5225,sub daily rainfall information is essential for many hydrological applications but ground based data availability is still an issue in poorly gauged regions worldwide satellite remote sensing missions such as the global precipitation measurement gpm mission have been playing a key role in estimating sub daily rainfall data globally however the quality of such information needs to be carefully evaluated previous studies evaluating sub daily data from the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg product considered only the rainfall depth over pre defined periods e g hourly or half hourly with no analysis of the ability and quality of the product in defining the actual rainfall events and the associated properties thus the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the imerg final run version 06b v06b product in capturing sub daily rainfall events and their properties depth duration and intensity over brazil the analysis consisted of comparing the satellite estimates against the ground based data from 1757 sub daily rainfall gauges for a period of three years 2015 2017 this study used the minimum inter event time mit criterion to define independent rainfall events determined by dry periods 1 6 and 24 h results show that imerg can properly estimate the sub daily rainfall depth for the three mits considered with the best results found in the southern part of the country this means that the imerg product represents a good source of sub daily rainfall depth data for hydrological and hydroclimatic applications in brazil on the other hand the evaluation shows large overestimations and underestimations of the imerg product for rainfall duration and intensity properties respectively the results obtained from this study provide a reference for imerg users who require sub daily rainfall data based on events and further knowledge about its properties keywords gpm evaluation inter event time depth intensity duration 1 introduction rainfall is one of the main components of the hydrological cycle and its accurate quantification is fundamental to providing primary information for understanding and predicting some regional physical processes such as floods landslides soil erosion and severe storms kidd et al 2017 skofronick jackson et al 2017 sub daily rainfall data are necessary for quantifying the characteristics of extreme events that trigger the physical processes mentioned above blenkinsop et al 2018 guerreiro et al 2018 lewis et al 2019 2018 therefore for hydrological application dividing the rainfall into events is essential for a better understanding of such processes for instance dunkerley 2012 showed that the rain event profile influences the partitioning of rainfall into ponding infiltration and runoff sub daily rain event properties are also important for quantifying the soil erosion for instance this information is indispensable to the universal soil loss equation usle and revised universal soil loss equation rusle developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 and renard et al 1997 respectively both the usle and rusle equations are based on the so called rainfall erosivity index which is calculated with the maximum rainfall intensity during the 30 min period the delineation of individual rain events is also the first step to generate the hyetographs for analysing the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall barbosa et al 2018 coutinho et al 2014 dolšak et al 2016 moreover the development of robust intensity duration frequency idf curves for extreme rainfall studies which are the key to many engineering designs is sometimes interfered with by sparse infrequent or short record sub daily observations in many locations courty et al 2019 lumbroso et al 2011 therefore rain event properties are particularly relevant for studies related to hydrological and ecological processes haile et al 2012 molina sanchis et al 2016 as revealed by dunkerley 2008a most reported studies of rainfall event data regarded a fixed rainless period a minimum inter event time mit as the common criterion to define events the use of the mit criterion is important for analysing the relationship between the yield of catchments e g water sedimentation and nutrients and the rainfall events with regards to their properties e g depth duration intensity dry time and intermittency moreover adopting a fixed time interval e g hourly or 30 min to define rainfall events is not appropriate because such an interval may encompass different events or part of one rainfall event hence the mit criteria provides a better way to recognise and understand single rainfall events according to dunkerley 2008a the common values of mit used for defining rainfall events varies between 3 min and 24 h following this dunkerley 2015 2010 2008a carried out a series of studies in australia to understand the influence of the mit criterion on the rainfall event and its properties these studies showed that longer mits yield rainfall events with lower intensity and conversely longer mits yield larger depth and duration similar studies highlighting the influence of the mit criterion on the rainfall properties have been reported in other countries e g see haile et al 2011 medina cobo et al 2016 meier et al 2016 and molina sanchis et al 2016 however characterising the sub daily rainfall variability over large areas by in situ data is still difficult because such records sparsely cover the entire global landmass never mind the key tropical regions hegerl et al 2015 the lack of sub daily in situ rainfall data is probably due to the higher implementation costs of rain gauges able to measure sub daily events compared with those that measure on a daily time scale blenkinsop et al 2018 identified more than 23 000 sub daily gauges worldwide providing freely available rainfall data with 60 of them concentrated in five countries the united states 7197 australia 1882 united kingdom 1869 japan 1723 and germany 1011 countries from africa and latin america have the lowest availability of sub daily data for instance at the time they have identified only 45 rain gauges with sub daily freely available rainfall data in brazil consequently rain rates event durations and other rainfall properties at sub daily time scales have not been properly studied and are still poorly understood in such low density gauge areas blenkinsop et al 2018 dunkerley 2008b westra et al 2014 during the last few decades the use of cutting edge satellite borne remote sensing technology has played a crucial role in providing valuable distributed observations of water resources including precipitation data at sub daily temporal resolution famiglietti et al 2015 levizzani et al 2018 o and kirstetter 2018 the remotely sensed precipitation products mainly rely on algorithms that combine the data observed from microwave and infrared sensors together with other ancillary ground based data hou et al 2001 kidd and levizzani 2011 launched in 1997 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm was one of the first dedicated and arguably most important satellites for obtaining information about precipitation in the latitude band 50 north and 50 south huffman et al 2007 the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa dataset provides rainfall data at 0 25 spatial resolution and 3 hour temporal resolution several studies evaluated the performance of the tmpa products in many countries e g baik and choi 2015 dembélé and zwart 2016 dinku et al 2008 fang et al 2013 naumann et al 2012 pombo and de oliveira 2015 including brazil e g buarque et al 2011 collischonn et al 2008 franchito et al 2009 melo et al 2015 but most of them are mainly focused on daily or coarser time scale evaluation even fewer studies checked the ability of the tmpa products for sub daily 3 hour applications such as flood forecasting e g nikolopoulos et al 2013 yuan et al 2019 specifically in brazil the studies evaluating the sub daily performance of the tmpa products only used a few rain gauges at small and medium river basin scale e g laverde barajas et al 2018 after nearly two decades of many successful applications of trmm its successor the global precipitation measurement gpm mission launched its core observatory in 2014 and began to provide rainfall and snowfall information globally with better temporal half hour and spatial 0 1 0 1 resolutions via the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg products skofronick jackson et al 2018a b 2017 due to the improvement in its resolution and enhancements for detecting light rain compared with the tmpa imerg opens up new opportunities for sub daily applications of rainfall data for many purposes asong et al 2017 three imerg products are currently available depending on the time that the data becomes available to the end users and the amount of information incorporated to improve the satellite estimations they are referred to as the early run late run and final run huffman et al 2017 the early and late run products are available at 4 and 12 h after observation respectively while the final run product is available 3 5 months after observation during the last five years several studies have been carried out to evaluate the imerg products in regions with different geographical characteristics worldwide most of which present good agreement with the gauge and ground based radar data e g asong et al 2017 li et al 2018 o et al 2017 o and kirstetter 2018 prakash et al 2018 satgé et al 2019 2017 tan et al 2017 tan and duan 2017 tang et al 2016b a 2018 wang et al 2018 some studies were conducted in brazil assessing the quality of the imerg products from different approaches at local to national scales e g gadelha et al 2019 lelis et al 2018 oliveira et al 2018 2016 rozante et al 2018 salles et al 2019 however all studies performed in brazil compared the imerg estimates against ground based data at relatively coarse temporal scales e g daily or longer when compared with the capability of the satellite based product in detecting rainfall at a higher temporal resolution half hour moreover worldwide most studies that have assessed the imerg data considered only the rainfall depth over pre defined periods e g li et al 2018 tang et al 2016a with no analysis of the ability and quality of the product in defining the actual rainfall events e g based on the mit criterion and the associated properties rainfall depth duration and intensity such analysis which is essential for further applications of sub daily data to predict the physical processes previously mentioned is now possible thanks to the higher temporal resolution of the imerg products furthermore a more comprehensive and robust validation of the imerg products in estimating the number of rain events and its properties can be done considering the importance of high quality sub daily distributed rainfall data the aims of this study are i evaluating the performance of the imerg product at sub daily time scale ii analysing the potential of imerg for delineating rainfall events and defining their properties rainfall depth duration and intensity and iii identifying how the quality of the imerg product is affected by the choice of mit criterion e g over 1 6 and 24 h based on these aims this study addresses the following scientific questions a how does imerg perform at sub daily time scale b is the imerg product able to delineate rainfall events and define their properties for sub daily applications c is the quality of imerg affected by the choice of mit criteria and rainfall regimes this study intends to be a reference for sub daily analysis of the imerg product covering a large scale area that encompasses a variety of climate zones rainfall patterns and terrains 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in brazil a continental wide country covering approximately 8 5 m km2 encompassed by 5 16 n 33 45 s and 34 47 w 73 59 w fig 1 officially the brazilian territory is divided into five geographical regions namely south s southeast se central west cw north east ne and north n brazil is the largest country in the southern hemisphere in area encompassing different climate zones and rainfall patterns due to its vast territory according to the detailed analysis performed by alvares et al 2013 the brazilian territory has twelve köppen s climate types divided into three main zones tropical semiarid and humid subtropical with a mean annual air temperature ranging approximately from 10 c to 26 c it has five different rainfall regimes that do not fit very well with the geographical regions reboita et al 2010 rozante et al 2018 the annual rainfall in brazil is characterised by high spatial variability with values ranging from 380 semiarid in the ne to 4000 mm tropical rainforest in the n alvares et al 2013 gadelha et al 2019 melo et al 2015 the rainfall regimes defined by reboita et al 2010 are described in table 1 2 2 observed rainfall data this study began by considering rainfall data from 3432 automated rain gauges distributed throughout the five official geographical regions in brazil the ground based data for the period 1 january 2015 31 december 2017 were acquired from tipping bucket gauges with a 10 min temporal resolution when it rains and 60 min over no rain periods these rain gauges are operated by the brazilian centre for monitoring and early warnings of natural disasters cemaden as part of a national wide network that was established by the brazilian government in 2011 to support its natural disasters risk management horita et al 2017 unfortunately the distribution of the rain gauges is rather uneven with the largest portion concentrated along the brazilian coastal region where the population density is also high thus most rain gauges obtained from the cemaden network are located within the cities the se region where the são paulo and rio de janeiro metropolitan regions are located for example is covered by 1594 rain gauges i e 46 of the total in contrast the number of rain gauges in the n region where the amazon rainforest is located corresponds to 2 only 66 gauges of the entire network although uneven this in situ rainfall monitoring network operated by cemaden represents an advance for understanding sub daily rainfall extremes in tropical regions since this type of data is currently much less available in other countries from africa and latin america sub daily rainfall data are mostly maintained by national meteorological agencies but a single agreed upon global approach for quality assessment and control of the gauge based measurements is still unavailable especially when considering large areas westra et al 2014 meanwhile a range of standard and sophisticated procedures for rainfall quality assessment and control has been proposed and recommended the commonly used standard methods involve some of the following procedures westra et al 2014 i checks of the range of values ii changes in values over subsequent measurements iii difference analysis between neighbouring stations iv comparisons to other data types v checking the range of time aggregations and vi identification of breakpoints in rainfall time series the observed rainfall data used in this study were quality controlled based on two steps for detecting possible rain gauge inconsistencies and selecting high quality data firstly a computational routine selected only rain gauges with 30 days of missing data along each civil analysed year considered in this study thereafter all the rain gauges meeting this first restriction were visually inspected using some of the above mentioned standard methods the first standard method compared monthly and sub daily rainfall data of the five nearest stations to verify large discrepancies between them for this first analysis the distances and the differences of altitude between the analysed rain gauge and the nearest stations were considered for identifying only rainfall patterns corresponding to their specific region the range of values and changes over subsequent measurements were then analysed for each rain gauge to identify constant or null rainfall records that probably indicate gauge clogging after the data quality check a total of 1757 rain gauges were used in this study for the comparison fig 1a i e almost half of the automated stations were discarded 2 3 imerg data the imerg final run imerg f is a level 3 gpm product that combines microwave and infrared estimates from the gpm constellation huffman et al 2017 it also incorporates monthly gauge observations from the global precipitation climatology gpcc and other ancillary data to improve the satellite estimations this study compared ground and satellite based data independently since the rain gauges operated by cemadem are not used by gpcc the imerg f product is available 3 5 months after observations which is not suitable for time sensitive applications instead the imerg f product is more suitable for hydrological and climate modelling purposes given its better performance compared to near real time products tang et al 2016a the imerg f dataset provide rainfall and snowfall information at 0 1 0 1 spatial and half hour temporal resolutions more information about the imerg f product are described in detail by huffman et al 2017 and skofronick jackson et al 2018a b specifically this study used the latest imerg f version 06b which presents several major changes when compared to the previous versions such as i the inclusion of additional sensors particularly in the trmm era ii improvements to parent gpm products iii modifications to the satellite intercalibrations and iv refinements to the morphing component tan et al 2019 the comparison between the imerg f product and the rain gauge dataset was performed in this study at the native 30 minute scale the imerg f dataset used in this study covers the same period of the ground based data i e between 1 january 2015 and 31 december 2017 2 4 rainfall events definition and properties many approaches are available for delineating individual rainfall events molina sanchis et al 2016 however the use of fixed time intervals e g hourly or half hourly to define rainfall events can sometimes be inappropriate since such intervals may contain part of only one or sometimes more than one event hence the mit criteria provide a better way to recognise and understand single rainfall events this study used the mit to discriminate successive independent events by a defined dry period dunkerley 2008a as previously mentioned some studies define optimum values of mit depending on the studied region e g medina cobo et al 2016 molina sanchis et al 2016 while others reveal that the definition of mit is associated with the application of the study e g aryal et al 2007 bracken et al 2008 cattan et al 2006 according to chin et al 2016 short values of mit are better used in local studies more sensitive to rainfall variation whereas longer values of mit are preferred for studies considering a whole weather system following this a range of mits e g 1 6 and 24 h were chosen in this study to define rainfall events this study also analysed three important properties of the imerg f rainfall product the depth duration and intensity a rainfall depth threshold of 2 5 mm for defining rain no rain was established for all analyses to exclude events deemed insignificant any imerg f and rain gauge rainfall events below this threshold were treated as zero the temporal resolutions of rain gauges and imerg f used to define rainfall events are 10 min and 30 min respectively therefore these are the possible shortest rainfall event durations 2 5 comparison and evaluation procedures comparison between the imerg f and rain gauge data was based on a pairwise approach fig 2 a point to cell analysis was performed when there was only one rain gauge available inside the imerg f native cell on the other hand an average points to cell analysis was considered for imerg f grid cells containing more than one rain gauge satellite gridded data without any rain gauges at all within the cell were excluded from the analyses as a result in total there are 1065 grid cells of the imerg f product considered in this study for analyses three evaluation procedures ep were performed to assess the quality of the imerg f product in detecting the rainfall events and their properties for different mit values fig 2b firstly the differences between the mean values of the properties of all rainfall events estimated by the imerg f product and observed by the rain gauges were checked this is the first evaluation procedure ep1 which makes use of the correlation coefficient cc and the mean relative absolute error mrae considering both national and group scale means 1 c c i 1 n o i o e i e i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n e i e 2 2 m r a e 100 n i 1 n o i e i o i where o is the value observed by the rain gauges ō is the mean observed values e is the value estimated by the imerg f product ē is the mean estimated values and n is the total number of compared pairs a second evaluation procedure ep2 was applied to verify whether the actual rainfall events correspond to those detected by the satellites ep2 uses the metrics related to rainfall events detection i probability of detection pod which shows the fraction of rainfall events that are correctly detected by the imerg f product ii false alarm ratio far which exhibits the fraction of events estimated by the imerg f product but not detected by the rain gauge and iii critical success index csi which measures the fraction of imerg f events correctly detected for the total number of observed and estimated rainfall events 3 p o d a a c 4 f a r b a b 5 c s i a a b c where a is the number of rainfall events simultaneously identified by both rain gauge and imerg f b is the number of rainfall events observed by the satellite product but not so by the ground based data and c is the number of rainfall events detected by the rain gauges but not observed by the imerg f product the values of pod far and csi range from 0 up to 1 the perfect score for pod and csi is close to 1 while the desirable values for far are close to 0 the three metrics applied to compare the detection of rainfall events are traditionally used for a defined time space e g gadelha et al 2018 prakash et al 2018 rozante et al 2018 tan and duan 2017 tang et al 2016a which is not the case of this study therefore a sequential approach containing three specific criteria was established to evaluate whether the estimated event is really the same as the observed i if the rainfall events are 100 overlapped ii if the rainfall events are overlapped by more than 50 or iii if the time lag between the centroids are lower than 2 5 times the mit only the events detected according to ep2 were subjected to a third evaluation procedure ep3 which computes the average magnitude of deviations between satellite and ground based properties of events ep3 only includes the mrae of each property in summary the eps adopted in this study make it possible to identify whether the rainfall events observed by the rain gauges are adequately estimated by the imerg f product as follows i good agreement of average rainfall properties ii ability to detect the events and iii conformity of detected events properties fig 2b 2 6 analysis of the rain gauge network density differences between point scale gauge measurements and areal satellite based rainfall can affect the validation conclusions of the imerg f product interpolation approaches are the only options for transferring point scale rainfall observations into areal estimates before they are compared with the grid cells of the satellite based data tian et al 2018 alternatively pairwise comparisons conducted only in grid cells containing at least one rain gauge can also be used asong et al 2017 tan and duan 2017 yang et al 2016 however the reliability of both methods used to compare satellite based products and rain gauge data is intrinsically linked to the density of the ground reference tang et al 2018 tian et al 2018 in order to ensure the reliability of the results the dependence of the imerg f performance on the density of the rain gauge network used in this study was also investigated there were then four metrics applied to verify the deviations of rainfall magnitudes for the imerg f product according to different gauge densities available in this study such metrics include the bias bias the mean relative error mre the mrae presented in eq 2 and the root mean square error rmse 6 b i a s i 1 n e i o i 7 m r e i 1 n e i o i o i 8 r m s e i 1 n e i o i 2 n 2 7 definition of regions based on homogeneous rainfall characteristics as previously mentioned the brazilian territory encompasses a variety of climate zones and rainfall regimes therefore it is necessary to cluster the rain gauges and their corresponding grids of the imerg f product in regions with similar characteristics prior to the proposed analyses the k means clustering algorithm was applied to define these regions with similar rainfall patterns carvalho et al 2016 there were five groups defined in this study based on the number of rainfall regions established for the brazilian territory by reboita et al 2010 and rozante et al 2018 all rain gauges selected after the quality control process were used to define these homogeneous regions as shown in fig 1b there were six different variables obtained from these rain gauges used to define the regions i elevation ii annual rainfall iii number of rainfall events iv mean rainfall depth v mean duration and vi mean intensity for the last four variables all three different mits used for the analyses were also considered when defining the regions however before the clustering analysis the number of variables was reduced using principal component analysis pca dyer 1975 ogallo 1989 singh 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 representativeness of the point s to cell analysis the point s to cell analysis applied in this study was performed using 1750 rain gauges distributed throughout 1065 grid cells of imerg which corresponds to an overall density network of 1 64 gauges per 100 km2 this represents more than eight times the threshold of one gauge per 575 km2 recommended by the world meteorological organisation wmo for the interior plane and undulating areas wmo 1994 the number of rain gauges per grid cell of imerg available for this study ranged from 1 to 12 as shown in table 2 grid cells with densities lower than four rain gauges per 100 km2 stand for more than 90 of the analysed pixels conversely grid cells containing more than seven rain gauges represent 1 of the total pixels evaluated in this study according to the review carried out by tian et al 2018 the rain gauge network used in this study is denser than in most other previous studies evaluating satellite based rainfall products fig 3 shows the evaluation results of the metrics for all available rain gauge density networks this evaluation also considers the three rainfall properties and mits used in this study overall it is not possible to identify an improvement of the evaluation performance with the increase of the gauge density for instance the bias of the rainfall depth and duration remained practically unchanged for the two shorter mits considered in this study in contrast the results show that denser gauge networks tend to slight increase the values of rmse for all mits and rainfall properties this result differs from the studies carried out by tang et al 2018 and tian et al 2018 that detected a strong dependence of the evaluating metrics for the imerg product on the rain gauge densities tang et al 2018 found 2 5 gauges per grid cell at 0 1 spatial scale as the more reliable density to accurately evaluate satellite precipitation products in a river basin in south china however they recommended that future studies should explore the sensitivity of the results to variations in topography climate conditions and precipitation phase solid or liquid because this number can be influenced by the region and season on the other hand the study performed by tian et al 2018 found that the evaluation of the imerg satellite product exhibited better accuracy for most metrics when considering one gauge or more per grid cell 3 2 homogenous rainfall groups fig 1b shows the spatial distribution cells separated by groups with homogenous rainfall characteristics after the application of pca and k means clustering algorithm group 1 is mainly located in the n and ne regions of brazil containing 163 cells table 1 the main atmospheric systems that have influence on this group of cells with the same rainfall patterns are those in the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the mesoscale convective complex mcc cohen et al 1995 espinoza villar et al 2009 according to köppen s classification proposed by alvares et al 2013 the climates of the region where group 1 is placed are tropical monsoon am and tropical with dry winter aw with an average annual temperature of 26 c the annual mean rainfall in the group 1 ranges from 1400 to 2000 mm most of which is concentrated between january and may fig 4 a group 2 mostly encompass the cells located along the atlantic coastal zone of northeast brazil which is mainly characterised by the instability lines il and southeast trade winds setw atmospheric systems kousky 1988 reboita et al 2010 group 2 presents a fewer number of evaluated cells in this study 108 in total the climate of this group is mainly tropical with dry summer as with historical mean rainfall ranging from 1200 to 1800 mm year 1 and mean monthly air temperature above 23 c throughout the year fig 4b most of the 209 cells of group 3 are located in the region of the southeast mainly characterised by a tropical with dry summer as climate with mean annual rainfall ranging from 1000 to 1300 mm and concentrating during the austral summer melo et al 2015 fig 4c the main climate systems influencing group 3 are the south atlantic subtropical anticyclone sasa and the south atlantic convergence zone sacz reboita et al 2010 rozante et al 2018 with the mean monthly air temperature varying between 18 c and 24 c throughout the year groups 4 and 5 own the largest number of analysed cells in this study 317 and 268 respectively both groups are mainly located in the s and se regions with a humid subtropical climate c the south atlantic subtropical anticyclone sasa and south atlantic convergence zone sacz are the main climate systems influencing the group 4 while group 5 is influenced more by the prefrontal squall line psl and cold fronts cf climate systems reboita et al 2010 velasco and fritsch 1987 the annual rainfall in the cells of group 4 ranges between 1300 and 1900 mm most of which is concentrated during the austral summer fig 4d in contrast the rainfall is spatially more uniform throughout the year in group 5 ranging from 1600 to 2 200 mm fig 4e the monthly average air temperature in group 5 ranges from 12 c in july to 23 c in january 3 3 nation wide mean values comparison of the properties of rainfall events in this first analysis the imerg data were evaluated by comparing the mean property values of all rainfall events identified by mit from both imerg and rain gauge fig 5 shows the scatter plots based on the mean values considering all cells analysed for the entire country the outliers were visually excluded from this figure for better visualisation of the point cloud overall the comparison between the two data sources indicates that the imerg product presented a good agreement with the rainfall depths observed by the rain gauges with a solid blotch of points concentrated close to the line of equality for all considered mits fig 5a c the concentration of most of the points above the line can demonstrate a slight overestimation of the rainfall depth by the imerg product for all individual events similar behaviour of slight overestimation was also observed by rozante et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 when evaluating the rainfall depth of imerg over brazil at coarser temporal scales daily onward similar performance behaviour of the sub daily mean areal precipitation from imerg was also noticed in other large scale studies carried out in different regions of the world e g li et al 2018 mayor et al 2017 tang et al 2016a the cc for the rainfall depth considering the cells of all groups ranged from 0 36 mit 24 h to 0 66 mit 6 h with values of mrae 32 indicating low variability of data between the rain gauges and the imerg product for all mit it is also noticeable that the mean rainfall depth progressively increased for both sources of data as mit become greater as observed in depth by dunkerley 2015 medina cobo et al 2016 and molina sanchis et al 2016 using only tipping bucket rain gauge data the mean duration and intensity considering all analysed cells show a poor agreement between the imerg product with the observed rainfall data for all mits fig 5d i for the mean duration a large overestimation of the satellite based product was observed with negative linear correlations with respect to the two longer mits i e 6 h cc 0 19 and 24 h cc 0 03 these negative and low values of linear correlations represent an absence of correlation when comparing the two different rainfall datasets for the mean intensity however the imerg products presented a large underestimation when compared with the observed data showing almost all points concentrated below the line of equality and the cc values ranging from 0 29 to 0 49 this behaviour was expected because the mean intensity inversely correlates to the mean duration as a well known feature from the relationship between intensity depth and duration dunkerley 2008a overall it is also noticeable that the mean durations of imerg present far larger amplitudes of data with values up to three times higher than that observed in the rain gauges accordingly the mean observed intensity is inversely proportional to the mit with amplitudes of values reducing significantly when rain events are longer as also noticed and analysed by dunkerley 2015 in australia in contrast the mean intensity estimated by the imerg product exhibits low dispersion for all mits with minimum and maximum values of 0 2 mit 24 h and 2 5 mm h 1 mit 1 h respectively the mrae values vary widely from 141 to 213 for mean duration and from 55 to 69 for mean intensity the disagreement detected for the rainfall intensity occurs because the imerg f product is adjusted so that the monthly rainfall depth matches up with the rain gauges represented in the gpcc analysis becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2014 this calibration does not affect the duration of the satellite event so the intensity will be adjusted to whatever it takes over the duration of the event to fit the total monthly rainfall this analysis considering national wide mean values comparison can lead to a false conclusion when data from the various regions are evaluated in a single pool therefore the following sections present the results based on the comparison of homogenous rainfall groups 3 4 homogenous group wide mean values comparison of the properties of event fig 6 shows the box plots of the mean values for all analysed rainfall properties separated by groups with homogenous characteristics with extreme values also visually excluded for better visualisation of the data overall the rainfall depth estimated by the imerg f product shows similar distribution with the data obtained from the rain gauges for all groups with groups 3 4 and 5 having the closest patterns there is a slight overestimation in the satellite based product compared with the observed data for all mits in contrast groups 1 and 2 exhibited the worst performance considering longer 24 h and shorter 1 and 6 h enclosing rain events respectively rozante et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 also noted low performance of imerg f in capturing daily rainfall depth in regions where the groups 1 and 2 are predominantly located the best ccs for rainfall depth were observed for group 1 with values equal to or higher than 0 52 for all mits table 3 although presenting the best cc values the variability of data between imerg and rain gauges was substantially high for mits equal to 24 h in group 1 with mrae reaching values higher than 90 the reduction of the number of events registered by imerg f for longer mit probably influenced the increase of the mean rainfall depth and consequently the values of mrae in group 1 this effect may be caused by the influence of convective clouds that prevail in this group since this type of cloud can be falsely detected by the infrared sensors of the satellite as also noticed by rozante et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 overall groups 4 and 5 presented the lowest variabilities of the mean rainfall depth between the two sources of data mrae 30 independently of the mit considered the mean duration of the events from the imerg f product is significantly overestimated compared with that of the ground based data for all five homogenous groups fig 6d f following the same characteristics observed for the national scale mean comparison similarly for the rainfall depth group 1 has the worst performance in terms of using the imerg f in detecting the mean duration with values of mrae higher than 300 for all mits considered in this study table 3 the best performance of the imerg f in identifying the duration of the gauge data was observed in group 5 54 mrae 150 although the values of cc showed negative correlations for the two shorter mits such performance is most likely caused by the prevalence of rainfall from cold front weather systems with low intensity and long durations as noted by rozante et al 2018 in general the shorter mit of the imerg f dataset represented the mean duration of the rain gauges worse regardless of the homogenous rainfall group 150 mrae 322 these behaviours show that the imerg f product can adequately capture the rainfall depth but with longer duration when compared to the ground based dataset the durations of the satellite based product result in a large underestimation of the rainfall intensity of imerg f once again group 1 exhibited the largest deviations and errors in the evaluation of the satellite rainfall product with mrae obtained for rainfall intensity exceeding 80 for all mit conversely lower errors for the rainfall intensity were found in groups 2 and 5 although coming with high values of mrae from 37 to 58 and low positive cc 0 43 this fact limits the use of the imerg f for those purposes that require accurate information about rainfall duration and intensity such as soil loss medeiros and araújo 2014 and production of surface runoff figueiredo et al 2016 3 5 mean values comparison of trends by fixed thresholds this section evaluates the agreement of the mean values of all rainfall properties of the imerg f product according to the level of underestimation or overestimation which is split into seven categories as shown in fig 7 overall the mean rainfall depth of imerg f exhibited low relative errors across all groups especially for the two shorter mits where more than 50 of the cells showed a good agreement for almost all groups an exception was noticed in group 2 where a mix of moderate and slight overestimations prevailed in more than 50 of the cells a reduction in the number of cells presenting good agreement was observed in almost all homogenous groups for longer mit values except in group 2 this effect was caused by the aggregation of individual rain events that increased the rainfall depth in longer mits as deeply discussed by dunkerley 2008a in this study the increase of rainfall depth within longer rain events was more accentuated for the imerg f product when compared to the observed dataset which is evidenced by the considerable number of cells presenting slight and moderate overestimations in all groups group 1 concentrates the largest relative errors for the longer mit with moderate and large overestimations representing more than 75 of the cells in this group generally the imerg f product is unable to successfully represent the mean rainfall duration or intensity of the events observed by the rain gauges with most cells displaying large overestimations and underestimations mainly for shorter mits respectively fig 7d i the performance of the group 1 does not practically change across different mits when comparing duration and intensity group 1 demonstrates very large deviations in duration overestimation and intensity underestimation on the other hand group 2 exhibited a better performance of rainfall duration and intensity with approximately 30 of the analysed cells deemed to be in good agreement for the two longer mits this analysis confirms the results found in the previous sections that indicate a limitation of the imerg f product to represent the intensity and duration of the same sub daily rainfall events observed by the gauges but with complementary information regarding the percentage of cells in each homogenous group according to the agreement thresholds 3 6 analysis of rainfall events detection the results presented in the previous sections show a good agreement between the mean rainfall depth estimated by the imerg f product and observed by the ground based dataset which was not noted for the two other rainfall properties duration and intensity this section analyses if the imerg f product is able to accurately match the same rainfall events detected by the rain gauges fig 8 shows considerable improvement of the imerg f product performance in detecting ground based rainfall events as mit increases an exception was noticed in group 1 where more events were correctly detected for the mit of 6 h overall groups 4 and 5 presented the highest pod values for all mit ranging from 0 3 mit 1 h to 0 8 mit 24 h the results exhibited in fig 8a indicate a good skill of imerg f in detecting individual rain events equal to or higher than 6 h in those two groups located in southern brazil as also noted by lelis et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 in their evaluation of the imerg f product from daily to annual time scales this performance of pod is corroborated by the distribution of csi which followed the same characteristics but with lower values due to the high number of detected far similar behaviour was also observed by tang et al 2016a who assessed the imerg f product in china where pod presented values 20 larger than csi on the other hand groups 1 and 2 displayed pod values lower than 0 5 for the longer mit rozante et al 2018 also observed low detection of imerg f along the atlantic coast of ne brazil where most of group 2 is located even considering analyses on a monthly basis unlike pod and csi the far presented an inverse relation with the mit with the highest false alarms observed for rain events equal to 1 h in all groups the far exhibited similar performance for all groups with the largest proportional reduction of false alarms identified between the two shorter mits 3 7 error magnitude analysis results relative to ep2 are depicted by the spider charts assessing the magnitude of deviations between the rainfall properties estimated by the imerg f product and observed by the rain gauges fig 9 the mrae values presented a general behaviour of remaining unchanged with the aggregation of the rainfall depth events in almost all groups with values close to 100 only group 2 exhibited an increase in the magnitude of the depth error when longer no rain periods are included within rainfall events gadelha et al 2019 also found large deviations of rainfall depth in most cells located in the coastal zone of the brazilian ne when evaluating the imerg f product on coarser time scales such poor performance was attributed by the authors to the warm rain process dominated systems that are not well detected by the passive microwave sensors over land the values of mrae for duration follow the general pattern observed in the rainfall depth but with higher errors also detected in group 2 especially for the mit 24 h 600 the largest values of mrae were noticed for rainfall intensity wherein the deviations of imerg f range from 300 group 5 to 2000 group 1 for the longer mit 4 summary and conclusions this study is the first national scale assessment of the imerg f product at sub daily temporal resolution in brazil moreover the analyses focused on the potential of the satellite based data in delineating rainfall events and defining some of its properties such as depth duration and intensity the evaluation was carried out using 1065 grid cells of the imerg f product separated into five different groups with homogenous rainfall characteristics the main specific findings of this study are summarised as follows 1 the imerg f product exhibited good performance in capturing the rainfall depth for all mits considered in this study with some variations depending on the analysed group overall the rainfall depth estimated by the satellite product presented better performance in cells located in southern brazil specifically in groups 4 and 5 2 imerg f presented a slight tendency in overestimation the ground based rainfall depth data for all mits this overestimation tends to slightly increase when longer rain events are analysed although a considerable improvement of the probability of detection was also noticed when more rain events were incorporated 3 the evaluations revealed large overestimations and underestimations of the imerg f product for rainfall duration and intensity respectively this behaviour was noted for all groups and all mits probably because i the calibration of the imerg f product that is made to match the monthly rain gauges rainfall depth incorporated to improve the satellite estimates and ii the capability of the microwave and infrared sensors for identifying rain no rain in general these sensors detect longer rainfall events than those that actually occurred such finding limits the use of the imerg f product in brazil for some applications that require rainfall intensity and duration information with high temporal resolution 4 the analyses reveal that the detection of events by the imerg f product tends to improve with the increasing of mit however the rainfall properties remain not well represented with this improvement especially the intensity and duration 5 overestimations and underestimations of the imerg f product were more evident in regions with the presence of mesoscale convective systems group 1 on the other hand in regions with the presence of cold front weather systems and rainfall characterised by long duration and low intensity the imerg f product better estimated the sub daily rainfall data group 5 the results obtained from this study provide a reference for imerg f v06b use cases that require sub daily rainfall data based on events and further knowledge about its properties based on our findings the sub daily information on rainfall depth from the imerg f product can be a good source of data for hydroclimatic and hydrological studies in southern brazil on the other hand sub daily rainfall depth data from the imerg f product have to be carefully checked when used throughout the ne coastal region because of the larger overestimations and underestimations associated with the weather systems il and setw and the reduced capability of the sensor to detect some precipitation and cloud types unfortunately the number of rain gauges with sub daily data from the cemaden network is limited over the n region where the amazon rainforest is located which makes a more accurate assessment of the imerg f product in this area difficult finally this study highlights the need for further analyses event by event in each cell of the imerg f product to verify the influence of the hydroclimatic variables in the detection of rainfall intensity and duration events moreover improvements in rainfall intensity and duration estimates of the imerg f product are necessary for better identification of rain no rain since the generation of a rainfall event however small it is leads to a change of the duration and consequently the intensity credit authorship

5225,sub daily rainfall information is essential for many hydrological applications but ground based data availability is still an issue in poorly gauged regions worldwide satellite remote sensing missions such as the global precipitation measurement gpm mission have been playing a key role in estimating sub daily rainfall data globally however the quality of such information needs to be carefully evaluated previous studies evaluating sub daily data from the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg product considered only the rainfall depth over pre defined periods e g hourly or half hourly with no analysis of the ability and quality of the product in defining the actual rainfall events and the associated properties thus the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the imerg final run version 06b v06b product in capturing sub daily rainfall events and their properties depth duration and intensity over brazil the analysis consisted of comparing the satellite estimates against the ground based data from 1757 sub daily rainfall gauges for a period of three years 2015 2017 this study used the minimum inter event time mit criterion to define independent rainfall events determined by dry periods 1 6 and 24 h results show that imerg can properly estimate the sub daily rainfall depth for the three mits considered with the best results found in the southern part of the country this means that the imerg product represents a good source of sub daily rainfall depth data for hydrological and hydroclimatic applications in brazil on the other hand the evaluation shows large overestimations and underestimations of the imerg product for rainfall duration and intensity properties respectively the results obtained from this study provide a reference for imerg users who require sub daily rainfall data based on events and further knowledge about its properties keywords gpm evaluation inter event time depth intensity duration 1 introduction rainfall is one of the main components of the hydrological cycle and its accurate quantification is fundamental to providing primary information for understanding and predicting some regional physical processes such as floods landslides soil erosion and severe storms kidd et al 2017 skofronick jackson et al 2017 sub daily rainfall data are necessary for quantifying the characteristics of extreme events that trigger the physical processes mentioned above blenkinsop et al 2018 guerreiro et al 2018 lewis et al 2019 2018 therefore for hydrological application dividing the rainfall into events is essential for a better understanding of such processes for instance dunkerley 2012 showed that the rain event profile influences the partitioning of rainfall into ponding infiltration and runoff sub daily rain event properties are also important for quantifying the soil erosion for instance this information is indispensable to the universal soil loss equation usle and revised universal soil loss equation rusle developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 and renard et al 1997 respectively both the usle and rusle equations are based on the so called rainfall erosivity index which is calculated with the maximum rainfall intensity during the 30 min period the delineation of individual rain events is also the first step to generate the hyetographs for analysing the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall barbosa et al 2018 coutinho et al 2014 dolšak et al 2016 moreover the development of robust intensity duration frequency idf curves for extreme rainfall studies which are the key to many engineering designs is sometimes interfered with by sparse infrequent or short record sub daily observations in many locations courty et al 2019 lumbroso et al 2011 therefore rain event properties are particularly relevant for studies related to hydrological and ecological processes haile et al 2012 molina sanchis et al 2016 as revealed by dunkerley 2008a most reported studies of rainfall event data regarded a fixed rainless period a minimum inter event time mit as the common criterion to define events the use of the mit criterion is important for analysing the relationship between the yield of catchments e g water sedimentation and nutrients and the rainfall events with regards to their properties e g depth duration intensity dry time and intermittency moreover adopting a fixed time interval e g hourly or 30 min to define rainfall events is not appropriate because such an interval may encompass different events or part of one rainfall event hence the mit criteria provides a better way to recognise and understand single rainfall events according to dunkerley 2008a the common values of mit used for defining rainfall events varies between 3 min and 24 h following this dunkerley 2015 2010 2008a carried out a series of studies in australia to understand the influence of the mit criterion on the rainfall event and its properties these studies showed that longer mits yield rainfall events with lower intensity and conversely longer mits yield larger depth and duration similar studies highlighting the influence of the mit criterion on the rainfall properties have been reported in other countries e g see haile et al 2011 medina cobo et al 2016 meier et al 2016 and molina sanchis et al 2016 however characterising the sub daily rainfall variability over large areas by in situ data is still difficult because such records sparsely cover the entire global landmass never mind the key tropical regions hegerl et al 2015 the lack of sub daily in situ rainfall data is probably due to the higher implementation costs of rain gauges able to measure sub daily events compared with those that measure on a daily time scale blenkinsop et al 2018 identified more than 23 000 sub daily gauges worldwide providing freely available rainfall data with 60 of them concentrated in five countries the united states 7197 australia 1882 united kingdom 1869 japan 1723 and germany 1011 countries from africa and latin america have the lowest availability of sub daily data for instance at the time they have identified only 45 rain gauges with sub daily freely available rainfall data in brazil consequently rain rates event durations and other rainfall properties at sub daily time scales have not been properly studied and are still poorly understood in such low density gauge areas blenkinsop et al 2018 dunkerley 2008b westra et al 2014 during the last few decades the use of cutting edge satellite borne remote sensing technology has played a crucial role in providing valuable distributed observations of water resources including precipitation data at sub daily temporal resolution famiglietti et al 2015 levizzani et al 2018 o and kirstetter 2018 the remotely sensed precipitation products mainly rely on algorithms that combine the data observed from microwave and infrared sensors together with other ancillary ground based data hou et al 2001 kidd and levizzani 2011 launched in 1997 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm was one of the first dedicated and arguably most important satellites for obtaining information about precipitation in the latitude band 50 north and 50 south huffman et al 2007 the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa dataset provides rainfall data at 0 25 spatial resolution and 3 hour temporal resolution several studies evaluated the performance of the tmpa products in many countries e g baik and choi 2015 dembélé and zwart 2016 dinku et al 2008 fang et al 2013 naumann et al 2012 pombo and de oliveira 2015 including brazil e g buarque et al 2011 collischonn et al 2008 franchito et al 2009 melo et al 2015 but most of them are mainly focused on daily or coarser time scale evaluation even fewer studies checked the ability of the tmpa products for sub daily 3 hour applications such as flood forecasting e g nikolopoulos et al 2013 yuan et al 2019 specifically in brazil the studies evaluating the sub daily performance of the tmpa products only used a few rain gauges at small and medium river basin scale e g laverde barajas et al 2018 after nearly two decades of many successful applications of trmm its successor the global precipitation measurement gpm mission launched its core observatory in 2014 and began to provide rainfall and snowfall information globally with better temporal half hour and spatial 0 1 0 1 resolutions via the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg products skofronick jackson et al 2018a b 2017 due to the improvement in its resolution and enhancements for detecting light rain compared with the tmpa imerg opens up new opportunities for sub daily applications of rainfall data for many purposes asong et al 2017 three imerg products are currently available depending on the time that the data becomes available to the end users and the amount of information incorporated to improve the satellite estimations they are referred to as the early run late run and final run huffman et al 2017 the early and late run products are available at 4 and 12 h after observation respectively while the final run product is available 3 5 months after observation during the last five years several studies have been carried out to evaluate the imerg products in regions with different geographical characteristics worldwide most of which present good agreement with the gauge and ground based radar data e g asong et al 2017 li et al 2018 o et al 2017 o and kirstetter 2018 prakash et al 2018 satgé et al 2019 2017 tan et al 2017 tan and duan 2017 tang et al 2016b a 2018 wang et al 2018 some studies were conducted in brazil assessing the quality of the imerg products from different approaches at local to national scales e g gadelha et al 2019 lelis et al 2018 oliveira et al 2018 2016 rozante et al 2018 salles et al 2019 however all studies performed in brazil compared the imerg estimates against ground based data at relatively coarse temporal scales e g daily or longer when compared with the capability of the satellite based product in detecting rainfall at a higher temporal resolution half hour moreover worldwide most studies that have assessed the imerg data considered only the rainfall depth over pre defined periods e g li et al 2018 tang et al 2016a with no analysis of the ability and quality of the product in defining the actual rainfall events e g based on the mit criterion and the associated properties rainfall depth duration and intensity such analysis which is essential for further applications of sub daily data to predict the physical processes previously mentioned is now possible thanks to the higher temporal resolution of the imerg products furthermore a more comprehensive and robust validation of the imerg products in estimating the number of rain events and its properties can be done considering the importance of high quality sub daily distributed rainfall data the aims of this study are i evaluating the performance of the imerg product at sub daily time scale ii analysing the potential of imerg for delineating rainfall events and defining their properties rainfall depth duration and intensity and iii identifying how the quality of the imerg product is affected by the choice of mit criterion e g over 1 6 and 24 h based on these aims this study addresses the following scientific questions a how does imerg perform at sub daily time scale b is the imerg product able to delineate rainfall events and define their properties for sub daily applications c is the quality of imerg affected by the choice of mit criteria and rainfall regimes this study intends to be a reference for sub daily analysis of the imerg product covering a large scale area that encompasses a variety of climate zones rainfall patterns and terrains 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in brazil a continental wide country covering approximately 8 5 m km2 encompassed by 5 16 n 33 45 s and 34 47 w 73 59 w fig 1 officially the brazilian territory is divided into five geographical regions namely south s southeast se central west cw north east ne and north n brazil is the largest country in the southern hemisphere in area encompassing different climate zones and rainfall patterns due to its vast territory according to the detailed analysis performed by alvares et al 2013 the brazilian territory has twelve köppen s climate types divided into three main zones tropical semiarid and humid subtropical with a mean annual air temperature ranging approximately from 10 c to 26 c it has five different rainfall regimes that do not fit very well with the geographical regions reboita et al 2010 rozante et al 2018 the annual rainfall in brazil is characterised by high spatial variability with values ranging from 380 semiarid in the ne to 4000 mm tropical rainforest in the n alvares et al 2013 gadelha et al 2019 melo et al 2015 the rainfall regimes defined by reboita et al 2010 are described in table 1 2 2 observed rainfall data this study began by considering rainfall data from 3432 automated rain gauges distributed throughout the five official geographical regions in brazil the ground based data for the period 1 january 2015 31 december 2017 were acquired from tipping bucket gauges with a 10 min temporal resolution when it rains and 60 min over no rain periods these rain gauges are operated by the brazilian centre for monitoring and early warnings of natural disasters cemaden as part of a national wide network that was established by the brazilian government in 2011 to support its natural disasters risk management horita et al 2017 unfortunately the distribution of the rain gauges is rather uneven with the largest portion concentrated along the brazilian coastal region where the population density is also high thus most rain gauges obtained from the cemaden network are located within the cities the se region where the são paulo and rio de janeiro metropolitan regions are located for example is covered by 1594 rain gauges i e 46 of the total in contrast the number of rain gauges in the n region where the amazon rainforest is located corresponds to 2 only 66 gauges of the entire network although uneven this in situ rainfall monitoring network operated by cemaden represents an advance for understanding sub daily rainfall extremes in tropical regions since this type of data is currently much less available in other countries from africa and latin america sub daily rainfall data are mostly maintained by national meteorological agencies but a single agreed upon global approach for quality assessment and control of the gauge based measurements is still unavailable especially when considering large areas westra et al 2014 meanwhile a range of standard and sophisticated procedures for rainfall quality assessment and control has been proposed and recommended the commonly used standard methods involve some of the following procedures westra et al 2014 i checks of the range of values ii changes in values over subsequent measurements iii difference analysis between neighbouring stations iv comparisons to other data types v checking the range of time aggregations and vi identification of breakpoints in rainfall time series the observed rainfall data used in this study were quality controlled based on two steps for detecting possible rain gauge inconsistencies and selecting high quality data firstly a computational routine selected only rain gauges with 30 days of missing data along each civil analysed year considered in this study thereafter all the rain gauges meeting this first restriction were visually inspected using some of the above mentioned standard methods the first standard method compared monthly and sub daily rainfall data of the five nearest stations to verify large discrepancies between them for this first analysis the distances and the differences of altitude between the analysed rain gauge and the nearest stations were considered for identifying only rainfall patterns corresponding to their specific region the range of values and changes over subsequent measurements were then analysed for each rain gauge to identify constant or null rainfall records that probably indicate gauge clogging after the data quality check a total of 1757 rain gauges were used in this study for the comparison fig 1a i e almost half of the automated stations were discarded 2 3 imerg data the imerg final run imerg f is a level 3 gpm product that combines microwave and infrared estimates from the gpm constellation huffman et al 2017 it also incorporates monthly gauge observations from the global precipitation climatology gpcc and other ancillary data to improve the satellite estimations this study compared ground and satellite based data independently since the rain gauges operated by cemadem are not used by gpcc the imerg f product is available 3 5 months after observations which is not suitable for time sensitive applications instead the imerg f product is more suitable for hydrological and climate modelling purposes given its better performance compared to near real time products tang et al 2016a the imerg f dataset provide rainfall and snowfall information at 0 1 0 1 spatial and half hour temporal resolutions more information about the imerg f product are described in detail by huffman et al 2017 and skofronick jackson et al 2018a b specifically this study used the latest imerg f version 06b which presents several major changes when compared to the previous versions such as i the inclusion of additional sensors particularly in the trmm era ii improvements to parent gpm products iii modifications to the satellite intercalibrations and iv refinements to the morphing component tan et al 2019 the comparison between the imerg f product and the rain gauge dataset was performed in this study at the native 30 minute scale the imerg f dataset used in this study covers the same period of the ground based data i e between 1 january 2015 and 31 december 2017 2 4 rainfall events definition and properties many approaches are available for delineating individual rainfall events molina sanchis et al 2016 however the use of fixed time intervals e g hourly or half hourly to define rainfall events can sometimes be inappropriate since such intervals may contain part of only one or sometimes more than one event hence the mit criteria provide a better way to recognise and understand single rainfall events this study used the mit to discriminate successive independent events by a defined dry period dunkerley 2008a as previously mentioned some studies define optimum values of mit depending on the studied region e g medina cobo et al 2016 molina sanchis et al 2016 while others reveal that the definition of mit is associated with the application of the study e g aryal et al 2007 bracken et al 2008 cattan et al 2006 according to chin et al 2016 short values of mit are better used in local studies more sensitive to rainfall variation whereas longer values of mit are preferred for studies considering a whole weather system following this a range of mits e g 1 6 and 24 h were chosen in this study to define rainfall events this study also analysed three important properties of the imerg f rainfall product the depth duration and intensity a rainfall depth threshold of 2 5 mm for defining rain no rain was established for all analyses to exclude events deemed insignificant any imerg f and rain gauge rainfall events below this threshold were treated as zero the temporal resolutions of rain gauges and imerg f used to define rainfall events are 10 min and 30 min respectively therefore these are the possible shortest rainfall event durations 2 5 comparison and evaluation procedures comparison between the imerg f and rain gauge data was based on a pairwise approach fig 2 a point to cell analysis was performed when there was only one rain gauge available inside the imerg f native cell on the other hand an average points to cell analysis was considered for imerg f grid cells containing more than one rain gauge satellite gridded data without any rain gauges at all within the cell were excluded from the analyses as a result in total there are 1065 grid cells of the imerg f product considered in this study for analyses three evaluation procedures ep were performed to assess the quality of the imerg f product in detecting the rainfall events and their properties for different mit values fig 2b firstly the differences between the mean values of the properties of all rainfall events estimated by the imerg f product and observed by the rain gauges were checked this is the first evaluation procedure ep1 which makes use of the correlation coefficient cc and the mean relative absolute error mrae considering both national and group scale means 1 c c i 1 n o i o e i e i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n e i e 2 2 m r a e 100 n i 1 n o i e i o i where o is the value observed by the rain gauges ō is the mean observed values e is the value estimated by the imerg f product ē is the mean estimated values and n is the total number of compared pairs a second evaluation procedure ep2 was applied to verify whether the actual rainfall events correspond to those detected by the satellites ep2 uses the metrics related to rainfall events detection i probability of detection pod which shows the fraction of rainfall events that are correctly detected by the imerg f product ii false alarm ratio far which exhibits the fraction of events estimated by the imerg f product but not detected by the rain gauge and iii critical success index csi which measures the fraction of imerg f events correctly detected for the total number of observed and estimated rainfall events 3 p o d a a c 4 f a r b a b 5 c s i a a b c where a is the number of rainfall events simultaneously identified by both rain gauge and imerg f b is the number of rainfall events observed by the satellite product but not so by the ground based data and c is the number of rainfall events detected by the rain gauges but not observed by the imerg f product the values of pod far and csi range from 0 up to 1 the perfect score for pod and csi is close to 1 while the desirable values for far are close to 0 the three metrics applied to compare the detection of rainfall events are traditionally used for a defined time space e g gadelha et al 2018 prakash et al 2018 rozante et al 2018 tan and duan 2017 tang et al 2016a which is not the case of this study therefore a sequential approach containing three specific criteria was established to evaluate whether the estimated event is really the same as the observed i if the rainfall events are 100 overlapped ii if the rainfall events are overlapped by more than 50 or iii if the time lag between the centroids are lower than 2 5 times the mit only the events detected according to ep2 were subjected to a third evaluation procedure ep3 which computes the average magnitude of deviations between satellite and ground based properties of events ep3 only includes the mrae of each property in summary the eps adopted in this study make it possible to identify whether the rainfall events observed by the rain gauges are adequately estimated by the imerg f product as follows i good agreement of average rainfall properties ii ability to detect the events and iii conformity of detected events properties fig 2b 2 6 analysis of the rain gauge network density differences between point scale gauge measurements and areal satellite based rainfall can affect the validation conclusions of the imerg f product interpolation approaches are the only options for transferring point scale rainfall observations into areal estimates before they are compared with the grid cells of the satellite based data tian et al 2018 alternatively pairwise comparisons conducted only in grid cells containing at least one rain gauge can also be used asong et al 2017 tan and duan 2017 yang et al 2016 however the reliability of both methods used to compare satellite based products and rain gauge data is intrinsically linked to the density of the ground reference tang et al 2018 tian et al 2018 in order to ensure the reliability of the results the dependence of the imerg f performance on the density of the rain gauge network used in this study was also investigated there were then four metrics applied to verify the deviations of rainfall magnitudes for the imerg f product according to different gauge densities available in this study such metrics include the bias bias the mean relative error mre the mrae presented in eq 2 and the root mean square error rmse 6 b i a s i 1 n e i o i 7 m r e i 1 n e i o i o i 8 r m s e i 1 n e i o i 2 n 2 7 definition of regions based on homogeneous rainfall characteristics as previously mentioned the brazilian territory encompasses a variety of climate zones and rainfall regimes therefore it is necessary to cluster the rain gauges and their corresponding grids of the imerg f product in regions with similar characteristics prior to the proposed analyses the k means clustering algorithm was applied to define these regions with similar rainfall patterns carvalho et al 2016 there were five groups defined in this study based on the number of rainfall regions established for the brazilian territory by reboita et al 2010 and rozante et al 2018 all rain gauges selected after the quality control process were used to define these homogeneous regions as shown in fig 1b there were six different variables obtained from these rain gauges used to define the regions i elevation ii annual rainfall iii number of rainfall events iv mean rainfall depth v mean duration and vi mean intensity for the last four variables all three different mits used for the analyses were also considered when defining the regions however before the clustering analysis the number of variables was reduced using principal component analysis pca dyer 1975 ogallo 1989 singh 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 representativeness of the point s to cell analysis the point s to cell analysis applied in this study was performed using 1750 rain gauges distributed throughout 1065 grid cells of imerg which corresponds to an overall density network of 1 64 gauges per 100 km2 this represents more than eight times the threshold of one gauge per 575 km2 recommended by the world meteorological organisation wmo for the interior plane and undulating areas wmo 1994 the number of rain gauges per grid cell of imerg available for this study ranged from 1 to 12 as shown in table 2 grid cells with densities lower than four rain gauges per 100 km2 stand for more than 90 of the analysed pixels conversely grid cells containing more than seven rain gauges represent 1 of the total pixels evaluated in this study according to the review carried out by tian et al 2018 the rain gauge network used in this study is denser than in most other previous studies evaluating satellite based rainfall products fig 3 shows the evaluation results of the metrics for all available rain gauge density networks this evaluation also considers the three rainfall properties and mits used in this study overall it is not possible to identify an improvement of the evaluation performance with the increase of the gauge density for instance the bias of the rainfall depth and duration remained practically unchanged for the two shorter mits considered in this study in contrast the results show that denser gauge networks tend to slight increase the values of rmse for all mits and rainfall properties this result differs from the studies carried out by tang et al 2018 and tian et al 2018 that detected a strong dependence of the evaluating metrics for the imerg product on the rain gauge densities tang et al 2018 found 2 5 gauges per grid cell at 0 1 spatial scale as the more reliable density to accurately evaluate satellite precipitation products in a river basin in south china however they recommended that future studies should explore the sensitivity of the results to variations in topography climate conditions and precipitation phase solid or liquid because this number can be influenced by the region and season on the other hand the study performed by tian et al 2018 found that the evaluation of the imerg satellite product exhibited better accuracy for most metrics when considering one gauge or more per grid cell 3 2 homogenous rainfall groups fig 1b shows the spatial distribution cells separated by groups with homogenous rainfall characteristics after the application of pca and k means clustering algorithm group 1 is mainly located in the n and ne regions of brazil containing 163 cells table 1 the main atmospheric systems that have influence on this group of cells with the same rainfall patterns are those in the intertropical convergence zone itcz and the mesoscale convective complex mcc cohen et al 1995 espinoza villar et al 2009 according to köppen s classification proposed by alvares et al 2013 the climates of the region where group 1 is placed are tropical monsoon am and tropical with dry winter aw with an average annual temperature of 26 c the annual mean rainfall in the group 1 ranges from 1400 to 2000 mm most of which is concentrated between january and may fig 4 a group 2 mostly encompass the cells located along the atlantic coastal zone of northeast brazil which is mainly characterised by the instability lines il and southeast trade winds setw atmospheric systems kousky 1988 reboita et al 2010 group 2 presents a fewer number of evaluated cells in this study 108 in total the climate of this group is mainly tropical with dry summer as with historical mean rainfall ranging from 1200 to 1800 mm year 1 and mean monthly air temperature above 23 c throughout the year fig 4b most of the 209 cells of group 3 are located in the region of the southeast mainly characterised by a tropical with dry summer as climate with mean annual rainfall ranging from 1000 to 1300 mm and concentrating during the austral summer melo et al 2015 fig 4c the main climate systems influencing group 3 are the south atlantic subtropical anticyclone sasa and the south atlantic convergence zone sacz reboita et al 2010 rozante et al 2018 with the mean monthly air temperature varying between 18 c and 24 c throughout the year groups 4 and 5 own the largest number of analysed cells in this study 317 and 268 respectively both groups are mainly located in the s and se regions with a humid subtropical climate c the south atlantic subtropical anticyclone sasa and south atlantic convergence zone sacz are the main climate systems influencing the group 4 while group 5 is influenced more by the prefrontal squall line psl and cold fronts cf climate systems reboita et al 2010 velasco and fritsch 1987 the annual rainfall in the cells of group 4 ranges between 1300 and 1900 mm most of which is concentrated during the austral summer fig 4d in contrast the rainfall is spatially more uniform throughout the year in group 5 ranging from 1600 to 2 200 mm fig 4e the monthly average air temperature in group 5 ranges from 12 c in july to 23 c in january 3 3 nation wide mean values comparison of the properties of rainfall events in this first analysis the imerg data were evaluated by comparing the mean property values of all rainfall events identified by mit from both imerg and rain gauge fig 5 shows the scatter plots based on the mean values considering all cells analysed for the entire country the outliers were visually excluded from this figure for better visualisation of the point cloud overall the comparison between the two data sources indicates that the imerg product presented a good agreement with the rainfall depths observed by the rain gauges with a solid blotch of points concentrated close to the line of equality for all considered mits fig 5a c the concentration of most of the points above the line can demonstrate a slight overestimation of the rainfall depth by the imerg product for all individual events similar behaviour of slight overestimation was also observed by rozante et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 when evaluating the rainfall depth of imerg over brazil at coarser temporal scales daily onward similar performance behaviour of the sub daily mean areal precipitation from imerg was also noticed in other large scale studies carried out in different regions of the world e g li et al 2018 mayor et al 2017 tang et al 2016a the cc for the rainfall depth considering the cells of all groups ranged from 0 36 mit 24 h to 0 66 mit 6 h with values of mrae 32 indicating low variability of data between the rain gauges and the imerg product for all mit it is also noticeable that the mean rainfall depth progressively increased for both sources of data as mit become greater as observed in depth by dunkerley 2015 medina cobo et al 2016 and molina sanchis et al 2016 using only tipping bucket rain gauge data the mean duration and intensity considering all analysed cells show a poor agreement between the imerg product with the observed rainfall data for all mits fig 5d i for the mean duration a large overestimation of the satellite based product was observed with negative linear correlations with respect to the two longer mits i e 6 h cc 0 19 and 24 h cc 0 03 these negative and low values of linear correlations represent an absence of correlation when comparing the two different rainfall datasets for the mean intensity however the imerg products presented a large underestimation when compared with the observed data showing almost all points concentrated below the line of equality and the cc values ranging from 0 29 to 0 49 this behaviour was expected because the mean intensity inversely correlates to the mean duration as a well known feature from the relationship between intensity depth and duration dunkerley 2008a overall it is also noticeable that the mean durations of imerg present far larger amplitudes of data with values up to three times higher than that observed in the rain gauges accordingly the mean observed intensity is inversely proportional to the mit with amplitudes of values reducing significantly when rain events are longer as also noticed and analysed by dunkerley 2015 in australia in contrast the mean intensity estimated by the imerg product exhibits low dispersion for all mits with minimum and maximum values of 0 2 mit 24 h and 2 5 mm h 1 mit 1 h respectively the mrae values vary widely from 141 to 213 for mean duration and from 55 to 69 for mean intensity the disagreement detected for the rainfall intensity occurs because the imerg f product is adjusted so that the monthly rainfall depth matches up with the rain gauges represented in the gpcc analysis becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2014 this calibration does not affect the duration of the satellite event so the intensity will be adjusted to whatever it takes over the duration of the event to fit the total monthly rainfall this analysis considering national wide mean values comparison can lead to a false conclusion when data from the various regions are evaluated in a single pool therefore the following sections present the results based on the comparison of homogenous rainfall groups 3 4 homogenous group wide mean values comparison of the properties of event fig 6 shows the box plots of the mean values for all analysed rainfall properties separated by groups with homogenous characteristics with extreme values also visually excluded for better visualisation of the data overall the rainfall depth estimated by the imerg f product shows similar distribution with the data obtained from the rain gauges for all groups with groups 3 4 and 5 having the closest patterns there is a slight overestimation in the satellite based product compared with the observed data for all mits in contrast groups 1 and 2 exhibited the worst performance considering longer 24 h and shorter 1 and 6 h enclosing rain events respectively rozante et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 also noted low performance of imerg f in capturing daily rainfall depth in regions where the groups 1 and 2 are predominantly located the best ccs for rainfall depth were observed for group 1 with values equal to or higher than 0 52 for all mits table 3 although presenting the best cc values the variability of data between imerg and rain gauges was substantially high for mits equal to 24 h in group 1 with mrae reaching values higher than 90 the reduction of the number of events registered by imerg f for longer mit probably influenced the increase of the mean rainfall depth and consequently the values of mrae in group 1 this effect may be caused by the influence of convective clouds that prevail in this group since this type of cloud can be falsely detected by the infrared sensors of the satellite as also noticed by rozante et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 overall groups 4 and 5 presented the lowest variabilities of the mean rainfall depth between the two sources of data mrae 30 independently of the mit considered the mean duration of the events from the imerg f product is significantly overestimated compared with that of the ground based data for all five homogenous groups fig 6d f following the same characteristics observed for the national scale mean comparison similarly for the rainfall depth group 1 has the worst performance in terms of using the imerg f in detecting the mean duration with values of mrae higher than 300 for all mits considered in this study table 3 the best performance of the imerg f in identifying the duration of the gauge data was observed in group 5 54 mrae 150 although the values of cc showed negative correlations for the two shorter mits such performance is most likely caused by the prevalence of rainfall from cold front weather systems with low intensity and long durations as noted by rozante et al 2018 in general the shorter mit of the imerg f dataset represented the mean duration of the rain gauges worse regardless of the homogenous rainfall group 150 mrae 322 these behaviours show that the imerg f product can adequately capture the rainfall depth but with longer duration when compared to the ground based dataset the durations of the satellite based product result in a large underestimation of the rainfall intensity of imerg f once again group 1 exhibited the largest deviations and errors in the evaluation of the satellite rainfall product with mrae obtained for rainfall intensity exceeding 80 for all mit conversely lower errors for the rainfall intensity were found in groups 2 and 5 although coming with high values of mrae from 37 to 58 and low positive cc 0 43 this fact limits the use of the imerg f for those purposes that require accurate information about rainfall duration and intensity such as soil loss medeiros and araújo 2014 and production of surface runoff figueiredo et al 2016 3 5 mean values comparison of trends by fixed thresholds this section evaluates the agreement of the mean values of all rainfall properties of the imerg f product according to the level of underestimation or overestimation which is split into seven categories as shown in fig 7 overall the mean rainfall depth of imerg f exhibited low relative errors across all groups especially for the two shorter mits where more than 50 of the cells showed a good agreement for almost all groups an exception was noticed in group 2 where a mix of moderate and slight overestimations prevailed in more than 50 of the cells a reduction in the number of cells presenting good agreement was observed in almost all homogenous groups for longer mit values except in group 2 this effect was caused by the aggregation of individual rain events that increased the rainfall depth in longer mits as deeply discussed by dunkerley 2008a in this study the increase of rainfall depth within longer rain events was more accentuated for the imerg f product when compared to the observed dataset which is evidenced by the considerable number of cells presenting slight and moderate overestimations in all groups group 1 concentrates the largest relative errors for the longer mit with moderate and large overestimations representing more than 75 of the cells in this group generally the imerg f product is unable to successfully represent the mean rainfall duration or intensity of the events observed by the rain gauges with most cells displaying large overestimations and underestimations mainly for shorter mits respectively fig 7d i the performance of the group 1 does not practically change across different mits when comparing duration and intensity group 1 demonstrates very large deviations in duration overestimation and intensity underestimation on the other hand group 2 exhibited a better performance of rainfall duration and intensity with approximately 30 of the analysed cells deemed to be in good agreement for the two longer mits this analysis confirms the results found in the previous sections that indicate a limitation of the imerg f product to represent the intensity and duration of the same sub daily rainfall events observed by the gauges but with complementary information regarding the percentage of cells in each homogenous group according to the agreement thresholds 3 6 analysis of rainfall events detection the results presented in the previous sections show a good agreement between the mean rainfall depth estimated by the imerg f product and observed by the ground based dataset which was not noted for the two other rainfall properties duration and intensity this section analyses if the imerg f product is able to accurately match the same rainfall events detected by the rain gauges fig 8 shows considerable improvement of the imerg f product performance in detecting ground based rainfall events as mit increases an exception was noticed in group 1 where more events were correctly detected for the mit of 6 h overall groups 4 and 5 presented the highest pod values for all mit ranging from 0 3 mit 1 h to 0 8 mit 24 h the results exhibited in fig 8a indicate a good skill of imerg f in detecting individual rain events equal to or higher than 6 h in those two groups located in southern brazil as also noted by lelis et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 in their evaluation of the imerg f product from daily to annual time scales this performance of pod is corroborated by the distribution of csi which followed the same characteristics but with lower values due to the high number of detected far similar behaviour was also observed by tang et al 2016a who assessed the imerg f product in china where pod presented values 20 larger than csi on the other hand groups 1 and 2 displayed pod values lower than 0 5 for the longer mit rozante et al 2018 also observed low detection of imerg f along the atlantic coast of ne brazil where most of group 2 is located even considering analyses on a monthly basis unlike pod and csi the far presented an inverse relation with the mit with the highest false alarms observed for rain events equal to 1 h in all groups the far exhibited similar performance for all groups with the largest proportional reduction of false alarms identified between the two shorter mits 3 7 error magnitude analysis results relative to ep2 are depicted by the spider charts assessing the magnitude of deviations between the rainfall properties estimated by the imerg f product and observed by the rain gauges fig 9 the mrae values presented a general behaviour of remaining unchanged with the aggregation of the rainfall depth events in almost all groups with values close to 100 only group 2 exhibited an increase in the magnitude of the depth error when longer no rain periods are included within rainfall events gadelha et al 2019 also found large deviations of rainfall depth in most cells located in the coastal zone of the brazilian ne when evaluating the imerg f product on coarser time scales such poor performance was attributed by the authors to the warm rain process dominated systems that are not well detected by the passive microwave sensors over land the values of mrae for duration follow the general pattern observed in the rainfall depth but with higher errors also detected in group 2 especially for the mit 24 h 600 the largest values of mrae were noticed for rainfall intensity wherein the deviations of imerg f range from 300 group 5 to 2000 group 1 for the longer mit 4 summary and conclusions this study is the first national scale assessment of the imerg f product at sub daily temporal resolution in brazil moreover the analyses focused on the potential of the satellite based data in delineating rainfall events and defining some of its properties such as depth duration and intensity the evaluation was carried out using 1065 grid cells of the imerg f product separated into five different groups with homogenous rainfall characteristics the main specific findings of this study are summarised as follows 1 the imerg f product exhibited good performance in capturing the rainfall depth for all mits considered in this study with some variations depending on the analysed group overall the rainfall depth estimated by the satellite product presented better performance in cells located in southern brazil specifically in groups 4 and 5 2 imerg f presented a slight tendency in overestimation the ground based rainfall depth data for all mits this overestimation tends to slightly increase when longer rain events are analysed although a considerable improvement of the probability of detection was also noticed when more rain events were incorporated 3 the evaluations revealed large overestimations and underestimations of the imerg f product for rainfall duration and intensity respectively this behaviour was noted for all groups and all mits probably because i the calibration of the imerg f product that is made to match the monthly rain gauges rainfall depth incorporated to improve the satellite estimates and ii the capability of the microwave and infrared sensors for identifying rain no rain in general these sensors detect longer rainfall events than those that actually occurred such finding limits the use of the imerg f product in brazil for some applications that require rainfall intensity and duration information with high temporal resolution 4 the analyses reveal that the detection of events by the imerg f product tends to improve with the increasing of mit however the rainfall properties remain not well represented with this improvement especially the intensity and duration 5 overestimations and underestimations of the imerg f product were more evident in regions with the presence of mesoscale convective systems group 1 on the other hand in regions with the presence of cold front weather systems and rainfall characterised by long duration and low intensity the imerg f product better estimated the sub daily rainfall data group 5 the results obtained from this study provide a reference for imerg f v06b use cases that require sub daily rainfall data based on events and further knowledge about its properties based on our findings the sub daily information on rainfall depth from the imerg f product can be a good source of data for hydroclimatic and hydrological studies in southern brazil on the other hand sub daily rainfall depth data from the imerg f product have to be carefully checked when used throughout the ne coastal region because of the larger overestimations and underestimations associated with the weather systems il and setw and the reduced capability of the sensor to detect some precipitation and cloud types unfortunately the number of rain gauges with sub daily data from the cemaden network is limited over the n region where the amazon rainforest is located which makes a more accurate assessment of the imerg f product in this area difficult finally this study highlights the need for further analyses event by event in each cell of the imerg f product to verify the influence of the hydroclimatic variables in the detection of rainfall intensity and duration events moreover improvements in rainfall intensity and duration estimates of the imerg f product are necessary for better identification of rain no rain since the generation of a rainfall event however small it is leads to a change of the duration and consequently the intensity credit authorship

5226,this work quantified the long term 2002 2017 impacts of the danjiangkou dam china on the thermal regimes of downstream han river using landsat thermal infrared imageries with an emphasis on the effect of dam heightening the accuracy assessment of satellite derived temperatures indicated a root mean square error of 0 95 c suggesting an accurate retrieval of water temperature the long term analysis detected a seasonal cycle of thermal impacts with strong cooling in summer moderate cooling in spring and autumn whereas no significant changes in winter the cycle was likely attributed to the seasonal thermal stratification in the dammed reservoir the analysis also revealed a pronounced year to year variability in the thermal impacts this was especially the case after the heightening of dam in 2013 which led to a stronger cooling effect and a longer cooling duration the inter annual variability can be largely explained by the varying reservoir water levels associated with dam operation and dam heightening as well as tributary inflows and water diversion projects the longitudinal thermal profile analysis suggested at least a length of 20 km downstream river was thermally affected the cooling effects may be significant to the aquatic ecosystems of downstream river especially with respect to the delay of famous four species of chinese carp spawning or the reduction and downstream shift of spawning sites the findings provide new scientific understandings about the long term seasonal thermal regimes of dammed rivers and the techniques can be extended to the global scale to investigate thermal effects of large dams keywords river water temperature danjiangkou dam thermal infrared remote sensing thermal impact cooling effect 1 introduction river water temperature rwt is one of the most important physical variables of streams and rivers it strongly influences physical chemical and biological properties of water governs most of the chemical and biochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems webb et al 2008 martí cardona et al 2019 hence understanding the thermal condition of rivers is critical for water quality issues and aquatic ecosystem health previous studies have shown that the rwt was affected by both large scale climate changes schneider and hook 2010 vliet et al 2011 and local scale human induced perturbations e g dam construction deforestation freshwater withdrawal thermal pollution etc webb and walling 1996 olden and naiman 2010 among these anthropogenic activities large dams more than 15 m high have become an important source of thermal alteration as two thirds of the world s major rivers have been disrupted with more than 50 000 dams lehner et al 2011 considerable works have been carried out to understand thermal impacts of large dams on downstream rivers in different climatic settings around the world such as the keepit dam in australia preece and jones 2002 the multi purpose dams in the willamette river basin steel and lange 2007 and the glen canyon dam wright et al 2009 in u s a the paso de las piedras dam casado et al 2013 in argentina the geheyan dam and gaobazhou dam ling et al 2017 and the three gorges dam tgd cai et al 2018 in china the previous studies have demonstrated that changes occurred to all aspects of the river thermal condition including the magnitude of thermal impacts the delay in the annual cycle of temperature the frequency and duration of temperature extremes and the extent of thermal alterations thus far we generally have a clear understanding of dam induced thermal impacts however most of these works were conducted either on a seasonal basis or over a few years cycle while such seasonal studies are informative for descriptive purposes year round perspectives are critical to understand the biological response associated with the thermal modification of habitat environments olden and naiman 2010 in addition the short term analysis is not adequate to assess the impact of dams over time in response to such factors as variations in climate conditions from year to year and changes in dam operation strategies webb and walling 1996 vinson 2001 a long term assessment of dam induced thermal impacts and full characterization of downstream thermal regimes would be challenging using traditional techniques such as sampling and modelling the former has been limited by sparse sampling of temperatures in both space and time and hence cannot provide the detailed information on spatial temperature patterns necessary for understanding the dam associated thermal effects ling et al 2017 in addition long term river temperature records may be unavailable or publicly inaccessible in most regions of the world olden and naiman 2010 temperature models were thus introduced to predict riverine thermal conditions the models typically require significant model development parameter estimation and computational cost making application of models over large scale domain difficult niemeyer et al 2018 conversely the thermal infrared tir remote sensing provides a powerful tool to acquire long term spatially distributed temperature measurements over a large spatial extent handcock et al 2006 several satellite sensors have been deployed to collect thermal emission data for example the thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper etm and thermal infrared sensor tirs onboard the landsat platforms offer for more than 40 years the continuous tir imageries with relatively fine spatial resolutions 120 to 60 m numerous studies have utilized landsat tir imageries to characterize thermal patterns in lakes and reservoirs martí cardona et al 2008 schneider and hook 2010 prats et al 2018 in case of rivers a minimum width of three pixels is suggested to reduce the effect of near bank reflected radiance in order to obtain reliable temperature estimates handcock et al 2006 martí cardona et al 2019 hence the landsat tir imagery has been used to estimate water surface temperatures in large rivers wawrzyniak and poirel 2012 lalot et al 2015 ling et al 2017 martí cardona et al 2019 these studies also indicated that the accuracies of derived temperatures from tir images varied from 1 to 2 c lamaro et al 2013 prats et al 2018 the danjiangkou dam across the han river china was the focus of this study the dam was completed in 1974 and was heightened in 2013 to increase the water storage capacity of impounded reservoir as it was selected as the water source for the strategic middle route project of the south north water transfer project snwtp zhang et al 2009 despite the vital importance for water supply and large capacity of the impoundment the dam induced flow and thermal alterations have threatened the biodiversity and ecosystem functions in the downstream han river it was reported that the population of famous four species of chinese carp ffcc in the middle reaches of han river was reduced sharply from 1970 s xie et al 2009 the increase of water level and extraction of surface water altered the thermal structure of reservoir posing further threats on the aquatic ecosystems in the downstream river previous studies on danjiangkou dam have mainly focused on the flow and sediment alterations wang et al 2015 qian et al 2016 song et al 2018 lu et al 2018 few works were conducted to investigate the thermal impact on the downstream river chen et al 2016 examined the thermal structure changes in the danjiangkou reservoir and the downstream river using a multi model approach while their study improved our understanding of the impacts of dam on the general thermal regime of the reservoir and downstream river there was still limited information available on the long term impacts of the dam in addition little work has addressed the effect of dam heightening on the downstream thermal conditions while this information could provide important reference for the assessment of the dam heightening project on the long term health and stability of river ecosystem therefore the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the long term 2002 2017 impact of danjiangkou dam on the thermal regimes of the downstream han river using landsat tir imageries the specific objectives of this study are 1 to provide a long term and season round perspective of thermal impacts of danjiangkou dam on the downstream river 2 to quantify the effect of dam heightening on the thermal alteration of the downstream river 3 to discuss the ecological implications associated with riverine thermal regime alterations in particular for the spawning of ffcc 2 study area the danjiangkou dam is located at about 650 km upstream of the han river fig 1 the han river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river with a length of 1 577 km and a catchment of 159 000 km2 joining the yangtze river mainstream at wuhan in hubei province the basin is affected by the east asian monsoon and characterized by a subtropical warm and wet climate with hot and humid summers and mild winters liu et al 2018 the average annual temperature is 15 17 c and the annual precipitation ranges from approximately 700 mm in the north hilly regions to 1 200 mm in the southern plains and 75 of the annual precipitation falls from may to october pan et al 2018 the reservoir is supplied by two major tributaries the upper han river and the dan river with a drainage area of approx 95 200 km2 zhang et al 2009 it typically gets water from april to july with an average annual inflow of about 38 80 km3 the inflow of dan river is much less than that of han river as the catchment area of dan river is 1 10 of han river the depth and width of the han river below the dam are around 7 m and over 450 m wide enough for the retrieval of rwt using landsat tir images the danjiangkou dam is a deep release dam with an elevation of 162 m above sea level creating one of the largest reservoirs in asia as the reservoir served as the water source for the snwtp it was heightened to 176 6 m in 2013 leading to an increase in the storage capacity from 17 45 km3 to 29 05 km3 liu et al 2018 the surface area of reservoir was expanded from 745 km2 to 1050 km2 with a maximum water depth of approximately 80 m pan et al 2018 the snwtp delivered a volume of 9 5 km3 of water each year to beijing tianjing and other cities along the water transfer route zhang et al 2009 in addition the ebei water transfer project ewtp was developed in 2015 which extracted another 1 4 km3 of water per year from the reservoir chen et al 2016 the reservoir was normally discharged through the hypolimnion by power tunnels while in flood seasons the overflow weir was also used to release a part of the flood peak the bottom elevations of power tunnels overflow weir and snwtp water intake were 115 0 m 138 m and 140 m respectively chen et al 2016 prior to these projects the dam was operated with a seasonal mode leading to seasonal fluctuations in the water level of reservoir fig 2 afterwards the operation was changed by reducing release rates to conserve water for diversion resulting in an increase of average water level by 10 m and a decrease of seasonal water level variation fig 2 the reservoir was approximately isothermal from november to march before the seasonal stratification began in april with heating of the surface layer chen et al 2016 3 materials and methods 3 1 data source landsat series tir images were used for the retrieval of water surface temperatures including these from tm etm and tirs the tm sensor on landsat 5 recorded the thermal emission in band 6 10 4 12 5 µm with a spatial resolution of 120 m the etm sensor on board landsat 7 has a unique thermal band band 6 which is divided into low gain band b6l and high gain band b6h with a spatial resolution of 60 m and a spectral resolution from 10 4 to 12 5 µm the b6l was used in this work because its range was larger and not saturated chander et al 2009 the tirs on landsat 8 collected thermal data in bands 10 and 11 with spectrum centred at roughly 10 9 and 12 µm and a spatial resolution of 100 m only band 10 was used as band 11 was affected by stray light effects barsi et al 2014 cloud free images of path 125 and row 39 were collected from 2002 to 2017 which resulted in 158 scenes corresponding to reservoir levels from 134 m to 168 m fig 2 it was noted that the cloud free image here referred to the image with no cloud above the study area rather than the entire image all images were level 1t products with precision and terrain correction and were projected into the utm zone 49n with wgs datum the measured water temperature data were collected from the danjiangkou and huangjiagang hydrological station to validate the water temperature estimates the former station is situated at the reservoir right upstream of the dam while the latter is located at the han river 6 km downstream of the dam the temperature was measured at 8 00 a m local time at a depth of 50 cm daily water temperature data at the two stations in 2009 2012 were obtained from yearbooks during this period there were 29 cloud free images available including 9 images in spring 8 in summer 4 in autumn and 8 in winter hence 58 temperature match ups for the two stations were used in the validation the daily water level of reservoir observed at danjiangkou hydrological station was collected it was used to investigate the relationship between the water level and the thermal impacts the data covered the period from january 2002 to december 2017 fig 2 3 2 method the long term impact of danjiangkou dam on thermal regimes of downstream han river was investigated using the time series landsat tir images which consisted of three steps including pure water pixels mask water temperature retrieval and thermal impact analysis a modified water index was employed to produce the water only image which was used to retrieve water surface temperatures the longitudinal profiles of river temperature were constructed to examine the magnitude and extent of thermal impacts water temperature differences wtds between the upstream reservoir and downstream river were calculated to examine the variability in annual and seasonal thermal influences on the downstream river 3 2 1 pure water pixels mask pure water pixels were identified for water temperature retrieval from tir images the modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 calculated from the green and shortwave infrared bands was employed to separate water from non water pixels the water pixels were masked by setting a proper threshold on each of the mndwi images the threshold was determined through trial and error method the generated binary water no water masks were then converted into vector polygons only the pixels in the thermal infrared band that were fully included in the water polygon were considered as water which were used to derive the water temperature additionally the river centreline was extracted based on the water polygon which was used to construct the longitudinal profile of river temperatures 3 2 2 water temperature retrieval various algorithms have been developed to retrieve water surface temperatures from tir images in the case of landsat platform the single channel method was the only suitable method as there was only one thermal band in tm and etm tir images one of the most popular single channel algorithms was based on the radiative transfer model rtm which involved radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and conversion of water surface radiance to water surface temperature lamaro et al 2013 lamaro et al 2013 compared this method with a generalized single channel method developed by jiménez muñoz and sobrino 2003 for retrieving water surface temperature from landsat 7 etm thermal bands it was found that the rtm yielded better results when compared against the in situ observations hence it was employed in this work radiometric calibration was necessary in order to compare data from the same sensor over time or between sensors lamaro et al 2013 the radiometric calibration was carried out to obtain the at sensor spectral radiance which was performed based on the digital number dn values of the image by applying the gain and bias coefficients given as follows irish et al 2006 1 l λ g a i n d n b i a s where l λ is the at sensor spectral radiance at λ wavelength in w m 2 s r m m gain and bias are calibration parameters of the sensors for landsat 5 and landsat 7 low gain thermal bands gain is set to be 0 055376 and 0 067087 and bias is set to be 1 18 and 0 07 respectively chander et al 2009 for landsat 8 the values of two parameters are variable which can be found in the header file of product avdan and jovanovska 2016 atmospheric correction was a crucial step for satellite derived water temperatures it was reported that atmospheric effects can cause a difference of up to 4 55 k between bulk water temperature and uncorrected satellite derived estimates considering a constant water emissivity lamaro et al 2013 therefore the atmospheric correction should be conducted to remove these effects from reflected downward and upward radiances the atmospheric correction was performed based on the radiative transfer equation srivastava et al 2009 which was given as follows 2 l λ t s l λ l λ up t ε λ 1 ε λ ε λ l λ down where l λ t s is the corrected water surface radiance l λ is the at sensor spectral radiance calculated in equation 1 l λ up is the upwelling atmospheric radiance l λ down is the downwelling atmospheric radiance t is the atmospheric transmissivity and ε λ is water emissivity the atmospheric parameters l λ up t and l λ down can be calculated from in situ radiosoundings or using a radiative transfer codes like modtran moderate resolution atmospheric transmission as the in situ radiosoundings launched simultaneously with the satellite passes were not available atmospheric parameters were estimated from atmospheric correction parameter calculator http www atmcorr gsfc nasa gov which was based on modtran model barsi et al 2003a barsi et al 2003b according to simon et al 2014 the water emissivity ε λ was set to be 0 9885 finally the water temperature was retrieved based on the corrected water surface radiance l λ t s using planck s function which was determined by 3 t s k 2 ln k 1 l λ t s 1 where t s is the water temperature k k 1 and k 2 are sensor specified thermal constants which can be found in table 1 for thermal bands of landsat 5 landsat 7 and landsat 8 3 2 3 thermal impact analysis water surface temperature maps were generated to illustrate thermal patterns of study area in different seasons once water temperatures were retrieved in order to highlight the thermal impacts the longitudinal profile of river temperatures was derived using the bilinear interpolation technique the profile was plotted and analysed against the distance to the dam to reveal both the magnitude and extent of thermal impacts in different seasons the wtds between the upstream reservoir and downstream river were used to demonstrate the variability in annual and seasonal thermal influences for this purpose two 3 3 windows locating at the reservoir and downstream river channel were selected to compute the mean water temperature by averaging values of 9 pixels which were about 0 5 and 6 km from the dam respectively fig 1 although spatial resolutions of tir bands varied among landsat series images they were resampled to 30 m by the data provider hence the window size was uniform for all the tir images the wtds were calculated by subtracting the mean water temperature of downstream river from that of the reservoir hence a positive value represented net cooling downstream from the dam while a negative value represented net warming it was noted that since the collected landsat images were not evenly distributed within each season due to cloud coverage fig 2 only the years with at least one image in each of the four seasons were used for the long term analysis in the analysis we assumed each season lasted three months and the spring runs from march to may as the study area is situated in the subtropical zone of north hemisphere thereafter seasonal and inter annual variability of thermal impacts were analysed using the long term wtds time series 4 results 4 1 seasonal thermal pattern the historical water surface temperatures were reconstructed for the study area using 158 landsat thermal images spanning from 2002 to 2017 fig 3 was a typical example of derived water temperatures in each of the four seasons in 2016 these maps provided spatially distributed thermal measurements across the study area and clearly showed the varying thermal patterns in the reservoir and downstream river over different seasons in spring an obvious temperature decline was identified in the river below the dam which was enhanced in summer with the largest temperature contrast occurred later the temperature discrepancy gradually decreased which was still obvious in autumn it was continued to reduce until no clear difference was observed in winter the figure also illustrated that there were no significant water temperature changes along the downstream river the seasonal thermal impacts can be highlighted by the longitudinal profile of river temperatures fig 4 showed the corresponding four profiles of river temperatures in 2016 each profile was approximately 24 km in length including 4 km in the reservoir and 20 km in the downstream river the profiles disclosed unique information regarding thermal gradients in the reservoir and the river according to the profiles the magnitude of thermal impacts varied significantly among the four seasons a sharp decrease of temperature was evident below the dam in summer with the water temperature decreased by up to approximately 10 c on june 27th notable river water temperature declines were also visible in spring and autumn which ranged from about 3 c to 4 c however the profile of winter did not exhibit a consistent pattern with those of the other three seasons which dropped very slightly below the dam suggesting the limited thermal impact the extent of thermal impacts can also be identified from the analysis of profiles for all the profiles the downstream river temperature remained stable for at least 20 km with no signs of significant recovery the profile analysis confirmed our previous observations of seasonal thermal impacts 4 2 seasonal and annual variability fig 5 illustrated the long term wtds and annual mean wtds between the upstream reservoir and downstream river during the period of 2002 2017 it clearly exhibited a strong seasonal cycle of thermal impacts on the downstream river the largest wtds were found in summer seasons with values up to 10 c 2016 while the lowest wtds were observed in winters with values around 0 c the spring and autumn had the moderate wtds values in addition considerable inter annual variations in thermal impacts can be detected as well the largest wtds prior to dam heightening 2002 to 2014 occurred in summer seasons with values fluctuating around 6 c while these values were increased up to 10 c after the heightening 2015 to 2017 even during the period of 2002 2014 the wtds in summer varied from 4 c 2007 to 9 c 2005 the annual mean wtds pre dam heightening fluctuated around 2 c which was increased to about 4 c afterwards revealing the impact of dam heightening it was noted that in some years e g 2003 and 2012 the peak wtds were found much lower than 4 c which was likely due to the lack of images in summer seasons because of cloud coverage these seasonal cycles and inter annual variations in thermal impacts can be better presented in table 2 which summarized the long term seasonal average wtds between the reservoir and downstream river from the table a general cooling effect of the dam on the downstream river was identified for all the seasons however the magnitude of cooling effects varied the strongest cooling occurred in summer with the temperature drop ranging from 3 08 c to 9 22 c and an average of 6 01 c followed by the moderate cooling in spring and autumn with the average drops of 2 76 c and 1 23 c respectively and then was winter with the average drop of 0 17 c showing the slightest cooling effect overall an average annual temperature decrease of 2 57 c in the downstream river was found it was worth mentioning that the cooling may pose significant adverse influences on the aquatic ecosystems in the downstream river particularly during the ecologically important later spring and summer period in short these results suggested that the danjiangkou dam had exerted seasonal cooling influences on the downstream river the long term satellite observations revealed considerable year to year variability in the dam induced thermal impacts table 2 the annual average wtds were generally less than 3 c during the pre dam heightening period of 2002 2014 which were increased to larger than 3 c afterwards suggesting an intensified cooling exerted by the dam heightening however an exception was found in the year of 2009 which showed the annual wtds of 2 97 c with largest wtds in both spring and summer season during 2002 2014 to summarize the analysis indicated that the considerable variations in the magnitude of the cooling impact of dam among individual years has been identified which highlighted dangers in generalizing the effects of dam on the basis of a few years of records 4 3 effect of dam heightening fig 6 and table 3 showed the monthly mean wtds pre 2002 2014 and post dam heightening 2015 2017 period based on the satellite observations it indicated that both the shape and the magnitude of wtds pattern were changed after the heightening of dam fig 6 the monthly peak wtds prior to the heightening of dam occurred in june with the value of 5 56 c which was shifted to august with the value of 8 85 c after the heightening with particularly strong differences in wtds occurring from june to september hence a two month lag of peak wtds was identified compared with the pre heightening condition prior to the heightening of dam little temperature alterations less than 1 c were found for five months from october to the next february while those were observed within four months from december to the next march after the heightening significant cooling impacts larger than 5 c lasted for two months june to july before the heightening compared with that of four months may to august after the heightening notably three out of these four months were observed with wtds larger than 8 c which may be a significant threat on the stability of river ecosystem it was noted that a tiny warming effect was observed in february before the heightening which was slightly enhanced by 0 21 c after the heightening meanwhile the cooling effects were intensified in the remaining months with temperature drop ranging from 0 06 to 5 59 c table 3 to summarize the danjiangkou dam caused a slightly warming effect in february and a cooling effect for the remaining months of a year while the heightening of dam enhanced both the warming and cooling effects especially with a stronger cooling effect and a longer cooling duration in summer seasons 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal and annual variability in thermal impacts the seasonal thermal impacts primarily depend on the stratification characteristics of dammed reservoir previous studies have suggested that seasonal patterns of thermal stratification are usually formed in deep reservoirs due to seasonal variations of solar radiation angilletta et al 2008 niemeyer et al 2018 in spring increased surface energy fluxes tend to create a layer of warmer water at the reservoir surface floating on top of colder water at depth leading to the onset of stratification nürnberg 2007 with the enhancement of solar radiation in summer upper layers of water are intensely heated and cooler waters remain underneath in the hypolimnion resulting in an extremely stratified water column while in autumn the upper layer are gradually cooled and the thermal stratification reduces and may disappear in winter due to fully mixing by convection niemeyer et al 2018 the danjiangkou reservoir is a deep reservoir located in the subtropical area favouring the development of seasonal thermal stratification hence the water released from the hypolimnion would seasonally alter the thermal regimes in the downstream river our results indicated a seasonal cycle of thermal impacts exerting on the river with the most pronounced thermal alteration occurred in summer while moderate in spring and autumn and least pronounced detected during the winter fig 5 table 3 thus far our results were consistent with the previous findings on characteristics of seasonal thermal stratification in deep reservoirs and the seasonal variability in thermal impacts was due to the seasonal thermal stratification in the reservoir moreover thermal impacts identified from the present study agreed with the results from other large deep release dams for example the annual maximum daily temperature of the naomi river immediately downstream of keepit dam in australia was reduced by 5 c preece and jones 2002 in argentina the mean daily temperature in sauce grande river was decreased by 3 c in summer immediately below the paso de las piedras dam casado et al 2013 similarly the summer temperature in the qingjiang river china dropped by 5 c following the geheyan dam ling et al 2017 indeed due to the cooling effects of deep release dams they have been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the influence of global warming null et al 2013 the magnitude in the seasonal thermal impacts is associated with the water level of reservoir the increased water level can affect the thermal stratification characteristics by weakening the heat exchange with the bottom water body niemeyer et al 2018 fig 7 showed the relations of wtds and the water level of reservoir in different months positive relationships were identified in summer months may to august during this period of year the reservoir was characterized by the strongest stratification with warm water in the surface and cold water in the bottom hence the higher water level reduced heat transfer from the upper to bottom waters leading to even larger wtds in other months of the year relationships between wtds and the water level were more scattered during these months the reservoir was approximately isothermal chen et al 2016 and therefore the higher water level did not significantly affect the heat exchange in the water column this may explain the intensified cooling effect in the downstream river associated with the heightening of dam which increased the average water level of reservoir by about 10 m fig 2 similarly the large seasonal wtds in 2009 was likely due to the high water level in that year while the low peak wtds in some year e g 2013 was likely caused by the lower water level in that summer fig 2 in short the influence of reservoir water level on discharge temperatures was seasonally dependent i e the water level was more influential in the months when the reservoir was stratified while it was less influential when the reservoir was isothermal additionally another obvious impact of higher water level was a two month lag of peak wtds compared with the pre heightening condition fig 6 the higher water level associated with dam heightening increased the volume of cold hypolimnion and thus reduced the vertical heat transfer leading to a delay in the peak wtds the temperature lag was commonly found in the downstream river of a dam for example the annual maximum daily river temperature downstream from keepit dam occurred three weeks later than the pre dam condition preece and jones 2002 moreover the location of the outflow facility may also affect the temperature of releases from stratified reservoirs according to the vertical profiles of pre heightening from chen et al 2016 the withdrawal was located in the reach of the meta and epilimnion during stratification whereas after the heightening the withdrawal can reach hypolimnion under normal years and the metalimnion in low level years thus the volume of withdrawals from the hypolimnion increased leading to an intensified cooling effect in the downstream river overall our analysis suggested that a seasonal pattern of thermal impacts was consistently repeated as a result of seasonal variations in solar radiation with an amplification that was a function of higher water level in the reservoir although the magnitude of thermal impacts was related with the water level in summer seasons it seemed that the relationship was not that strong as the coefficient of determinations ranged between 0 17 and 0 5 in summer and even smaller in other seasons some other factors may also affect the magnitude of thermal impacts apart from variations of solar radiation and water level the thermal inertia and structure of reservoir are also affected by variable inflows and outflows the danjiangkou reservoir is a river fed reservoir serving for multi purposes through water withdrawals from different layers take 2016 2017 as an example an inflow of 43 63 km3 with varying temperatures was received by the reservoir from december 1 2016 to october 31 2017 compared with the reservoir the inflow of han river was warmer in spring by 0 9 c and colder in summer autumn and winter by 1 5 3 7 and 4 1 c measured at the station 216 km upstream of the dam li and hu 1995 as such the inflow water affected the thermal inertia of reservoir and resulted in stronger vertical stratification by forming density currents alavian et al 1992 i e by forming a near surface flow during spring and an underflow during the rest of year it was noted that the dan river inflow and the north western basin of the reservoir were much colder in spring autumn and winter fig 3 although the inflow of dan river was much less than that of han river it seemed that the river brought a lot of cold water into the reservoir system hence the seasonal variations of inflow temperature matter a lot which should be carefully monitored for future work in addition the schemes of water withdrawal were also important in determining thermal stratification in reservoirs during this period the snwtp delivered 4 49 km3 of water from the epilimnion while another 33 72 km3 was discharged to the downstream river through the hypolimnion the remaining 5 km3 was stored in the reservoir kerimoglu and rinke 2013 have shown that a withdrawal from the epilimnion increased the thermal stratification of reservoir by reducing heat transfer in the water column leading to stronger thermal stability while a hypolimnetic withdrawal was found to weaken the stratification of water body resulting in thermal instability nürnberg 2007 the strength of thermal stratification may lead to the release of even colder water it was noted that the amounts of river inflow the fraction and timing of hydropower withdrawal at 115 m and overflow at 138 m are crucial for the resulting mixed temperature and the cooling effect of the dam operations which may vary seasonally and inter annually posing further influences on the thermal structure of reservoir overall the river inflow and water withdrawal affected the thermal inertia and vertical thermal structure of danjiangkou reservoir in a complex way leading to additional influences on the thermal regimes of downstream han river to quantify these effects considerable gauging data and complex models were required weber et al 2017 which may be the focus of future work to summarize the significant inter annual variability in the thermal impacts of danjiangkou dam was due to many different mechanisms including year to year changes in reservoir water levels associated with dam operations and dam heightening tributary inflows as well as water diversion projects while thermal stratification and variable flows are inevitable the design of a dam also plays an important role in determining the thermal regime of downstream river dams are usually equipped with different outlets that discharges can be made from if the water outlet facilities are located close to the surface the downstream river temperature will be warmer than the pre dam condition due to surface heating of reservoir lessard and hayes 2003 for dams with the outlet in the bottom such as the case in this study the released cold water will reduce the temperature of downstream river given thermal stratification occurs for dams equipped with multiple depth outlet devices a selective withdrawal can be made from different layers of reservoir creating a discharge with desirable water temperature weber et al 2019 in fact the concept of selective reservoir withdrawal was not new many reservoirs in the united states have been operated using a selective withdrawal since the 1970 s and 1980 s with selective withdrawal the world s largest dam the tgd caused a monthly mean rwt decrease of 1 03 c in the downstream river during spring and summer while an increase of approximately 2 41 c in the rest of the year cai et al 2018 which was rather limited compared with the danjiangkou dam in addition this work investigated the extent of thermal impacts it was estimated that a length of at least 20 km downstream river was thermally influenced although the exact affected reach was not fully known due to the limited coverage of satellite image it was likely to persist for a long distance as the profiles revealed no clear signs of temperature recovery within the 20 km river stretch fig 4 moreover preece and jones 2002 found the annual temperature only recovered within 1 c 100 km below the keepit dam in australia previous study suggested that it may take 40 930 km for the recovery of longitudinal thermal regime depending on dam characteristics and downstream inputs of lakes groundwater and tributaries olden and naiman 2010 a recent work on thermal regime modelling over danjiangkou reservoir suggested that the recovery distance could be longer than 578 km in summer chen et al 2016 the extent of thermal impacts could be identified by integration of more images in the future work 5 2 ecological implications temperature is a key factor for aquatic ecosystems this work found that the danjiangkou dam has caused a cooling effect on the downstream han river compared with the reservoir which was further intensified after the heightening of dam it was noted that as for ecological restoration purpose it was better to compare the temperature between the river before the dam and the river after the dam vinson 2001 preece and jones 2002 however the river temperature prior to dam closure was not available in order to obtain the natural pre dam river temperature the temperatures of han river 168 km upstream of the dam were used which was supposed not to be affected by surface heating effect of the reservoir the river temperatures were estimated and compared with those in the downstream river based on 84 landsat imageries where the two locations were cloud free two 3 3 windows locating at the river channel 6 km downstream and 168 km upstream from the dam were used to compute the mean water temperature by averaging values of 9 pixels it was found that the upstream river temperatures were higher than these of the downstream by 2 8 and 3 9 c in spring and summer and slightly lower by 1 4 and 1 2 c in autumn and winter it was suggested that the dam still posed considerable impacts on the thermal regime of downstream river in terms of ecological implications the temperature alterations have affected aquatic ecosystems over a broad temporal and spatial domains sherman et al 2007 although there was little detailed information on thermal requirements of most aquatic organisms in the han river some information for spawning of several native fish species e g ffcc was available which was used to discuss the potential ecological impact arising from the danjingkou dam the minimum temperature threshold for spawning of these species is 18 c and the breeding period runs from late may to early august shi and huang 2009 according to our results this period was right within the months when the dam posed the strongest cooling impact on the river table 3 as such the river water temperature may be below suitable thresholds for the ffcc it was reported that the spawning of ffcc was delayed by 20 30 days due to the postponed timing of spring summer warming caused by the operation of danjingkou dam shi and huang 2009 a recent assessment of spawning opportunities suggested that the dam may also result in a reduction of spawning sites and the optimal spawning locations moving downstream from huangjiagang 6 km to xiangyang 111 km due to the release of unseasonably cold water during spring and summer chen et al 2016 with the heightening of dam in 2013 a stronger cooling effect was exerted on the downstream river during this ecologically critical period fig 6 table 3 which may suggest that the spawning sites could be further threatened thus far certain technical solutions e g multi level intake structures or floating intakes olden and naiman 2010 were suggested to be adapted to allow the release of water from different depths to produce a discharge with desired thermal characteristics 5 3 satellite based water temperature estimation the accuracy of satellite derived water temperature is crucial in the understanding of thermal alterations associated with dam operation in this work the derived water temperatures were compared with in situ observations to assess the accuracy of temperature estimation the linear regression analysis was carried out to assess the correlation of water temperature estimates with observed data quality of the correlation was evaluated by calculating the root mean square error rmse and bias between the estimated and observed values fig 8 showed the plot of estimated water surface temperature and measured temperature at the reservoir and the downstream river most scatter points were located around the 1 1 line the satellite based temperature estimates were slightly negatively biased 0 03 c above the 1 1 line suggesting a small underestimation of water temperatures the correlation coefficient r2 was 0 97 and the rmse was 1 14 c indicating a high accuracy of water temperature estimation in all seasons it was noted that the reliability of obtained thermal impacts could be better than this accuracy level because systematic errors associated with landsat estimates can be largely eliminated through the difference of water temperatures between the reservoir and downstream river the obtained accuracy was also consistent with those of similar studies for example lamaro et al 2013 reported an rmse of 1 0 c when estimating water temperatures of the río tercero reservoir in argentina using landsat 7 etm thermal images ling et al 2017 obtained an accuracy of 1 07 c rmse from the landsat etm thermal band demonstrating the effectiveness of rtm algorithm for estimating water temperature more recently prats et al 2018 reported an overall rmse of 1 2 c for the satellite derived temperatures over french inland water bodies from landsat archives understanding of dam induced impacts on long term riverine thermal regimes is challenging largelydue to the paucity and appropriateness of water temperature data olden and naiman 2010 the use of landsat tir images to derive high accuracy water surface temperatures has allowed to reconstruct the historical spatially resolved thermal information which made the assessment of dam associated thermal impacts possible however a major limitation of tir remote sensing is the obstruction by clouds which makes temperature measurements unavailable for example the phenomenon of strong summer cooling was not observed in some years i e 2003 and 2012 due to the lack of images in summer the use of long term observations can partly tackle this problem and is able to capture both seasonal and inter annual patterns of thermal impacts in addition although the satellites have a 16 day cycle the images were not evenly collected over each month or season in different years due to cloud coverage fig 2 this may introduce biases when comparing monthly or seasonal thermal impacts among various years nevertheless tir remote sensing is currently the best way to obtain the long term spatially distributed temperature data in the future the inclusion of more tir images from other satellite platforms may partly solve the problem although this study considered the danjiangkou dam in china the findings are presumably similar for other dammed reservoirs across the world given the similar climate condition and comparable design and construction of these dams furthermore the techniques used in this work can be easily extended to the global scale to investigate thermal effects of various large dams with readily available datasets the outputs could help understand the extent and magnitude of dam associated thermal alterations and thus provide reference for the assessment of impacts of human activities on the long term health and stability of river ecosystem 6 conclusion this paper has investigated the long term impact of danjiangkou dam 2002 2017 on thermal regimes of the downstream han river china using 158 landsat tir imageries with an emphasis on the influence of dam heightening it was found that the dam had a seasonal cycle of cooling impact on the downstream river the most pronounced cooling effect was found in summer seasons with mean temperature drop of 6 01 c moderate cooling effects were detected in the spring and autumn with mean temperature drop of 1 23 c and 2 76 c respectively while no significant impact was observed in winters the seasonal cycle of thermal impacts was likely attributed to the seasonal pattern of thermal stratification formed in the dammed reservoir longitude thermal profile analysis suggested that the thermal alteration affected a length of 20 km downstream river and likely to impact for a longer distance our analysis indicated that the heightening of dam enhanced these thermal impacts especially with a stronger cooling effect in summer and a longer cooling duration which may be significant to the ecology of the downstream river especially with respect to the delay of ffcc spawning or the reduction and downstream shift of spawning sites our results also revealed considerable inter annual variability in its thermal impact on the downstream river which highlighted dangers in generalizing the effects of impoundments on the basis of a few years of records the inter annual variation can largely be explained by varying reservoir water levels associated with dam operation and dam heightening and tributary inflows and water diversion projects it can also be concluded from this study that the use of landsat tir imageries to derive high accuracy water surface temperature is allowed to reconstruct the historical temporal and spatial thermal patterns and made the assessment of the long term thermal impacts of dam on the downstream river possible the output of this paper could provide reference for the assessment of the impacts of human activities on the long term health and stability of the han river ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement jiayang zhao methodology formal analysis writing original draft hui li

5226,this work quantified the long term 2002 2017 impacts of the danjiangkou dam china on the thermal regimes of downstream han river using landsat thermal infrared imageries with an emphasis on the effect of dam heightening the accuracy assessment of satellite derived temperatures indicated a root mean square error of 0 95 c suggesting an accurate retrieval of water temperature the long term analysis detected a seasonal cycle of thermal impacts with strong cooling in summer moderate cooling in spring and autumn whereas no significant changes in winter the cycle was likely attributed to the seasonal thermal stratification in the dammed reservoir the analysis also revealed a pronounced year to year variability in the thermal impacts this was especially the case after the heightening of dam in 2013 which led to a stronger cooling effect and a longer cooling duration the inter annual variability can be largely explained by the varying reservoir water levels associated with dam operation and dam heightening as well as tributary inflows and water diversion projects the longitudinal thermal profile analysis suggested at least a length of 20 km downstream river was thermally affected the cooling effects may be significant to the aquatic ecosystems of downstream river especially with respect to the delay of famous four species of chinese carp spawning or the reduction and downstream shift of spawning sites the findings provide new scientific understandings about the long term seasonal thermal regimes of dammed rivers and the techniques can be extended to the global scale to investigate thermal effects of large dams keywords river water temperature danjiangkou dam thermal infrared remote sensing thermal impact cooling effect 1 introduction river water temperature rwt is one of the most important physical variables of streams and rivers it strongly influences physical chemical and biological properties of water governs most of the chemical and biochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems webb et al 2008 martí cardona et al 2019 hence understanding the thermal condition of rivers is critical for water quality issues and aquatic ecosystem health previous studies have shown that the rwt was affected by both large scale climate changes schneider and hook 2010 vliet et al 2011 and local scale human induced perturbations e g dam construction deforestation

alteration as two thirds of the world s major rivers have been disrupted with more than 50 000 dams lehner et al 2011 considerable works have been carried out to understand thermal impacts of large dams on downstream rivers in different climatic settings around the world such as the keepit dam in australia preece and jones 2002 the multi purpose dams in the willamette river basin steel and lange 2007 and the glen canyon dam wright et al 2009 in u s a the paso de las piedras dam casado et al 2013 in argentina the geheyan dam and gaobazhou dam ling et al 2017 and the three gorges dam tgd cai et al 2018 in china the previous studies have demonstrated that changes occurred to all aspects of the river thermal condition including the magnitude of thermal impacts the delay in the annual cycle of temperature the frequency and duration of temperature extremes and the extent of thermal alterations thus far we generally have a clear understanding of dam induced thermal impacts however most of these works were conducted either on a seasonal basis or over a few years cycle while such seasonal studies are informative for descriptive purposes year round perspectives are critical to understand the biological response associated with the thermal modification of habitat environments olden and naiman 2010 in addition the short term analysis is not adequate to assess the impact of dams over time in response to such factors as variations in climate conditions from year to year and changes in dam operation strategies webb and walling 1996 vinson 2001 a long term assessment of dam induced thermal impacts and full characterization of downstream thermal regimes would be challenging using traditional techniques such as sampling and modelling the former has been limited by sparse sampling of temperatures in both space and time and hence cannot provide the detailed information on spatial temperature patterns necessary for understanding the dam associated thermal effects ling et al 2017 in addition long term river temperature records may be unavailable or publicly inaccessible in most regions of the world olden and naiman 2010 temperature models were thus introduced to predict riverine thermal conditions the models typically require significant model development parameter estimation and computational cost making application of models over large scale domain difficult niemeyer et al 2018 conversely the thermal infrared tir remote sensing provides a powerful tool to acquire long term spatially distributed temperature measurements over a large spatial extent handcock et al 2006 several satellite sensors have been deployed to collect thermal emission data for example the thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper etm and thermal infrared sensor tirs onboard the landsat platforms offer for more than 40 years the continuous tir imageries with relatively fine spatial resolutions 120 to 60 m numerous studies have utilized landsat tir imageries to characterize thermal patterns in lakes and reservoirs martí cardona et al 2008 schneider and hook 2010 prats et al 2018 in case of rivers a minimum width of three pixels is suggested to reduce the effect of near bank reflected radiance in order to obtain reliable temperature estimates handcock et al 2006 martí cardona et al 2019 hence the landsat tir imagery has been used to estimate water surface temperatures in large rivers wawrzyniak and poirel 2012 lalot et al 2015 ling et al 2017 martí cardona et al 2019 these studies also indicated that the accuracies of derived temperatures from tir images varied from 1 to 2 c lamaro et al 2013 prats et al 2018 the danjiangkou dam across the han river china was the focus of this study the dam was completed in 1974 and was heightened in 2013 to increase the water storage capacity of impounded reservoir as it was selected as the water source for the strategic middle route project of the south north water transfer project snwtp zhang et al 2009 despite the vital importance for water supply and large capacity of the impoundment the dam induced flow and thermal alterations have threatened the biodiversity and ecosystem functions in the downstream han river it was reported that the population of famous four species of chinese carp ffcc in the middle reaches of han river was reduced sharply from 1970 s xie et al 2009 the increase of water level and extraction of surface water altered the thermal structure of reservoir posing further threats on the aquatic ecosystems in the downstream river previous studies on danjiangkou dam have mainly focused on the flow and sediment alterations wang et al 2015 qian et al 2016 song et al 2018 lu et al 2018 few works were conducted to investigate the thermal impact on the downstream river chen et al 2016 examined the thermal structure changes in the danjiangkou reservoir and the downstream river using a multi model approach while their study improved our understanding of the impacts of dam on the general thermal regime of the reservoir and downstream river there was still limited information available on the long term impacts of the dam in addition little work has addressed the effect of dam heightening on the downstream thermal conditions while this information could provide important reference for the assessment of the dam heightening project on the long term health and stability of river ecosystem therefore the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the long term 2002 2017 impact of danjiangkou dam on the thermal regimes of the downstream han river using landsat tir imageries the specific objectives of this study are 1 to provide a long term and season round perspective of thermal impacts of danjiangkou dam on the downstream river 2 to quantify the effect of dam heightening on the thermal alteration of the downstream river 3 to discuss the ecological implications associated with riverine thermal regime alterations in particular for the spawning of ffcc 2 study area the danjiangkou dam is located at about 650 km upstream of the han river fig 1 the han river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river with a length of 1 577 km and a catchment of 159 000 km2 joining the yangtze river mainstream at wuhan in hubei province the basin is affected by the east asian monsoon and characterized by a subtropical warm and wet climate with hot and humid summers and mild winters liu et al 2018 the average annual temperature is 15 17 c and the annual precipitation ranges from approximately 700 mm in the north hilly regions to 1 200 mm in the southern plains and 75 of the annual precipitation falls from may to october pan et al 2018 the reservoir is supplied by two major tributaries the upper han river and the dan river with a drainage area of approx 95 200 km2 zhang et al 2009 it typically gets water from april to july with an average annual inflow of about 38 80 km3 the inflow of dan river is much less than that of han river as the catchment area of dan river is 1 10 of han river the depth and width of the han river below the dam are around 7 m and over 450 m wide enough for the retrieval of rwt using landsat tir images the danjiangkou dam is a deep release dam with an elevation of 162 m above sea level creating one of the largest reservoirs in asia as the reservoir served as the water source for the snwtp it was heightened to 176 6 m in 2013 leading to an increase in the storage capacity from 17 45 km3 to 29 05 km3 liu et al 2018 the surface area of reservoir was expanded from 745 km2 to 1050 km2 with a maximum water depth of approximately 80 m pan et al 2018 the snwtp delivered a volume of 9 5 km3 of water each year to beijing tianjing and other cities along the water transfer route zhang et al 2009 in addition the ebei water transfer project ewtp was developed in 2015 which extracted another 1 4 km3 of water per year from the reservoir chen et al 2016 the reservoir was normally discharged through the hypolimnion by power tunnels while in flood seasons the overflow weir was also used to release a part of the flood peak the bottom elevations of power tunnels overflow weir and snwtp water intake were 115 0 m 138 m and 140 m respectively chen et al 2016 prior to these projects the dam was operated with a seasonal mode leading to seasonal fluctuations in the water level of reservoir fig 2 afterwards the operation was changed by reducing release rates to conserve water for diversion resulting in an increase of average water level by 10 m and a decrease of seasonal water level variation fig 2 the reservoir was approximately isothermal from november to march before the seasonal stratification began in april with heating of the surface layer chen et al 2016 3 materials and methods 3 1 data source landsat series tir images were used for the retrieval of water surface temperatures including these from tm etm and tirs the tm sensor on landsat 5 recorded the thermal emission in band 6 10 4 12 5 µm with a spatial resolution of 120 m the etm sensor on board landsat 7 has a unique thermal band band 6 which is divided into low gain band b6l and high gain band b6h with a spatial resolution of 60 m and a spectral resolution from 10 4 to 12 5 µm the b6l was used in this work because its range was larger and not saturated chander et al 2009 the tirs on landsat 8 collected thermal data in bands 10 and 11 with spectrum centred at roughly 10 9 and 12 µm and a spatial resolution of 100 m only band 10 was used as band 11 was affected by stray light effects barsi et al 2014 cloud free images of path 125 and row 39 were collected from 2002 to 2017 which resulted in 158 scenes corresponding to reservoir levels from 134 m to 168 m fig 2 it was noted that the cloud free image here referred to the image with no cloud above the study area rather than the entire image all images were level 1t products with precision and terrain correction and were projected into the utm zone 49n with wgs datum the measured water temperature data were collected from the danjiangkou and huangjiagang hydrological station to validate the water temperature estimates the former station is situated at the reservoir right upstream of the dam while the latter is located at the han river 6 km downstream of the dam the temperature was measured at 8 00 a m local time at a depth of 50 cm daily water temperature data at the two stations in 2009 2012 were obtained from yearbooks during this period there were 29 cloud free images available including 9 images in spring 8 in summer 4 in autumn and 8 in winter hence 58 temperature match ups for the two stations were used in the validation the daily water level of reservoir observed at danjiangkou hydrological station was collected it was used to investigate the relationship between the water level and the thermal impacts the data covered the period from january 2002 to december 2017 fig 2 3 2 method the long term impact of danjiangkou dam on thermal regimes of downstream han river was investigated using the time series landsat tir images which consisted of three steps including pure water pixels mask water temperature retrieval and thermal impact analysis a modified water index was employed to produce the water only image which was used to retrieve water surface temperatures the longitudinal profiles of river temperature were constructed to examine the magnitude and extent of thermal impacts water temperature differences wtds between the upstream reservoir and downstream river were calculated to examine the variability in annual and seasonal thermal influences on the downstream river 3 2 1 pure water pixels mask pure water pixels were identified for water temperature retrieval from tir images the modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 calculated from the green and shortwave infrared bands was employed to separate water from non water pixels the water pixels were masked by setting a proper threshold on each of the mndwi images the threshold was determined through trial and error method the generated binary water no water masks were then converted into vector polygons only the pixels in the thermal infrared band that were fully included in the water polygon were considered as water which were used to derive the water temperature additionally the river centreline was extracted based on the water polygon which was used to construct the longitudinal profile of river temperatures 3 2 2 water temperature retrieval various algorithms have been developed to retrieve water surface temperatures from tir images in the case of landsat platform the single channel method was the only suitable method as there was only one thermal band in tm and etm tir images one of the most popular single channel algorithms was based on the radiative transfer model rtm which involved radiometric calibration atmospheric correction and conversion of water surface radiance to water surface temperature lamaro et al 2013 lamaro et al 2013 compared this method with a generalized single channel method developed by jiménez muñoz and sobrino 2003 for retrieving water surface temperature from landsat 7 etm thermal bands it was found that the rtm yielded better results when compared against the in situ observations hence it was employed in this work radiometric calibration was necessary in order to compare data from the same sensor over time or between sensors lamaro et al 2013 the radiometric calibration was carried out to obtain the at sensor spectral radiance which was performed based on the digital number dn values of the image by applying the gain and bias coefficients given as follows irish et al 2006 1 l λ g a i n d n b i a s where l λ is the at sensor spectral radiance at λ wavelength in w m 2 s r m m gain and bias are calibration parameters of the sensors for landsat 5 and landsat 7 low gain thermal bands gain is set to be 0 055376 and 0 067087 and bias is set to be 1 18 and 0 07 respectively chander et al 2009 for landsat 8 the values of two parameters are variable which can be found in the header file of product avdan and jovanovska 2016 atmospheric correction was a crucial step for satellite derived water temperatures it was reported that atmospheric effects can cause a difference of up to 4 55 k between bulk water temperature and uncorrected satellite derived estimates considering a constant water emissivity lamaro et al 2013 therefore the atmospheric correction should be conducted to remove these effects from reflected downward and upward radiances the atmospheric correction was performed based on the radiative transfer equation srivastava et al 2009 which was given as follows 2 l λ t s l λ l λ up t ε λ 1 ε λ ε λ l λ down where l λ t s is the corrected water surface radiance l λ is the at sensor spectral radiance calculated in equation 1 l λ up is the upwelling atmospheric radiance l λ down is the downwelling atmospheric radiance t is the atmospheric transmissivity and ε λ is water emissivity the atmospheric parameters l λ up t and l λ down can be calculated from in situ radiosoundings or using a radiative transfer codes like modtran moderate resolution atmospheric transmission as the in situ radiosoundings launched simultaneously with the satellite passes were not available atmospheric parameters were estimated from atmospheric correction parameter calculator http www atmcorr gsfc nasa gov which was based on modtran model barsi et al 2003a barsi et al 2003b according to simon et al 2014 the water emissivity ε λ was set to be 0 9885 finally the water temperature was retrieved based on the corrected water surface radiance l λ t s using planck s function which was determined by 3 t s k 2 ln k 1 l λ t s 1 where t s is the water temperature k k 1 and k 2 are sensor specified thermal constants which can be found in table 1 for thermal bands of landsat 5 landsat 7 and landsat 8 3 2 3 thermal impact analysis water surface temperature maps were generated to illustrate thermal patterns of study area in different seasons once water temperatures were retrieved in order to highlight the thermal impacts the longitudinal profile of river temperatures was derived using the bilinear interpolation technique the profile was plotted and analysed against the distance to the dam to reveal both the magnitude and extent of thermal impacts in different seasons the wtds between the upstream reservoir and downstream river were used to demonstrate the variability in annual and seasonal thermal influences for this purpose two 3 3 windows locating at the reservoir and downstream river channel were selected to compute the mean water temperature by averaging values of 9 pixels which were about 0 5 and 6 km from the dam respectively fig 1 although spatial resolutions of tir bands varied among landsat series images they were resampled to 30 m by the data provider hence the window size was uniform for all the tir images the wtds were calculated by subtracting the mean water temperature of downstream river from that of the reservoir hence a positive value represented net cooling downstream from the dam while a negative value represented net warming it was noted that since the collected landsat images were not evenly distributed within each season due to cloud coverage fig 2 only the years with at least one image in each of the four seasons were used for the long term analysis in the analysis we assumed each season lasted three months and the spring runs from march to may as the study area is situated in the subtropical zone of north hemisphere thereafter seasonal and inter annual variability of thermal impacts were analysed using the long term wtds time series 4 results 4 1 seasonal thermal pattern the historical water surface temperatures were reconstructed for the study area using 158 landsat thermal images spanning from 2002 to 2017 fig 3 was a typical example of derived water temperatures in each of the four seasons in 2016 these maps provided spatially distributed thermal measurements across the study area and clearly showed the varying thermal patterns in the reservoir and downstream river over different seasons in spring an obvious temperature decline was identified in the river below the dam which was enhanced in summer with the largest temperature contrast occurred later the temperature discrepancy gradually decreased which was still obvious in autumn it was continued to reduce until no clear difference was observed in winter the figure also illustrated that there were no significant water temperature changes along the downstream river the seasonal thermal impacts can be highlighted by the longitudinal profile of river temperatures fig 4 showed the corresponding four profiles of river temperatures in 2016 each profile was approximately 24 km in length including 4 km in the reservoir and 20 km in the downstream river the profiles disclosed unique information regarding thermal gradients in the reservoir and the river according to the profiles the magnitude of thermal impacts varied significantly among the four seasons a sharp decrease of temperature was evident below the dam in summer with the water temperature decreased by up to approximately 10 c on june 27th notable river water temperature declines were also visible in spring and autumn which ranged from about 3 c to 4 c however the profile of winter did not exhibit a consistent pattern with those of the other three seasons which dropped very slightly below the dam suggesting the limited thermal impact the extent of thermal impacts can also be identified from the analysis of profiles for all the profiles the downstream river temperature remained stable for at least 20 km with no signs of significant recovery the profile analysis confirmed our previous observations of seasonal thermal impacts 4 2 seasonal and annual variability fig 5 illustrated the long term wtds and annual mean wtds between the upstream reservoir and downstream river during the period of 2002 2017 it clearly exhibited a strong seasonal cycle of thermal impacts on the downstream river the largest wtds were found in summer seasons with values up to 10 c 2016 while the lowest wtds were observed in winters with values around 0 c the spring and autumn had the moderate wtds values in addition considerable inter annual variations in thermal impacts can be detected as well the largest wtds prior to dam heightening 2002 to 2014 occurred in summer seasons with values fluctuating around 6 c while these values were increased up to 10 c after the heightening 2015 to 2017 even during the period of 2002 2014 the wtds in summer varied from 4 c 2007 to 9 c 2005 the annual mean wtds pre dam heightening fluctuated around 2 c which was increased to about 4 c afterwards revealing the impact of dam heightening it was noted that in some years e g 2003 and 2012 the peak wtds were found much lower than 4 c which was likely due to the lack of images in summer seasons because of cloud coverage these seasonal cycles and inter annual variations in thermal impacts can be better presented in table 2 which summarized the long term seasonal average wtds between the reservoir and downstream river from the table a general cooling effect of the dam on the downstream river was identified for all the seasons however the magnitude of cooling effects varied the strongest cooling occurred in summer with the temperature drop ranging from 3 08 c to 9 22 c and an average of 6 01 c followed by the moderate cooling in spring and autumn with the average drops of 2 76 c and 1 23 c respectively and then was winter with the average drop of 0 17 c showing the slightest cooling effect overall an average annual temperature decrease of 2 57 c in the downstream river was found it was worth mentioning that the cooling may pose significant adverse influences on the aquatic ecosystems in the downstream river particularly during the ecologically important later spring and summer period in short these results suggested that the danjiangkou dam had exerted seasonal cooling influences on the downstream river the long term satellite observations revealed considerable year to year variability in the dam induced thermal impacts table 2 the annual average wtds were generally less than 3 c during the pre dam heightening period of 2002 2014 which were increased to larger than 3 c afterwards suggesting an intensified cooling exerted by the dam heightening however an exception was found in the year of 2009 which showed the annual wtds of 2 97 c with largest wtds in both spring and summer season during 2002 2014 to summarize the analysis indicated that the considerable variations in the magnitude of the cooling impact of dam among individual years has been identified which highlighted dangers in generalizing the effects of dam on the basis of a few years of records 4 3 effect of dam heightening fig 6 and table 3 showed the monthly mean wtds pre 2002 2014 and post dam heightening 2015 2017 period based on the satellite observations it indicated that both the shape and the magnitude of wtds pattern were changed after the heightening of dam fig 6 the monthly peak wtds prior to the heightening of dam occurred in june with the value of 5 56 c which was shifted to august with the value of 8 85 c after the heightening with particularly strong differences in wtds occurring from june to september hence a two month lag of peak wtds was identified compared with the pre heightening condition prior to the heightening of dam little temperature alterations less than 1 c were found for five months from october to the next february while those were observed within four months from december to the next march after the heightening significant cooling impacts larger than 5 c lasted for two months june to july before the heightening compared with that of four months may to august after the heightening notably three out of these four months were observed with wtds larger than 8 c which may be a significant threat on the stability of river ecosystem it was noted that a tiny warming effect was observed in february before the heightening which was slightly enhanced by 0 21 c after the heightening meanwhile the cooling effects were intensified in the remaining months with temperature drop ranging from 0 06 to 5 59 c table 3 to summarize the danjiangkou dam caused a slightly warming effect in february and a cooling effect for the remaining months of a year while the heightening of dam enhanced both the warming and cooling effects especially with a stronger cooling effect and a longer cooling duration in summer seasons 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal and annual variability in thermal impacts the seasonal thermal impacts primarily depend on the stratification characteristics of dammed reservoir previous studies have suggested that seasonal patterns of thermal stratification are usually formed in deep reservoirs due to seasonal variations of solar radiation angilletta et al 2008 niemeyer et al 2018 in spring increased surface energy fluxes tend to create a layer of warmer water at the reservoir surface floating on top of colder water at depth leading to the onset of stratification nürnberg 2007 with the enhancement of solar radiation in summer upper layers of water are intensely heated and cooler waters remain underneath in the hypolimnion resulting in an extremely stratified water column while in autumn the upper layer are gradually cooled and the thermal stratification reduces and may disappear in winter due to fully mixing by convection niemeyer et al 2018 the danjiangkou reservoir is a deep reservoir located in the subtropical area favouring the development of seasonal thermal stratification hence the water released from the hypolimnion would seasonally alter the thermal regimes in the downstream river our results indicated a seasonal cycle of thermal impacts exerting on the river with the most pronounced thermal alteration occurred in summer while moderate in spring and autumn and least pronounced detected during the winter fig 5 table 3 thus far our results were consistent with the previous findings on characteristics of seasonal thermal stratification in deep reservoirs and the seasonal variability in thermal impacts was due to the seasonal thermal stratification in the reservoir moreover thermal impacts identified from the present study agreed with the results from other large deep release dams for example the annual maximum daily temperature of the naomi river immediately downstream of keepit dam in australia was reduced by 5 c preece and jones 2002 in argentina the mean daily temperature in sauce grande river was decreased by 3 c in summer immediately below the paso de las piedras dam casado et al 2013 similarly the summer temperature in the qingjiang river china dropped by 5 c following the geheyan dam ling et al 2017 indeed due to the cooling effects of deep release dams they have been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the influence of global warming null et al 2013 the magnitude in the seasonal thermal impacts is associated with the water level of reservoir the increased water level can affect the thermal stratification characteristics by weakening the heat exchange with the bottom water body niemeyer et al 2018 fig 7 showed the relations of wtds and the water level of reservoir in different months positive relationships were identified in summer months may to august during this period of year the reservoir was characterized by the strongest stratification with warm water in the surface and cold water in the bottom hence the higher water level reduced heat transfer from the upper to bottom waters leading to even larger wtds in other months of the year relationships between wtds and the water level were more scattered during these months the reservoir was approximately isothermal chen et al 2016 and therefore the higher water level did not significantly affect the heat exchange in the water column this may explain the intensified cooling effect in the downstream river associated with the heightening of dam which increased the average water level of reservoir by about 10 m fig 2 similarly the large seasonal wtds in 2009 was likely due to the high water level in that year while the low peak wtds in some year e g 2013 was likely caused by the lower water level in that summer fig 2 in short the influence of reservoir water level on discharge temperatures was seasonally dependent i e the water level was more influential in the months when the reservoir was stratified while it was less influential when the reservoir was isothermal additionally another obvious impact of higher water level was a two month lag of peak wtds compared with the pre heightening condition fig 6 the higher water level associated with dam heightening increased the volume of cold hypolimnion and thus reduced the vertical heat transfer leading to a delay in the peak wtds the temperature lag was commonly found in the downstream river of a dam for example the annual maximum daily river temperature downstream from keepit dam occurred three weeks later than the pre dam condition preece and jones 2002 moreover the location of the outflow facility may also affect the temperature of releases from stratified reservoirs according to the vertical profiles of pre heightening from chen et al 2016 the withdrawal was located in the reach of the meta and epilimnion during stratification whereas after the heightening the withdrawal can reach hypolimnion under normal years and the metalimnion in low level years thus the volume of withdrawals from the hypolimnion increased leading to an intensified cooling effect in the downstream river overall our analysis suggested that a seasonal pattern of thermal impacts was consistently repeated as a result of seasonal variations in solar radiation with an amplification that was a function of higher water level in the reservoir although the magnitude of thermal impacts was related with the water level in summer seasons it seemed that the relationship was not that strong as the coefficient of determinations ranged between 0 17 and 0 5 in summer and even smaller in other seasons some other factors may also affect the magnitude of thermal impacts apart from variations of solar radiation and water level the thermal inertia and structure of reservoir are also affected by variable inflows and outflows the danjiangkou reservoir is a river fed reservoir serving for multi purposes through water withdrawals from different layers take 2016 2017 as an example an inflow of 43 63 km3 with varying temperatures was received by the reservoir from december 1 2016 to october 31 2017 compared with the reservoir the inflow of han river was warmer in spring by 0 9 c and colder in summer autumn and winter by 1 5 3 7 and 4 1 c measured at the station 216 km upstream of the dam li and hu 1995 as such the inflow water affected the thermal inertia of reservoir and resulted in stronger vertical stratification by forming density currents alavian et al 1992 i e by forming a near surface flow during spring and an underflow during the rest of year it was noted that the dan river inflow and the north western basin of the reservoir were much colder in spring autumn and winter fig 3 although the inflow of dan river was much less than that of han river it seemed that the river brought a lot of cold water into the reservoir system hence the seasonal variations of inflow temperature matter a lot which should be carefully monitored for future work in addition the schemes of water withdrawal were also important in determining thermal stratification in reservoirs during this period the snwtp delivered 4 49 km3 of water from the epilimnion while another 33 72 km3 was discharged to the downstream river through the hypolimnion the remaining 5 km3 was stored in the reservoir kerimoglu and rinke 2013 have shown that a withdrawal from the epilimnion increased the thermal stratification of reservoir by reducing heat transfer in the water column leading to stronger thermal stability while a hypolimnetic withdrawal was found to weaken the stratification of water body resulting in thermal instability nürnberg 2007 the strength of thermal stratification may lead to the release of even colder water it was noted that the amounts of river inflow the fraction and timing of hydropower withdrawal at 115 m and overflow at 138 m are crucial for the resulting mixed temperature and the cooling effect of the dam operations which may vary seasonally and inter annually posing further influences on the thermal structure of reservoir overall the river inflow and water withdrawal affected the thermal inertia and vertical thermal structure of danjiangkou reservoir in a complex way leading to additional influences on the thermal regimes of downstream han river to quantify these effects considerable gauging data and complex models were required weber et al 2017 which may be the focus of future work to summarize the significant inter annual variability in the thermal impacts of danjiangkou dam was due to many different mechanisms including year to year changes in reservoir water levels associated with dam operations and dam heightening tributary inflows as well as water diversion projects while thermal stratification and variable flows are inevitable the design of a dam also plays an important role in determining the thermal regime of downstream river dams are usually equipped with different outlets that discharges can be made from if the water outlet facilities are located close to the surface the downstream river temperature will be warmer than the pre dam condition due to surface heating of reservoir lessard and hayes 2003 for dams with the outlet in the bottom such as the case in this study the released cold water will reduce the temperature of downstream river given thermal stratification occurs for dams equipped with multiple depth outlet devices a selective withdrawal can be made from different layers of reservoir creating a discharge with desirable water temperature weber et al 2019 in fact the concept of selective reservoir withdrawal was not new many reservoirs in the united states have been operated using a selective withdrawal since the 1970 s and 1980 s with selective withdrawal the world s largest dam the tgd caused a monthly mean rwt decrease of 1 03 c in the downstream river during spring and summer while an increase of approximately 2 41 c in the rest of the year cai et al 2018 which was rather limited compared with the danjiangkou dam in addition this work investigated the extent of thermal impacts it was estimated that a length of at least 20 km downstream river was thermally influenced although the exact affected reach was not fully known due to the limited coverage of satellite image it was likely to persist for a long distance as the profiles revealed no clear signs of temperature recovery within the 20 km river stretch fig 4 moreover preece and jones 2002 found the annual temperature only recovered within 1 c 100 km below the keepit dam in australia previous study suggested that it may take 40 930 km for the recovery of longitudinal thermal regime depending on dam characteristics and downstream inputs of lakes groundwater and tributaries olden and naiman 2010 a recent work on thermal regime modelling over danjiangkou reservoir suggested that the recovery distance could be longer than 578 km in summer chen et al 2016 the extent of thermal impacts could be identified by integration of more images in the future work 5 2 ecological implications temperature is a key factor for aquatic ecosystems this work found that the danjiangkou dam has caused a cooling effect on the downstream han river compared with the reservoir which was further intensified after the heightening of dam it was noted that as for ecological restoration purpose it was better to compare the temperature between the river before the dam and the river after the dam vinson 2001 preece and jones 2002 however the river temperature prior to dam closure was not available in order to obtain the natural pre dam river temperature the temperatures of han river 168 km upstream of the dam were used which was supposed not to be affected by surface heating effect of the reservoir the river temperatures were estimated and compared with those in the downstream river based on 84 landsat imageries where the two locations were cloud free two 3 3 windows locating at the river channel 6 km downstream and 168 km upstream from the dam were used to compute the mean water temperature by averaging values of 9 pixels it was found that the upstream river temperatures were higher than these of the downstream by 2 8 and 3 9 c in spring and summer and slightly lower by 1 4 and 1 2 c in autumn and winter it was suggested that the dam still posed considerable impacts on the thermal regime of downstream river in terms of ecological implications the temperature alterations have affected aquatic ecosystems over a broad temporal and spatial domains sherman et al 2007 although there was little detailed information on thermal requirements of most aquatic organisms in the han river some information for spawning of several native fish species e g ffcc was available which was used to discuss the potential ecological impact arising from the danjingkou dam the minimum temperature threshold for spawning of these species is 18 c and the breeding period runs from late may to early august shi and huang 2009 according to our results this period was right within the months when the dam posed the strongest cooling impact on the river table 3 as such the river water temperature may be below suitable thresholds for the ffcc it was reported that the spawning of ffcc was delayed by 20 30 days due to the postponed timing of spring summer warming caused by the operation of danjingkou dam shi and huang 2009 a recent assessment of spawning opportunities suggested that the dam may also result in a reduction of spawning sites and the optimal spawning locations moving downstream from huangjiagang 6 km to xiangyang 111 km due to the release of unseasonably cold water during spring and summer chen et al 2016 with the heightening of dam in 2013 a stronger cooling effect was exerted on the downstream river during this ecologically critical period fig 6 table 3 which may suggest that the spawning sites could be further threatened thus far certain technical solutions e g multi level intake structures or floating intakes olden and naiman 2010 were suggested to be adapted to allow the release of water from different depths to produce a discharge with desired thermal characteristics 5 3 satellite based water temperature estimation the accuracy of satellite derived water temperature is crucial in the understanding of thermal alterations associated with dam operation in this work the derived water temperatures were compared with in situ observations to assess the accuracy of temperature estimation the linear regression analysis was carried out to assess the correlation of water temperature estimates with observed data quality of the correlation was evaluated by calculating the root mean square error rmse and bias between the estimated and observed values fig 8 showed the plot of estimated water surface temperature and measured temperature at the reservoir and the downstream river most scatter points were located around the 1 1 line the satellite based temperature estimates were slightly negatively biased 0 03 c above the 1 1 line suggesting a small underestimation of water temperatures the correlation coefficient r2 was 0 97 and the rmse was 1 14 c indicating a high accuracy of water temperature estimation in all seasons it was noted that the reliability of obtained thermal impacts could be better than this accuracy level because systematic errors associated with landsat estimates can be largely eliminated through the difference of water temperatures between the reservoir and downstream river the obtained accuracy was also consistent with those of similar studies for example lamaro et al 2013 reported an rmse of 1 0 c when estimating water temperatures of the río tercero reservoir in argentina using landsat 7 etm thermal images ling et al 2017 obtained an accuracy of 1 07 c rmse from the landsat etm thermal band demonstrating the effectiveness of rtm algorithm for estimating water temperature more recently prats et al 2018 reported an overall rmse of 1 2 c for the satellite derived temperatures over french inland water bodies from landsat archives understanding of dam induced impacts on long term riverine thermal regimes is challenging largelydue to the paucity and appropriateness of water temperature data olden and naiman 2010 the use of landsat tir images to derive high accuracy water surface temperatures has allowed to reconstruct the historical spatially resolved thermal information which made the assessment of dam associated thermal impacts possible however a major limitation of tir remote sensing is the obstruction by clouds which makes temperature measurements unavailable for example the phenomenon of strong summer cooling was not observed in some years i e 2003 and 2012 due to the lack of images in summer the use of long term observations can partly tackle this problem and is able to capture both seasonal and inter annual patterns of thermal impacts in addition although the satellites have a 16 day cycle the images were not evenly collected over each month or season in different years due to cloud coverage fig 2 this may introduce biases when comparing monthly or seasonal thermal impacts among various years nevertheless tir remote sensing is currently the best way to obtain the long term spatially distributed temperature data in the future the inclusion of more tir images from other satellite platforms may partly solve the problem although this study considered the danjiangkou dam in china the findings are presumably similar for other dammed reservoirs across the world given the similar climate condition and comparable design and construction of these dams furthermore the techniques used in this work can be easily extended to the global scale to investigate thermal effects of various large dams with readily available datasets the outputs could help understand the extent and magnitude of dam associated thermal alterations and thus provide reference for the assessment of impacts of human activities on the long term health and stability of river ecosystem 6 conclusion this paper has investigated the long term impact of danjiangkou dam 2002 2017 on thermal regimes of the downstream han river china using 158 landsat tir imageries with an emphasis on the influence of dam heightening it was found that the dam had a seasonal cycle of cooling impact on the downstream river the most pronounced cooling effect was found in summer seasons with mean temperature drop of 6 01 c moderate cooling effects were detected in the spring and autumn with mean temperature drop of 1 23 c and 2 76 c respectively while no significant impact was observed in winters the seasonal cycle of thermal impacts was likely attributed to the seasonal pattern of thermal stratification formed in the dammed reservoir longitude thermal profile analysis suggested that the thermal alteration affected a length of 20 km downstream river and likely to impact for a longer distance our analysis indicated that the heightening of dam enhanced these thermal impacts especially with a stronger cooling effect in summer and a longer cooling duration which may be significant to the ecology of the downstream river especially with respect to the delay of ffcc spawning or the reduction and downstream shift of spawning sites our results also revealed considerable inter annual variability in its thermal impact on the downstream river which highlighted dangers in generalizing the effects of impoundments on the basis of a few years of records the inter annual variation can largely be explained by varying reservoir water levels associated with dam operation and dam heightening and tributary inflows and water diversion projects it can also be concluded from this study that the use of landsat tir imageries to derive high accuracy water surface temperature is allowed to reconstruct the historical temporal and spatial thermal patterns and made the assessment of the long term thermal impacts of dam on the downstream river possible the output of this paper could provide reference for the assessment of the impacts of human activities on the long term health and stability of the han river ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement jiayang zhao methodology formal analysis writing original draft hui li

5227,the increased occurrence of flood events resulting from urbanization and global climate change is a great threat to water security to systematically evaluate the impacts of urbanization on floods we applied a paired catchments approach to two adjacent river basins in south central texas the san antonio river basin sarb with fast urbanization and the guadalupe river basin grb with little land cover change a physics based distributed hydrological model the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model embedded with a multi purpose reservoir module dhsvm res was used to simulate streamflow and reservoir storage the simulations were conducted under different land cover scenarios including a newly developed continuous land cover series clcs holistic analyses were then conducted for the paired basins using three methods analyzing the selected flood events detecting change points cp of monthly floods and testing the elasticity of long term flood regimes the results suggest that 1 urbanization may reduce lag time and elevate flood peaks significantly by 3 30 in our study area 2 when there is little land cover change changing climate is the major driver of variations in the monthly maximum streamflow mms 3 fast urbanization can amplify streamflow variability increase mms significantly and thus alter the timing of cp and 4 the mean mms of observed streamflow in the sarb has increased by as much as 75 7 from the pre cp to post cp periods this comprehensive study fills in a gap in our current understanding of the isolated impacts of urbanization on flooding and is expected to support future explorations of anthropogenic influences on floods keywords urbanization paired catchments hydrological modeling changing climate land cover change water security 1 introduction global urbanization exacerbates the negative socioeconomic impacts from severe climatic disasters e g floods and droughts united nations 2009 2011 jha et al 2012 for example urbanization is associated with increasing impervious area and decreasing infiltration which can lead to more frequent and severe flooding cuo 2016 defries and eshleman 2004 jongman 2018 nowak and greenfield 2012 onistephen et al 2015 this directly endangers our societal safety as well as infrastructure stability jha et al 2012 which threatens water security and hinders improvements in water related infrastructure hall and borgomeo 2013 gain et al 2016 yangon 2016 thus it is critical for policymakers to update water management plans and promote water security through evaluating the influence of urbanization on floods winters et al 2015 cross et al 2018 emmett et al 2018 in recent decades the frequency and intensity of various climate extremes have increased substantially alexander et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 donat et al 2013 for example in the united states nine of the top ten most extreme 1 day precipitation events from 1910 to 2015 occurred after 1990 noaa 2019 this intensification of heavy precipitation has also been observed in other parts of the world such as the united kingdom south africa india and japan groisman et al 2005 goswami et al 2006 min et al 2011 westra et al 2013 kunkel frankson 2015 donat et al 2016 some regions have shorter more intense storms compared to other regions which leads to unexpected severe floods recently the hurricane harvey event august 25 31 2017 which was ranked as the second most destructive storm in u s history hurricane katrina being the worst in inflation adjusted costs of 161 billion natsios 2019 resulted in damages of around 125 billion combined with other factors such as urbanization the impacts from intensified climate extremes can be further nonlinearly enhanced thus it is important to understand the mechanism of the hydrological changes under these impacts however while it is imperative to evaluate the distinct impacts of urbanization and the changing climate on flooding to better support decision making in terms of flood control and urban planning such effects are challenging to quantify separately since both climate and land cover affect streamflow it is difficult to separate their effects when a single basin is investigated thus neighboring basins with similar physical characteristics e g climate pattern topography soil texture vegetation but different paces of urbanization are ideal study areas that can be used to isolate the land cover impacts and the climate impacts one of the most common practices used to separate the effects of urbanization and climate is paired catchments analysis ochoa tocachi et al 2016 seibert and mcdonnell 2010 zhao et al 2010 the paired catchments study originated from a forestry study bates henry 1928 and has since been widely used to evaluate the influences of changes in land cover on the magnitudes of water yields bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 ide et al 2013 schelker et al 2013 in recent years this method has also been applied to investigate the effects of urbanization on streamflows burns et al 2005 onistephen et al 2015 putro et al 2016 zégre et al 2010 typically a reference basin and an urbanized basin with similar physical characteristics are selected to isolate the effects of urbanization regression models or conceptual frameworks are usually applied to analyze the results from the paired river basins burns et al 2005 zhao et al 2010a while this approach provides a systematic way to disentangle the combined issues other anthropogenic factors e g reservoir regulation and irrigation schemes may further complicate the analysis and hamper an accurate quantification zégre et al 2010 hence it is necessary to use additional tools and methods to further extract the influence of urbanization on flooding when studying the paired catchments unlike lumped models distributed physics based models can be employed to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the soil and vegetation parameters and the meteorological forcing data giertz et al 2006 such models have a distinct advantage of being able to simulate streamflow under various land use cover change lucc scenarios at high spatial and temporal resolution motta tucci 1984 wigmosta et al 1994 brirhet benaabidate 2016 for example a 2008 study used the mike she model to study the effects of five types of land use changes on streamflow in a korean river basin im et al 2008 cuo et al 2008 employed the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm to study the effects of continuing urbanization on peak flows in a partially urbanized basin in the state of washington zhao et al 2016a compared dhsvm simulations under different historical and projected land cover maps in texas s san antonio river basin and found that urbanization alone had a profound impact on the increased peak streamflow with the availability of coupled hydrologic and reservoir management models e g dhsvm res zhao et al 2016b distributed models can be further used to study areas under significant reservoir regulation that cannot be addressed through conventional natural streamflow only models in addition to the above approaches using detrended climate data coupled with a series of lucc snapshots in time is a commonly adopted modeling approach used to isolate the effects of lucc and climate change variability on streamflow for example detrended daily rainfall was used in the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model to evaluate the relative impacts of climate and land cover changes in the godavari river basin india hengade and eldho 2019 in the andean basins of south america precipitation and streamflow time series datasets which were influenced by the el niño southern oscillation were detrended to disentangle the impacts of climate variability and lucc molina et al 2015 however in these types of studies the results can be easily affected by the uncertainties associated with the selection of the time period overall our current understanding about the isolated influence of urbanization on floods is limited because of two main obstacles the joint effects of urbanization and changing climate are difficult to distinguish and other human induced factors such as reservoir regulation also plays a role kaushal et al 2008 hejazi mohamad markus 2009 with an overarching goal of improving water security our specific objective in this study is to systematically evaluate the impacts of urbanization on flooding by leveraging both paired catchments analysis and physics based distributed hydrological modeling with an embedded multi purpose reservoir module specifically dhsvm res was selected to simulate the hydrological processes due to its explicit urban and reservoir modules and its high spatial and temporal resolutions two adjacent texas river basins one with little lucc and one with considerable urbanization are compared holistically via a stepwise methodology first the flood characteristics e g peak flow and peak time of several observed simulated flood events are analyzed for the paired basins second changes in the monthly flood related variables are studied via a change point detection method killick eckley 2014 third a newly defined elasticity test is conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the flood peak flows to different urban land cover conditions under perturbed precipitation conditions 2 study area texas is the largest state in the contiguous united states conus and its climate is characterized by drastic spatial and temporal variations throughout the state kottek et al 2006 two adjacent river basins in south central texas the san antonio river basin sarb and the guadalupe river basin grb are selected as the study area fig 1 the san antonio river merges into the guadalupe river about 16 km upstream of san antonio bay located adjacent to the gulf of mexico both basins have similar precipitation climatology fig 2 a vegetation types e g grass and shrub and soil types e g clay the characteristics of the paired basins are further compared in fig s1 and table s1 supplementary material both basins are vulnerable to recurring tropical storms including hurricanes due to their geographical proximity to the gulf coast guannel et al 2010 the sarb has a drainage area of 10 826 km2 the elevation of the basin ranges from 4 m to 693 m above sea level and the average annual precipitation was 813 mm from 1966 to 2011 livneh et al 2013 there are six subbasins in the sarb the medina river the leon creek the salado creek the upper san antonio river the cibolo creek and the lower san antonio river subbasins fig 1 the city of san antonio thesecond most populouscity in texas has experienced rapid urbanization the urban population doubled from 0 65 million in 1970 to 1 30 million in 2010 and the impervious area almost tripled from 325 km2 3 0 to 903 km2 8 3 during the same period fig 2b price et al 2006 jin et al 2013 thomas et al 2013 the grb has a drainage area of 15 418 km2 the elevation of the basin ranges from 1 m to 735 m above sea level and the annual average rainfall was 889 mm from 1966 to 2011 livneh et al 2013 the grb consists of four subbasins the upper guadalupe river the san marcos river the middle guadalupe river and the lower guadalupe river subbasins fig 1 in contrast to the sarb the grb only had a population of approximately 0 24 million in 1970 and approximately 0 33 million in 2010 thomas et al 2013 from 1970 to 2010 the impervious area of the grb increased slightly from 93 km2 0 6 to 132 km2 0 9 fig 2b price et al 2006 jin et al 2013 there is a flood control reservoir within the grb canyon lake 29 86 n 98 20 w fig 1 that has been operated at the conservation level since 1968 by the u s army corps of engineers 3 methodology and data 3 1 hydrological model and input data 3 1 1 hydrological model the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model wigmosta et al 1994 with an embedded multi purpose reservoir module dhsvm res zhao et al 2016b was used to simulate the streamflow of the sarb and grb dhsvm res is an open source physics based fully distributed model which computes the energy and water balances at each grid cell the model can be set up at a high spatial resolution e g 10 200 meter and at a sub daily time step e g 1 24 hour which together can facilitate the simulation of flood response in this study dhsvm res was set up at a 200 meter spatial resolution and at a 3 hourly time step from 1965 to 2011 with the first year used for model spin up one of the major advantages of dhsvm res is its explicit urban module cuo et al 2008 coupled with the spatially distributed features of the model the urban module can simulate the flow path from an urban pixel to its nearest river channel for each urban pixel the fraction of impervious area and the fraction of water stored in flood detention are both specified the fraction of impervious area determines the amount of surface runoff which is diverted to detention storage and follows the designed detention process then based on the outflow from detention discharge to the nearest channel is calculated with the support of this module the spatial heterogeneity of the urban sprawl e g denser urbanization along highways can be explicitly simulated another recently added feature of dhsvm is a multi purpose e g flood control water supply reservoir module zhao et al 2016b 2018 the reservoir module consists of three components the evaporation scheme the release scheme and the storage calculation which calculates the overall water balance of the reservoir the reservoir releases water based on prescribed operation rules by incorporating this module during the calibration and validation processes and then removing its effects in the following simulation naturalized flow can be obtained it is a common practice to create naturalized flow for example in döll et al 2009 naturalized flow was computed by removing all reservoirs in the global water model watergap simulation to quantify the impacts of reservoir regulation on streamflow in our study this methodology facilitates the separation of the urbanization impacts from the influences of reservoir flow regulation 3 1 2 input data there are three types of input data for dhsvm res land surface parameters reservoir configurations and meteorological forcing data land surface parameters include elevation soil and land cover data the elevation data digital elevation model dem map was adopted from the shuttle radar topography mission 30 meter resolution product jarvis et al 2008 and was resampled to 200 meter the basin mask was created based on the dem using arcmap 10 3 the flow direction the stream network and the soil depth were generated using the dem and python scripts from duan 2018 soil texture data was obtained from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo nauman et al 2018 land cover data were collected from three sources 1 the united states geological survey usgs national land cover database nlcd which includes nlcd1992 nlcd2001 nlcd2006 and nlcd2011 vogelmann et al 2001 homer et al 2007 fry et al 2011 jin et al 2013 2 the usgs enhanced historical land use and land cover datasets which depict lucc from the 1970s to 1980s referred to as lc1970 hereinafter price et al 2006 and 3 the continuous land cover series clcs which depicts the continuous urban expansion of the city of san antonio for each year from 1984 to 2011 the clcs was generated by combining the baseline map lc1970 with the classified annual urban land cover maps which were derived from annual landsat 5 thematic mapper images the steps of clcs generation are demonstrated in text s1 of the supplementary material reservoir configurations storage elevation and surface area for canyon lake fig 1 were acquired from the texas water development board and were used to derive the reservoir rating curve fig s5 supplementary material the storage capacity of canyon lake 1 5 109 m3 was divided by the u s army corps of engineers into a surcharge pool 1 1 108 m3 a flood control pool 9 1 108 m3 a conservation pool 4 8 108 m3 and an inactive pool 8 7 105 m3 four downstream control points i e new braunfels nbrt2 gonzales gnlt2 cuero cuet2 and victoria vict2 national weather service 2018 with the same channel streamflow limit 340 m3 s were designated to represent the downstream flow control operations the reservoir parameters include the water demand the discharge rate from the reservoir and the flood inflow threshold zhao et al 2016b the monthly water demand data for each reservoir was calculated based on the water rights and water use data which were derived from the texas commission on environmental quality 2017 the discharge rate from the reservoir and the flood inflow threshold were calibrated based on a comparison between the simulated and observed reservoir storage two types of meteorological forcing data observation based and synthetic were utilized in this study both datasets contain a full set of meteorological forcing terms i e air temperature wind speed relative humidity incoming shortwave radiation incoming longwave radiation and precipitation the observation based forcing data were obtained from livneh et al 2013 which are available for the conus at 1 16 spatial resolution and a daily time step from 1915 to 2011 to explore the sole influence of urbanization on flooding an alternative synthetic forcing dataset which does not exhibit any precipitation interannual variability i e having the same annual precipitation each year was created for the sarb 1975 was selected as the representative year for the sarb mainly because the annual mean precipitation in 1975 832 mm was close to the multi year annual mean observed precipitation from 1966 to 2011 813 mm additionally the intra annual precipitation distribution of 1975 is similar to the sarb precipitation climatology when compared to other years moreover there were neither extremely wet nor extremely dry events in 1975 next the cumulative distribution function cdf mapping technique was applied the 1975 daily precipitation was first organized as a look up table during each year the quantile of daily precipitation was determined and then used to identify the corresponding quantile in the 1975 table then it was replaced by the value from the look up table this led to a synthetic forcing dataset that had identical daily precipitation distribution values for each year the concept of this approach is similar to that of the quantile mapping qm method which is widely used to post process downscaled gcm projections wood et al 2002 wood lettenmaier 2006 this method can facilitate the removal of inter annual variations of the precipitation data while preserving its physical characteristics both datasets were then disaggregated to a 3 hourly time step further details about the synthetic forcing data can be found in the supplementary material 3 2 model set up and study design 3 2 1 dhsvm res calibration and validation the calibration and validation processes were conducted for the grb the calibrated parameters for the sarb were adopted from zhao et al 2016a table s4 the calibration was performed individually for each subbasin of the grb from january 1 2001 to december 31 2011 and the simulation was conducted under nlcd2006 using observation based forcing data ten usgs streamflow gauges fig 1 were selected for the two basins based on their locations and the available data lengths calibration based on multiple gauges across the entire river basin can also facilitate the testing of the model s performance and can reduce over fitting issues the calibration of the soil and vegetation parameters was conducted by comparing the simulated streamflow and the simulated monthly maximum streamflow with the observed streamflow at four usgs stations i e usgs 08167500 usgs 08171300 usgs 08173900 and usgs 08175800 based on a sensitivity test zhao et al 2016a streamflow was found to be most sensitive to six soil vegetation parameters lateral hydraulic conductivity maximum infiltration soil porosity wilting point field capacity and monthly leaf area index the reservoir parameters were calibrated afterward by comparing the simulated and observed reservoir storage values three criteria were used for the calibration the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 and the relative bias rb the validation was conducted from january 1 1966 to december 31 2011 by comparing the simulated streamflow with the observed streamflow at usgs 08175800 the simulation was conducted under lc1970 nlcd1992 nlcd2001 nlcd2006 and nlcd2011 using the observation based forcing data the results of the calibration and the validation for the grb are shown in section 4 1 3 2 2 study design the impacts of urbanization on flooding were studied comprehensively through a series of comparative analyses between the paired basins table 1 considering that the change in land cover due to urbanization affects floods in many aspects three sets of analyses were designed first to study the influence of urbanization on the change of flood characteristics i e flood peak peak time the analysis was performed for two specific flood events by comparing the observed and simulated daily mean streamflow q for the paired basins then to study the influence of urbanization on the change of monthly floods e g statistical distribution the distributions of three variables were investigated via change point cp analysis and percentile analysis these three variables are the observed monthly maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation time series rx5day which is an important metric to indicate monthly floods karl et al 1999 peterson et al 2001 wang et al 2017 the observed simulated monthly maximum streamflow time series mms representing the monthly peak streamflow series zhang et al 2011 and the observed simulated monthly maximum naturalized streamflow time series nmms indicating the mms without the impact from reservoir regulation finally to test the sensitivity of the status of long term flood regimes to different urban land covers a newly defined elasticity test was conducted that studied the median of the monthly maximum streamflow time series mms50 the above three steps are explained in detail below first the observed daily mean streamflow qobs and the simulated daily mean streamflow using lc1970 qlc1970 were analyzed for the paired basins over two periods december 1 1986 to january 31 1987 and october 17 2002 to december 1 2002 this analysis is based on the streamflow data from usgs 08175800 and usgs 08188500 which are the main downstream stations of the paired basins respectively for each flood event during the two periods the differences in the peak time and the peak magnitude between qobs and qlc1970 were compared for the paired basins the purpose of using the fixed lc1970 for qlc1970 is to eliminate the effects of urbanization to isolate the influence of the changing climate second the cp detection method killick eckley 2014 was utilized to detect the abrupt changes of the long term underlying distributions of rx5day mms and nmms this method was developed based on a maximum likelihood estimation framework and has been applied to a number of hydrological time series in past studies harder et al 2015 gu et al 2017 li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 sidibe et al 2018 before implementing this method the flood peaks of the historical flood events were analyzed the october 1998 flood peak was the highest peak on record for both the grb and the sarb this flash flood was caused by two hurricanes in the eastern pacific i e hurricane madeline and hurricane lester and a relatively stationary cold front white 2018 national weather service 2019 u s geological survey 2014 thus this extreme event was considered as an outlier which greatly impacted the statistics of the dataset e g mean and standard deviation thus the values of rx5day and the flood peaks in october 1998 were removed from all datasets for both basins at the locations of usgs 08175800 and usgs 08188500 which are the main downstream stations of the paired basins then the cps of rx5day the observed mms mmsobs and the simulated mms under the fixed lc1970 mmslc1970 were calculated for both basins because there are no major reservoirs in the sarb the cp of the simulated nmms under the fixed lc1970 nmmslc1970 was not tested for the sarb after the cp detection percentile analyses were conducted for rx5day mmslc1970 and mmsobs third an elasticity test was conducted for two purposes 1 comparing the elasticity of precipitation between the paired basins and 2 assessing the isolated influence of the progressive urbanization process on mms50 correspondingly there were two sets of simulations processed from 1986 to 2011 to facilitate the elasticity tests 1 the first set was processed under the same fixed land cover map i e lc1970 2 the second set was conducted using the clcs and a single fixed land cover i e ulc1986 for the sarb the elasticity test was originally introduced by schaake 1990 and was designed for evaluating the sensitivity of the annual mean streamflow to changes in annual precipitation a similar but modified test was performed in this study based on simulations that were conducted under different urban land cover scenarios and were forced by a series of perturbed precipitation patterns the elasticity of mms50 is defined as 1 ε p p q d q q d p p where q represents mms50 and p represents the perturbed observed rescaled precipitation in the first set of the elasticity tests the observation based precipitation livneh et al 2013 was perturbed such that the interannual variations of the historical precipitation data could be preserved in the second set of the elasticity tests the rescaled synthetic precipitation was perturbed which is free of the interannual variations resulting from the use of the cdf mapping technique in both sets the precipitation values have been changed by 10 20 and 30 the test was conducted for the entire sarb and focuses on the simulated streamflow at usgs 08188500 however for the grb the elasticity test was only conducted for the san marcos river subbasin fig 1 a subbasin of the grb and the simulated streamflow was targeted at usgs 08173900 this is due to the fact that the main soil type of the upper guadalupe river basin is clay loam fig s1 supplementary material which is different from the major soil types of the other subbasins of the grb and those of the entire sarb the san marcos river subbasin is also representative for the grb in terms of the dem land cover and precipitation distribution for the dem most subbasins are in the region of low elevation except the upper grb and the upper portion of san marcos river subbasin thus the dem for san marcos river subbasin can be representative of the whole grb the san marcos river subbasin contains two major land cover types grass and forest while other subbasins are dominated by just one land cover type forest in the upper grb and grass in the middle grb and lower grb additionally the monthly precipitation distribution in the san marcos river subbasin is almost the same as that of the entire grb 4 results 4 1 dhsvm res calibration and validation the calibration and validation results for the grb are shown in fig 3 the error statistics of the daily calibration for the lower grb suggest that the simulated streamflow is relatively accurate with an r2 of 0 75 an nse of 0 71 and an rb of 0 05 fig 3d however the results for the blanco river gauge station fig 3b are not as good with both the r2 and the nse under 0 60 meanwhile it is observed that the simulated base flows do not agree very well with the observations in some subbasins fig 3b c and d which can be attributed to groundwater discharge from the edwards aquifer close to usgs 08171300 near kyle texas regardless the good agreement of the simulated and observed reservoir storage volume for canyon lake indicates that the reservoir parameters in dhsvm res are robust fig 3f the error statistics of mms were also calculated for both basins and the results show that the simulated mms are relatively accurate with r2 values of 0 84 and 0 78 and nse values of 0 78 and 0 77 for the grb and the sarb respectively the validation results figs 3f and 4 indicate that the calibrated parameters can simulate the daily streamflow and the mms for both basins to evaluate the simulated timing of peak flow events several flood events with similar magnitude to the flood events in fig 5 are selected to calculate the lag time between the observed and simulated peak flow timing results shown in tables s5 and s6 of the supplementary material indicate that the model can accurately simulate the peak time on a daily scale in 43 of the selected events in the sarb and in 68 of those in the grb 4 2 comparisons between sarb and grb 4 2 1 comparisons of streamflow during flood events to evaluate the impacts of urbanization on flood events the flood peak and peak time were compared between qobs and qlc1970 for the paired basins over two selected periods i e december 1 1986 to january 31 1987 october 17 2002 to december 1 2002 a time period during which the two basins had similar precipitation events and similar hydrological responses fig 5 first qobs and qlc1970 were compared from december 1 1986 to january 31 1987 for the grb the peak of qobs was 612 m3 s on december 26 1986 which was 17 smaller than that of qlc1970 on december 25 1986 739 m3 s fig 5a this might be attributed to model uncertainties for the sarb fig 5b the peak of qobs was 303 m3 s on december 27 1986 which was slightly higher and 1 day earlier than qlc1970 295 m3 s peaked on december 28 1986 the impervious area increased from 3 0 in 1970 to 4 9 in 1986 estimated from the clcs which could lead to an acceleration of runoff process resulting in the observed elevation of the flood peak then qobs and qlc1970 in the grb and the sarb were compared from october 17 2002 to december 1 2002 a period which contains two flood events for the grb the first peak of qobs was 668 m3 s on october 28 2002 which was slightly lower than that of qlc1970 761 m3 s on october 27 2002 fig 5c the second peaks of qobs and qlc1970 were 1705 m3 s and 1361 m3 s respectively which both occurred on november 7 2002 fig 5c this can be possibly attributed to model uncertainties and uncertainties associated with the land cover data first the classification algorithms are different for lc1970 and other nlcd products which may add uncertainties to the simulated streamflow second based on the data shown in table s7 supplementary materials the impervious area increased 0 19 from lc1970 to nlcd2001 with a slight decrease in bare ground grassland and forest the higher second peak flow in the qobs compared with qlc1970 could be also related to these land cover changes which were not addressed in the model scenarios for the sarb the first peak of qobs was 484 m3 s on october 28 2002 this is about 20 larger than that of qlc1970 406 m3 s which occurred on october 30 2002 fig 5d the second peak of qobs was 470 m3 s on november 8 2002 which is 30 larger than that of the corresponding qlc1970 363 m3 s on november 10 2002 fig 5d the comparison between fig 5c and fig 5d suggests that urbanization exacerbated the effects of antecedent moisture conditions on floods in the sarb the difference between the second peaks 30 is noticeably larger than that of the first flood peaks 20 when comparing fig 5b and d the difference between the lag times is two days for both flood events in 2002 and only one day for the flood events in 1986 these differences might be attributed to the increase in impervious area i e 6 5 the higher catchment s antecedent moisture content and or the larger flood size in 2002 as compared to 1986 it can be inferred that urbanization effects outweigh the model uncertainty and are apparent in the sarb 4 2 2 change point analysis the results of the detected cps are summarized in table 2 the cps of rx5day were detected in terms of variance and the cps of other variables i e mmsobs mmslc1970 and nmmslc1970 were detected in terms of mean all cps were detected at a significance level of 5 the cps of rx5day were not detected in terms of mean because the variation of mean value of rx5day was relatively small and the cp of the mean value of rx5day was undetectable at a significance level of 5 when comparing the mean variance of the post cp period with the pre cp period for the above four variables the mean variance of the post cp period was larger than that of the pre cp period in all cases table 3 the cps of rx5day were first compared for the paired basins to assess if the two basins had undergone similar climate patterns the cp of rx5day for the grb was in october 1991 which was close to the cp of rx5day for the sarb i e april 1990 this indicates that the rx5day of the two basins share similar change patterns which makes them suitable for paired catchments analysis next the cps of mmsobs and mmslc1970 were detected for these basins for the grb the cps were also in october 1991 for both mmsobs and mmslc1970 which is in agreement with the cp of rx5day the results show that the change of flood pattern mainly depends on the changing climate when there is limited or no lucc for the sarb the cp of mmslc1970 was also october 1991 the same for the grb however the cp of mmsobs was june 2001 with its mean value increased by 75 7 from the pre cp period to the post cp period table 3 in contrast the mean value of mmsobs only grew by 24 7 for the grb even though the rx5day of the grb had a larger gain 6 5 than that of the sarb 5 4 the significant change of mmsobs for the sarb after june 2001 could be linked to the high speed urbanization of san antonio with the impervious area increasing at an average annual rate of around 3 from 2001 to 2007 and the population growing at an average annual rate of 15 9 from 2000 to 2010 castro et al 2012 this continuous urbanization amplified the effects of the changing climate i e the change of rx5day on streamflow and thus elevated the value of mms significantly and even changed the timing of the cp of mms for the grb the cps of nmmslc1970 and mmslc1970 were both in october 1991 with the average of nmmslc1970 being 10 larger than that of mmslc1970 this suggests that the construction of the reservoir has changed the natural hydrological process by lowering the mms additionally the same change points of the variables october 1991 table 2 and the similar differences of nmmslc1970 and mmslc1970 table 3 show that the monthly floods also vary significantly according to the change of rx5day next the mean value of each of the following rx5day mmsobs and mmslc1970 within each 10th percentile was calculated in both the pre cp and post cp periods cp october 1991 the difference between the mean values of the pre cp and post cp periods was then calculated for each of the ten percentile ranges fig 6 shows the partitioning of the total difference according to the variable s percentile range because the difference values are very small in the 1 70 percentile range these are summed together as shown in fig 6 the major differences of the three variables i e rx5day mmsobs and mmslc1970 are all found within the 90th to 100th percentile this suggests that the changes detected are primarily associated with extreme rainfall or extreme peak flows for the grb the difference value for each percentile range is very similar among the three variables for the sarb the difference of the mmsobs in the 90th 100th percentile range is clearly larger than those of the rx5day and mmslc1970 indicating that the urbanization in the sarb after 1991 has exacerbated the impact of changing precipitation on the peak flows 4 2 3 elasticity tests there were two sets of elasticity tests conducted from 1986 to 2011 fig 7 in general elasticity increases when there is more precipitation because larger precipitation can lead to more surface runoff and therefore is more likely to cause a larger rainfall runoff ratio however the differences among the elasticities of the two urban conditions are relatively small when compared with those of the variously disturbed precipitation series the comparison of the elasticities between the paired basins is shown in fig 7a the simulations were processed for the paired basins under the same fixed land cover map i e lc1970 and the same observation based forcing data considering that there was a relatively small amount of urbanized land in the paired basins in the 1970s elasticity mainly depended on basin characteristics and forcing data the elasticity ranges from 1 71 to 2 82 for the grb which is similar to that of the sarb 1 69 to 2 76 the elasticities of the grb are slightly larger than those of the sarb in the case of 30 precipitation in the cases of 10 and 20 precipitation however the elasticities of the sarb are slightly larger than those of the grb nevertheless it is evident that the elasticity values of the paired basins resemble each other this analysis also supports using the paired catchments comparison approach for this study the evaluation results showing the isolated impacts of the progressive urbanization process on mms50 are shown in fig 7b the elasticity was tested under two types of land cover maps and was synthetically forced over the sarb one land cover map is clcs and the other is the fixed clcs with 1986 urban land cover i e ulc1986 in the case of ulc1986 the elasticity ranges from 1 77 to 2 81 in the case of clcs the elasticity ranges from 1 74 to 3 02 fig 7b the elasticity of clcs is obviously larger than that of ulc1986 in most perturbed precipitation scenarios except in the case of 30 precipitation where the elasticity of ulc1986 is slightly larger than that of clcs this can be attributed to two reasons first when the precipitation is relatively small most of it becomes evapotranspiration and soil moisture where little can reach the basin outlet in the form of overland flow or base flow second when there is more impervious area dhsvm res is set up such that a higher portion of the surface runoff goes into the urban channel this is due to the low infiltration capacity of impervious surface and the quick routing process so less surface runoff is available to infiltrate into the deep soil and less is available to evaporate on the land surface despite this continuous urbanization still plays a primary role in elevating the elasticity of mms50 5 discussion the paired catchments approach has a unique advantage because it uses observed precipitation and streamflow data to complement the modeling approaches and quantify the urbanization impact for instance the change point analysis that we performed section 4 2 2 has shown that by comparing the statistics of observed precipitation and streamflow over the paired basins the effects of urbanization within the sarb are isolated if we only investigate the changes of observed precipitation and streamflow from one basin it is challenging to separate the urbanization and climate change impacts as their impacts are both included in the observation data even though using detrended climate data to drive a model is a well recognized method the results can be subject to uncertainties due to the selected period therefore our study uses a hybrid approach that leverages both the paired catchments and modeling methods it is important to investigate the effects of the changing climate before evaluating the isolated influences of urbanization in the paired basins we found that rx5day increased significantly after the 1990s which is in line with the findings of kunkel et al 2010 who observed that the number of heavy precipitation events associated with tropical cyclones over the conus during 1994 to 2008 was more than twice the long term average while many studies show that the changing climate is one main factor affecting streamflow variability other factors such as urbanization are also closely associated with increasing flood events yang et al 2013 buendia et al 2016 zhao et al 2016a we reached a similar conclusion by combining paired catchments analysis with a physics based modeling framework dhsvm res furthermore we disentangled the impacts of urbanization and changing climate on floods using a hydrological model the application of the fixed lc1970 to the model simulations of the paired basins not only extracted the influences of the changing climate but also facilitated the evaluation of isolated urbanization effects by comparing qobs with qlc1970 and mmsobs with mmslc1970 the idea of conducting a comparative analysis with fixed land use maps has been previously investigated for example the effects of land use change on the flood frequency regime in the samoggia river basin of italy were assessed by applying fixed land use scenarios from 1955 1980 and 1992 brath et al 2006 in this study nmms was simulated to eliminate the influences from reservoir regulation on the grb which contributes to the rationality of using the grb as the reference basin the elimination of similar non target effects within the reference basin is important for other studies this can be accomplished by various hydrological modeling techniques in this study all subbasins within these two basins were calibrated independently to avoid an overfitting problem which occurs when only the streamflow of the downstream stations was calibrated while this has improved the overall model performance it could also add uncertainties to the paired catchments approach since the validation was conducted over a long time period 46 years from 1966 to 2011 the robust results suggest that the uncertainties associated with this calibration approach are relatively small as a result the paired basins do not exactly share the same model parameterization furthermore the calibration was conducted in this way because the model and model parameters are not completely physics based model structure and model parameters as well as the forcing and input data e g soil texture all have associated uncertainties calibration over each subbasin could practically reduce the impacts of these types of uncertainties nevertheless the selection of parameters over the paired basins has not been fully investigated in this study thus more future studies are expected to be conducted using the recently published parallel dhsvm perkins et al 2019 which is significantly more computational efficient for evaluating the effects of parameter selection over the neighboring basins the elasticity results were also compared against a contour map of precipitation elasticity of streamflow covering the united states which was developed by sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and was widely used as a validation metric in later studies the map showed that the elasticity values ranged from 0 5 to 3 5 over the united states and higher values greater than 2 0 primarily occurred in arid and semiarid regions such as the southwest and midwest in texas elasticity values mainly fall into the range of 1 0 2 5 considering that model genres and model calibration also play important roles in determining elasticity values sankarasubramanian et al 2001 dooge 1992 the elasticity results of this study are reasonable and can be compared with those of future research the application of synthetic forcing data in elasticity tests significantly eliminated the influences of the changing climate which made the isolated evaluation of urbanization influences even more thorough the cdf mapping technique borrows this idea from the qm method which is widely used to post process downscaled gcm projections wood et al 2002 wood lettenmaier 2006 when creating synthetic forcing data the selection of a representative year is an important step here we mainly consider the similarity of annual mean precipitation and intra annual precipitation distribution between the selected year and the climatology however there are still uncertainties inherent to this method experiments using different representative precipitation years are expected to be conducted in the future nevertheless this cdf mapping technique creates the rescaled precipitation of the synthetic forcing data text s2 in supplementary material which is a simple and transferrable method in most hydrological modeling studies over the united states four nlcd land cover maps i e nlcd1992 nlcd2001 nlcd2006 and nlcd2011 have been applied to simulate the change in land cover however the unavailability of continuous land cover maps hinders the continuous quantification of the effects of lucc on hydrologic processes fletcher et al 2013 zarezadeh giacomoni 2017 this is because lucc influences the energy balance and the hydrological cycle zhu woodcock 2014 in this sense using annually continuous lucc maps to parameterize the model is the ideal choice for realistic evapotranspiration and surface runoff results however our newly developed clcs only provided continuous lucc changes for urban areas and did not include changes for non urban land use types this is primarily because our focus is on urbanization which has the most significant impacts on altering surface runoff as compared to other land cover changes meanwhile other non urban land cover types did not change as much as urban land cover in the sarb to our knowledge a product named lcmap land change monitoring assessment and projection which includes annual lucc maps from 1985 to 2017 in the united states is under development u s geological survey 2020 this product can be used in future studies to facilitate sustainable land management and to better evaluate the hydrological responses to lucc in addition a free and advanced cloud computing geospatial platform the google earth engine gee gorelick et al 2017 was used to develop the clcs used in this study the analysis scripts and results have been released on gee https code earthengine google com a71de59b8522e79ba401ccb4f63f1d55 which makes the classification methods transferrable to many other urbanized basins throughout the world with regard to cp detection historical analyses have mainly been based on either total or mean streamflow over multiple years gao et al 2010 harrigan et al 2014 cockburn garver 2015 buendia et al 2016 ivancic shaw 2017 also a limited number of cp analyses have been performed on flood related variables at a monthly level our work expands the use of cp to support further exploration of anthropogenic influences on floods even though our work can deliver useful information for local water resources management some limitations need to be addressed in future studies 1 only satellite images collected by the landsat 5 tm sensor from 1984 to 2011 were used the length of the study period can be extended to more recent years by incorporating images collected by landsats 7 and 8 which will be more informative to current and near future water resources management practices 2 table s7 of the supplementary material shows a slight increase in forested area from lc1970 to nlcd1992 however there could be uncertainties associated with the lc1970 land cover data because the classification methodology is different for lc1970 when compared with that of other nlcd products price et al 2006 research is necessary to obtain more accurate historical land cover maps which have consistent classification with the current nlcd products 3 the calibration and validation results fig 3 suggest that the capabilities of dhsvm res in base flow simulations are limited which hinders further applications of dhsvm res in the future this limitation can be alleviated by coupling a complete groundwater component to the current modeling framework 4 the impacts of urbanization on regional climate were not considered other modeling systems such as the weather research and forecasting wrf model can be used in the future to capture the influences of urbanization on regional climate 5 the elasticity test uses mms50 which is different from the traditional estimator i e the average streamflow the reason is that limited research campaigns have investigated mms50 so this study could provide quantitative information regarding the sensitivity of the long term monthly flood regime to precipitation furthermore only one normal year 1975 was selected as the representative year and thus the uncertainties regarding the selection of the representative years have not been fully investigated more precipitation scenarios using wet or dry years as the representative year should be included in future elasticity studies additionally the simulations for the elasticity test can be extended by including a future climate sensitivity test via the application of regional climate models feser et al 2011 6 conclusion a large portion of the world s population is facing flood related risks because of urbanization miao 2018 and it is imperative to study the impacts of urbanization on flooding considering the widescale accessibility of various remote sensing datasets distributed hydrological modeling can be conducted in many other paired river basins hence our comparative investigation based on paired catchments analysis and a modeling framework is transferrable to other regions of the world to promote local water security overall this study evaluates the influence of urbanization on flooding and unravels the combined impacts of urbanization and the changing climate to improve water security our main findings include 1 the grb and sarb are reasonably paired basins for studying the effects of urbanization on floods they share similar physical characteristics and analogous elasticities of precipitation additionally the urban impervious area of the sarb has increased significantly while the land cover of the grb has scarcely changed 2 with paired basins and a comprehensive modeling framework this study separated the impacts of the changing climate and urbanization and removed the effects of reservoir regulation thus the influence of urbanization on flooding was extracted 3 the change of mms patterns was mainly driven by the changing climate when there was limited lucc the evidence is the same cp october 1991 among the rx5day mmsobs and mmslc1970 for the grb as well as mmslc1970 of the sarb 4 through analysis of the selected flood events we found that urbanization can cause an apparent elevation of flood peaks lead to shorter lag times and exacerbate the influence of antecedent moisture conditions on floods during the flood events over the sarb in 2002 the flood peak of qobs was two days earlier than that of qlc1970 and the difference between the peaks of qlc1970 and qobs reached 30 5 by detecting the change points cp of monthly floods we found that the high speed urbanization of san antonio amplified the effects of the changing climate on streamflow patterns this elevated mms significantly and thus changed the timing of the cp of mmsobs to june 2001 meanwhile the difference between the values of the post cp and the pre cp periods of mmsobs for the sarb was around 76 which was obviously larger than that for any of the other cases 6 the elasticity test confirmed that continuous urbanization played a primary role in elevating the elasticity of mms50 when the influence of the changing climate was eliminated to a significant level the differences among the elasticities of the two urban land cover scenarios became larger with increased precipitation 7 while flow regulation reduced the peak flow values and lessened the streamflow intra annual variability it did not affect the cp for instance in the grb we found that the variance is larger for mms1970 69 than for nmms1970 58 3 table 3 but the cps of mmslc1970 and nmmslc1970 were the same as that of rx5day october 1991 this study successfully quantified the impacts of urbanization on floods in a systematic manner by using paired catchments analysis and dhsvm res in two adjacent basins more studies about the changes of hydrological processes under a changing environment e g urbanization climate change

5227,the increased occurrence of flood events resulting from urbanization and global climate change is a great threat to water security to systematically evaluate the impacts of urbanization on floods we applied a paired catchments approach to two adjacent river basins in south central texas the san antonio river basin sarb with fast urbanization and the guadalupe river basin grb with little land cover change a physics based distributed hydrological model the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model embedded with a multi purpose reservoir module dhsvm res was used to simulate streamflow and reservoir storage the simulations were conducted under different land cover scenarios including a newly developed continuous land cover series clcs holistic analyses were then conducted for the paired basins using three methods analyzing the selected flood events detecting change points cp of monthly floods and testing the elasticity of long term flood regimes the results suggest that 1 urbanization may reduce lag time and elevate flood peaks significantly by 3 30 in our study area 2 when there is little land cover change changing climate is the major driver of variations in the monthly maximum streamflow mms 3 fast urbanization can amplify streamflow variability increase mms significantly and thus alter the timing of cp and 4 the mean mms of observed streamflow in the sarb has increased by as much as 75 7 from the pre cp to post cp periods this comprehensive study fills in a gap in our current understanding of the isolated impacts of urbanization on flooding and is expected to support future explorations of anthropogenic influences on floods keywords urbanization paired catchments hydrological modeling changing climate land cover change water security 1 introduction global urbanization exacerbates the negative socioeconomic impacts from severe climatic disasters e g floods and droughts united nations 2009 2011 jha et al 2012 for example urbanization is associated with increasing impervious area and decreasing infiltration which can lead to more frequent and severe flooding cuo 2016 defries and eshleman 2004 jongman 2018 nowak and greenfield 2012 onistephen et al 2015 this directly endangers our societal safety as well as infrastructure stability jha et al 2012 which threatens water security and hinders improvements in water related infrastructure hall and borgomeo 2013 gain et al 2016 yangon 2016 thus it is critical for policymakers to update water management plans and promote water security through evaluating the influence of urbanization on floods winters et al 2015 cross et al 2018 emmett et al 2018 in recent decades the frequency and intensity of various climate extremes have increased substantially alexander et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 donat et al 2013 for example in the united states nine of the top ten most extreme 1 day precipitation events from 1910 to 2015 occurred after 1990 noaa 2019 this intensification of heavy precipitation has also been observed in other parts of the world such as the united kingdom south africa india and japan groisman et al 2005 goswami et al 2006 min et al 2011 westra et al 2013 kunkel frankson 2015 donat et al 2016 some regions have shorter more intense storms compared to other regions which leads to unexpected severe floods recently the hurricane harvey event august 25 31 2017 which was ranked as the second most destructive storm in u s history hurricane katrina being the worst in inflation adjusted costs of 161 billion natsios 2019 resulted in damages of around 125 billion combined with other factors such as urbanization the impacts from intensified climate extremes can be further nonlinearly enhanced thus it is important to understand the mechanism of the hydrological changes under these impacts however while it is imperative to evaluate the distinct impacts of urbanization and the changing climate on flooding to better support decision making in terms of flood control and urban planning such effects are challenging to quantify separately since both climate and land cover affect streamflow it is difficult to separate their effects when a single basin is investigated thus neighboring basins with similar physical characteristics e g climate pattern topography soil texture vegetation but different paces of urbanization are ideal study areas that can be used to isolate the land cover impacts and the climate impacts one of the most common practices used to separate the effects of urbanization and climate is paired catchments analysis ochoa tocachi et al 2016 seibert and mcdonnell 2010 zhao et al 2010 the paired catchments study originated from a forestry study bates henry 1928 and has since been widely used to evaluate the influences of changes in land cover on the magnitudes of water yields bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 ide et al 2013 schelker et al 2013 in recent years this method has also been applied to investigate the effects of urbanization on streamflows burns et al 2005 onistephen et al 2015 putro et al 2016 zégre et al 2010 typically a reference basin and an urbanized basin with similar physical characteristics are selected to isolate the effects of urbanization regression models or conceptual frameworks are usually applied to analyze the results from the paired river basins burns et al 2005 zhao et al 2010a while this approach provides a systematic way to disentangle the combined issues other anthropogenic factors e g reservoir regulation and irrigation schemes may further complicate the analysis and hamper an accurate quantification zégre et al 2010 hence it is necessary to use additional tools and methods to further extract the influence of urbanization on flooding when studying the paired catchments unlike lumped models distributed physics based models can be employed to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the soil and vegetation parameters and the meteorological forcing data giertz et al 2006 such models have a distinct advantage of being able to simulate streamflow under various land use cover change lucc scenarios at high spatial and temporal resolution motta tucci 1984 wigmosta et al 1994 brirhet benaabidate 2016 for example a 2008 study used the mike she model to study the effects of five types of land use changes on streamflow in a korean river basin im et al 2008 cuo et al 2008 employed the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm to study the effects of continuing urbanization on peak flows in a partially urbanized basin in the state of washington zhao et al 2016a compared dhsvm simulations under different historical and projected land cover maps in texas s san antonio river basin and found that urbanization alone had a profound impact on the increased peak streamflow with the availability of coupled hydrologic and reservoir management models e g dhsvm res zhao et al 2016b distributed models can be further used to study areas under significant reservoir regulation that cannot be addressed through conventional natural streamflow only models in addition to the above approaches using detrended climate data coupled with a series of lucc snapshots in time is a commonly adopted modeling approach used to isolate the effects of lucc and climate change variability on streamflow for example detrended daily rainfall was used in the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model to evaluate the relative impacts of climate and land cover changes in the godavari river basin india hengade and eldho 2019 in the andean basins of south america precipitation and streamflow time series datasets which were influenced by the el niño southern oscillation were detrended to disentangle the impacts of climate variability and lucc molina et al 2015 however in these types of studies the results can be easily affected by the uncertainties associated with the selection of the time period overall our current understanding about the isolated influence of urbanization on floods is limited because of two main obstacles the joint effects of urbanization and changing climate are difficult to distinguish and other human induced factors such as reservoir regulation also plays a role kaushal et al 2008 hejazi mohamad markus 2009 with an overarching goal of improving water security our specific objective in this study is to systematically evaluate the impacts of urbanization on flooding by leveraging both paired catchments analysis and physics based distributed hydrological modeling with an embedded multi purpose reservoir module specifically dhsvm res was selected to simulate the hydrological processes due to its explicit urban and reservoir modules and its high spatial and temporal resolutions two adjacent texas river basins one with little lucc and one with considerable urbanization are compared holistically via a stepwise methodology first the flood characteristics e g peak flow and peak time of several observed simulated flood events are analyzed for the paired basins second changes in the monthly flood related variables are studied via a change point detection method killick eckley 2014 third a newly defined elasticity test is conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the flood peak flows to different urban land cover conditions under perturbed precipitation conditions 2 study area texas is the largest state in the contiguous united states conus and its climate is characterized by drastic spatial and temporal variations throughout the state kottek et al 2006 two adjacent river basins in south central texas the san antonio river basin sarb and the guadalupe river basin grb are selected as the study area fig 1 the san antonio river merges into the guadalupe river about 16 km upstream of san antonio bay located adjacent to the gulf of mexico both basins have similar precipitation climatology fig 2 a vegetation types e g grass and shrub and soil types e g clay the characteristics of the paired basins are further compared in fig s1 and table s1 supplementary material both basins are vulnerable to recurring tropical storms including hurricanes due to their geographical proximity to the gulf coast guannel et al 2010 the sarb has a drainage area of 10 826 km2 the elevation of the basin ranges from 4 m to 693 m above sea level and the average annual precipitation was 813 mm from 1966 to 2011 livneh et al 2013 there are six subbasins in the sarb the medina river the leon creek the salado creek the upper san antonio river the cibolo creek and the lower san antonio river subbasins fig 1 the city of san antonio thesecond most populouscity in texas has experienced rapid urbanization the urban population doubled from 0 65 million in 1970 to 1 30 million in 2010 and the impervious area almost tripled from 325 km2 3 0 to 903 km2 8 3 during the same period fig 2b price et al 2006 jin et al 2013 thomas et al 2013 the grb has a drainage area of 15 418 km2 the elevation of the basin ranges from 1 m to 735 m above sea level and the annual average rainfall was 889 mm from 1966 to 2011 livneh et al 2013 the grb consists of four subbasins the upper guadalupe river the san marcos river the middle guadalupe river and the lower guadalupe river subbasins fig 1 in contrast to the sarb the grb only had a population of approximately 0 24 million in 1970 and approximately 0 33 million in 2010 thomas et al 2013 from 1970 to 2010 the impervious area of the grb increased slightly from 93 km2 0 6 to 132 km2 0 9 fig 2b price et al 2006 jin et al 2013 there is a flood control reservoir within the grb canyon lake 29 86 n 98 20 w fig 1 that has been operated at the conservation level since 1968 by the u s army corps of engineers 3 methodology and data 3 1 hydrological model and input data 3 1 1 hydrological model the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model wigmosta et al 1994 with an embedded multi purpose reservoir module dhsvm res zhao et al 2016b was used to simulate the streamflow of the sarb and grb dhsvm res is an open source physics based fully distributed model which computes the energy and water balances at each grid cell the model can be set up at a high spatial resolution e g 10 200 meter and at a sub daily time step e g 1 24 hour which together can facilitate the simulation of flood response in this study dhsvm res was set up at a 200 meter spatial resolution and at a 3 hourly time step from 1965 to 2011 with the first year used for model spin up one of the major advantages of dhsvm res is its explicit urban module cuo et al 2008 coupled with the spatially distributed features of the model the urban module can simulate the flow path from an urban pixel to its nearest river channel for each urban pixel the fraction of impervious area and the fraction of water stored in flood detention are both specified the fraction of impervious area determines the amount of surface runoff which is diverted to detention storage and follows the designed detention process then based on the outflow from detention discharge to the nearest channel is calculated with the support of this module the spatial heterogeneity of the urban sprawl e g denser urbanization along highways can be explicitly simulated another recently added feature of dhsvm is a multi purpose e g flood control water supply reservoir module zhao et al 2016b 2018 the reservoir module consists of three components the evaporation scheme the release scheme and the storage calculation which calculates the overall water balance of the reservoir the reservoir releases water based on prescribed operation rules by incorporating this module during the calibration and validation processes and then removing its effects in the following simulation naturalized flow can be obtained it is a common practice to create naturalized flow for example in döll et al 2009 naturalized flow was computed by removing all reservoirs in the global water model watergap simulation to quantify the impacts of reservoir regulation on streamflow in our study this methodology facilitates the separation of the urbanization impacts from the influences of reservoir flow regulation 3 1 2 input data there are three types of input data for dhsvm res land surface parameters reservoir configurations and meteorological forcing data land surface parameters include elevation soil and land cover data the elevation data digital elevation model dem map was adopted from the shuttle radar topography mission 30 meter resolution product jarvis et al 2008 and was resampled to 200 meter the basin mask was created based on the dem using arcmap 10 3 the flow direction the stream network and the soil depth were generated using the dem and python scripts from duan 2018 soil texture data was obtained from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo nauman et al 2018 land cover data were collected from three sources 1 the united states geological survey usgs national land cover database nlcd which includes nlcd1992 nlcd2001 nlcd2006 and nlcd2011 vogelmann et al 2001 homer et al 2007 fry et al 2011 jin et al 2013 2 the usgs enhanced historical land use and land cover datasets which depict lucc from the 1970s to 1980s referred to as lc1970 hereinafter price et al 2006 and 3 the continuous land cover series clcs which depicts the continuous urban expansion of the city of san antonio for each year from 1984 to 2011 the clcs was generated by combining the baseline map lc1970 with the classified annual urban land cover maps which were derived from annual landsat 5 thematic mapper images the steps of clcs generation are demonstrated in text s1 of the supplementary material reservoir configurations storage elevation and surface area for canyon lake fig 1 were acquired from the texas water development board and were used to derive the reservoir rating curve fig s5 supplementary material the storage capacity of canyon lake 1 5 109 m3 was divided by the u s army corps of engineers into a surcharge pool 1 1 108 m3 a flood control pool 9 1 108 m3 a conservation pool 4 8 108 m3 and an inactive pool 8 7 105 m3 four downstream control points i e new braunfels nbrt2 gonzales gnlt2 cuero cuet2 and victoria vict2 national weather service 2018 with the same channel streamflow limit 340 m3 s were designated to represent the downstream flow control operations the reservoir parameters include the water demand the discharge rate from the reservoir and the flood inflow threshold zhao et al 2016b the monthly water demand data for each reservoir was calculated based on the water rights and water use data which were derived from the texas commission on environmental quality 2017 the discharge rate from the reservoir and the flood inflow threshold were calibrated based on a comparison between the simulated and observed reservoir storage two types of meteorological forcing data observation based and synthetic were utilized in this study both datasets contain a full set of meteorological forcing terms i e air temperature wind speed relative humidity incoming shortwave radiation incoming longwave radiation and precipitation the observation based forcing data were obtained from livneh et al 2013 which are available for the conus at 1 16 spatial resolution and a daily time step from 1915 to 2011 to explore the sole influence of urbanization on flooding an alternative synthetic forcing dataset which does not exhibit any precipitation interannual variability i e having the same annual precipitation each year was created for the sarb 1975 was selected as the representative year for the sarb mainly because the annual mean precipitation in 1975 832 mm was close to the multi year annual mean observed precipitation from 1966 to 2011 813 mm additionally the intra annual precipitation distribution of 1975 is similar to the sarb precipitation climatology when compared to other years moreover there were neither extremely wet nor extremely dry events in 1975 next the cumulative distribution function cdf mapping technique was applied the 1975 daily precipitation was first organized as a look up table during each year the quantile of daily precipitation was determined and then used to identify the corresponding quantile in the 1975 table then it was replaced by the value from the look up table this led to a synthetic forcing dataset that had identical daily precipitation distribution values for each year the concept of this approach is similar to that of the quantile mapping qm method which is widely used to post process downscaled gcm projections wood et al 2002 wood lettenmaier 2006 this method can facilitate the removal of inter annual variations of the precipitation data while preserving its physical characteristics both datasets were then disaggregated to a 3 hourly time step further details about the synthetic forcing data can be found in the supplementary material 3 2 model set up and study design 3 2 1 dhsvm res calibration and validation the calibration and validation processes were conducted for the grb the calibrated parameters for the sarb were adopted from zhao et al 2016a table s4 the calibration was performed individually for each subbasin of the grb from january 1 2001 to december 31 2011 and the simulation was conducted under nlcd2006 using observation based forcing data ten usgs streamflow gauges fig 1 were selected for the two basins based on their locations and the available data lengths calibration based on multiple gauges across the entire river basin can also facilitate the testing of the model s performance and can reduce over fitting issues the calibration of the soil and vegetation parameters was conducted by comparing the simulated streamflow and the simulated monthly maximum streamflow with the observed streamflow at four usgs stations i e usgs 08167500 usgs 08171300 usgs 08173900 and usgs 08175800 based on a sensitivity test zhao et al 2016a streamflow was found to be most sensitive to six soil vegetation parameters lateral hydraulic conductivity maximum infiltration soil porosity wilting point field capacity and monthly leaf area index the reservoir parameters were calibrated afterward by comparing the simulated and observed reservoir storage values three criteria were used for the calibration the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 and the relative bias rb the validation was conducted from january 1 1966 to december 31 2011 by comparing the simulated streamflow with the observed streamflow at usgs 08175800 the simulation was conducted under lc1970 nlcd1992 nlcd2001 nlcd2006 and nlcd2011 using the observation based forcing data the results of the calibration and the validation for the grb are shown in section 4 1 3 2 2 study design the impacts of urbanization on flooding were studied comprehensively through a series of comparative analyses between the paired basins table 1 considering that the change in land cover due to urbanization affects floods in many aspects three sets of analyses were designed first to study the influence of urbanization on the change of flood characteristics i e flood peak peak time the analysis was performed for two specific flood events by comparing the observed and simulated daily mean streamflow q for the paired basins then to study the influence of urbanization on the change of monthly floods e g statistical distribution the distributions of three variables were investigated via change point cp analysis and percentile analysis these three variables are the observed monthly maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation time series rx5day which is an important metric to indicate monthly floods karl et al 1999 peterson et al 2001 wang et al 2017 the observed simulated monthly maximum streamflow time series mms representing the monthly peak streamflow series zhang et al 2011 and the observed simulated monthly maximum naturalized streamflow time series nmms indicating the mms without the impact from reservoir regulation finally to test the sensitivity of the status of long term flood regimes to different urban land covers a newly defined elasticity test was conducted that studied the median of the monthly maximum streamflow time series mms50 the above three steps are explained in detail below first the observed daily mean streamflow qobs and the simulated daily mean streamflow using lc1970 qlc1970 were analyzed for the paired basins over two periods december 1 1986 to january 31 1987 and october 17 2002 to december 1 2002 this analysis is based on the streamflow data from usgs 08175800 and usgs 08188500 which are the main downstream stations of the paired basins respectively for each flood event during the two periods the differences in the peak time and the peak magnitude between qobs and qlc1970 were compared for the paired basins the purpose of using the fixed lc1970 for qlc1970 is to eliminate the effects of urbanization to isolate the influence of the changing climate second the cp detection method killick eckley 2014 was utilized to detect the abrupt changes of the long term underlying distributions of rx5day mms and nmms this method was developed based on a maximum likelihood estimation framework and has been applied to a number of hydrological time series in past studies harder et al 2015 gu et al 2017 li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 sidibe et al 2018 before implementing this method the flood peaks of the historical flood events were analyzed the october 1998 flood peak was the highest peak on record for both the grb and the sarb this flash flood was caused by two hurricanes in the eastern pacific i e hurricane madeline and hurricane lester and a relatively stationary cold front white 2018 national weather service 2019 u s geological survey 2014 thus this extreme event was considered as an outlier which greatly impacted the statistics of the dataset e g mean and standard deviation thus the values of rx5day and the flood peaks in october 1998 were removed from all datasets for both basins at the locations of usgs 08175800 and usgs 08188500 which are the main downstream stations of the paired basins then the cps of rx5day the observed mms mmsobs and the simulated mms under the fixed lc1970 mmslc1970 were calculated for both basins because there are no major reservoirs in the sarb the cp of the simulated nmms under the fixed lc1970 nmmslc1970 was not tested for the sarb after the cp detection percentile analyses were conducted for rx5day mmslc1970 and mmsobs third an elasticity test was conducted for two purposes 1 comparing the elasticity of precipitation between the paired basins and 2 assessing the isolated influence of the progressive urbanization process on mms50 correspondingly there were two sets of simulations processed from 1986 to 2011 to facilitate the elasticity tests 1 the first set was processed under the same fixed land cover map i e lc1970 2 the second set was conducted using the clcs and a single fixed land cover i e ulc1986 for the sarb the elasticity test was originally introduced by schaake 1990 and was designed for evaluating the sensitivity of the annual mean streamflow to changes in annual precipitation a similar but modified test was performed in this study based on simulations that were conducted under different urban land cover scenarios and were forced by a series of perturbed precipitation patterns the elasticity of mms50 is defined as 1 ε p p q d q q d p p where q represents mms50 and p represents the perturbed observed rescaled precipitation in the first set of the elasticity tests the observation based precipitation livneh et al 2013 was perturbed such that the interannual variations of the historical precipitation data could be preserved in the second set of the elasticity tests the rescaled synthetic precipitation was perturbed which is free of the interannual variations resulting from the use of the cdf mapping technique in both sets the precipitation values have been changed by 10 20 and 30 the test was conducted for the entire sarb and focuses on the simulated streamflow at usgs 08188500 however for the grb the elasticity test was only conducted for the san marcos river subbasin fig 1 a subbasin of the grb and the simulated streamflow was targeted at usgs 08173900 this is due to the fact that the main soil type of the upper guadalupe river basin is clay loam fig s1 supplementary material which is different from the major soil types of the other subbasins of the grb and those of the entire sarb the san marcos river subbasin is also representative for the grb in terms of the dem land cover and precipitation distribution for the dem most subbasins are in the region of low elevation except the upper grb and the upper portion of san marcos river subbasin thus the dem for san marcos river subbasin can be representative of the whole grb the san marcos river subbasin contains two major land cover types grass and forest while other subbasins are dominated by just one land cover type forest in the upper grb and grass in the middle grb and lower grb additionally the monthly precipitation distribution in the san marcos river subbasin is almost the same as that of the entire grb 4 results 4 1 dhsvm res calibration and validation the calibration and validation results for the grb are shown in fig 3 the error statistics of the daily calibration for the lower grb suggest that the simulated streamflow is relatively accurate with an r2 of 0 75 an nse of 0 71 and an rb of 0 05 fig 3d however the results for the blanco river gauge station fig 3b are not as good with both the r2 and the nse under 0 60 meanwhile it is observed that the simulated base flows do not agree very well with the observations in some subbasins fig 3b c and d which can be attributed to groundwater discharge from the edwards aquifer close to usgs 08171300 near kyle texas regardless the good agreement of the simulated and observed reservoir storage volume for canyon lake indicates that the reservoir parameters in dhsvm res are robust fig 3f the error statistics of mms were also calculated for both basins and the results show that the simulated mms are relatively accurate with r2 values of 0 84 and 0 78 and nse values of 0 78 and 0 77 for the grb and the sarb respectively the validation results figs 3f and 4 indicate that the calibrated parameters can simulate the daily streamflow and the mms for both basins to evaluate the simulated timing of peak flow events several flood events with similar magnitude to the flood events in fig 5 are selected to calculate the lag time between the observed and simulated peak flow timing results shown in tables s5 and s6 of the supplementary material indicate that the model can accurately simulate the peak time on a daily scale in 43 of the selected events in the sarb and in 68 of those in the grb 4 2 comparisons between sarb and grb 4 2 1 comparisons of streamflow during flood events to evaluate the impacts of urbanization on flood events the flood peak and peak time were compared between qobs and qlc1970 for the paired basins over two selected periods i e december 1 1986 to january 31 1987 october 17 2002 to december 1 2002 a time period during which the two basins had similar precipitation events and similar hydrological responses fig 5 first qobs and qlc1970 were compared from december 1 1986 to january 31 1987 for the grb the peak of qobs was 612 m3 s on december 26 1986 which was 17 smaller than that of qlc1970 on december 25 1986 739 m3 s fig 5a this might be attributed to model uncertainties for the sarb fig 5b the peak of qobs was 303 m3 s on december 27 1986 which was slightly higher and 1 day earlier than qlc1970 295 m3 s peaked on december 28 1986 the impervious area increased from 3 0 in 1970 to 4 9 in 1986 estimated from the clcs which could lead to an acceleration of runoff process resulting in the observed elevation of the flood peak then qobs and qlc1970 in the grb and the sarb were compared from october 17 2002 to december 1 2002 a period which contains two flood events for the grb the first peak of qobs was 668 m3 s on october 28 2002 which was slightly lower than that of qlc1970 761 m3 s on october 27 2002 fig 5c the second peaks of qobs and qlc1970 were 1705 m3 s and 1361 m3 s respectively which both occurred on november 7 2002 fig 5c this can be possibly attributed to model uncertainties and uncertainties associated with the land cover data first the classification algorithms are different for lc1970 and other nlcd products which may add uncertainties to the simulated streamflow second based on the data shown in table s7 supplementary materials the impervious area increased 0 19 from lc1970 to nlcd2001 with a slight decrease in bare ground grassland and forest the higher second peak flow in the qobs compared with qlc1970 could be also related to these land cover changes which were not addressed in the model scenarios for the sarb the first peak of qobs was 484 m3 s on october 28 2002 this is about 20 larger than that of qlc1970 406 m3 s which occurred on october 30 2002 fig 5d the second peak of qobs was 470 m3 s on november 8 2002 which is 30 larger than that of the corresponding qlc1970 363 m3 s on november 10 2002 fig 5d the comparison between fig 5c and fig 5d suggests that urbanization exacerbated the effects of antecedent moisture conditions on floods in the sarb the difference between the second peaks 30 is noticeably larger than that of the first flood peaks 20 when comparing fig 5b and d the difference between the lag times is two days for both flood events in 2002 and only one day for the flood events in 1986 these differences might be attributed to the increase in impervious area i e 6 5 the higher catchment s antecedent moisture content and or the larger flood size in 2002 as compared to 1986 it can be inferred that urbanization effects outweigh the model uncertainty and are apparent in the sarb 4 2 2 change point analysis the results of the detected cps are summarized in table 2 the cps of rx5day were detected in terms of variance and the cps of other variables i e mmsobs mmslc1970 and nmmslc1970 were detected in terms of mean all cps were detected at a significance level of 5 the cps of rx5day were not detected in terms of mean because the variation of mean value of rx5day was relatively small and the cp of the mean value of rx5day was undetectable at a significance level of 5 when comparing the mean variance of the post cp period with the pre cp period for the above four variables the mean variance of the post cp period was larger than that of the pre cp period in all cases table 3 the cps of rx5day were first compared for the paired basins to assess if the two basins had undergone similar climate patterns the cp of rx5day for the grb was in october 1991 which was close to the cp of rx5day for the sarb i e april 1990 this indicates that the rx5day of the two basins share similar change patterns which makes them suitable for paired catchments analysis next the cps of mmsobs and mmslc1970 were detected for these basins for the grb the cps were also in october 1991 for both mmsobs and mmslc1970 which is in agreement with the cp of rx5day the results show that the change of flood pattern mainly depends on the changing climate when there is limited or no lucc for the sarb the cp of mmslc1970 was also october 1991 the same for the grb however the cp of mmsobs was june 2001 with its mean value increased by 75 7 from the pre cp period to the post cp period table 3 in contrast the mean value of mmsobs only grew by 24 7 for the grb even though the rx5day of the grb had a larger gain 6 5 than that of the sarb 5 4 the significant change of mmsobs for the sarb after june 2001 could be linked to the high speed urbanization of san antonio with the impervious area increasing at an average annual rate of around 3 from 2001 to 2007 and the population growing at an average annual rate of 15 9 from 2000 to 2010 castro et al 2012 this continuous urbanization amplified the effects of the changing climate i e the change of rx5day on streamflow and thus elevated the value of mms significantly and even changed the timing of the cp of mms for the grb the cps of nmmslc1970 and mmslc1970 were both in october 1991 with the average of nmmslc1970 being 10 larger than that of mmslc1970 this suggests that the construction of the reservoir has changed the natural hydrological process by lowering the mms additionally the same change points of the variables october 1991 table 2 and the similar differences of nmmslc1970 and mmslc1970 table 3 show that the monthly floods also vary significantly according to the change of rx5day next the mean value of each of the following rx5day mmsobs and mmslc1970 within each 10th percentile was calculated in both the pre cp and post cp periods cp october 1991 the difference between the mean values of the pre cp and post cp periods was then calculated for each of the ten percentile ranges fig 6 shows the partitioning of the total difference according to the variable s percentile range because the difference values are very small in the 1 70 percentile range these are summed together as shown in fig 6 the major differences of the three variables i e rx5day mmsobs and mmslc1970 are all found within the 90th to 100th percentile this suggests that the changes detected are primarily associated with extreme rainfall or extreme peak flows for the grb the difference value for each percentile range is very similar among the three variables for the sarb the difference of the mmsobs in the 90th 100th percentile range is clearly larger than those of the rx5day and mmslc1970 indicating that the urbanization in the sarb after 1991 has exacerbated the impact of changing precipitation on the peak flows 4 2 3 elasticity tests there were two sets of elasticity tests conducted from 1986 to 2011 fig 7 in general elasticity increases when there is more precipitation because larger precipitation can lead to more surface runoff and therefore is more likely to cause a larger rainfall runoff ratio however the differences among the elasticities of the two urban conditions are relatively small when compared with those of the variously disturbed precipitation series the comparison of the elasticities between the paired basins is shown in fig 7a the simulations were processed for the paired basins under the same fixed land cover map i e lc1970 and the same observation based forcing data considering that there was a relatively small amount of urbanized land in the paired basins in the 1970s elasticity mainly depended on basin characteristics and forcing data the elasticity ranges from 1 71 to 2 82 for the grb which is similar to that of the sarb 1 69 to 2 76 the elasticities of the grb are slightly larger than those of the sarb in the case of 30 precipitation in the cases of 10 and 20 precipitation however the elasticities of the sarb are slightly larger than those of the grb nevertheless it is evident that the elasticity values of the paired basins resemble each other this analysis also supports using the paired catchments comparison approach for this study the evaluation results showing the isolated impacts of the progressive urbanization process on mms50 are shown in fig 7b the elasticity was tested under two types of land cover maps and was synthetically forced over the sarb one land cover map is clcs and the other is the fixed clcs with 1986 urban land cover i e ulc1986 in the case of ulc1986 the elasticity ranges from 1 77 to 2 81 in the case of clcs the elasticity ranges from 1 74 to 3 02 fig 7b the elasticity of clcs is obviously larger than that of ulc1986 in most perturbed precipitation scenarios except in the case of 30 precipitation where the elasticity of ulc1986 is slightly larger than that of clcs this can be attributed to two reasons first when the precipitation is relatively small most of it becomes evapotranspiration and soil moisture where little can reach the basin outlet in the form of overland flow or base flow second when there is more impervious area dhsvm res is set up such that a higher portion of the surface runoff goes into the urban channel this is due to the low infiltration capacity of impervious surface and the quick routing process so less surface runoff is available to infiltrate into the deep soil and less is available to evaporate on the land surface despite this continuous urbanization still plays a primary role in elevating the elasticity of mms50 5 discussion the paired catchments approach has a unique advantage because it uses observed precipitation and streamflow data to complement the modeling approaches and quantify the urbanization impact for instance the change point analysis that we performed section 4 2 2 has shown that by comparing the statistics of observed precipitation and streamflow over the paired basins the effects of urbanization within the sarb are isolated if we only investigate the changes of observed precipitation and streamflow from one basin it is challenging to separate the urbanization and climate change impacts as their impacts are both included in the observation data even though using detrended climate data to drive a model is a well recognized method the results can be subject to uncertainties due to the selected period therefore our study uses a hybrid approach that leverages both the paired catchments and modeling methods it is important to investigate the effects of the changing climate before evaluating the isolated influences of urbanization in the paired basins we found that rx5day increased significantly after the 1990s which is in line with the findings of kunkel et al 2010 who observed that the number of heavy precipitation events associated with tropical cyclones over the conus during 1994 to 2008 was more than twice the long term average while many studies show that the changing climate is one main factor affecting streamflow variability other factors such as urbanization are also closely associated with increasing flood events yang et al 2013 buendia et al 2016 zhao et al 2016a we reached a similar conclusion by combining paired catchments analysis with a physics based modeling framework dhsvm res furthermore we disentangled the impacts of urbanization and changing climate on floods using a hydrological model the application of the fixed lc1970 to the model simulations of the paired basins not only extracted the influences of the changing climate but also facilitated the evaluation of isolated urbanization effects by comparing qobs with qlc1970 and mmsobs with mmslc1970 the idea of conducting a comparative analysis with fixed land use maps has been previously investigated for example the effects of land use change on the flood frequency regime in the samoggia river basin of italy were assessed by applying fixed land use scenarios from 1955 1980 and 1992 brath et al 2006 in this study nmms was simulated to eliminate the influences from reservoir regulation on the grb which contributes to the rationality of using the grb as the reference basin the elimination of similar non target effects within the reference basin is important for other studies this can be accomplished by various hydrological modeling techniques in this study all subbasins within these two basins were calibrated independently to avoid an overfitting problem which occurs when only the streamflow of the downstream stations was calibrated while this has improved the overall model performance it could also add uncertainties to the paired catchments approach since the validation was conducted over a long time period 46 years from 1966 to 2011 the robust results suggest that the uncertainties associated with this calibration approach are relatively small as a result the paired basins do not exactly share the same model parameterization furthermore the calibration was conducted in this way because the model and model parameters are not completely physics based model structure and model parameters as well as the forcing and input data e g soil texture all have associated uncertainties calibration over each subbasin could practically reduce the impacts of these types of uncertainties nevertheless the selection of parameters over the paired basins has not been fully investigated in this study thus more future studies are expected to be conducted using the recently published parallel dhsvm perkins et al 2019 which is significantly more computational efficient for evaluating the effects of parameter selection over the neighboring basins the elasticity results were also compared against a contour map of precipitation elasticity of streamflow covering the united states which was developed by sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and was widely used as a validation metric in later studies the map showed that the elasticity values ranged from 0 5 to 3 5 over the united states and higher values greater than 2 0 primarily occurred in arid and semiarid regions such as the southwest and midwest in texas elasticity values mainly fall into the range of 1 0 2 5 considering that model genres and model calibration also play important roles in determining elasticity values sankarasubramanian et al 2001 dooge 1992 the elasticity results of this study are reasonable and can be compared with those of future research the application of synthetic forcing data in elasticity tests significantly eliminated the influences of the changing climate which made the isolated evaluation of urbanization influences even more thorough the cdf mapping technique borrows this idea from the qm method which is widely used to post process downscaled gcm projections wood et al 2002 wood lettenmaier 2006 when creating synthetic forcing data the selection of a representative year is an important step here we mainly consider the similarity of annual mean precipitation and intra annual precipitation distribution between the selected year and the climatology however there are still uncertainties inherent to this method experiments using different representative precipitation years are expected to be conducted in the future nevertheless this cdf mapping technique creates the rescaled precipitation of the synthetic forcing data text s2 in supplementary material which is a simple and transferrable method in most hydrological modeling studies over the united states four nlcd land cover maps i e nlcd1992 nlcd2001 nlcd2006 and nlcd2011 have been applied to simulate the change in land cover however the unavailability of continuous land cover maps hinders the continuous quantification of the effects of lucc on hydrologic processes fletcher et al 2013 zarezadeh giacomoni 2017 this is because lucc influences the energy balance and the hydrological cycle zhu woodcock 2014 in this sense using annually continuous lucc maps to parameterize the model is the ideal choice for realistic evapotranspiration and surface runoff results however our newly developed clcs only provided continuous lucc changes for urban areas and did not include changes for non urban land use types this is primarily because our focus is on urbanization which has the most significant impacts on altering surface runoff as compared to other land cover changes meanwhile other non urban land cover types did not change as much as urban land cover in the sarb to our knowledge a product named lcmap land change monitoring assessment and projection which includes annual lucc maps from 1985 to 2017 in the united states is under development u s geological survey 2020 this product can be used in future studies to facilitate sustainable land management and to better evaluate the hydrological responses to lucc in addition a free and advanced cloud computing geospatial platform the google earth engine gee gorelick et al 2017 was used to develop the clcs used in this study the analysis scripts and results have been released on gee https code earthengine google com a71de59b8522e79ba401ccb4f63f1d55 which makes the classification methods transferrable to many other urbanized basins throughout the world with regard to cp detection historical analyses have mainly been based on either total or mean streamflow over multiple years gao et al 2010 harrigan et al 2014 cockburn garver 2015 buendia et al 2016 ivancic shaw 2017 also a limited number of cp analyses have been performed on flood related variables at a monthly level our work expands the use of cp to support further exploration of anthropogenic influences on floods even though our work can deliver useful information for local water resources management some limitations need to be addressed in future studies 1 only satellite images collected by the landsat 5 tm sensor from 1984 to 2011 were used the length of the study period can be extended to more recent years by incorporating images collected by landsats 7 and 8 which will be more informative to current and near future water resources management practices 2 table s7 of the supplementary material shows a slight increase in forested area from lc1970 to nlcd1992 however there could be uncertainties associated with the lc1970 land cover data because the classification methodology is different for lc1970 when compared with that of other nlcd products price et al 2006 research is necessary to obtain more accurate historical land cover maps which have consistent classification with the current nlcd products 3 the calibration and validation results fig 3 suggest that the capabilities of dhsvm res in base flow simulations are limited which hinders further applications of dhsvm res in the future this limitation can be alleviated by coupling a complete groundwater component to the current modeling framework 4 the impacts of urbanization on regional climate were not considered other modeling systems such as the weather research and forecasting wrf model can be used in the future to capture the influences of urbanization on regional climate 5 the elasticity test uses mms50 which is different from the traditional estimator i e the average streamflow the reason is that limited research campaigns have investigated mms50 so this study could provide quantitative information regarding the sensitivity of the long term monthly flood regime to precipitation furthermore only one normal year 1975 was selected as the representative year and thus the uncertainties regarding the selection of the representative years have not been fully investigated more precipitation scenarios using wet or dry years as the representative year should be included in future elasticity studies additionally the simulations for the elasticity test can be extended by including a future climate sensitivity test via the application of regional climate models feser et al 2011 6 conclusion a large portion of the world s population is facing flood related risks because of urbanization miao 2018 and it is imperative to study the impacts of urbanization on flooding considering the widescale accessibility of various remote sensing datasets distributed hydrological modeling can be conducted in many other paired river basins hence our comparative investigation based on paired catchments analysis and a modeling framework is transferrable to other regions of the world to promote local water security overall this study evaluates the influence of urbanization on flooding and unravels the combined impacts of urbanization and the changing climate to improve water security our main findings include 1 the grb and sarb are reasonably paired basins for studying the effects of urbanization on floods they share similar physical characteristics and analogous elasticities of precipitation additionally the urban impervious area of the sarb has increased significantly while the land cover of the grb has scarcely changed 2 with paired basins and a comprehensive modeling framework this study separated the impacts of the changing climate and urbanization and removed the effects of reservoir regulation thus the influence of urbanization on flooding was extracted 3 the change of mms patterns was mainly driven by the changing climate when there was limited lucc the evidence is the same cp october 1991 among the rx5day mmsobs and mmslc1970 for the grb as well as mmslc1970 of the sarb 4 through analysis of the selected flood events we found that urbanization can cause an apparent elevation of flood peaks lead to shorter lag times and exacerbate the influence of antecedent moisture conditions on floods during the flood events over the sarb in 2002 the flood peak of qobs was two days earlier than that of qlc1970 and the difference between the peaks of qlc1970 and qobs reached 30 5 by detecting the change points cp of monthly floods we found that the high speed urbanization of san antonio amplified the effects of the changing climate on streamflow patterns this elevated mms significantly and thus changed the timing of the cp of mmsobs to june 2001 meanwhile the difference between the values of the post cp and the pre cp periods of mmsobs for the sarb was around 76 which was obviously larger than that for any of the other cases 6 the elasticity test confirmed that continuous urbanization played a primary role in elevating the elasticity of mms50 when the influence of the changing climate was eliminated to a significant level the differences among the elasticities of the two urban land cover scenarios became larger with increased precipitation 7 while flow regulation reduced the peak flow values and lessened the streamflow intra annual variability it did not affect the cp for instance in the grb we found that the variance is larger for mms1970 69 than for nmms1970 58 3 table 3 but the cps of mmslc1970 and nmmslc1970 were the same as that of rx5day october 1991 this study successfully quantified the impacts of urbanization on floods in a systematic manner by using paired catchments analysis and dhsvm res in two adjacent basins more studies about the changes of hydrological processes under a changing environment e g urbanization climate change

5228,evaluating water system vulnerability is the first priority in water security management which is defined as measuring the degree of harm from exposure to stresses and the susceptibility and resilience of the system to human activities and natural causes as a means of comprehensively exploring such weaknesses and susceptibilities in the interest of future development this paper proposes a vulnerability evaluation framework that integrates bi level programming blp and data envelopment analysis dea with multi followers the water authority as the leader and industrial domestic and agricultural water users as the multiple followers a case study of 19 regions in the yangtze river basin between 2013 and 2017 is then introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bi level dea model it was found that water systems were vulnerable to damage by hazards that the domestic sector had the greatest effect on the whole and the proposed framework identifying more vulnerable and safer areas provided managerial insights the novelty of this paper is to put forward the vulnerability assessment framework of the regional water system which integrates water quantity contamination water related hazards and water use efficiency and reveals the structure of realistic water resource management to obtain more sensitive results keywords bi level dea method multiple followers water vulnerability assessment 1 introduction climate uncertainty population growth and changes in land use have been exerting increasing impacts on water resource systems and increasing water security risks rodrigues et al 2014 leading to increases in the vulnerability of global water resources mirauda and ostoich 2011 it has been reported that approximately 80 of the worlds population faces high level water security issues vörösmarty et al 2010 furthermore the imbalances between water supply and demand caused by the increasing water demand and decreasing water supply weaken the capacity of water resources systems to withstand external change foti et al 2014 assessing the vulnerability of water systems is an attempt to evaluate the magnitude of the threat and to provide a starting point for identifying effective remedial actions kelly and adger 2000 water resources vulnerability assessment is fundamental to this process has been a key issue and should be conducted first vulnerability as defined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc mccarthy et al 2001 is the extent to which climate change may damage or harm a system it depends not only on a systems sensitivity but also on its ability to adapt to new climatic conditions water vulnerability evaluation is a powerful analytical tool that can reveal potential sources of damage for the sake of taking appropriate actions to reduce the discovered vulnerability wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 and guiding normative analysis of efforts to reduce risk and enhance well being adger 2006 standardized quantification of urban water system vulnerability will play a critical role in societies definition and implementation of sustainable water resource management in the context of the changing environment adger 2006 in recent decades scholars have been reflecting on water vulnerability from diverse perspectives hashimoto et al 1982 treated vulnerability as how severe the likely consequences of failure may be to measure the magnitude of a failure occurring from the perspective of the water supply reservoir anandhi and kannan 2018 emphasized water availability to address stakeholders need to cope with the adverse effects of changes in water resources due to for example climate change population change and variability gogu and dassargues 2000 assessed groundwater vulnerability based on the fundamental concept that some land areas are more vulnerable to groundwater contamination than others vrba and zaporozec 1994 and concentrated on contamination xiang et al 2016 the use of an aquifer vulnerability assessment as a significant tool to protect aquifers from surface contamination has attracted the attention of many researchers hussein et al 2013 worrall and kolpin 2004 nadiri et al 2018 and entails two particular concepts intrinsic vulnerability determining the vulnerability of groundwater to pollutants from human activities and specific vulnerability determining the vulnerability of groundwater generated by a particular contaminant or group of contaminants many researchers have focused on vulnerability to natural water hazards flood or drought which result in social damage for example social vulnerability contexts and drivers of floods rufat et al 2015 a standardized drought vulnerability index framework oikonomou et al 2019 and vulnerability assessment miranda and ferreira 2019 however previous research has mostly focused on particular aspects of the problem and few papers have combined water quantity and quality and vulnerability to flood and drought to evaluate water system vulnerability with the involvement of water managers and water users many vulnerability assessment tools have been developed to measure the state of suffering from anthropomorphic and environmental stresses or the tolerance of climatic dynamics and hazards overlay and index methods include the driver pressure state impact response framework dpsir and the intergovernmental panel on climate changes framework ipccs anandhi and kannan 2018 and the epikarst protective cover infiltration conditions karst network development epik doerfliger et al 1999 which comprise the majority of methods employed in papers assessing water vulnerability however these multi attributes weighting rating methods which use a mass of indicators are vulnerable to subjectivity and not easily affected dea a nonparametric mathematical programming approach is a popular evaluation method and has been used by many researchers because of its objectivity in the absence of exact production functions for weighting the indexes wei et al 2004 systematically described dea as a practical method for assessing vulnerability to natural disasters and identifying the causes leading to regional change and variation xiang et al 2016 employed water contamination as an input output process in the dea evaluation model to assess the vulnerability of surface water to pollution and concluded that the water environment in a humid area with intensive human activity is more vulnerable to water quality concerns than to water quantity concerns huang et al 2012 used the dea method to identify multidimensional flood vulnerability to construct a scientific basis for policymaking and implementation of flood prevention and mitigation designs however these papers used the classic and conventional dea method considering it as a black box considering only the initial inputs and final outputs while failing to detect internal interactions and specific characteristics throughout water resource management systems blp methodology was proposed given the bi level nature of the distribution of water with regional water authority as the leader and water users as the follower engaging in planning to achieve their respective goals which have been subject to formal studies khorshidi et al 2019 used the leader follower game to determine the optimum 12 month operation policy of a reservoir to agricultural and environmental sectors sedghamiz et al 2018 established leader follower game model among agricultural water users leader follower framework was also used for designing of contamination warning system in water distribution network which helped to govern system in a resilient and safe manner and warrants practical implementation khorshidi et al 2019 we considered a bi level decision structure which is congruent with the structure of water resources management with authority as the leader and the industrial domestic and agricultural water users as the followers in the assessment vulnerability of water resources system the novelty of this leader follower vulnerability framework is that three types of water users industrial agricultural domestic user are considered which is different from the existing studies simply focusing on a part of water resource management irrigation or water contamination a bi level dea method integrating blp and data envelopment analysis dea with multi followers was proposed to evaluate water system vulnerability the vulnerabilities of the regions are identified through the multi inputs and multi outputs production process of the decision maker units dmu with upper level determining resources allocation from leader to followers in the bi level dea model the multiple followers water users are considered a means by which more specific fragile points and differences can be exposed and more details supplied water regional authority from a global perspective allocates water resources formulates sewage discharge standards manages hazards and responds to emergencies to enhance water system security and resilience water users mainly consider their own vital interests and adhere to water availability and pollutant emission standards from a local perspective the methodology proposed can open the black box and reveal the structure of realistic water resource management to obtain more sensitive results zhou et al 2018 detects inner processes and gathers information from vertical hierarchical decision makers to supply cogent managerial insights wu et al 2016 in addition results are presented over time since water vulnerability is a time dependent phenomenon that changes from year to year because of climatic variability rodrigues et al 2014 changes in land use and other uncertainties the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 this paper first complements the existing research by proposing a new vulnerability assessment framework of the urban water system that integrates water quantity contamination water related hazards and water use efficiency based on previous studies 2 a bilevel dea evaluation model with multi followers is proposed to assess water system vulnerability with regional water authority as the leader and water users as the followers 3 the regions in the yangtze river basin are studied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and identify its potential weaknesses the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in the methodology section vulnerability assessment methods are discussed in detail in the application to the yangtze river basin section an actual case is described to prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in the summary and conclusion section comprehensive conclusions and future study extensions are presented 2 methodology in light of the wide research interest in water vulnerability assessment this study focuses on developing a bilevel dea with multi followers approach at first dea vulnerability assessment consisting of vulnerability frontier and vulnerability score is described to explain the implications of vulnerability frontier and probability set and elaborate how to calculate vulnerability scores then bilevel framework of the water resource management in river basin is described in detail and bilevel dea index system is determined according to the characteristics of vulnerability frontier at last water vulnerability evaluation model is proposed the flowchart in fig 1 provides an overview of the vulnerability scores evaluation process of the regional water system 2 1 dea vulnerability assessment 2 1 1 vulnerability frontier vulnerability frontier is opposite to the efficiency frontier in the conventional dea model which contains many well behaved performers this approach which measures the present degree of vulnerability is similar to bankruptcy assessment premachandra et al 2009 where the higher the score value the more fragile the system and the lower the score value the resilient the system contrary to previous applications we define the input indexes as illustrating the positive side the smaller they are the more vulnerable the evaluation system the output indexes represent the negative side the larger they are the greater the damage and loss these factors define a vulnerability frontier containing fragile performers in which non fragile healthy dmus are expected to exist inside a vulnerability probability set shaped by the vulnerability boundary due to the feature of inputs and outputs this approach seeks to find units with the worst performance to provide key objectives for managerial attention the proposed use of dea provides executives and researchers with quick and easy information for identifying failed performers premachandra et al 2009 fig 2 demonstrates the vulnerability frontier and the vulnerability possibility set located below the bankruptcy frontier 2 1 2 vulnerability score vulnerability evaluation recognizes the most affected units and explores the differences between vulnerable and stable regions in the context of a changeable and complex climate we define a vulnerability score vs representing the index of severity of water security in contrast to existing studies of cost efficiency zhou et al 2018 and profit efficiency wu et al 2016 vs is calculated as follows given j decision making units dmus being evaluated and indexed by j 1 2 j each of which has m input variables x i i 1 2 i and produces n output variables y r r 1 2 r with per unit costs v r attached to output for each evaluated region the vulnerability score of the jth dmu j 1 2 j is calculated using the linear programming lp problem below 1 vy max r 1 r v r y r s t x i j 1 j λ j x ij i 1 2 i y r j 1 j λ j y rj r 1 2 r x i y r λ j 0 j 1 2 j where y r λ j are decision variables and v r which represents the unit loss cost is attached to the damage caused outputs subject to the resource restrictions in the current water management environment note that in the overall system v r is assumed to be a unit and it is assumed that it is fixed and consolidated for the administration while among diverse water users it is a variable but is fixed from the perspective of individual users the above model allows substitutions in outputs and constrains the benchmarking units for dmu0 which can yield the existing vulnerability possibility set the maximum value requires a dea analysis which requires the solution of n linear programs one for each dmu based on the optimal solution y j λ j yielded by the above mathematical formula the vs of the evaluated dmu j is defined as the ratio of current status and the maximum tolerance in the water system as follows 2 vs j vy j v y j where vs satisfies 0 vs 1 vs 1 implying that dmu j is in a severe state conversely if vs is smaller than 1 it s more secure 2 2 regional water system vulnerability evaluation framework 2 2 1 bi level framework regional water system vulnerability assessment is performed here using a bi level process composed of the regional authority as the leader and water users as followers embracing multi periods the administrator in the upper level considers the magnitude of water stress to the regional system as a whole and identifies the conditions under which the system fails to satisfy both social development and ecological stability more precisely this process refers to the integrated analysis of contemporary water related states that exert an influence on society the economy and the environment water users in the lower level are mainly divided into three relatively independent water consumer groups industrial domestic and agricultural yan et al 2015 which individually pursue their objectives from a local perspective the connection between the upper and lower levels lies in the principle of water resource allocation based on water rights where each follower needs to reduce the volume of water consumed as much as possible within a given range to improve water efficiency while ensuring that the discharged wastewater meets the emission limits the leader allocates water resources according to the nature and characteristics of the multiple followers the allocations and utilization efficiencies among the different water user groups can be measured from an evaluation of the lower level when the regional authority makes a decision the whole procedure must be taken into account with the followers complying with the decision the conceptual significance of the bilevel structure is that it allows the vulnerability analysis to exhaustively consider the interrelationships and influences between water authority and multiple users and opens the black box of the system in multiple dimensions including water utilization contamination and hazards fig 3 illustrates the bilevel structure of water system vulnerability assessment we construct the vulnerability assessment framework to encompass multiple time periods and a bi level dea model is applied to regions located in the upper middle and lower reaches of the river basin the effects exerted on the regional water system and river basin are not temporary but are sustained with implications for both the near and long term this consideration is usually neglected resulting in a failure to consider the time change using panel data combining both vertical and horizontal factors above all the integrated model framework used to quantify regional water system vulnerability is a bi level model composed of one leader with multiple followers 2 2 2 input and output variable selection regional water system faces important challenges such as water supply and equitable allocation poff et al 2016 natural hazards including floods and droughts wei et al 2004 and water pollution xiang et al 2016 which impacts their ability to support human well being while maintaining healthy functioning ecosystems in this study three interrelated themes dominate the dimensions and direction of water vulnerability assessment water availability human vulnerability to hazards including water drought and inundation and water quality contamination given the nature of vulnerability assessment the selection of inputs and outputs is crucial for analysis and differs from that of the conventional dea model considering the whole system the smaller inferior values that could possibly cause water distress are considered to be input variables in contrast the larger superior values that could result in water security accidents and hence appear on the vulnerability frontier are classified as output variables at the upper level the assessment is focused on the key factors that affect the water supply capacity of the system including water quantity and the cost of natural hazards including floods and droughts areas with low water quantities are more likely to experience water shortages and would affect the functioning of the entire system while an increase in direct costs will increase the probability of water distress therefore the leader has two inputs total water resources water use per capita and two outputs direct economic loss water supply for department at the lower level the divergence among water users in terms of water usage and sewage discharge has characteristic impacts on water services and sustainable development followers with abundant contamination issues such as chemical organic demand cod and ammonia nitrogen an major water pollutants are expected to be more vulnerable hence there is one input water supply and two outputs cod and an these indicators have frequently been used in studies of vulnerability xiang et al 2016 wei et al 2004 and water security jensen and wu 2018 rodrigues et al 2014 2 3 bi level programming dea model with multi followers suppose that there are j dmus with a bi level hierarchical structure over t terms to be evaluated each system dmu in this study contains two decentralized subsystems a single water management authority as the leader and n water users as the multiple followers this kind of complicated situation is common in real life contexts and has a considerable influence on the overall system note that the intermediate values of the multiple followers are set by the leader in the bi level structure before establishing bilevel dea models various notations need to be introduced as follows indexes j the jth dmu j 1 2 j n the nth follower n 1 2 n t the tth period t 1 2 t parameters v t unit loss cost vector associated with the direct outputs of leader v f n 1 t unit loss cost vector associated with the cod emission of nth follower v f n 2 t unit loss cost vector associated with the an emission at nth follower λ vector of non negative multipliers used

nth follower function f t objective function for the leader f n t objective function for the nth follower 2 3 1 sub level efficiency a conceptual bi level programming dea model is shown in detail below the purpose of calculating a vulnerability score here is to identify the worst result which forms a vulnerability possibility frontier for the sake of providing a direction for possible improvements and generating suggestions for government the water authority as the leader at the upper level aims to measure the degree of fragility of the overall system by taking the lower level into account therefore the objective function of the leader is specified by the sum of the unit loss cost by multiplying the outputs and all the lower objective functions the objective and constraint conditions of the leader in period t are presented as the upper level objective 3 max y t λ t f t v t y t n 1 n v f n 1 t y f n 1 t v f n 2 t y f n 2 t the upper level constrains 4 s t x 1 t j 1 j x 1

users as the followers at the downstream level are regarded as independent participators who possess individual variables there are n decision makers in the lower level subsystem and each follower produces the corresponding outputs y f n 1 t and y f n 2 t after the leader determines the intermediate values z f n t to maximize f n t for observation we built a mathematical expression for the nth follower of the evaluated dmu and the lower subsystem consists of n 1 2 n models hence the maximum function for each water user in period t the lower level objectives 5 max y f n 1 t y f n 2 t π t f n

resulting in constrains z f n t j 1 j z f n t j λ j t at the upper level however z f n t is an undesirable input at the lower layer because the greater the water consumption the greater the vulnerability which results in constraints z f n t j 1 j z f n t j π j t 2 3 2 overall efficiency in a bilevel hierarchical structure if the water authority leader wants to optimize its goal it needs to take into account the goals and constraints of the multiple followers in conclusion the dea model for a bilevel system with multiple followers is presented as 7 max y t y f n 1 t y f n 2 t π t λ t

framework fig 3 to regions along the 6300 km 2 yangtze river basin yrb as seen in fig 4 e94 18 49 n35 10 47 to e121 23 50 n31 37 22 over a time period of five years to illustrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach yrb flows through total of 19 regions provinces municipalities and autonomous regions originating at tanggula mountain in qinghai province and eventually emptying into the donghai sea in shanghai this is the largest river basin in asia and in china and is the third largest in the world the yrb is rich in natural resources the yrb has significant economic social and environment relevance since it contributes approximately 36 percent of the countrys total river runoff and supplies water to approximately 400 million people with water for domestic industrial and agricultural use serving three different economic zones chinas eastern central and western zones and supporting numerous hydropower projects the majority of the basin is located in the humid subtropical region and is characterized by a warm humid climate but with an irregular distribution of both annual average temperatures and precipitation in both spatial and temporal dimensions urban development and related policies such as the grain for green project have resulted in changes in land use urban land classification grew by 67 5 while agriculture shrank by 7 5 and forests increased by 2 1 and vegetative cover between 2000 and 2015 these changes have led to an increased potential for floods of greater magnitude and frequency blöschl et al 2010 and affect hydrological outputs and rainfall runoff processes lin et al 2009 however the yrb still experiences a period of drought due to a combination of climate warming and accelerating water consumption in addition sewage from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors has increased pollution national bureau of statistics and ministry of environmental protection remarkably distinct regional differences exist for precipitation extremes cui et al 2019 hydrological extremes and flood risk fang et al 2018 this study considered 19 regions in the yrb as dmus and analyzed water system vulnerability from 2013 to 2017 data were obtained from the national bureau of statistics and the ministry of ecology and environment 3 2 results after solving the bi level dea model the following section presents the regional water vulnerability assessment scores and identifies weak points at the upper level and lower level subsystems as well as in the system as a whole figs 5 9 show the system and subsystem vss for 19 regions between 2013 and 2017 3 2 1 overall vss of 19 regions along the yrb between 2013 and 2017 in terms of the overall vss of 19 regions from 2013 to 2017 the scores fluctuate considerably among dmus with the lowest value close to zero while others values approach 1 as shown in fig 10 these discrepancies reveal that there are major differences in water management including water use efficiency water pollution and water hazards among the various regions of the yrb obviously there are identical peak points jiangsu henan guangdong sichuan shanxi and gansu and valley bottoms tibet and qinghai on these five lines the urban water systems in these areas are at the peak with high values representing poor performance in water management and high vulnerability and fragility while regions at the bottom indicate healthy water systems with relatively few water related problems remarkably the values of particular provinces showed large fluctuations in certain years for example anhui in 2016 had an abnormal value of 0 9410 indicating that it possesses a very fragile water environment compared with the other regions zhejiang reached 0 8261 and 0 7847 in 2013 and 2015 respectively while the evaluation values of the remaining regions fluctuated by approximately 0 4 similarly fujian hubei and hunan were all intense water environments in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively with high vulnerability values close to the frontier however they were relatively stable in other years as presented in figs 5 9 we find that guangdong had the highest score over four years due to having higher values at both the upper and lower levels compared to those of the other regions and that tibet had the lowest score because of lower values at both levels over five years the complete system vs always falls between the vss of the upper subsystem and the lower subsystem which takes into account integral elements instead of partial shanghai has a comparatively small vs for the whole system despite its efficiency at the upper level as the system efficiency is composed of each efficiency in each period the internal reasons for the vulnerability and instability of the whole bi level regional water system require further analysis to provide potential managerial insights for improving the stability of the system by paying more attention to a specific player 3 2 2 vs of the upper level subsystem from the perspective of the upper level subsystem centered on water resources administration shanghai jiangsu henan and guangdong always ranked first with scores of 1 leading to an upstream efficiency duration of five years however in the vulnerability assessment system these values represent the worst performances and most vulnerability in the decision making units dmus indicating the need for immediate attention which is distinct from the conventional dea evaluation method where efficient dmus indicate the best performers the high values of shanghai are primarily explained by the minimum amount of total water resources less than 10 billion m 3 compared to those of the other areas tibet for example possesses more than 400 billion m 3 of water excessive water consumption in jiangsu more than 50 billion m 3 each year was significantly higher than that in other regions the score of 1 for henan was caused by fewer water resources resulting in less water available per person both the higher water consumption of the three water users and high economic losses were the primary causes of the weakness in guangdong in addition shanxi and gansu obtained high scores in the vulnerability evaluation for the past five years due to economic losses and fewer abundant water resources obviously jiangxi tibet and qinghai had consistently lower scores indicating that these regions have healthy water systems according to data analysis appendix b the input indexes of these regions in a secure state are larger and the output indexes are lower than those of other regions which means that they have advantages in water resources utilization water resources availability and disaster management as shown in figs 5 9 the values for particular provinces exhibited large fluctuations in certain years the most likely reason for these abnormal years was that natural hazards caused considerable destruction of water systems and led to enormous damage for citizens taking fujian as an example the region was only on the vulnerability frontier in 2015 while its values in other years were all lower than 0 5 because in 2015 it suffered a large economic loss 223 70 billion yuan far higher than that in other years 14 31 billion yuan 5 61 billion yuan 38 22 billion yuan respectively with the other indexes remaining stationary moreover the score in 2016 was 0 4955 slightly higher than those in the remaining three years through specific analysis we can find that zhejiang hubei and hunan are facing the same problems for the same reasons we can draw the conclusion that stability of the water system is achievable despite major floods and mudslides in the upstream performance 3 2 3 vs of the lower level subsystem from the perspective of the lower level subsystem which is centered on multiple water users composed of industrial domestic and agricultural water sectors we found that the lower level subsystem vs always failed among the vss of the three water departments from 2013 to 2017 and that henan and hunan achieved maximum values of 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively only when the three followers were simultaneously on the vulnerability frontier fig 9 presents the average values for the three water users for 19 regions in each period generally for all the evaluated regional water vulnerabilities the average vss of domestic water sector are highest among the three players and the vss of industrial water sector are relatively higher than the agricultural sector across the whole water system from 2014 to 2017 in 2013 there is no significant difference among the three values these results demonstrate that the vulnerability of domestic water users exert a greater influence on the water system than those of the other two users comparatively as shown in figs 5 9 there were existing differences among the three water users in each region some of which were significantly diverse taking the scores for hunan province from 2017 as an example the industrial sector scored 1 while the domestic and agriculture sectors were lower than 0 3 regions with high cod and an emissions all reached high values since these pollutants worsened water quality resulting in a deteriorating ecological environment making the water systems more fragile however regions with relatively low pollutant emissions such as tibet and qinghai also reached higher levels because the intensity of their emissions relative to water consumption was relatively high although the amounts were small this finding can be confirmed by the example of jiangsu where high agricultural pollutant emissions had relatively low values due to high water consumption all the tables and figures mentioned above exhibit these three major findings see table 1 1 five regions jiangsu henan guangdong sichuan shanxi and gansu have been faced with major problems in water resource management since they reached higher vss each year suggesting that they require increased attention 2 water systems are highly susceptible to natural hazards especially floods which damage the entire system 3 from the results presented in figs 5 9 the overall water system vs always falls between those of the upper and lower levels and lower lever subsystem vs fall among the industrial domestic and agricultural water users the domestic sector contributed the most to vs while the agricultural sector contributed the least downstream 3 3 managerial insights the proposed methodology reflects the realistic structure of water management and is deeply analyzed internally simultaneously incorporating water management and water users to more accurately identify vulnerability based on the preceding findings through the results of the past five years some policy suggestions are given to assist government decision makers in meeting the challenges presented by these different weaknesses 1 appropriate efforts should be made to strengthen government legislation and policies in the most vulnerable areas jiangsu henan guangdong and shanxi obtained highly vulnerable scores in all five years because of both high upstream and downstream values implying that their poor performance in water management is attributable to both water utilization and pollutant discharge and the both factors require increased attention properly upgraded emissions policies are required to alleviate the situation and provide an escape from ecological degradation 2 it is crucial to establish guidelines and improved practices concerning the construction operation and maintenance of stormwater and flood management it is obvious from the results of the bi level model that natural hazards caused by floods and drought especially floods have great impacts on regional water systems and drive large and diverse potential societal damage implementing sustainable urban stormwater management is an effective method for flood relief and for reducing the influence of hydrological balance qiao et al 2018 however development of contemporary urban stormwater management facilities have lagged behind development of infrastructure due to the uncertainties rooted in climate change interacting with spatial heterogeneity increasing vulnerability to flooding jiang et al 2018 therefore it requires a wide perspective and high quality decisions emphasizing the importance of sustainable solutions to rapidly respond to urban pluvial flood disasters and related water and environment issues appropriate planning and an adaptive approach to policy implementation together with green infrastructure and low impact technologies should be pursued for their long term benefits 3 the government and water management administration should ask not only enterprises but residents to pay more attention to water resources and improve residents awareness of water conservation and environmental protection vulnerability analysis of the three main water consumption sectors reveal that the domestic unit is faced with more serious circumstances possibly because residents do not have access to comprehensive information regarding the troubling water situation we are approaching and thus maintain an optimistic perspective with blind faith for the future therefore it is urgent and obligatory to raise public consciousness concerning sustainable water management and social development 4 summary and conclusion in this study a modeling framework constructed by combining regional water authority and multiple water users was developed to carry out regional water system vulnerability analysis integrating blp and dea methodology regional water authority as the leader makes decisions to optimize objective functions by taking into account system wide constraints and followers objective functions while the followers optimize their own objective functions by considering the constraints of the lower level when the leader arrives at the optimal solution the followers must embrace the optimal solution and vice versa the proposed bi level dea with multi followers model was applied to the assessment of water system vulnerability in 19 regions along the yrb from 2013 to 2017 the results indicate that the bi level assessment framework is an effective and practical analytical tool for vulnerability analysis with advantages in opening the black box of internal operations and connections and demonstrating actual water management structures several conclusions can been drawn 1 the overall water system vs always falls between those of the upper and lower levels and the lower level subsystem vs falls among the industrial domestic and agricultural water users 2 the whole system obtains a score of 1 only if the vss of both the upper level and lower level are 1 and 3 the bi level dea with multi followers method can identify weaknesses and intuitively reveal the causes of this vulnerability furthermore because of the proposed model had access to deeply study the internal factors affecting poor performance several managerial insights were proposed for improvements firstly the most vulnerable areas should be pay more attention to secondly its vital to concentrate on sustainable stormwater and flood management since floods have brought destructive damage to the entire water system thirdly not only should government and water administrative take practical actions but more significantly individuals should raise awareness on water conservation and environmental protection this study has several limitations which need be reduced in future research this work only considered the case where there were identical followers in the bi level structure however it is common that the followers are different in amount or magnitude which requires in depth research in addition this study ignored the relationships between the following multiple followers further research should pay more attention to the connections between followers such as

5228,evaluating water system vulnerability is the first priority in water security management which is defined as measuring the degree of harm from exposure to stresses and the susceptibility and resilience of the system to human activities and natural causes as a means of comprehensively exploring such weaknesses and susceptibilities in the interest of future development this paper proposes a vulnerability evaluation framework that integrates bi level programming blp and data envelopment analysis dea with multi followers the water authority as the leader and industrial domestic and agricultural water users as the multiple followers a case study of 19 regions in the yangtze river basin between 2013 and 2017 is then introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bi level dea model it was found that water systems were vulnerable to damage by hazards that the domestic sector had the greatest effect on the whole and the proposed framework identifying more vulnerable and safer areas provided managerial insights the novelty of this paper is to put forward the vulnerability assessment framework of the regional water system which integrates water quantity contamination water related hazards and water use efficiency and reveals the structure of realistic water resource management to obtain more sensitive results keywords bi level dea method multiple followers water vulnerability assessment 1 introduction climate uncertainty population growth and changes in land use have been exerting increasing impacts on water resource systems and increasing water security risks rodrigues et al 2014 leading to increases in the vulnerability of global water resources mirauda and ostoich 2011 it has been reported that approximately 80 of the worlds population faces high level water security issues vörösmarty et al 2010 furthermore the imbalances between water supply and demand caused by the increasing water demand and decreasing water supply weaken the capacity of water resources systems to withstand external change foti et al 2014 assessing the vulnerability of water systems is an attempt to evaluate the magnitude of the threat and to provide a starting point for identifying effective remedial actions kelly and adger 2000 water resources vulnerability assessment is fundamental to this process has been a key issue and should be conducted first vulnerability as defined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc mccarthy et al 2001 is the extent to which climate change may damage or harm a system it depends not only on a systems sensitivity but also on its ability to adapt to new climatic conditions water vulnerability evaluation is a powerful analytical tool that can reveal potential sources of damage for the sake of taking appropriate actions to reduce the discovered vulnerability wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 and guiding normative analysis of efforts to reduce risk and enhance well being adger 2006 standardized quantification of urban water system vulnerability will play a critical role in societies definition and implementation of sustainable water resource management in the context of the changing environment adger 2006 in recent decades scholars have been reflecting on water vulnerability from diverse perspectives hashimoto et al 1982 treated vulnerability as how severe the likely consequences of failure may be to measure the magnitude of a failure occurring from the perspective of the water supply reservoir anandhi and kannan 2018 emphasized water availability to address stakeholders need to cope with the adverse effects of changes in water resources due to for example climate change population change and variability gogu and dassargues 2000 assessed groundwater vulnerability based on the fundamental concept that some land areas are more vulnerable to groundwater contamination than others vrba and zaporozec 1994 and concentrated on contamination xiang et al 2016 the use of an aquifer vulnerability assessment as a significant tool to protect aquifers from surface contamination has attracted the attention of many researchers hussein et al 2013 worrall and kolpin 2004 nadiri et al 2018 and entails two particular concepts intrinsic vulnerability determining the vulnerability of groundwater to pollutants from human activities and specific vulnerability determining the vulnerability of groundwater generated by a particular contaminant or group of contaminants many researchers have focused on vulnerability to natural water hazards flood or drought which result in social damage for example social vulnerability contexts and drivers of floods rufat et al 2015 a standardized drought vulnerability index framework oikonomou et al 2019 and vulnerability assessment miranda and ferreira 2019 however previous research has mostly focused on particular aspects of the problem and few papers have combined water quantity and quality and vulnerability to flood and drought to evaluate water system vulnerability with the involvement of water managers and water users many vulnerability assessment tools have been developed to measure the state of suffering from anthropomorphic and environmental stresses or the tolerance of climatic dynamics and hazards overlay and index methods include the driver pressure state impact response framework dpsir and the intergovernmental panel on climate changes framework ipccs anandhi and kannan 2018 and the epikarst protective cover infiltration conditions karst network development epik doerfliger et al 1999 which comprise the majority of methods employed in papers assessing water vulnerability however these multi attributes weighting rating methods which use a mass of indicators are vulnerable to subjectivity and not easily affected dea a nonparametric mathematical programming approach is a popular evaluation method and has been used by many researchers because of its objectivity in the absence of exact production functions for weighting the indexes wei et al 2004 systematically described dea as a practical method for assessing vulnerability to natural disasters and identifying the causes leading to regional change and variation xiang et al 2016 employed water contamination as an input output process in the dea evaluation model to assess the vulnerability of surface water to pollution and concluded that the water environment in a humid area with intensive human activity is more vulnerable to water quality concerns than to water quantity concerns huang et al 2012 used the dea method to identify multidimensional flood vulnerability to construct a scientific basis for policymaking and implementation of flood prevention and mitigation designs however these papers used the classic and conventional dea method considering it as a black box considering only the initial inputs and final outputs while failing to detect internal interactions and specific characteristics throughout water resource management systems blp methodology was proposed given the bi level nature of the distribution of water with regional water authority as the leader and water users as the follower engaging in planning to achieve their respective goals which have been subject to formal studies khorshidi et al 2019 used the leader follower game to determine the optimum 12 month operation policy of a reservoir to agricultural and environmental sectors sedghamiz et al 2018 established leader follower game model among agricultural water users leader follower framework was also used for designing of contamination warning system in water distribution network which helped to govern system in a resilient and safe manner and warrants practical implementation khorshidi et al 2019 we considered a bi level decision structure which is congruent with the structure of water resources management with authority as the leader and the industrial domestic and agricultural water users as the followers in the assessment vulnerability of water resources system the novelty of this leader follower vulnerability framework is that three types of water users industrial agricultural domestic user are considered which is different from the existing studies simply focusing on a part of water resource management irrigation or water contamination a bi level dea method integrating blp and data envelopment analysis dea with multi followers was proposed to evaluate water system vulnerability the vulnerabilities of the regions are identified through the multi inputs and multi outputs production process of the decision maker units dmu with upper level determining resources allocation from leader to followers in the bi level dea model the multiple followers water users are considered a means by which more specific fragile points and differences can be exposed and more details supplied water regional authority from a global perspective allocates water resources formulates sewage discharge standards manages hazards and responds to emergencies to enhance water system security and resilience water users mainly consider their own vital interests and adhere to water availability and pollutant emission standards from a local perspective the methodology proposed can open the black box and reveal the structure of realistic water resource management to obtain more sensitive results zhou et al 2018 detects inner processes and gathers information from vertical hierarchical decision makers to supply cogent managerial insights wu et al 2016 in addition results are presented over time since water vulnerability is a time dependent phenomenon that changes from year to year because of climatic variability rodrigues et al 2014 changes in land use and other uncertainties the main contributions of this paper are as follows 1 this paper first complements the existing research by proposing a new vulnerability assessment framework of the urban water system that integrates water quantity contamination water related hazards and water use efficiency based on previous studies 2 a bilevel dea evaluation model with multi followers is proposed to assess water system vulnerability with regional water authority as the leader and water users as the followers 3 the regions in the yangtze river basin are studied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and identify its potential weaknesses the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in the methodology section vulnerability assessment methods are discussed in detail in the application to the yangtze river basin section an actual case is described to prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in the summary and conclusion section comprehensive conclusions and future study extensions are presented 2 methodology in light of the wide research interest in water vulnerability assessment this study focuses on developing a bilevel dea with multi followers approach at first dea vulnerability assessment consisting of vulnerability frontier and vulnerability score is described to explain the implications of vulnerability frontier and probability set and elaborate how to calculate vulnerability scores then bilevel framework of the water resource management in river basin is described in detail and bilevel dea index system is determined according to the characteristics of vulnerability frontier at last water vulnerability evaluation model is proposed the flowchart in fig 1 provides an overview of the vulnerability scores evaluation process of the regional water system 2 1 dea vulnerability assessment 2 1 1 vulnerability frontier vulnerability frontier is opposite to the efficiency frontier in the conventional dea model which contains many well behaved performers this approach which measures the present degree of vulnerability is similar to bankruptcy assessment premachandra et al 2009 where the higher the score value the more fragile the system and the lower the score value the resilient the system contrary to previous applications we define the input indexes as illustrating the positive side the smaller they are the more vulnerable the evaluation system the output indexes represent the negative side the larger they are the greater the damage and loss these factors define a vulnerability frontier containing fragile performers in which non fragile healthy dmus are expected to exist inside a vulnerability probability set shaped by the vulnerability boundary due to the feature of inputs and outputs this approach seeks to find units with the worst performance to provide key objectives for managerial attention the proposed use of dea provides executives and researchers with quick and easy information for identifying failed performers premachandra et al 2009 fig 2 demonstrates the vulnerability frontier and the vulnerability possibility set located below the bankruptcy frontier 2 1 2 vulnerability score vulnerability evaluation recognizes the most affected units and explores the differences between vulnerable and stable regions in the context of a changeable and complex climate we define a vulnerability score vs representing the index of severity of water security in contrast to existing studies of cost efficiency zhou et al 2018 and profit efficiency wu et al 2016 vs is calculated as follows given j decision making units dmus being evaluated and indexed by j 1 2 j each of which has m input variables x i i 1 2 i and produces n output variables y r r 1 2 r with per unit costs v r attached to output for each evaluated region the vulnerability score of the jth dmu j 1 2 j is calculated using the linear programming lp problem below 1 vy max r 1 r v r y r s t x i j 1 j λ j x ij i 1 2 i y r j 1 j λ j y rj r 1 2 r x i y r λ j 0 j 1 2 j where y r λ j are decision variables and v r which represents the unit loss cost is attached to the damage caused outputs subject to the resource restrictions in the current water management environment note that in the overall system v r is assumed to be a unit and it is assumed that it is fixed and consolidated for the administration while among diverse water users it is a variable but is fixed from the perspective of individual users the above model allows substitutions in outputs and constrains the benchmarking units for dmu0 which can yield the existing vulnerability possibility set the maximum value requires a dea analysis which requires the solution of n linear programs one for each dmu based on the optimal solution y j λ j yielded by the above mathematical formula the vs of the evaluated dmu j is defined as the ratio of current status and the maximum tolerance in the water system as follows 2 vs j vy j v y j where vs satisfies 0 vs 1 vs 1 implying that dmu j is in a severe state conversely if vs is smaller than 1 it s more secure 2 2 regional water system vulnerability evaluation framework 2 2 1 bi level framework regional water system vulnerability assessment is performed here using a bi level process composed of the regional authority as the leader and water users as followers embracing multi periods the administrator in the upper level considers the magnitude of water stress to the regional system as a whole and identifies the conditions under which the system fails to satisfy both social development and ecological stability more precisely this process refers to the integrated analysis of contemporary water related states that exert an influence on society the economy and the environment water users in the lower level are mainly divided into three relatively independent water consumer groups industrial domestic and agricultural yan et al 2015 which individually pursue their objectives from a local perspective the connection between the upper and lower levels lies in the principle of water resource allocation based on water rights where each follower needs to reduce the volume of water consumed as much as possible within a given range to improve water efficiency while ensuring that the discharged wastewater meets the emission limits the leader allocates water resources according to the nature and characteristics of the multiple followers the allocations and utilization efficiencies among the different water user groups can be measured from an evaluation of the lower level when the regional authority makes a decision the whole procedure must be taken into account with the followers complying with the decision the conceptual significance of the bilevel structure is that it allows the vulnerability analysis to exhaustively consider the interrelationships and influences between water authority and multiple users and opens the black box of the system in multiple dimensions including water utilization contamination and hazards fig 3 illustrates the bilevel structure of water system vulnerability assessment we construct the vulnerability assessment framework to encompass multiple time periods and a bi level dea model is applied to regions located in the upper middle and lower reaches of the river basin the effects exerted on the regional water system and river basin are not temporary but are sustained with implications for both the near and long term this consideration is usually neglected resulting in a failure to consider the time change using panel data combining both vertical and horizontal factors above all the integrated model framework used to quantify regional water system vulnerability is a bi level model composed of one leader with multiple followers 2 2 2 input and output variable selection regional water system faces important challenges such as water supply and equitable allocation poff et al 2016 natural hazards including floods and droughts wei et al 2004 and water pollution xiang et al 2016 which impacts their ability to support human well being while maintaining healthy functioning ecosystems in this study three interrelated themes dominate the dimensions and direction of water vulnerability assessment water availability human vulnerability to hazards including water drought and inundation and water quality contamination given the nature of vulnerability assessment the selection of inputs and outputs is crucial for analysis and differs from that of the conventional dea model considering the whole system the smaller inferior values that could possibly cause water distress are considered to be input variables in contrast the larger superior values that could result in water security accidents and hence appear on the vulnerability frontier are classified as output variables at the upper level the assessment is focused on the key factors that affect the water supply capacity of the system including water quantity and the cost of natural hazards including floods and droughts areas with low water quantities are more likely to experience water shortages and would affect the functioning of the entire system while an increase in direct costs will increase the probability of water distress therefore the leader has two inputs total water resources water use per capita and two outputs direct economic loss water supply for department at the lower level the divergence among water users in terms of water usage and sewage discharge has characteristic impacts on water services and sustainable development followers with abundant contamination issues such as chemical organic demand cod and ammonia nitrogen an major water pollutants are expected to be more vulnerable hence there is one input water supply and two outputs cod and an these indicators have frequently been used in studies of vulnerability xiang et al 2016 wei et al 2004 and water security jensen and wu 2018 rodrigues et al 2014 2 3 bi level programming dea model with multi followers suppose that there are j dmus with a bi level hierarchical structure over t terms to be evaluated each system dmu in this study contains two decentralized subsystems a single water management authority as the leader and n water users as the multiple followers this kind of complicated situation is common in real life contexts and has a considerable influence on the overall system note that the intermediate values of the multiple followers are set by the leader in the bi level structure before establishing bilevel dea models various notations need to be introduced as follows indexes j the jth dmu j 1 2 j n the nth follower n 1 2 n t the tth period t 1 2 t parameters v t unit loss cost vector associated with the direct outputs of leader v f n 1 t unit loss cost vector associated with the cod emission of nth follower v f n 2 t unit loss cost vector associated with the an emission at nth follower λ vector of non negative multipliers used

nth follower function f t objective function for the leader f n t objective function for the nth follower 2 3 1 sub level efficiency a conceptual bi level programming dea model is shown in detail below the purpose of calculating a vulnerability score here is to identify the worst result which forms a vulnerability possibility frontier for the sake of providing a direction for possible improvements and generating suggestions for government the water authority as the leader at the upper level aims to measure the degree of fragility of the overall system by taking the lower level into account therefore the objective function of the leader is specified by the sum of the unit loss cost by multiplying the outputs and all the lower objective functions the objective and constraint conditions of the leader in period t are presented as the upper level objective 3 max y t λ t f t v t y t n 1 n v f n 1 t y f n 1 t v f n 2 t y f n 2 t the upper level constrains 4 s t x 1 t j 1 j x 1

users as the followers at the downstream level are regarded as independent participators who possess individual variables there are n decision makers in the lower level subsystem and each follower produces the corresponding outputs y f n 1 t and y f n 2 t after the leader determines the intermediate values z f n t to maximize f n t for observation we built a mathematical expression for the nth follower of the evaluated dmu and the lower subsystem consists of n 1 2 n models hence the maximum function for each water user in period t the lower level objectives 5 max y f n 1 t y f n 2 t π t f n

resulting in constrains z f n t j 1 j z f n t j λ j t at the upper level however z f n t is an undesirable input at the lower layer because the greater the water consumption the greater the vulnerability which results in constraints z f n t j 1 j z f n t j π j t 2 3 2 overall efficiency in a bilevel hierarchical structure if the water authority leader wants to optimize its goal it needs to take into account the goals and constraints of the multiple followers in conclusion the dea model for a bilevel system with multiple followers is presented as 7 max y t y f n 1 t y f n 2 t π t λ t

framework fig 3 to regions along the 6300 km 2 yangtze river basin yrb as seen in fig 4 e94 18 49 n35 10 47 to e121 23 50 n31 37 22 over a time period of five years to illustrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach yrb flows through total of 19 regions provinces municipalities and autonomous regions originating at tanggula mountain in qinghai province and eventually emptying into the donghai sea in shanghai this is the largest river basin in asia and in china and is the third largest in the world the yrb is rich in natural resources the yrb has significant economic social and environment relevance since it contributes approximately 36 percent of the countrys total river runoff and supplies water to approximately 400 million people with water for domestic industrial and agricultural use serving three different economic zones chinas eastern central and western zones and supporting numerous hydropower projects the majority of the basin is located in the humid subtropical region and is characterized by a warm humid climate but with an irregular distribution of both annual average temperatures and precipitation in both spatial and temporal dimensions urban development and related policies such as the grain for green project have resulted in changes in land use urban land classification grew by 67 5 while agriculture shrank by 7 5 and forests increased by 2 1 and vegetative cover between 2000 and 2015 these changes have led to an increased potential for floods of greater magnitude and frequency blöschl et al 2010 and affect hydrological outputs and rainfall runoff processes lin et al 2009 however the yrb still experiences a period of drought due to a combination of climate warming and accelerating water consumption in addition sewage from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors has increased pollution national bureau of statistics and ministry of environmental protection remarkably distinct regional differences exist for precipitation extremes cui et al 2019 hydrological extremes and flood risk fang et al 2018 this study considered 19 regions in the yrb as dmus and analyzed water system vulnerability from 2013 to 2017 data were obtained from the national bureau of statistics and the ministry of ecology and environment 3 2 results after solving the bi level dea model the following section presents the regional water vulnerability assessment scores and identifies weak points at the upper level and lower level subsystems as well as in the system as a whole figs 5 9 show the system and subsystem vss for 19 regions between 2013 and 2017 3 2 1 overall vss of 19 regions along the yrb between 2013 and 2017 in terms of the overall vss of 19 regions from 2013 to 2017 the scores fluctuate considerably among dmus with the lowest value close to zero while others values approach 1 as shown in fig 10 these discrepancies reveal that there are major differences in water management including water use efficiency water pollution and water hazards among the various regions of the yrb obviously there are identical peak points jiangsu henan guangdong sichuan shanxi and gansu and valley bottoms tibet and qinghai on these five lines the urban water systems in these areas are at the peak with high values representing poor performance in water management and high vulnerability and fragility while regions at the bottom indicate healthy water systems with relatively few water related problems remarkably the values of particular provinces showed large fluctuations in certain years for example anhui in 2016 had an abnormal value of 0 9410 indicating that it possesses a very fragile water environment compared with the other regions zhejiang reached 0 8261 and 0 7847 in 2013 and 2015 respectively while the evaluation values of the remaining regions fluctuated by approximately 0 4 similarly fujian hubei and hunan were all intense water environments in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively with high vulnerability values close to the frontier however they were relatively stable in other years as presented in figs 5 9 we find that guangdong had the highest score over four years due to having higher values at both the upper and lower levels compared to those of the other regions and that tibet had the lowest score because of lower values at both levels over five years the complete system vs always falls between the vss of the upper subsystem and the lower subsystem which takes into account integral elements instead of partial shanghai has a comparatively small vs for the whole system despite its efficiency at the upper level as the system efficiency is composed of each efficiency in each period the internal reasons for the vulnerability and instability of the whole bi level regional water system require further analysis to provide potential managerial insights for improving the stability of the system by paying more attention to a specific player 3 2 2 vs of the upper level subsystem from the perspective of the upper level subsystem centered on water resources administration shanghai jiangsu henan and guangdong always ranked first with scores of 1 leading to an upstream efficiency duration of five years however in the vulnerability assessment system these values represent the worst performances and most vulnerability in the decision making units dmus indicating the need for immediate attention which is distinct from the conventional dea evaluation method where efficient dmus indicate the best performers the high values of shanghai are primarily explained by the minimum amount of total water resources less than 10 billion m 3 compared to those of the other areas tibet for example possesses more than 400 billion m 3 of water excessive water consumption in jiangsu more than 50 billion m 3 each year was significantly higher than that in other regions the score of 1 for henan was caused by fewer water resources resulting in less water available per person both the higher water consumption of the three water users and high economic losses were the primary causes of the weakness in guangdong in addition shanxi and gansu obtained high scores in the vulnerability evaluation for the past five years due to economic losses and fewer abundant water resources obviously jiangxi tibet and qinghai had consistently lower scores indicating that these regions have healthy water systems according to data analysis appendix b the input indexes of these regions in a secure state are larger and the output indexes are lower than those of other regions which means that they have advantages in water resources utilization water resources availability and disaster management as shown in figs 5 9 the values for particular provinces exhibited large fluctuations in certain years the most likely reason for these abnormal years was that natural hazards caused considerable destruction of water systems and led to enormous damage for citizens taking fujian as an example the region was only on the vulnerability frontier in 2015 while its values in other years were all lower than 0 5 because in 2015 it suffered a large economic loss 223 70 billion yuan far higher than that in other years 14 31 billion yuan 5 61 billion yuan 38 22 billion yuan respectively with the other indexes remaining stationary moreover the score in 2016 was 0 4955 slightly higher than those in the remaining three years through specific analysis we can find that zhejiang hubei and hunan are facing the same problems for the same reasons we can draw the conclusion that stability of the water system is achievable despite major floods and mudslides in the upstream performance 3 2 3 vs of the lower level subsystem from the perspective of the lower level subsystem which is centered on multiple water users composed of industrial domestic and agricultural water sectors we found that the lower level subsystem vs always failed among the vss of the three water departments from 2013 to 2017 and that henan and hunan achieved maximum values of 1 in 2014 and 2015 respectively only when the three followers were simultaneously on the vulnerability frontier fig 9 presents the average values for the three water users for 19 regions in each period generally for all the evaluated regional water vulnerabilities the average vss of domestic water sector are highest among the three players and the vss of industrial water sector are relatively higher than the agricultural sector across the whole water system from 2014 to 2017 in 2013 there is no significant difference among the three values these results demonstrate that the vulnerability of domestic water users exert a greater influence on the water system than those of the other two users comparatively as shown in figs 5 9 there were existing differences among the three water users in each region some of which were significantly diverse taking the scores for hunan province from 2017 as an example the industrial sector scored 1 while the domestic and agriculture sectors were lower than 0 3 regions with high cod and an emissions all reached high values since these pollutants worsened water quality resulting in a deteriorating ecological environment making the water systems more fragile however regions with relatively low pollutant emissions such as tibet and qinghai also reached higher levels because the intensity of their emissions relative to water consumption was relatively high although the amounts were small this finding can be confirmed by the example of jiangsu where high agricultural pollutant emissions had relatively low values due to high water consumption all the tables and figures mentioned above exhibit these three major findings see table 1 1 five regions jiangsu henan guangdong sichuan shanxi and gansu have been faced with major problems in water resource management since they reached higher vss each year suggesting that they require increased attention 2 water systems are highly susceptible to natural hazards especially floods which damage the entire system 3 from the results presented in figs 5 9 the overall water system vs always falls between those of the upper and lower levels and lower lever subsystem vs fall among the industrial domestic and agricultural water users the domestic sector contributed the most to vs while the agricultural sector contributed the least downstream 3 3 managerial insights the proposed methodology reflects the realistic structure of water management and is deeply analyzed internally simultaneously incorporating water management and water users to more accurately identify vulnerability based on the preceding findings through the results of the past five years some policy suggestions are given to assist government decision makers in meeting the challenges presented by these different weaknesses 1 appropriate efforts should be made to strengthen government legislation and policies in the most vulnerable areas jiangsu henan guangdong and shanxi obtained highly vulnerable scores in all five years because of both high upstream and downstream values implying that their poor performance in water management is attributable to both water utilization and pollutant discharge and the both factors require increased attention properly upgraded emissions policies are required to alleviate the situation and provide an escape from ecological degradation 2 it is crucial to establish guidelines and improved practices concerning the construction operation and maintenance of stormwater and flood management it is obvious from the results of the bi level model that natural hazards caused by floods and drought especially floods have great impacts on regional water systems and drive large and diverse potential societal damage implementing sustainable urban stormwater management is an effective method for flood relief and for reducing the influence of hydrological balance qiao et al 2018 however development of contemporary urban stormwater management facilities have lagged behind development of infrastructure due to the uncertainties rooted in climate change interacting with spatial heterogeneity increasing vulnerability to flooding jiang et al 2018 therefore it requires a wide perspective and high quality decisions emphasizing the importance of sustainable solutions to rapidly respond to urban pluvial flood disasters and related water and environment issues appropriate planning and an adaptive approach to policy implementation together with green infrastructure and low impact technologies should be pursued for their long term benefits 3 the government and water management administration should ask not only enterprises but residents to pay more attention to water resources and improve residents awareness of water conservation and environmental protection vulnerability analysis of the three main water consumption sectors reveal that the domestic unit is faced with more serious circumstances possibly because residents do not have access to comprehensive information regarding the troubling water situation we are approaching and thus maintain an optimistic perspective with blind faith for the future therefore it is urgent and obligatory to raise public consciousness concerning sustainable water management and social development 4 summary and conclusion in this study a modeling framework constructed by combining regional water authority and multiple water users was developed to carry out regional water system vulnerability analysis integrating blp and dea methodology regional water authority as the leader makes decisions to optimize objective functions by taking into account system wide constraints and followers objective functions while the followers optimize their own objective functions by considering the constraints of the lower level when the leader arrives at the optimal solution the followers must embrace the optimal solution and vice versa the proposed bi level dea with multi followers model was applied to the assessment of water system vulnerability in 19 regions along the yrb from 2013 to 2017 the results indicate that the bi level assessment framework is an effective and practical analytical tool for vulnerability analysis with advantages in opening the black box of internal operations and connections and demonstrating actual water management structures several conclusions can been drawn 1 the overall water system vs always falls between those of the upper and lower levels and the lower level subsystem vs falls among the industrial domestic and agricultural water users 2 the whole system obtains a score of 1 only if the vss of both the upper level and lower level are 1 and 3 the bi level dea with multi followers method can identify weaknesses and intuitively reveal the causes of this vulnerability furthermore because of the proposed model had access to deeply study the internal factors affecting poor performance several managerial insights were proposed for improvements firstly the most vulnerable areas should be pay more attention to secondly its vital to concentrate on sustainable stormwater and flood management since floods have brought destructive damage to the entire water system thirdly not only should government and water administrative take practical actions but more significantly individuals should raise awareness on water conservation and environmental protection this study has several limitations which need be reduced in future research this work only considered the case where there were identical followers in the bi level structure however it is common that the followers are different in amount or magnitude which requires in depth research in addition this study ignored the relationships between the following multiple followers further research should pay more attention to the connections between followers such as

5229,the present study uses hourly rainfall measurements from 36 raingauge stations in the northeastern united states with more than 55 years of recordings to assess the accuracy and robustness of three conceptually different parametric approaches to produce intensity duration frequency idf curves from rainfall records a the well celebrated parametric idf model based on annual maxima am series initially introduced by rossi and villani 1994 and later extended by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 b a peaks over threshold pot model based on proper fitting of a reparametrized generalized pareto gp distribution to the scaled excesses of the average rainfall intensity over various durations d and c the analytical approximation introduced by langousis et al 2009 for estimation of multifractal mf rainfall maxima since its development the third approach has never been tested in real world applications and or compared to routinely used approaches for idf curve estimation the obtained results show that the mf approach may constitute an important tool for hydrological applications as it produces more accurate and robust idf estimates than the other two approaches irrespective of the duration d and return period t of interest especially in cases where rainfall records exhibit significant length limitations in addition the parameters of the mf analytical approximation are found to be descriptive of the local topography and rainfall climatology of the region providing a physically meaningful modeling setting that is particularly suited for regional frequency analysis and idf estimation at ungauged locations keywords rainfall extremes extreme value and extreme excess theories multifractal theory intensity duration frequency curves annual maxima series peaks over threshold series 1 introduction hydrological modeling and design require accurate and robust estimates of extreme rainfall over a wide range of characteristic temporal scales and exceedance probability levels thus following the early works of sherman 1931 and bernard 1932 intensity duration frequency idf curves have been a major focus for statistical hydrologists see e g the textbooks of eagleson 1970 chow et al 1988 and singh 1992 and rossi and villani 1994 burlando and rosso 1996 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 koutsoyiannis et al 1998 willems 2000 menabde and sivapalan 2000 asquith and famiglietti 2000 veneziano and furcolo 2002 castro et al 2004 langousis and veneziano 2007 langousis et al 2009 and tyralis and langousis 2019 among many others define id to be the average rainfall intensity inside duration d imax d to be the maximum of id in a year and denote by id t the value of imax d exceeded with probability p imax d id t 1 yr t where t is the return period in years idf curves represent the relationship of id t with d and t see e g koutsoyiannis et al 1998 langousis and veneziano 2007 veneziano et al 2007 langousis et al 2009 van de vyver and demarée 2010 and tyralis and langousis 2019 among others for temporal scales d above the nominal resolution of the rainfall record and for return periods t below its length id t can be calculated directly from the empirical distribution of annual rainfall maxima for larger return periods t one should rely on parametric approaches i e fitting a proper theoretical distribution model to the annual rainfall maxima or to the rainfall excesses above a properly selected threshold or use a stochastic model of rainfall a widely used parametric approach to construct idf curves is based on the statistical analysis of annual maxima am series see e g bernard 1932 demarée 1985 cunnane 1973 madsen and pearson 1997a b koutsoyiannis et al 1998 katz et al 2002 gellens 2002 overeem et al 2008 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 according to this approach one averages the available series of historical rainrates over pre specified durations dj j 1 2 extracts the annual maxima imax d and models them using a theoretical distribution model with parameters that depend on d selection of the model is usually based on extreme value ev theory and more precisely on the assumption that unless degenerate asymptotically as t imax d is attracted to an extreme type distribution that belongs to the gev generalized exreme value family see e g fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 jenkinson 1955 and more recently coles 2001 langousis et al 2016 and lucarini et al 2016 subsequently the fitted theoretical distribution model is used to acquire estimates of 1 1 t quantiles for various combinations of d t conditional on d and fit a parametric relationship of the separable type id t α t b d where α and b are positively valued functions see e g raudkivi 1979 chow et al 1988 wanielista 1990 singh 1992 and more recently koutsoyiannis et al 1998 and veneziano et al 2007 over the years various parametric forms of the functions α and b have been suggested see e g bernard 1932 raudkivi 1979 subramanya 1984 chow et al 1988 wanielista 1990 singh 1992 koutsoyiannis et al 1998 and shaw et al 2017 initially algebraic forms were chosen based on empirical arguments but later their validity was substantiated in the context of multifractal scale invariance see e g hubert et al 1998 veneziano and furcolo 2002 veneziano and langousis 2005a veneziano et al 2006a b 2007 2009 langousis and veneziano 2007 langousis et al 2009 2013 veneziano and yoon 2013 garcía marín et al 2013 and the reviews in veneziano and langousis 2010 and tyralis and langousis 2019 rossi and villani 1994 and koutsoyiannis et al 1998 proposed an improvement to the aforementioned parametric approach assuming that the idf curves are separable in d and t where estimation of α t can be conducted by fitting a theoretical distribution model to the entire sample independent of d of the standardized annual rainfall maxima x imax d b d which are assumed to be duration independent see also section 3 1 koutsoyiannis et al 1998 also suggested numerical procedures to estimate the parameters c 0 1 and δ 0 of function b d d δ c from data an important note to be made here is that dependence of id t on d is not based on theory which can be considered a weakness of the parametric approach based on am see e g tyralis and langousis 2019 furthermore since the distribution of the yearly maxima under pre asymptotic conditions that is for finite t may not comply with an extreme type distribution the dependence of id t on t needs to be also verified to some extent see e g veneziano et al 2009 langousis et al 2013 and veneziano and yoon 2013 another maybe more important limitation of the parametric approach based on am is that it uses only the historical annual maxima neglecting the largest portion of information present in the historical rainfall record consequently the estimated distribution parameters and corresponding idf values i e conditional quantiles may exhibit significant variability as well as sensitivity to outliers see e g coles and tawn 1996 coles et al 2003 koutsoyiannis 2004 deidda 2010 and langousis et al 2013 2016 when continuous rainfall data is available t may be calculated conditional on the rate at which a properly selected threshold intensity u is exceeded in this context and similar to the parametric approach based on am one averages the available series of historical rainrates over pre specified durations dj j 1 2 extracts the series of the excesses above u usually referred to as partial duration series pds or peaks over threshold pot series see e g davison and smith 1990 wang 1991 rosbjerg and madsen 1992 1995 madsen and pearson 1997a b 2002 lang et al 1999 willems 2000 deidda and puliga 2006 cooley et al 2007 veneziano et al 2007 deidda 2010 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 among others and models them using a theoretical distribution model with parameters that depend on d see e g madsen et al 2002 2009 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 and chang et al 2013 selection of the model is usually based on extreme excess ee theory and more precisely on the assumption that unless degenerate asymptotically as u and p id u 0 the scaled excesses id u id u id u are attracted to a generalized pareto gp distribution see e g balkema and de haan 1974 pickands 1975 leadbetter et al 1983 and more recently coles 2001 langousis et al 2016 and lucarini et al 2016 approximate convergence of id u to a gp distribution under pre asymtotic conditions i e for moderately high values of u is supported by empirical evidence see e g martins and stedinger 2001a b deidda and puliga 2006 veneziano et al 2007 2009 deidda 2010 veneziano and yoon 2013 papalexiou et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 and langousis et al 2016 while both am and pot approaches should lead asymptotically to the same results as t one would expect the pot approach to be more suitable than the am approach for estimation of extreme quantiles as it accounts for a larger portion of the available information nevertheless to consistently apply the pot approach for extreme excess ee modeling one needs to determine for each pre specified duration dj j 1 2 a proper threshold u d to extract pds from the available data selection of an appropriate threshold is not a trivial issue due to its dependence on the duration d the presence of quantization in the data a quite common case in rainfall records and the additional constraints that the selected threshold should be high enough to ensure validity of the gp assumption and at the same time maintain a sufficient amount of data to avoid unnecessary increase of the estimation variance of the gp distribution parameters see e g rosbjerg and madsen 1992 lang et al 1999 adamowski 2000 coles 2001 deidda and puliga 2006 tancredi et al 2006 deidda 2010 chavez demoulin and davison 2012 scarrott and macdonald 2012 and langousis et al 2016 an alternative approach which avoids indirect parametric assumptions on the calculated rainfall maxima is to fit a stochastic model of temporal rainfall to the continuous historical record and then use the fitted model to generate synthetic rainfall time series through monte carlo simulation see e g chow et al 1988 singh 1992 langousis and veneziano 2007 and tyralis and langousis 2019 the synthetic ensembles can then be used to construct empirical idf curves by extracting and sorting the annual block maxima corresponding to various durations d and applying a plotting position formula in this context all available data is used to fit the model and no a priori assumption is made on the parametric form of the estimated idfs yet this conceptually more appealing approach is rarely followed in practice because of the complexities of formulating stochastic rainfall models estimating their parameters and generating monte carlo samples see langousis and veneziano 2007 over the years different classes of stochastic rainfall models have been introduced one class includes first order second moment based schemes see e g valencia and schaake 1973 valencia and schaake 1972 and the reviews in salas 1993 and koutsoyiannis and langousis 2011 a second class comprises of stochastic rainfall generators based on point processes and rainfall pulses see e g lecam 1961 waymire and gupta 1981a c rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 1988 entekhabi et al 1989 onof and wheater 1993 1994 velghe et al 1994 cowpertwait 1995 1998 verhoest et al 1997 onof et al 2000 willems 2001 veneziano et al 2002 veneziano and iacobellis 2002 segond et al 2007 onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 pohle et al 2018 and the review in koutsoyiannis and langousis 2011 the third class consists of stochastic rainfall models based on multifractal scale invariance see e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 lovejoy and schertzer 1995 perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 menabde et al 1997 olsson 1998 deidda 2000 menabde and sivapalan 2000 güntner et al 2001 ahrens 2003 venugopal et al 2006 paulson and baxter 2007 veneziano and lepore 2012 müller and haberlandt 2018 and the reviews in venugopal et al 2006 and veneziano and langousis 2010 the last class of models is particularly engaging for three reasons first multifractal scale invariance demonstrates good performance in reproducing the intermittent character and statistical structure of rainfall at multiple temporal scales see e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 lovejoy and schertzer 1995 olsson et al 1993 gupta and waymire 1993 marsan et al 1996 over and gupta 1996 menabde et al 1997 harris et al 1998 venugopal et al 1999 2006 deidda et al 1999 and langousis and veneziano 2007 this is typically true for durations d from about one hour to several days see e g tessier et al 1993 lovejoy and schertzer 1995 olsson 1995 de lima and grasman 1999 and the review in veneziano and langousis 2010 second multifractal rainfall models have been used to investigate the scaling properties of extreme rainfall under asymptotic and pre asymptotic conditions see e g hubert et al 1998 veneziano and furcolo 2002 veneziano and langousis 2005a langousis et al 2009 2013 veneziano et al 2009 and veneziano and yoon 2013 as well as their dependence on geographical and climatic features see e g veneziano and lepore 2012 and innocenti et al 2017 finally regarding idf curve estimation multifractal rainfall models manifest significantly fewer parameters relative to other types of stochastic rainfall generators while allowing for idf characterization based on theoretical arguments see langousis et al 2009 more precisely langousis et al 2009 developed an analytical approximation for idf curve estimation in the case when temporal rainfall exhibits approximate multifractal scale invariance the method exploits the statistical structure of rainfall at multiple time scales utilizing information from the complete rainfall record rather than a small portion of it i e rainfall excesses above a properly selected threshold or annual maxima while promising since its development the method had never been tested in real world rainfall data and or compared to routinely used approaches for idf curve estimation in the present study we seek to investigate the potential of the analytical approximation introduced by langousis et al 2009 for multifractal rainfall maxima in statistically characterizing extreme rainfall at multiple temporal resolutions and producing idf curves and compare it to a the parametric idf model based on annual maxima am series as implemented by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 and b a peaks over threshold pot model based on proper fitting of a reparameterized generalized pareto gp distribution to the scaled excesses of the average rainfall intensity over various durations d followed by log linear regression of its corresponding parameters the analysis is conducted using hourly rainfall measurements from 36 raingauge stations in the northeastern united states with more than 55 years of recordings where model based idf estimates obtained based on various record lengths i e through random bootstrapping of the years in record are compared to empirical idf estimates obtained from the full record quantitative assessment is done in terms of relative bias and dimensionless root mean squared error drmse and the spatial variation of both idf estimates and model parameter values is evaluated in the light of the topographic features and the rainfall climatology of the region in section 2 below we provide necessary information regarding the origin and processing of the rainfall data used section 3 details the relevant theory methodological framework and technical aspects of the three idf estimation methods while presenting details on technical aspects of the implemented comparison a comprehensive discussion of the

is referred to barbero et al 2017 3 models and methods for idf curve estimation 3 1 historical series of annual rainfall maxima am approach following the approach of koutsoyiannis et al 1998 for idf curve estimation from historical annual maxima id t is assumed separable in d and t receiving the form 1 i d t α t b d where b d d δ c and α t is obtained by fitting a theoretical distribution model to the entire sample of the standardized annual rainfall maxima x imax d b d which are assumed to be duration independent following the two step approach of koutsoyiannis et al 1998 estimation of c 0 1 and δ 0 involves minimization of the kruskal wallis statistic see e g kruskal and wallis 1952 and more recently siegel and castellan 1988 and corder and foreman 2009 of the standardized historical annual maxima x so they can be effectively assumed to belong to the same population here we set δ 0 as it is found to minimally affect the obtained idf values while considering it as a free parameter increases the uncertainty of the obtained estimates having c determined α t is obtained by fitting a theoretical distribution model with parameters independent of d to the standardized annual maxima sample here we use the generalized extreme value gev distribution model with cumulative distribution function 2 g max x exp 1 k x μ σ 1 k where k σ and μ denote the shape scale and location parameters of the distribution respectively for parameter estimation we use the method of probability weighted moments pwm which has been proved to produce robust estimates even in the case of small sample sizes see e g greenwood et al 1979 landwehr et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 hosking 1990 1992 koutsoyiannis 2004 trefry et al 2005 and langousis et al 2013 for low sample sizes some stations may exhibit negative shape parameter values corresponding to upper bounded distributions for the annual maxima an assumption that is not readily justified by empirical evidence see e g koutsoyiannis 2004 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2006 2013 papalexiou et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 langousis et al 2016 and references therein unless attributed to statistical variability in brief in order for rainfall extremes to be upper bounded all marginal and finite dimensional joint distributions of rainfall rates i e over all possible durations should necessarily be upper bounded and therefore a much more general assumption should hold that is the rainfall process to exhibit a physical upper bound since from a physical perspective the rainfall process cannot simultaneously exhibit as implied by negative shape parameter estimates and not exhibit as implied by positive shape parameter estimates an upper bound it follows that negative and positive shape parameter estimates cannot coexist unless attributed to statistical variability in order to minimize the uncertainty of the obtained idf estimates in our analysis we have set all obtained negative k values to zero i e corresponding to a gumbel distribution model and re estimated the remaining model parameters i e σ and μ conditional on k 0 the aforementioned rational was based on the fact that when using the complete series of annual rainfall maxima from each of the 36 stations considered only 6 stations resulted in negative shape parameter estimates with values ranging between 0 0947 and 0 0026 for illustration purposes fig 2 shows the complementary cdf ccdf of a gev theoretical distribution model fitted to the standardized historical rainfall maxima for raingauge station usc00302454 in the northeastern unites states with 61 years of hourly recordings and compares it to the ccdf obtained empirically once all four model parameters μ σ k and c have been estimated the idf values can be calculated by applying eq 1 with α t g max 1 1 1 t where t is the return period in years an important note to be made here is that the am method of koutsoyiannis et al 1998 standardizes and uses more than one rainfall maxima values from each year i e corresponding to different durations d see discussion on eq 1 above making it applicable also to rainfall records with significant length limitations i e 1 2 years of data 3 2 series of rainfall peaks over threshold pot approach suppose that above a properly selected threshold u the scaled excesses id u id u id u of the average rainfall intensity id inside duration d follow a generalized pareto gp distribution model with cdf see e g balkema and de haan 1974 pickands 1975 leadbetter et al 1983 and more recently coles 2001 lucarini et al 2016 and langousis et al 2016 3 f i d u x 1 1 k d x u a u d 1 k d k d 0 1 exp x u a u d k d 0 where k d is the distribution shape parameter αu d the scale parameter and u is the threshold value in this case the scaled excesses id u id u id u above any threshold u u should also follow a gp distribution model with the same shape parameter k and scale parameter αu that is a linear function of u 4 α u d α u d k d u u for the purpose of idf curve estimation we use the aforementioned property to reparameterize the gp distribution fitted to the scaled excesses of the average rainfall intensity id inside duration d in a threshold invariant way to do so we select to use the multiple threshold method mtm developed by deidda 2010 with a pwm probability weighted moments see e g greenwood et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 hosking and wallis 1987 1997 hosking 1990 1992 and deidda and puliga 2009 estimator applied to the historical rainfall series averaged over different durations d mtm is a robust parameter estimation method that avoids convergence related issues in the case of highly quantized data which is usually the case for rainfall see e g deidda and puliga 2009 and langousis et al 2016 more precisely mtm is based on proper standardization reparameterization of the gp model to zero threshold allowing for multiple fits using a range of possible thresholds thus minimizing uncertainties in model parameter estimation see deidda 2010 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 for u 0 eq 3 reduces to the form 5 f i d 0 x 1 1 k d x a 0 d 1 k d k d 0 1 exp x a 0 d k d 0 in applying the mtm method for each duration d and selected threshold u we estimate the probability zu d p id u directly from data and the parameters au d and k d by applying the pwm parameter estimation method to the scaled rainfall excesses above threshold u i e id u id u for a detailed description of the pwm method the reader is referred to hosking 1992 and hosking and wallis 1987 1997 at a next step for each duration d and selected threshold u we calculate the reparameterized standardized to zero threshold scale parameter a 0 d and the probability z 0 d p id 0 using see deidda 2010 6 a 0 d a u d k d u z 0 d z u d 1 k d u a 0 d 1 k d k d 0 z u d exp u a 0 d k d 0 f o r a n y u 0 for each duration d we obtain the threshold invariant parameters z 0 d a 0 d and k d in eq 5 using the median of the corresponding parameter estimates deidda 2010 obtained by fitting a gp model to the excesses above different thresholds u in the range between the 50 and 99 empirical quantiles of non zero rainfall as a final step and in accordance with extreme value and extreme excess limit theorems see e g coles 2001 and more recently lucarini et al 2016 and langousis et al 2016 we assume a duration independent shape parameter the latter is obtained by averaging the corresponding shape parameter estimates over all durations 7 k 1 m d a l l d k d where md is the total number of different durations d considered in addition we model the dependence of z 0 d and a 0 d on d in a continuous setting by least square fitting log linear expressions to the empirical estimates 8 z 0 d s d g 9 α 0 d h d c where s g h and c are parameter constants once all five model parameters s g h c and k have been estimated following deidda 2010 and assuming that the average rainfall intensities inside non overlapping d intervals are independent and identically distributed iid random variables the idf curves are calculated as 10 i d t α 0 d k 1 1 1 t 1 n z 0 d k 1 k 0 α 0 d ln 1 1 1 t 1 n z 0 d k 0 where k z 0 d and a 0 d are given by eqs 7 8 and 9 respectively and n is the number of d intervals in a year that is n 365 d for d in days it follows from eq 10 that contrary to the am approach to idf curve estimation presented in section 3 1 the obtained idf curves based on the suggested pot setting hereafter referred to as the pot approach are not separable in d t for raingauge usc00302454 used in section 3 1 fig 3 illustrates how the empirical distribution of positive rainfall intensities and the fitted gp distribution model in eq 5 vary with duration d one sees that as the duration d increases the distribution moves towards lower rainfall intensity values fig 4 illustrates the dependence of the estimated gp parameters z 0 d and a 0 d on d together with the corresponding fits of the log linear expressions in eqs 8 and 9 one sees that independent of the duration d the fitted gp model approximates well the empirical distribution of positive rainfall intensities see fig 3 in addition as shown in fig 4 and in accordance with empirical evidence and physical expectations z 0 d p id 0 increases with the duration d whereas the scale parameter a 0 d that is an indicator of the dispersion of the distribution of positive rainrates decreases with increasing d in an algebraic way 3 3 analytical approximation for multifractal idf curve estimation mf approach temporal rainfall is said to be stationary multifractal if its statistics remain unchanged when the time axis is contracted by a factor r 1 and the intensity is multiplied by a non negative unit mean random variable ar see e g gupta and waymire 1993 burlando and rosso 1996 veneziano 1999 and the review in veneziano and langousis 2010 in this case 11 i d d a r i rd r d d 1 where d denotes equality in all finite dimensional distributions and d is the upper limit of the scaling range typically on the order of several days see e g venugopal et al 2006 langousis and veneziano 2007 langousis et al 2009 2013 and references therein a frequent choice to model the intermittent and highly variable character of rainfall is to use a beta lognormal model for the distribution of ar see e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 over and gupta 1996 schmitt et al 1998 veneziano and langousis 2005a b langousis and veneziano 2007 langousis et al 2013 langousis and kaleris 2013 and the reviews in veneziano et al 2006a b and veneziano and langousis 2010 in this case ar in eq 11 is obtained as the product of two independent random factors a continuous random variable aln r with lognormal distribution i e ln aln r n μ σ 2 where μ cln ln r and σ 2 2cln ln r and an indicator random variable aβ r that satisfies p aβ r 0 1 r c β and p aβ r r c β r c β hence 12 a r 0 with probability 1 r c β r c β exp c ln ln r q 2 c ln in r with probability r c β where q n 0 12 is a standard normal variable and cβ and cln are non negative parameters that satisfy cβ cln 1 see e g langousis and veneziano 2007 more precisely cβ controls the lacunarity of the rainfall field i e cβ 0 for compact rainfall and cln controls the amplitude of the multifractal fluctuations when it rains with the two parameters exhibiting typical ranges from 0 4 to 0 6 and from 0 05 to 0 1 respectively see e g langousis et al 2009 it follows from eq 11 that for the case of beta lognormal multifractal processes the moments of the average rainfall intensity id inside duration d scale as 13 e i d q d k q for q q where q denotes the moment order 14 k q lo g r e a r q c β q 1 c ln q 2 q is the associated moment scaling function and q 1 cβ cln 1 is the lowest moment order larger than 1 such that e id q diverges see e g kahane and peyriène 1976 schertzer and lovejoy 1987 and more recently the reviews in venugopal et al 2006 and veneziano and langousis 2010 hence one can study the scaling properties of temporal rainfall and subsequently obtain the multifractal parameters cβ and cln from the available rainfall data by see e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 langousis et al 2009 2013 langousis and kaleris 2014 and the review in veneziano and langousis 2010 1 plotting the initial moments e id ī q of different orders q as a function of the duration d where ī denotes the mean rainfall intensity 2 estimating k q as the negative slope of loge id ī q against logd and 3 least square fitting eq 14 to the empirical k q values from step 2 for raingauge usc00302454 used in sections 3 1 and 3 2 fig 5 shows log log plots of the empirical moments e id ī q q 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 of the standardized to mean 1 rainfall process as a function of the duration d the reason why we consider moment orders that do not exceed q 3 is that for highly intermittent random fields as is the case for temporal rainfall moment orders q 3 are underestimated with high probability see e g ossiander and waymire 2000 2002 lashermes et al 2004 veneziano et al 2006a b langousis and veneziano 2007 veneziano and furcolo 2009 and the review in veneziano and langousis 2010 fig 6 shows empirical circles and theoretical solid lines estimates of the moment scaling function k q the theoretical estimates have been obtained by least square fitting the expression in eq 14 to the negative slopes of loge id ī q against logd for q 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 after estimating the parameters cβ and cln of the beta lognormal multifractal process one can use the analytical approximation developed by langousis et al 2009 to derive idf curves according to this approximation 15 i d t r r 0 c β c ln e 2 c l n ln r r 0 φ 1 1 r r 0 c β d r t t t r i r t t r c l n 1 c β t t r where r d d φ 1 is the inverse of the standard normal cdf d is the value of d for which e id ī 3 r 0 2 c β 6 c ln is a model constant that depends on the parameter set cβ cln and can be obtained from fig 2 in langousis et al 2009 or equivalently fig 3 in langousis et al 2013 and 16 i r r r 0 2 c β c ln a t r d r 2 π 2 ln r r 0 1 c β 2 c ln 1 2 r r 0 1 c β 2 c l n c β b it follows from eq 15 that the idf model suggested by langousis et al 2009 based on multifractal scaling arguments hereafter referred to as the mf approach produces idf curves that are not separable in d t and has four parameters cβ cln d and ī 3 4 bootstrapping and benchmarking to assess the relative performance of the idf models described in the previous subsections with respect to the length n of the available data we consider six different sample sizes n n 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 years and for each station analyzed we 1 randomly bootstrap the available years to create one ensemble for each of the different sample sizes n n 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 years considered each consisting of n 50 ensemble members of size equal to n years 2 apply the annual maxima am peaks over threshold pot and multifractal mf idf estimation methods to each ensemble member from 1 to estimate the parameters of each model and calculate model based idf values for various durations d 1 2 4 12 24 48 h and return periods t 5 10 25 50 years 3 use the results from 2 to develop idf and model parameter maps and also quantitatively assess the accuracy and robustness of the model based idfs as a function of the sample size n relative to those obtained empirically using the full record length calculation of the empirical idf curves at each station is conducted by averaging the available series of historical rainrates over pre specified durations d 1 2 4 12 24 48 h extracting and ranking the annual rainfall maxima for each d and calculating the corresponding exceedance probabilities using the weibull 1939 plotting position formula see e g singh 1992 and makkonen 2006 fig 7 shows empirical and model based idf curves for station usc00302454 for return periods t 5 10 25 50 100 and 1000 years obtained using the full record length that is 61 years for the empirical idf estimates we have applied log linear interpolation in t one sees that independent of the duration d all three methods tend to produce similar results indicating a slight underestimation of the empirical idf values with the pot and mf methods being the less and better performing ones respectively and the am method lying in between note however that the similar performances of the methods are due to the considerably large size of the sample that is 61 years as shown in the next section for smaller sample sizes the relative performances of the methods differ significantly 4 results and discussion 4 1 idf estimates fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of model based idf values for duration d 1 h and return period t 50 years calculated by ensemble averaging the results obtained using the am fig 8c e pot fig 8f h and mf fig 8i k methods for different sample sizes n 2 left column 10 central column and 50 years right column and compares it to the spatial distribution of the empirical idf values obtained from the full record length fig 8b in view of the elevation map of the study region fig 8a all maps have been created using triangulated irregular network based linear interpolation similar maps of model based idf values for durations d 1 and 24 h and return periods t 10 and 50 years are presented in the supporting information see figs s 1 s 3 one sees that rainfall intensifies close to the shore of delaware and maryland see 40 n 76 w in figs 1 and 8 due to the storm landfall that frequently occurs in the region and reduces gradually as one moves inland the lowest rainfall intensity values are observed on the northwestern side of the mountainous regions of new york that is adirondack mountains see 44 n 74 w in figs 1 and 8 and new england the green mountains and the white mountains see 44 n 72 5 w and 44 n 71 5 w respectively in figs 1 and 8 which serve as rain barriers for the western slopes and valleys causing rain shadow effects see e g singh 1992 and koutsoyiannis and langousis 2011 the white mountains in new hampshire which form part of the northern appalachian mountains also have a pronounced effect on the disentification of rainfall due to rain shadow effects see 44 n 71 5 w in fig 8 when comparing the spatial patterns of empirical idf estimates fig 8b to those obtained by the three models one sees that the am method fig 8c e is more sensitive to the length n of the available data than the pot and mf methods fig 8f k while all approaches tend to produce similar results and approximate well the spatial pattern of empirical idf values for large sample sizes e g n 50 years see right column in fig 8 and fig 8b to quantitatively assess the accuracy and robustness of model based idf estimates as a function of the duration d return period t and sample size n we use the average relative error also referred to as relative bias rb see eq 17 and the dimensionless root mean squared error drmse see eq 18 17 r b d t n 1 n s j 1 n s i d t n j i d t i d t 18 d r m s e d t n 1 n s j 1 n s i d t n j i d t i d t 2 where id t denotes the empirical idf estimate obtained for a certain station using the full record length available i d t n j denotes the corresponding model based idf value obtained using ensemble member j j 1 2 n s of the 50 member ensemble corresponding to sample size n n 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 years and n s is the total number of samples members in the ensemble in our case n s 50 see also section 3 4 fig 9 shows the relative bias rb of model based idf estimates obtained using the am blue pot green and mf red approaches averaged over all 36 stations as a function of the sample size n for durations d 2 and 24 h and return periods t 5 10 25 and 50 years one sees that irrespective of the duration d the magnitude of the relative bias of the am approach is larger for higher return periods t and increases significantly for sample sizes n 10 years the latter increase has its origin in the implicit assumption of the koutsoyiannis et al 1998 idf estimation method which standardizes and uses more than one rainfall maxima values corresponding to different durations d see section 3 1 from each year these values are not fully independent and for small sample sizes they affect significantly the obtained idf estimates leading to pronounced negative biases large negative biases are also produced by the pot approach described in section 3 2 we have investigated this issue in some detail and concluded that it is mainly due to two reasons the first is the exponent 1 n in eq 10 more precisely in the current formulation of the pot approach n is set equal to the number of d intervals in a year that is n 365 d for d in days whereas from a statistical point of view it corresponds to the number of independent d intervals in a year the latter is a fraction of the nominal number of d intervals in a year which depends on d the other reason is the assumption of a duration independent gp shape parameter in eq 7 while under asymptotic conditions the shape parameter k of a gp distribution model fitted to the rainfall excesses should be independent of the duration d of temporal averaging see e g coles 2001 and more recently lucarini et al 2016 and langousis et al 2016 under pre asymptotic conditions it becomes a function d see e g veneziano et al 2009 langousis et al 2013 and veneziano and yoon 2013 leading to biases of the idf estimates obtained under a constant k assumption while parameterizing n and k as functions of d can be considered an option to improve the performance of the pot method actually it is not as it increases the number of parameters from five to eight with subsequent increase of the estimation variance when compared to the am and pot idf models the mf approach displays lower levels of relative bias irrespective of d and t even for sample sizes down to one year fig 10 presents results similar to those in fig 9 illustrating how the dimensionless root mean squared error drmse of the am pot and mf idf estimates varies with the sample n for different durations d and return periods t in addition to the relative bias drmse incorporates information also on the variance of the relative error of model based idf estimates thus allowing for performance assessments based on both constant and random errors one sees that irrespective of the idf estimation method used and the duration d drmse increases with increasing t and decreasing n in addition the pot and mf methods are the less and better performing ones respectively with the am method lying in between it follows from figs 9 and 10 and the discussion above that in comparison to the am four parameter and pot five parameter approaches the mf four parameter approach displays better performance both in terms of bias and variance of the relative error of obtained idfs producing robust idf estimates even for small sample sizes n down to one year therefore the mf model can be considered as an important tool for the purposes of idf estimation especially from short rainfall records 4 2 model parameters to study how the parameters of the idf models presented in section 3 are affected by the local topography rainfall climatology and the length n of the available data figs 11 13 and figs s 4 s 6 in the supporting information illustrate how the parameters of the am pot and mf approaches vary spatially for different sample sizes n the spatial maps have been obtained by applying the idf estimation methods to the individual members of each ensemble corresponding to different length n of the available data and ensemble averaging the obtained parameter estimates with regard to the mf approach see fig 11 one sees that except for d the remaining model parameter estimates i e cβ cln and ī are minimally affected by the sample size n contrast left n 2 years and right n 50 years columns in fig 11 regarding d i e the upper limit of the scaling range see section 3 3 please note that as discussed in langousis et al 2009 its exact value only minimally affects the idf estimates and hence its estimation uncertainty from short records is not influential on the overall performance of the method see figs 9 and 10 and the discussion in section 4 1 parameter cln which determines the amplitude of the fluctuations when it rains and the average rainfall intensity ī are systematically larger at higher elevations as physically expected the opposite holds for d and cβ with the latter parameter determining the fraction of wet periods inside d intervals i e cβ 0 for compact rainfall this means that orographic precipitation is characterized by lower duration and more compact and intense rainfall events in addition at the rainfall intensification region close to the shore of delaware and maryland see 40 n 76 w in figs 1 and 8 land falling storms lead to higher values of d cln and cβ indicating that the rainfall process has much higher variability with subsequent increase of the frequency and intensity of rainfall extremes see fig 8 shifting to the am approach by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 fig 12 shows the spatial variation of the gev shape parameter k the most influential parameter to the frequency and intensity of rainfall extremes for three different record lengths n 2 fig 12b 10 fig 12c and 50 years fig 12d and contrasts it to the elevation map of the region fig 12a similar plots for the remaining parameters of the am approach i e μ σ and c are presented in the supporting information see fig s 4 one sees that for small sample lengths e g n 2 years the shape parameter is spatially constant and equal to zero the reason for this is that for small sample sizes the estimates of k resulted to be negative and were set to zero see section 3 1 as the length of the samples increases see fig 12c for n 10 years and fig 12d for n 50 years the spatial variation of k becomes more apparent although without explicit linkage to the topography and local climatology of the region this can be attributed to the significant variability of the obtained k estimates which highly depends on the length of the available series as it can be seen from the boxplots in fig 14 even for sample sizes on the order of n 50 years the distribution of the shape parameter estimates has not yet converged for moment orders higher than the mean with regard to the pot approach fig 13 shows how the shape parameter k left column and parameter h in eq 9 right column vary spatially for different sample sizes n 2 10 and 50 years similar plots for the remaining parameters of the pot approach i e s g and c are presented in the supporting information see fig s 5 one sees that while sensitivity of the parameters of the pot method is less pronounced than that of the am approach still there is no explicit linkage to the topography and local climatology of the region for example regions of higher elevation may exhibit either low or high k and h parameter values see red broken line boxes in fig 13 overall it follows from the discussion in this and the previous sections that in comparison to the am four parameter and pot five parameter idf estimation methods the four parameter mf approach provides a parsimonious and physically meaningful parameter setting which is consistent with the local topography and rainfall climatology of the region while producing robust idf estimates even from short rainfall records 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the accuracy and robustness of three alternative parametric approaches to idf curve estimation from historical rainfall data namely a a four parameter model based on annual maxima am series developed by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 b a peaks over threshold pot approach with five parameters based on proper fitting of a reparameterized generalized pareto gp distribution to the scaled excesses of the average rainfall intensity id inside duration d in a threshold invariant way referred to as the multiple threshold method mtm see deidda 2010 followed by log linear regression of its parameters with d and c the analytical approximation developed by langousis et al 2009 for idf curve estimation which is based on multifractal scaling arguments resulting in a four parameter model the assessment was based on hourly rainfall measurements from 36 raingauge stations in the northeastern united states with more than 55 years of recordings where the model based idf estimates obtained from various record lengths n n 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 years were compared to the empirical idf estimates obtained from the full records in terms of relative bias and root mean squared error drmse in addition the spatial variation of both idf estimates and model parameter values was evaluated in the light of the local topography and rainfall climatology of the region with regard to the am parametric approach developed by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 we found that irrespective of the average duration d it results in considerable negative biases and dimensionless root mean squared errors which are larger for higher return periods t and increase significantly for sample sizes n 10 years see figs 9 and 10 and the discussion in section 4 1 in addition the obtained parameter estimates did not display explicit linkage to the topography and local climatology of the region with the shape parameter estimates being highly variable even for large sample sizes on the order of 50 years similar findings were obtained for the 5 parameter pot approach although in this case the statistical variability of model parameters was less pronounced shifting to the four parameter multifractal analytical approximation for idf curve estimation developed by langousis et al 2009 the conducted analysis showed that when compared to the am and pot parametric approaches it produces more accurate and robust idf estimates both in terms of relative bias and drmse irrespective of the duration d and return period t of interest in addition the parameters of the method were found to be descriptive of the local topography and rainfall climatology providing a physically meaningful modeling setting this was the case even for rainfall records with significant length limitations i e 1 2 years of data as the method exploits the statistical structure of rainfall at multiple time scales utilizing information from the complete rainfall record rather than a small portion of it i e rainfall excesses above a properly selected threshold or annual maxima concluding while all three idf estimation methods considered produce acceptable results in terms of accuracy and robustness for historical record lengths on the order of 25 years or more the multifractal analytical approximation introduced by langousis et al 2009 for rainfall idf curve estimation is the less sensitive one to data length requirements producing more accurate and robust idf estimates even for sample sizes n down to 1 2 years also its application is simple and straightforward see section 3 3 making it suitable for hydrological applications and engineering design irrespective of the duration d and return period t of interest with significant advantages in terms of accuracy and robustness relative to parametric approaches based on annual maxima am and peaks over threshold pot series for example as shown in fig 9a for duration d 1 h the relative biases of am idf estimates range from 10 to more than 30 with larger values been associated with higher return periods and lower sample sizes whereas the corresponding relative biases of mf idf estimates are smaller than 10 even for sample sizes down 1 year this together with the lower uncertainty of mf idf estimates see fig 10 significantly reduce the risk of under design of hydraulic infrastructures when rainfall recordings are short the aforementioned attributes of the mf approach together with the descriptive linkage of its parameters to the local topography and rainfall climatology make it particularly appealing for regional frequency analysis and idf estimation at ungauged locations these two topics will form the subjects of follow up communications credit authorship contribution

5229,the present study uses hourly rainfall measurements from 36 raingauge stations in the northeastern united states with more than 55 years of recordings to assess the accuracy and robustness of three conceptually different parametric approaches to produce intensity duration frequency idf curves from rainfall records a the well celebrated parametric idf model based on annual maxima am series initially introduced by rossi and villani 1994 and later extended by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 b a peaks over threshold pot model based on proper fitting of a reparametrized generalized pareto gp distribution to the scaled excesses of the average rainfall intensity over various durations d and c the analytical approximation introduced by langousis et al 2009 for estimation of multifractal mf rainfall maxima since its development the third approach has never been tested in real world applications and or compared to routinely used approaches for idf curve estimation the obtained results show that the mf approach may constitute an important tool for hydrological applications as it produces more accurate and robust idf estimates than the other two approaches irrespective of the duration d and return period t of interest especially in cases where rainfall records exhibit significant length limitations in addition the parameters of the mf analytical approximation are found to be descriptive of the local topography and rainfall climatology of the region providing a physically meaningful modeling setting that is particularly suited for regional frequency analysis and idf estimation at ungauged locations keywords rainfall extremes extreme value and extreme excess theories multifractal theory intensity duration frequency curves annual maxima series peaks over threshold series 1 introduction hydrological modeling and design require accurate and robust estimates of extreme rainfall over a wide range of characteristic temporal scales and exceedance probability levels thus following the early works of sherman 1931 and bernard 1932 intensity duration frequency idf curves have been a major focus for statistical hydrologists see e g the textbooks of eagleson 1970 chow et al 1988 and singh 1992 and rossi and villani 1994 burlando and rosso 1996 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 koutsoyiannis et al 1998 willems 2000 menabde and sivapalan 2000 asquith and famiglietti 2000 veneziano and furcolo 2002 castro et al 2004 langousis and veneziano 2007 langousis et al 2009 and tyralis and langousis 2019 among many others define id to be the average rainfall intensity inside duration d imax d to be the maximum of id in a year and denote by id t the value of imax d exceeded with probability p imax d id t 1 yr t where t is the return period in years idf curves represent the relationship of id t with d and t see e g koutsoyiannis et al 1998 langousis and veneziano 2007 veneziano et al 2007 langousis et al 2009 van de vyver and demarée 2010 and tyralis and langousis 2019 among others for temporal scales d above the nominal resolution of the rainfall record and for return periods t below its length id t can be calculated directly from the empirical distribution of annual rainfall maxima for larger return periods t one should rely on parametric approaches i e fitting a proper theoretical distribution model to the annual rainfall maxima or to the rainfall excesses above a properly selected threshold or use a stochastic model of rainfall a widely used parametric approach to construct idf curves is based on the statistical analysis of annual maxima am series see e g bernard 1932 demarée 1985 cunnane 1973 madsen and pearson 1997a b koutsoyiannis et al 1998 katz et al 2002 gellens 2002 overeem et al 2008 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 according to this approach one averages the available series of historical rainrates over pre specified durations dj j 1 2 extracts the annual maxima imax d and models them using a theoretical distribution model with parameters that depend on d selection of the model is usually based on extreme value ev theory and more precisely on the assumption that unless degenerate asymptotically as t imax d is attracted to an extreme type distribution that belongs to the gev generalized exreme value family see e g fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 jenkinson 1955 and more recently coles 2001 langousis et al 2016 and lucarini et al 2016 subsequently the fitted theoretical distribution model is used to acquire estimates of 1 1 t quantiles for various combinations of d t conditional on d and fit a parametric relationship of the separable type id t α t b d where α and b are positively valued functions see e g raudkivi 1979 chow et al 1988 wanielista 1990 singh 1992 and more recently koutsoyiannis et al 1998 and veneziano et al 2007 over the years various parametric forms of the functions α and b have been suggested see e g bernard 1932 raudkivi 1979 subramanya 1984 chow et al 1988 wanielista 1990 singh 1992 koutsoyiannis et al 1998 and shaw et al 2017 initially algebraic forms were chosen based on empirical arguments but later their validity was substantiated in the context of multifractal scale invariance see e g hubert et al 1998 veneziano and furcolo 2002 veneziano and langousis 2005a veneziano et al 2006a b 2007 2009 langousis and veneziano 2007 langousis et al 2009 2013 veneziano and yoon 2013 garcía marín et al 2013 and the reviews in veneziano and langousis 2010 and tyralis and langousis 2019 rossi and villani 1994 and koutsoyiannis et al 1998 proposed an improvement to the aforementioned parametric approach assuming that the idf curves are separable in d and t where estimation of α t can be conducted by fitting a theoretical distribution model to the entire sample independent of d of the standardized annual rainfall maxima x imax d b d which are assumed to be duration independent see also section 3 1 koutsoyiannis et al 1998 also suggested numerical procedures to estimate the parameters c 0 1 and δ 0 of function b d d δ c from data an important note to be made here is that dependence of id t on d is not based on theory which can be considered a weakness of the parametric approach based on am see e g tyralis and langousis 2019 furthermore since the distribution of the yearly maxima under pre asymptotic conditions that is for finite t may not comply with an extreme type distribution the dependence of id t on t needs to be also verified to some extent see e g veneziano et al 2009 langousis et al 2013 and veneziano and yoon 2013 another maybe more important limitation of the parametric approach based on am is that it uses only the historical annual maxima neglecting the largest portion of information present in the historical rainfall record consequently the estimated distribution parameters and corresponding idf values i e conditional quantiles may exhibit significant variability as well as sensitivity to outliers see e g coles and tawn 1996 coles et al 2003 koutsoyiannis 2004 deidda 2010 and langousis et al 2013 2016 when continuous rainfall data is available t may be calculated conditional on the rate at which a properly selected threshold intensity u is exceeded in this context and similar to the parametric approach based on am one averages the available series of historical rainrates over pre specified durations dj j 1 2 extracts the series of the excesses above u usually referred to as partial duration series pds or peaks over threshold pot series see e g davison and smith 1990 wang 1991 rosbjerg and madsen 1992 1995 madsen and pearson 1997a b 2002 lang et al 1999 willems 2000 deidda and puliga 2006 cooley et al 2007 veneziano et al 2007 deidda 2010 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 among others and models them using a theoretical distribution model with parameters that depend on d see e g madsen et al 2002 2009 2017 agilan and umamahesh 2017 and chang et al 2013 selection of the model is usually based on extreme excess ee theory and more precisely on the assumption that unless degenerate asymptotically as u and p id u 0 the scaled excesses id u id u id u are attracted to a generalized pareto gp distribution see e g balkema and de haan 1974 pickands 1975 leadbetter et al 1983 and more recently coles 2001 langousis et al 2016 and lucarini et al 2016 approximate convergence of id u to a gp distribution under pre asymtotic conditions i e for moderately high values of u is supported by empirical evidence see e g martins and stedinger 2001a b deidda and puliga 2006 veneziano et al 2007 2009 deidda 2010 veneziano and yoon 2013 papalexiou et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 and langousis et al 2016 while both am and pot approaches should lead asymptotically to the same results as t one would expect the pot approach to be more suitable than the am approach for estimation of extreme quantiles as it accounts for a larger portion of the available information nevertheless to consistently apply the pot approach for extreme excess ee modeling one needs to determine for each pre specified duration dj j 1 2 a proper threshold u d to extract pds from the available data selection of an appropriate threshold is not a trivial issue due to its dependence on the duration d the presence of quantization in the data a quite common case in rainfall records and the additional constraints that the selected threshold should be high enough to ensure validity of the gp assumption and at the same time maintain a sufficient amount of data to avoid unnecessary increase of the estimation variance of the gp distribution parameters see e g rosbjerg and madsen 1992 lang et al 1999 adamowski 2000 coles 2001 deidda and puliga 2006 tancredi et al 2006 deidda 2010 chavez demoulin and davison 2012 scarrott and macdonald 2012 and langousis et al 2016 an alternative approach which avoids indirect parametric assumptions on the calculated rainfall maxima is to fit a stochastic model of temporal rainfall to the continuous historical record and then use the fitted model to generate synthetic rainfall time series through monte carlo simulation see e g chow et al 1988 singh 1992 langousis and veneziano 2007 and tyralis and langousis 2019 the synthetic ensembles can then be used to construct empirical idf curves by extracting and sorting the annual block maxima corresponding to various durations d and applying a plotting position formula in this context all available data is used to fit the model and no a priori assumption is made on the parametric form of the estimated idfs yet this conceptually more appealing approach is rarely followed in practice because of the complexities of formulating stochastic rainfall models estimating their parameters and generating monte carlo samples see langousis and veneziano 2007 over the years different classes of stochastic rainfall models have been introduced one class includes first order second moment based schemes see e g valencia and schaake 1973 valencia and schaake 1972 and the reviews in salas 1993 and koutsoyiannis and langousis 2011 a second class comprises of stochastic rainfall generators based on point processes and rainfall pulses see e g lecam 1961 waymire and gupta 1981a c rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 1988 entekhabi et al 1989 onof and wheater 1993 1994 velghe et al 1994 cowpertwait 1995 1998 verhoest et al 1997 onof et al 2000 willems 2001 veneziano et al 2002 veneziano and iacobellis 2002 segond et al 2007 onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 pohle et al 2018 and the review in koutsoyiannis and langousis 2011 the third class consists of stochastic rainfall models based on multifractal scale invariance see e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 lovejoy and schertzer 1995 perica and foufoula georgiou 1996 menabde et al 1997 olsson 1998 deidda 2000 menabde and sivapalan 2000 güntner et al 2001 ahrens 2003 venugopal et al 2006 paulson and baxter 2007 veneziano and lepore 2012 müller and haberlandt 2018 and the reviews in venugopal et al 2006 and veneziano and langousis 2010 the last class of models is particularly engaging for three reasons first multifractal scale invariance demonstrates good performance in reproducing the intermittent character and statistical structure of rainfall at multiple temporal scales see e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 lovejoy and schertzer 1995 olsson et al 1993 gupta and waymire 1993 marsan et al 1996 over and gupta 1996 menabde et al 1997 harris et al 1998 venugopal et al 1999 2006 deidda et al 1999 and langousis and veneziano 2007 this is typically true for durations d from about one hour to several days see e g tessier et al 1993 lovejoy and schertzer 1995 olsson 1995 de lima and grasman 1999 and the review in veneziano and langousis 2010 second multifractal rainfall models have been used to investigate the scaling properties of extreme rainfall under asymptotic and pre asymptotic conditions see e g hubert et al 1998 veneziano and furcolo 2002 veneziano and langousis 2005a langousis et al 2009 2013 veneziano et al 2009 and veneziano and yoon 2013 as well as their dependence on geographical and climatic features see e g veneziano and lepore 2012 and innocenti et al 2017 finally regarding idf curve estimation multifractal rainfall models manifest significantly fewer parameters relative to other types of stochastic rainfall generators while allowing for idf characterization based on theoretical arguments see langousis et al 2009 more precisely langousis et al 2009 developed an analytical approximation for idf curve estimation in the case when temporal rainfall exhibits approximate multifractal scale invariance the method exploits the statistical structure of rainfall at multiple time scales utilizing information from the complete rainfall record rather than a small portion of it i e rainfall excesses above a properly selected threshold or annual maxima while promising since its development the method had never been tested in real world rainfall data and or compared to routinely used approaches for idf curve estimation in the present study we seek to investigate the potential of the analytical approximation introduced by langousis et al 2009 for multifractal rainfall maxima in statistically characterizing extreme rainfall at multiple temporal resolutions and producing idf curves and compare it to a the parametric idf model based on annual maxima am series as implemented by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 and b a peaks over threshold pot model based on proper fitting of a reparameterized generalized pareto gp distribution to the scaled excesses of the average rainfall intensity over various durations d followed by log linear regression of its corresponding parameters the analysis is conducted using hourly rainfall measurements from 36 raingauge stations in the northeastern united states with more than 55 years of recordings where model based idf estimates obtained based on various record lengths i e through random bootstrapping of the years in record are compared to empirical idf estimates obtained from the full record quantitative assessment is done in terms of relative bias and dimensionless root mean squared error drmse and the spatial variation of both idf estimates and model parameter values is evaluated in the light of the topographic features and the rainfall climatology of the region in section 2 below we provide necessary information regarding the origin and processing of the rainfall data used section 3 details the relevant theory methodological framework and technical aspects of the three idf estimation methods while presenting details on technical aspects of the implemented comparison a comprehensive discussion of the obtained results is presented in section 4 conclusions and future research directions are presented in section 5 2 data the data used in this study are hourly rainfall measurements from the cooperative observers program hourly precipitation dataset of noaa https data nodc noaa gov cgi bin iso id gov noaa ncdc c00988 see national centres for environmental information 2017 and wuertz and lawrimore 2018 and include 36 raingauge stations in the northeastern united states see fig 1 with more than 55 years of hourly recordings with less than 50 of missing values in each year see table s 1 in the supporting information the considered stations cover a wide range of terrain types with elevations ranging from 36 to 655 m for more information on the data used and their processing the reader is referred to barbero et al 2017 3 models and methods for idf curve estimation 3 1 historical series of annual rainfall maxima am approach following the approach of koutsoyiannis et al 1998 for idf curve estimation from historical annual maxima id t is assumed separable in d and t receiving the form 1 i d t α t b d where b d d δ c and α t is obtained by fitting a theoretical distribution model to the entire sample of the standardized annual rainfall maxima x imax d b d which are assumed to be duration independent following the two step approach of koutsoyiannis et al 1998 estimation of c 0 1 and δ 0 involves minimization of the kruskal wallis statistic see e g kruskal and wallis 1952 and more recently siegel and castellan 1988 and corder and foreman 2009 of the standardized historical annual maxima x so they can be effectively assumed to belong to the same population here we set δ 0 as it is found to minimally affect the obtained idf values while considering it as a free parameter increases the uncertainty of the obtained estimates having c determined α t is obtained by fitting a theoretical distribution model with parameters independent of d to the standardized annual maxima sample here we use the generalized extreme value gev distribution model with cumulative distribution function 2 g max x exp 1 k x μ σ 1 k where k σ and μ denote the shape scale and location parameters of the distribution respectively for parameter estimation we use the method of probability weighted moments pwm which has been proved to produce robust estimates even in the case of small sample sizes see e g greenwood et al 1979 landwehr et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 hosking 1990 1992 koutsoyiannis 2004 trefry et al 2005 and langousis et al 2013 for low sample sizes some stations may exhibit negative shape parameter values corresponding to upper bounded distributions for the annual maxima an assumption that is not readily justified by empirical evidence see e g koutsoyiannis 2004 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2006 2013 papalexiou et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 langousis et al 2016 and references therein unless attributed to statistical variability in brief in order for rainfall extremes to be upper bounded all marginal and finite dimensional joint distributions of rainfall rates i e over all possible durations should necessarily be upper bounded and therefore a much more general assumption should hold that is the rainfall process to exhibit a physical upper bound since from a physical perspective the rainfall process cannot simultaneously exhibit as implied by negative shape parameter estimates and not exhibit as implied by positive shape parameter estimates an upper bound it follows that negative and positive shape parameter estimates cannot coexist unless attributed to statistical variability in order to minimize the uncertainty of the obtained idf estimates in our analysis we have set all obtained negative k values to zero i e corresponding to a gumbel distribution model and re estimated the remaining model parameters i e σ and μ conditional on k 0 the aforementioned rational was based on the fact that when using the complete series of annual rainfall maxima from each of the 36 stations considered only 6 stations resulted in negative shape parameter estimates with values ranging between 0 0947 and 0 0026 for illustration purposes fig 2 shows the complementary cdf ccdf of a gev theoretical distribution model fitted to the standardized historical rainfall maxima for raingauge station usc00302454 in the northeastern unites states with 61 years of hourly recordings and compares it to the ccdf obtained empirically once all four model parameters μ σ k and c have been estimated the idf values can be calculated by applying eq 1 with α t g max 1 1 1 t where t is the return period in years an important note to be made here is that the am method of koutsoyiannis et al 1998 standardizes and uses more than one rainfall maxima values from each year i e corresponding to different durations d see discussion on eq 1 above making it applicable also to rainfall records with significant length limitations i e 1 2 years of data 3 2 series of rainfall peaks over threshold pot approach suppose that above a properly selected threshold u the scaled excesses id u id u id u of the average rainfall intensity id inside duration d follow a generalized pareto gp distribution model with cdf see e g balkema and de haan 1974 pickands 1975 leadbetter et al 1983 and more recently coles 2001 lucarini et al 2016 and langousis et al 2016 3 f i d u x 1 1 k d x u a u d 1 k d k d 0 1 exp x u a u d k d 0 where k d is the distribution shape parameter αu d the scale parameter and u is the threshold value in this case the scaled excesses id u id u id u above any threshold u u should also follow a gp distribution model with the same shape parameter k and scale parameter αu that is a linear function of u 4 α u d α u d k d u u for the purpose of idf curve estimation we use the aforementioned property to reparameterize the gp distribution fitted to the scaled excesses of the average rainfall intensity id inside duration d in a threshold invariant way to do so we select to use the multiple threshold method mtm developed by deidda 2010 with a pwm probability weighted moments see e g greenwood et al 1979 hosking et al 1985 hosking and wallis 1987 1997 hosking 1990 1992 and deidda and puliga 2009 estimator applied to the historical rainfall series averaged over different durations d mtm is a robust parameter estimation method that avoids convergence related issues in the case of highly quantized data which is usually the case for rainfall see e g deidda and puliga 2009 and langousis et al 2016 more precisely mtm is based on proper standardization reparameterization of the gp model to zero threshold allowing for multiple fits using a range of possible thresholds thus minimizing uncertainties in model parameter estimation see deidda 2010 and serinaldi and kilsby 2014 for u 0 eq 3 reduces to the form 5 f i d 0 x 1 1 k d x a 0 d 1 k d k d 0 1 exp x a 0 d k d 0 in applying the mtm method for each duration d and selected threshold u we estimate the probability zu d p id u directly from data and the parameters au d and k d by applying the pwm parameter estimation method to the scaled rainfall excesses above threshold u i e id u id u for a detailed description of the pwm method the reader is referred to hosking 1992 and hosking and wallis 1987 1997 at a next step for each duration d and selected threshold u we calculate the reparameterized standardized to zero threshold scale parameter a 0 d and the probability z 0 d p id 0 using see deidda 2010 6 a 0 d a u d k d u z 0 d z u d 1 k d u a 0 d 1 k d k d 0 z u d exp u a 0 d k d 0 f o r a n y u 0 for each duration d we obtain the threshold invariant parameters z 0 d a 0 d and k d in eq 5 using the median of the corresponding parameter estimates deidda 2010 obtained by fitting a gp model to the excesses above different thresholds u in the range between the 50 and 99 empirical quantiles of non zero rainfall as a final step and in accordance with extreme value and extreme excess limit theorems see e g coles 2001 and more recently lucarini et al 2016 and langousis et al 2016 we assume a duration independent shape parameter the latter is obtained by averaging the corresponding shape parameter estimates over all durations 7 k 1 m d a l l d k d where md is the total number of different durations d considered in addition we model the dependence of z 0 d and a 0 d on d in a continuous setting by least square fitting log linear expressions to the empirical estimates 8 z 0 d s d g 9 α 0 d h d c where s g h and c are parameter constants once all five model parameters s g h c and k have been estimated following deidda 2010 and assuming that the average rainfall intensities inside non overlapping d intervals are independent and identically distributed iid random variables the idf curves are calculated as 10 i d t α 0 d k 1 1 1 t 1 n z 0 d k 1 k 0 α 0 d ln 1 1 1 t 1 n z 0 d k 0 where k z 0 d and a 0 d are given by eqs 7 8 and 9 respectively and n is the number of d intervals in a year that is n 365 d for d in days it follows from eq 10 that contrary to the am approach to idf curve estimation presented in section 3 1 the obtained idf curves based on the suggested pot setting hereafter referred to as the pot approach are not separable in d t for raingauge usc00302454 used in section 3 1 fig 3 illustrates how the empirical distribution of positive rainfall intensities and the fitted gp distribution model in eq 5 vary with duration d one sees that as the duration d increases the distribution moves towards lower rainfall intensity values fig 4 illustrates the dependence of the estimated gp parameters z 0 d and a 0 d on d together with the corresponding fits of the log linear expressions in eqs 8 and 9 one sees that independent of the duration d the fitted gp model approximates well the empirical distribution of positive rainfall intensities see fig 3 in addition as shown in fig 4 and in accordance with empirical evidence and physical expectations z 0 d p id 0 increases with the duration d whereas the scale parameter a 0 d that is an indicator of the dispersion of the distribution of positive rainrates decreases with increasing d in an algebraic way 3 3 analytical approximation for multifractal idf curve estimation mf approach temporal rainfall is said to be stationary multifractal if its statistics remain unchanged when the time axis is contracted by a factor r 1 and the intensity is multiplied by a non negative unit mean random variable ar see e g gupta and waymire 1993 burlando and rosso 1996 veneziano 1999 and the review in veneziano and langousis 2010 in this case 11 i d d a r i rd r d d 1 where d denotes equality in all finite dimensional distributions and d is the upper limit of the scaling range typically on the order of several days see e g venugopal et al 2006 langousis and veneziano 2007 langousis et al 2009 2013 and references therein a frequent choice to model the intermittent and highly variable character of rainfall is to use a beta lognormal model for the distribution of ar see e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 over and gupta 1996 schmitt et al 1998 veneziano and langousis 2005a b langousis and veneziano 2007 langousis et al 2013 langousis and kaleris 2013 and the reviews in veneziano et al 2006a b and veneziano and langousis 2010 in this case ar in eq 11 is obtained as the product of two independent random factors a continuous random variable aln r with lognormal distribution i e ln aln r n μ σ 2 where μ cln ln r and σ 2 2cln ln r and an indicator random variable aβ r that satisfies p aβ r 0 1 r c β and p aβ r r c β r c β hence 12 a r 0 with probability 1 r c β r c β exp c ln ln r q 2 c ln in r with probability r c β where q n 0 12 is a standard normal variable and cβ and cln are non negative parameters that satisfy cβ cln 1 see e g langousis and veneziano 2007 more precisely cβ controls the lacunarity of the rainfall field i e cβ 0 for compact rainfall and cln controls the amplitude of the multifractal fluctuations when it rains with the two parameters exhibiting typical ranges from 0 4 to 0 6 and from 0 05 to 0 1 respectively see e g langousis et al 2009 it follows from eq 11 that for the case of beta lognormal multifractal processes the moments of the average rainfall intensity id inside duration d scale as 13 e i d q d k q for q q where q denotes the moment order 14 k q lo g r e a r q c β q 1 c ln q 2 q is the associated moment scaling function and q 1 cβ cln 1 is the lowest moment order larger than 1 such that e id q diverges see e g kahane and peyriène 1976 schertzer and lovejoy 1987 and more recently the reviews in venugopal et al 2006 and veneziano and langousis 2010 hence one can study the scaling properties of temporal rainfall and subsequently obtain the multifractal parameters cβ and cln from the available rainfall data by see e g schertzer and lovejoy 1987 langousis et al 2009 2013 langousis and kaleris 2014 and the review in veneziano and langousis 2010 1 plotting the initial moments e id ī q of different orders q as a function of the duration d where ī denotes the mean rainfall intensity 2 estimating k q as the negative slope of loge id ī q against logd and 3 least square fitting eq 14 to the empirical k q values from step 2 for raingauge usc00302454 used in sections 3 1 and 3 2 fig 5 shows log log plots of the empirical moments e id ī q q 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 of the standardized to mean 1 rainfall process as a function of the duration d the reason why we consider moment orders that do not exceed q 3 is that for highly intermittent random fields as is the case for temporal rainfall moment orders q 3 are underestimated with high probability see e g ossiander and waymire 2000 2002 lashermes et al 2004 veneziano et al 2006a b langousis and veneziano 2007 veneziano and furcolo 2009 and the review in veneziano and langousis 2010 fig 6 shows empirical circles and theoretical solid lines estimates of the moment scaling function k q the theoretical estimates have been obtained by least square fitting the expression in eq 14 to the negative slopes of loge id ī q against logd for q 0 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 after estimating the parameters cβ and cln of the beta lognormal multifractal process one can use the analytical approximation developed by langousis et al 2009 to derive idf curves according to this approximation 15 i d t r r 0 c β c ln e 2 c l n ln r r 0 φ 1 1 r r 0 c β d r t t t r i r t t r c l n 1 c β t t r where r d d φ 1 is the inverse of the standard normal cdf d is the value of d for which e id ī 3 r 0 2 c β 6 c ln is a model constant that depends on the parameter set cβ cln and can be obtained from fig 2 in langousis et al 2009 or equivalently fig 3 in

multifractal scaling arguments hereafter referred to as the mf approach produces idf curves that are not separable in d t and has four parameters cβ cln d and ī 3 4 bootstrapping and benchmarking to assess the relative performance of the idf models described in the previous subsections with respect to the length n of the available data we consider six different sample sizes n n 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 years and for each station analyzed we 1 randomly bootstrap the available years to create one ensemble for each of the different sample sizes n n 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 years considered each consisting of n 50 ensemble members of size equal to n years 2 apply the annual maxima am peaks over threshold pot and multifractal mf idf estimation methods to each ensemble member from 1 to estimate the parameters of each model and calculate model based idf values for various durations d 1 2 4 12 24 48 h and return periods t 5 10 25 50 years 3 use the results from 2 to develop idf and model parameter maps and also quantitatively assess the accuracy and robustness of the model based idfs as a function of the sample size n relative to those obtained empirically using the full record length calculation of the empirical idf curves at each station is conducted by averaging the available series of historical rainrates over pre specified durations d 1 2 4 12 24 48 h extracting and ranking the annual rainfall maxima for each d and calculating the corresponding exceedance probabilities using the weibull 1939 plotting position formula see e g singh 1992 and makkonen 2006 fig 7 shows empirical and model based idf curves for station usc00302454 for return periods t 5 10 25 50 100 and 1000 years obtained using the full record length that is 61 years for the empirical idf estimates we have applied log linear interpolation in t one sees that independent of the duration d all three methods tend to produce similar results indicating a slight underestimation of the empirical idf values with the pot and mf methods being the less and better performing ones respectively and the am method lying in between note however that the similar performances of the methods are due to the considerably large size of the sample that is 61 years as shown in the next section for smaller sample sizes the relative performances of the methods differ significantly 4 results and discussion 4 1

obtained from the full record length fig 8b in view of the elevation map of the study region fig 8a all maps have been created using triangulated irregular network based linear interpolation similar maps of model based idf values for durations d 1 and 24 h and return periods t 10 and 50 years are presented in the supporting information see figs s 1 s 3 one sees that rainfall intensifies close to the shore of delaware and maryland see 40 n 76 w in figs 1 and 8 due to the storm landfall that frequently occurs in the region and reduces gradually as one moves inland the lowest rainfall intensity values are observed on the northwestern side of the mountainous regions of new york that is adirondack mountains see 44 n 74 w in figs 1 and 8 and new england the green mountains and the white mountains see 44 n 72 5 w and 44 n 71 5 w respectively in figs 1 and 8 which serve as rain barriers for the western slopes and valleys causing rain shadow effects see e g singh 1992 and koutsoyiannis and langousis 2011 the white mountains in new hampshire which form part of the northern appalachian mountains also have a pronounced effect on the disentification of rainfall due to rain shadow effects see 44 n 71 5 w in fig 8 when comparing the spatial patterns of empirical idf estimates fig 8b to those obtained by the three models one sees that the am method fig 8c e is more sensitive to the length n of the available data than the pot and mf methods fig 8f k while all approaches tend to produce similar results and approximate well the spatial pattern of empirical idf values for large sample sizes e g n 50 years see right column in fig 8 and fig 8b to quantitatively assess the accuracy and robustness of model based idf estimates as a function of the duration d return period t and sample size n we use the average relative error also referred to as relative bias rb see eq 17 and the dimensionless root mean squared error drmse see eq 18 17 r b d t n 1 n s j 1 n s i d t n j i d t i d t 18 d r m s e d t n 1 n s j 1 n s i d t n j i d t i d t 2 where id t denotes the empirical idf estimate obtained for a certain station using the full record length available i d t n j denotes the corresponding model based idf value obtained using ensemble member j j 1 2 n s of the 50 member ensemble corresponding to sample size n n 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 years and n s is the total number of samples members in the ensemble in our case n s 50 see also section 3 4 fig 9 shows the relative bias rb of model based idf estimates obtained using the am blue pot green and mf red approaches averaged over all 36 stations as a function of the sample size n for durations d 2 and 24 h and return periods t 5 10 25 and 50 years one sees that irrespective of the duration d the magnitude of the relative bias of the am approach is larger for higher return periods t and increases significantly for sample sizes n 10 years the latter increase has its origin in the implicit assumption of the koutsoyiannis et al 1998 idf estimation method which standardizes and uses more than one rainfall maxima values corresponding to different durations d see section 3 1 from each year these values are not fully independent and for small sample sizes they affect significantly the obtained idf estimates leading to pronounced negative biases large negative biases are also produced by the pot approach described in section 3 2 we have investigated this issue in some detail and concluded that it is mainly due to two reasons the first is the exponent 1 n in eq 10 more precisely in the current formulation of the pot approach n is set equal to the number of d intervals in a year that is n 365 d for d in days whereas from a statistical point of view it corresponds to the number of independent d intervals in a year the latter is a fraction of the nominal number of d intervals in a year which depends on d the other reason is the assumption of a duration independent gp shape parameter in eq 7 while under asymptotic conditions the shape parameter k of a gp distribution model fitted to the rainfall excesses should be independent of the duration d of temporal averaging see e g coles 2001 and more recently lucarini et al 2016 and langousis et al 2016 under pre asymptotic conditions it becomes a function d see e g veneziano et al 2009 langousis et al 2013 and veneziano and yoon 2013 leading to biases of the idf estimates obtained under a constant k assumption while parameterizing n and k as functions of d can be considered an option to improve the performance of the pot method actually it is not as it increases the number of parameters from five to eight with subsequent increase of the estimation variance when compared to the am and pot idf models the mf approach displays lower levels of relative bias irrespective of d and t even for sample sizes down to one year fig 10 presents results similar to those in fig 9 illustrating how the dimensionless root mean squared error drmse of the am pot and mf idf estimates varies with the sample n for different durations d and return periods t in addition to the relative bias drmse incorporates information also on the variance of the relative error of model based idf estimates thus allowing for performance assessments based on both constant and random errors one sees that irrespective of the idf estimation method used and the duration d drmse increases with increasing t and decreasing n in addition the pot and mf methods are the less and better performing ones respectively with the am method lying in between it follows from figs 9 and 10 and the discussion above that in comparison to the am four parameter and pot five parameter approaches the mf four parameter approach displays better performance both in terms of bias and variance of the relative error of obtained idfs producing robust idf estimates even for small sample sizes n down to one year therefore the mf model can be considered as an important tool for the purposes of idf estimation especially from short rainfall records 4 2 model parameters to study how the parameters of the idf models presented in section 3 are affected by the local topography rainfall climatology and the length n of the available data figs 11 13 and figs s 4 s 6 in the supporting information illustrate how the parameters of the am pot and mf approaches vary spatially for different sample sizes n the spatial maps have been obtained by applying the idf estimation methods to the individual members of each ensemble corresponding to different length n of the available data and ensemble averaging the obtained parameter estimates with regard to the mf approach see fig 11 one sees that except for d the remaining model parameter estimates i e cβ cln and ī are minimally affected by the sample size n contrast left n 2 years and right n 50 years columns in fig 11 regarding d i e the upper limit of the scaling range see section 3 3 please note that as discussed in langousis et al 2009 its exact value only minimally affects the idf estimates and hence its estimation uncertainty from short records is not influential on the overall performance of the method see figs 9 and 10 and the discussion in section 4 1 parameter cln which determines the amplitude of the fluctuations when it rains and the average rainfall intensity ī are systematically larger at higher elevations as physically expected the opposite holds for d and cβ with the latter parameter determining the fraction of wet periods inside d intervals i e cβ 0 for compact rainfall this means that orographic precipitation is characterized by lower duration and more compact and intense rainfall events in addition at the rainfall intensification region close to the shore of delaware and maryland see 40 n 76 w in figs 1 and 8 land falling storms lead to higher values of d cln and cβ indicating that the rainfall process has much higher variability with subsequent increase of the frequency and intensity of rainfall extremes see fig 8 shifting to the am approach by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 fig 12 shows the spatial variation of the gev shape parameter k the most influential parameter to the frequency and intensity of rainfall extremes for three different record lengths n 2 fig 12b 10 fig 12c and 50 years fig 12d and contrasts it to the elevation map of the region fig 12a similar plots for the remaining parameters of the am approach i e μ σ and c are presented in the supporting information see fig s 4 one sees that for small sample lengths e g n 2 years the shape parameter is spatially constant and equal to zero the reason for this is that for small sample sizes the estimates of k resulted to be negative and were set to zero see section 3 1 as the length of the samples increases see fig 12c for n 10 years and fig 12d for n 50 years the spatial variation of k becomes more apparent although without explicit linkage to the topography and local climatology of the region this can be attributed to the significant variability of the obtained k estimates which highly depends on the length of the available series as it can be seen from the boxplots in fig 14 even for sample sizes on the order of n 50 years the distribution of the shape parameter estimates has not yet converged for moment orders higher than the mean with regard to the pot approach fig 13 shows how the shape parameter k left column and parameter h in eq 9 right column vary spatially for different sample sizes n 2 10 and 50 years similar plots for the remaining parameters of the pot approach i e s g and c are presented in the supporting information see fig s 5 one sees that while sensitivity of the parameters of the pot method is less pronounced than that of the am approach still there is no explicit linkage to the topography and local climatology of the region for example regions of higher elevation may exhibit either low or high k and h parameter values see red broken line boxes in fig 13 overall it follows from the discussion in this and the previous sections that in comparison to the am four parameter and pot five parameter idf estimation methods the four parameter mf approach provides a parsimonious and physically meaningful parameter setting which is consistent with the local topography and rainfall climatology of the region while producing robust idf estimates even from short rainfall records 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the accuracy and robustness of three alternative parametric approaches to idf curve estimation from historical rainfall data namely a a four parameter model based on annual maxima am series developed by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 b a peaks over threshold pot approach with five parameters based on proper fitting of a reparameterized generalized pareto gp distribution to the scaled excesses of the average rainfall intensity id inside duration d in a threshold invariant way referred to as the multiple threshold method mtm see deidda 2010 followed by log linear regression of its parameters with d and c the analytical approximation developed by langousis et al 2009 for idf curve estimation which is based on multifractal scaling arguments resulting in a four parameter model the assessment was based on hourly rainfall measurements from 36 raingauge stations in the northeastern united states with more than 55 years of recordings where the model based idf estimates obtained from various record lengths n n 1 2 5 10 25 and 50 years were compared to the empirical idf estimates obtained from the full records in terms of relative bias and root mean squared error drmse in addition the spatial variation of both idf estimates and model parameter values was evaluated in the light of the local topography and rainfall climatology of the region with regard to the am parametric approach developed by koutsoyiannis et al 1998 we found that irrespective of the average duration d it results in considerable negative biases and dimensionless root mean squared errors which are larger for higher return periods t and increase significantly for sample sizes n 10 years see figs 9 and 10 and the discussion in section 4 1 in addition the obtained parameter estimates did not display explicit linkage to the topography and local climatology of the region with the shape parameter estimates being highly variable even for large sample sizes on the order of 50 years similar findings were obtained for the 5 parameter pot approach although in this case the statistical variability of model parameters was less pronounced shifting to the four parameter multifractal analytical approximation for idf curve estimation developed by langousis et al 2009 the conducted analysis showed that when compared to the am and pot parametric approaches it produces more accurate and robust idf estimates both in terms of relative bias and drmse irrespective of the duration d and return period t of interest in addition the parameters of the method were found to be descriptive of the local topography and rainfall climatology providing a physically meaningful modeling setting this was the case even for rainfall records with significant length limitations i e 1 2 years of data as the method exploits the statistical structure of rainfall at multiple time scales utilizing information from the complete rainfall record rather than a small portion of it i e rainfall excesses above a properly selected threshold or annual maxima concluding while all three idf estimation methods considered produce acceptable results in terms of accuracy and robustness for historical record lengths on the order of 25 years or more the multifractal analytical approximation introduced by langousis et al 2009 for rainfall idf curve estimation is the less sensitive one to data length requirements producing more accurate and robust idf estimates even for sample sizes n down to 1 2 years also its application is simple and straightforward see section 3 3 making it suitable for hydrological applications and engineering design irrespective of the duration d and return period t of interest with significant advantages in terms of accuracy and robustness relative to parametric approaches based on annual maxima am and peaks over threshold pot series for example as shown in fig 9a for duration d 1 h the relative biases of am idf estimates range from 10 to more than 30 with larger values been associated with higher return periods and lower sample sizes whereas the corresponding relative biases of mf idf estimates are smaller than 10 even for sample sizes down 1 year this together with the lower uncertainty of mf idf estimates see fig 10 significantly reduce the risk of under design of hydraulic infrastructures when rainfall recordings are short the aforementioned attributes of the mf approach together with the descriptive linkage of its parameters to the local topography and rainfall climatology make it particularly appealing for regional frequency analysis and idf estimation at ungauged locations these two topics will form the subjects of follow up communications credit authorship contribution
