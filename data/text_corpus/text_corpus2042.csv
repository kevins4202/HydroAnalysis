10210,in the agricultural water resources system the regional yield is hard to be simulated accurately under the impacts of spatial heterogeneities of soil weather and crop types the optimal water allocation schemes may be not in accordance with actual conditions due to neglecting the actual crop growth process meanwhile the uncertainties in the simulation optimization models are not easy to be addressed to deal with the above problems this paper develops a framework of the distributed aquacrop simulation nonlinear multi objective dependent chance programming distributed aquacrop nmofdcp for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties this developed model is applied to a case study of irrigation water resources management in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin in china the 134 homogeneous decision making units dmus are divided to depict the spatial heterogeneities of the study area and 472 decision variables irrigation amount for 134 dmus are optimized moreover the model deals with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy goals and tradeoffs relationships between objectives of the yield and water productivity and measures the satisfactory degrees between objectives and their fuzzy goals two groups of pareto solutions corresponding to the maximum satisfactory degree of the yield and the maximum satisfactory degree of the water productivity are obtained by the parallel genetic algorithm pga method respectively in addition water allocation satisfactory degree of the yield and satisfactory degree of water productivity are analyzed at the decision making unit scale crop scale and irrigation district scale separately besides the effects of three weather conditions and four soil types on the system s outputs are conducted the results show that weather conditions and soil types have obvious effects on the system s outputs at three analysis scales and different water allocation patterns at the growth period affect the yield and water productivity keywords distributed simulation optimization model distributed aquacrop modeling nonlinear multi objective dependent chance programming parallel genetic algorithm uncertainty 1 introduction heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin of china the middle heihe river basin is an important food production base and irrigation occupies 83 of the total available water resources in the basin zhao et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 thus water resources play an important role in meeting the demand of food for the growing population however the significantly increasing water use leads to an inevitable water scarcity problem aggravating competition of water users singh 2012 lu et al 2016 therefore a reasonable water allocation scheme appears to be necessary to relieve water use stress improve water productivity and increase the crop yield to address above concerns a large number of simulation models and optimization models are developed for agricultural water resources management lu et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 zhang and guo 2018 the simulation models are usually used to get the answer of what if and optimization models deal with the question of what is the best under given set of constraints singh and panda 2013 for example simulation models usually conduct irrigation water resources management by simulating the crop yields under given water allocation schemes and selecting the scheme with highest crop yield they are incapable of getting globally optimal solution under the condition of limited water availability besides traversal method which selects the best one through comparing a series of water allocation alternatives needs to run the simulation model multiple times and is complex and time consuming the optimization models can get optimal water allocation schemes under a series of constraints however the complex simulation will make solution difficult and they need to simplify the simulation process usually by fitting water production functions of crops such as jessen function and quadratic function this will lead to that the optimal schemes may be not in accordance with actual situations because the fitted functions ignore the physical process of crop growth and the influences of spatial heterogeneities of weather and soil types on the yield gaur et al 2011 sedki and ouazar 2011 singh 2014 therefore it is essential to find a good way to couple simulation models with optimization models aimed at this problem previous studies often choose to focus on one or two aspects from spatial distribution temporal variability many crops and multiple objectives latifi et al 2019 hatamkhani et al 2020 rezapour tabari and soltani 2013 they cannot conduct optimizations to allocate water resources to many types of crops at different growth periods considering spatial heterogeneities of soils and weathers and deal with the many contradictory objectives moreover they are incapable of coping with uncertain parameters in simulation optimization models therefore the appropriate simulation optimization model considering the above problems needs to be established to simulate yields of crops at multiple irrigation districts with consideration of spatial heterogeneities of the above elements the distributed crop simulation model is required to be developed there are many distributed crop simulation models such as distributed hydrus epic model hao et al 2015 gswap model xu et al 2011 distributed aquacrop gis model and distributed swap epic model jiang et al 2015 among these models the distributed aquacrop gis model can achieve balances between robustness and simplicity thus is suitable to integrate with optimization models andarzian et al 2011 abedinpour et al 2012 trombetta et al 2016 li et al 2016a 2016b due to the nonlinearity of simulation model and multiple objectives the associated optimization models would belong to the nonlinear multi objective programming nmop as mentioned before the previous studies that develop the nobp model to conduct irrigation water resources management neglect spatial variability and simplified crop growth by the water production function yazdi 2014 wang et al 2019 nevertheless their expressions of optimization problems can also provide some references to our study there are mainly three kinds of uncertain parameters in the water resource management system including interval numbers fuzzy numbers and stochastic variables compared with interval numbers and stochastic variables fuzzy numbers can make balances between accuracy and simplicity and thus it has been widely used in expressing uncertainties of parameters in reality decision makers usually require the economic benefit not less than the goal of managers the goal of economic benefit has fuzziness because of managers subjectivities and knowledge thus the fuzzy dependent chance programming fdcp can be applied to address fuzzy goals of economic benefit to get optimal water allocation schemes corresponding to maximum satisfactory degrees and improve ability of the distributed simulation optimization model of handling fuzzy parameters peng and zhou 2011 wang et al 2018 therefore the fdcp model can be incorporated with the distributed simulation optimization model for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties the global optimal solutions of the distributed simulation optimization are hardly obtained by the conventional approaches due to its complicacy the genetic algorithm method ga has been widely used to address the above problem there are many kinds of ga methods such as parallel selection algorithm pga nsga ii method and weight coefficient transformation method cho et al 2004 amy et al 2005 yang et al 2008 among these methods the pga method is operated easily and thus it is adopted to solve the distributed simulation optimization models in this paper in this study a distributed aquacrop nonlinear multi objective fuzzy dependent chance programming distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is developed in this paper for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties it includes nonlinear multi objective programming nmop and fuzzy dependent chance programming fdcp and the distributed aquacrop model firstly the distributed aquacrop based on the arcgis considering spatial heterogeneities of soils weathers crops and irrigations on yields is developed which broadens applications of the aquacrop model at the single point scale secondly the distributed aquacrop nmop model is proposed which can get optimal water allocation schemes considering multiple objectives of the yield and water productivity and effects of daily soil water stresses and water exchanges in soil layers on yields thirdly the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is established by integrating the fdcp model into the distributed aquacrop nmop model which can deal with uncertainties presented as fuzzy goals of the yield and water productivity and measure the satisfactory degree between the yield water productivity and its fuzzy goals finally the optimal water allocation schemes and corresponding satisfactory degrees of the objectives can be obtained by using the pga method the developed distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is applied to a real case study of an irrigation water resources management system in the heihe river basin gansu province china to verify its application moreover results analysis at the irrigation district scale the crop scale and the decision making units scale are conducted and compared 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area is located in the middle reaches of heihe river basin hrb 97 37 102 06 e 37 44 42 40 n zhangye city gansu province northwest china and the total irrigation area is 2 56 104 km2 shown in fig 1 the study area includes 24 irrigation districts i e daman irrigation area represented by dm and four main crops e g field corn seed corn wheat and vegetable which are shown in fig 2 a b the zhangye 101 28 e 38 55 n linze 100 6 e 39 09 n and gaotai 99 47 e 39 22 n meteorological stations are used to monitor the meteorological features of the upstream midstream and downstream of the study area respectively the mean annual precipitation is 124 mm 113 mm and 103 mm and the mean annual evapotranspiration is 1174 mm 1103 mm and 1039 mm for 3 weather stations separately the variation rate of precipitation changes from 9 to 17 and the variation of evapotranspiration ranges from 6 to 11 respectively it shows that spatial differences in weather elements are relatively small and the single weather station can represent weather conditions of the surrounding irrigation districts where the corresponding relationship between the weather station and irrigation districts can be attained by the theissen polygon method operated at the gis platform because the rainfall is far less than evapotranspiration and thus most crop yields are derived from irrigation and the main water resources are extracted from the heihe river and supplementary groundwater resource there are main four soil types and the spatial distribution is shown in fig 2 c the first soil type t1 is composed of the silty loam at upper and lower layers the second soil type t2 consists of the silty loam and sandy loam the third soil type t3 includes the silty loam and loam the fourth soil type t4 is composed of loams each soil type has different field capacity and wilting points and thus owns and has different water retaining and ventilation capacities the 134 decision making units dmus are formed for 24 irrigation districts by overlapping the crop type layer soil type layer irrigation district boundary layer and the weather condition layer based on the gis platform there are 48 basic dmus composed of three weather types four soil types and four crop types and each irrigation district consists of different basic dmus moreover 134 dmus are formulated for 24 irrigation districts which have the characters of weather conditions crop types soil types and irrigation district types each unit has the same weather condition crop type soil type and irrigation district and the division result is shown in fig 2 d the crop simulation models can conduct irrigation water resources management by assessing the yield under a series of water allocation schemes but it can get the optimal water allocation schemes because of the nonlinear relationship between the yield and irrigation the optimization models can get the optimal water allocation schemes which may not follow the actual situation because of neglecting the growth crop process and simplifying the associated constraints thus it is essential to develop a simulation optimization model to conduct agricultural water resources management the spatial heterogeneities of weather conditions soil types and crop types should be considered in to the simulation optimization model when optimizing irrigation water resources is conducted at the regional scale because they affect the regional yield and water productivity thus a distributed simulation optimization model is desired to be established to optimize the irrigation water resources at regional scale with consideration of the spatial heterogeneities of weather condition soil types and crop types besides the agricultural water resources system is full of uncertainties such as randomness of runoff and fuzziness of goals caused by the subjectivity of managers these uncertain parameters affect the robustness of decisions thus the uncertainties require to be considered in the distributed simulation optimization model 2 2 distributed aquacrop modeling the aquacrop model is a crop growth simulation model http www fao org land water databases andsoftware aquacrop en it can simulate the crop yield and evaluate the response of the yield on irrigation under deficient irrigation the irrigation amount at each fixed irrigation date is optimized because irrigation amount plays an important role in the crop yield and water productivity moreover the broad irrigation is adopted in this paper the principles of the yield simulations are as follows firstly crop transpiration is simulated based on the green canopy cover cc secondly biomass is computed based on the crop transpiration finally the yield is calculated through multiplying biomass by the harvest index the detailed calculation steps are as follows aquacrop training handbooks the simulation of crop transpiration is as follows 1 t r k s cc k ctr x et 0 2 cc 1 72 cc cc 2 o 3 cc 3 3 et 0 0

kpa dry and wet constant the person correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and mean relative error mre are used to calibrate the aquacrop model at the single point scale the equations of statistical indicators are shown as follows 7 r i 1 n y i y y i ˆ y ˆ i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i ˆ y ˆ 2 8 rmse i 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 n 9 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i ˆ y i ˆ 100 where y ˆ and y are simulated values and observed values of crop indicators respectively y and y ˆ are the average value of observed values and simulated values separately n is the number of observed values the r 2 higher than 0 6 and the ratio between the rmse and average observed value less than 20 and the mre within 10 indicate the simulation accuracy of the distributed aquacrop at the single point scale can be adopted jiang et al 2015 the aquacrop model at single point scale can simulate the single point crop yield but it is unable to simulate the regional yield due to the influences of spatial heterogeneities of soil types weather conditions and crop types the distributed aquacrop model is developed based on the calibrated aquacrop model at a single point scale and the arcgis the steps of the distributed aquacrop modeling are as follows 1 overly the weather conditions layers crop types layer soil types layers and irrigation districts boundary layers and forming 134 homogeneous decision making units dmus where each dmu has the same weather condition crop and soil type and irrigation district which is operated in the gis platform 2 prepare the multiple groups of input data of the multiple aquacrop models at the single point scale where the numbers of groups of input data equal to the numbers of the dmus 3 generate the several groups of control files pro of the aquacrop model where the numbers of control files equal to the numbers of the dmus 4 input the control files into the aquacrop plug in folder http www fao org aquacrop and operating the acsav60 exe to get the crop yields of 134dmus 5 sum the yields of dmus to get the regional yield the distributed aquacrop model is calibrated by the determined coefficient r 2 through comparing the differences between actual statistical yield and simulated yield 10 r 2 1 i 1 n y i ˆ y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the r 2 ranges from 0 to1 and the r 2 larger than 0 6 is regarded as good simulation accuracy of the distributed aquacrop model jiang et al 2015 2 3 nonlinear multi objective fuzzy dependent chance programming optimization modeling a nonlinear multi objective programming fuzzy dependent chance programming nmofdcp optimization model is established to deal with the asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers and tradeoff the relationship amid multiple objectives and the expressions are as follows the detailed formulation of the optimization model is shown in the appendix objective 1 maximizing satisfactory degree of the crop yield 11 max f 1 ty 3 2 ty 2 i 1 134 a i y i 2 t y 3 t y 2 objective 2 maximizing satisfactory degree of water productivity

subscripts of decision making units dmus and the growth period of the crop respectively the growth periods of the field corn and seed corn are divided into four growth stages while these of the wheat and vegetable are divided into three growth periods separately wa it refers to water allocation of the crop at the i th dmu at the t th growth period decision variables m3 hm2 which means water resources are allocated to the dmus at the growth period scale thus each dmu with wheat or vegetable has three decision variables and the dmu with field corn or seed corn has four decision variables the numbers of dmus for the field corn seed corn wheat and vegetable are 20 50 28 and 36 in the whole study area respectively thus 472 20 4 50 4 28 3 36 3 numbers of decision variables for 134 dmus are formed wi is the water allocation of the crop at each dmu at the whole growth period m3 hm2 which is calculated by summing the water allocation at the whole growth period the f is a function transforming numbers of decision variables into numbers of dmus water demand constraints 15 wa it min wa it wa it max i t non negative constraints 16 wa it 0 i t where f 1 f 2 are the satisfactory degree of yield and water productivity respectively which ranges from 0 to 1 0 and the higher value indicates a higher satisfactory degree and the 0 5 is defined as the minimum satisfactory degree and the 1 0 is regarded as the maximum satisfactory degree wang et al 2020 the i 1 134 a i y i is the sum of the yield of 134 dmus and the i 1 134 a i wa i is the sum of water allocation amount of 134 dmus the ty 3 ty 2 wp 3 and wp 2 denote the maximum possible and possible values of fuzzy numbers of the yield kg and water productivity kg m3 respectively and the subindex 2 and 3 donate the possible

collection the input data of the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model include data of the distributed aquacrop model and data of the nmofdcp model which are described separately 2 4 1 the data collection for distributed aquacrop model the input data of the distributed aquacrop model are composed of weather data crop parameters soil parameters groundwater irrigation scheduling and field management the weather data in the year 2012 include rainfall temperature and other weather data are obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn the evapotranspiration is calculated by the p m equation the crop parameters and soil parameters are calibrated by the observed field data and simulated data which are operated at the aquacrop model the irrigation date is attained from the local survey and the irrigation amount is derived from the chromosomes generated by the ga method the irrigation dates of the field corn are 49th day 70th day 101st day and 125th day those of the seed corn are 37th day 64th day 93rd day and 116th day and those of wheat are 27th day 55th day and 83rd day and those of vegetable are 12th day 53rd day and 68th day respectively where the date is the distance from planting date of the crop the field management is got from the local survey 2 4 2 the data collection for optimization model the input data of the nmofdcp model consist of planting areas of crops crop yield water productivity fuzzy goals of the yield and fuzzy goals of water productivity the minimum and maximum water demand the available surface water and groundwater resources and canal water use coefficient the planting areas of dmus are extracted from the crop type layer based on the arcgis which is re categorized into the planting areas of four crops at 24 irrigation districts shown in fig 3 the yield is the sum of yields of 134 dmus obtained from running the distributed aquacrop model and the water productivity is calculated by yield dividing water allocation the asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers of the yield are 219 185 232 595 2 855 777 104 kg which are calculated by multiplying the yield per area by planting areas of all dmus the distributed aquacrop model simulates the yield per area of each dmu under the minimum water demand regular water demand and maximum water demand respectively the maximum water demand is calculated by multiplying the crop coefficient by the potential evapotranspiration the minimum water demand refers to li et al 2016a 2016b and the regular water demand is the average value of minimum water demand and maximum water demand the fuzzy numbers of water productivity are 1 23 1 62 3 63 kg m3 the available surface water and groundwater and canal water use coefficient are attained from the water conservancy annual report of zhangye city of the year 2012 the related parameters are shown in table 1 2 5 solving algorithm the parallel genetic algorithm pga is used to solve the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model the numbers of decision variables are 472 and the numbers of individuals are set as 100 the maximum generation takes 200 and the crossover probability and mutation probability are 0 7 and 0 01 respectively in this paper the toolbox of gatbx proposed by sheffield university is the basis to support the pga approach and it includes mainly functions of creating population calculating the fitness value selection crossover and mutation which are used to generate select crossover and mutate individuals and form new individuals to evolutions the steps of pga to solve the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model are as follows 1 generate the initial chromosomes based on the crtbp function that is a population creation function where the input data includes the upper and lower boundary numbers of decision variables and binary digits of decisions 2 calculate the fitness values of chromosomes based on the ranking function and values of objective functions the first 50 individuals are input into the first objective function to calculate the satisfactory degree of the yield of individuals and the last 50 individuals are input into the second objective function to calculate the satisfactory degree of water productivity of individuals 3 select the 50 individuals with higher fitness values based on the first objective value and the 50 individuals with higher fitness values based on the second objective value where the stochastic universal sampling selection is adopted to select the individuals 4 combine the selected individuals to form the new chromosomes and conduct crossover and mutation operation to chromosomes 5 generate the new chromosome 6 turn to the step 2 and repeat the steps 2 5 until the generation reaches the maximum generation or the objective functions are convergent 2 6 distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model fig 4 shows the working steps of the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model firstly the initial 100 random chromosomes irrigation amount created by the pga method are input into the nmofdcp model secondly the nmofdcp model calls the distributed aquacrop model to simulate yields of 100 individuals by inputting the 100 individuals into the 134 irr files of the distributed aquacrop model respectively moreover the yields of 134 dmus of 100 individuals are used to calculate the objective values of individuals e g the satisfactory degree of yield and the satisfactory degree of water productivity under a series of constraints such as water availability constraints water demand constraints thirdly the objective values regarded as fitness values are used to select the individuals with higher fitness values and then conduct the operations of crossover and mutation to the individuals to further form new 100 chromosomes finally the new chromosomes are input into the nmofdcp model and then the second and third steps are repeated until the generation reaches the maximum generation or the objective values are convergent this process concerns a large number of iterations between the distributed aquacrop model and the nmofdcp model the code is run based on the matlab platform and the operations of creating initial chromosomes selection crossover and mutation are based on the gatbx toolbox 3 results analysis and discussion 3 1 the calibration of the distributed aquacrop model the field observed data includes green canopy cover cc biomass b and soil water content swc and crop yield the data of 16 observed points are used for calibrate the crop parameters and soil parameters the relationship between simulated values and observed values of the green canopy cover biomass and soil water content are shown in fig 5 the statistical values of r rmse and mre of above crop indictors are shown in table 2 the r and rmse of the green canopy cover of four crops all exceed 0 93 and are less than 15 respectively indicating that the green canopy cover of four crops can be simulated well by the aquacrop model the r and rmse of the biomass of seed corn and filed corn surpass 0 96 and are less than 2 0 separately illustrating that simulated biomass agrees well with the observed values the r and rmse of the soil water content of four crops are all in the acceptable ranges disclosing that a good agreement between observed soil water content and simulated soil water content the mre and rmse of the yield of four crops are in the reasonable ranges indicating that the aquacrop model can simulate the yields of four crops well in summary the aquacrop model can simulate the green canopy cover biomass soil water content and yield well for four crops thus it is used selected as a basis to conduct the distributed aquacrop modeling the observed yield and simulated yield of the corn wheat and vegetable under the year 2012 are compared to validate the regional distributed aquacrop model moreover the result is shown in fig 6 it shows that the r 2 is 0 9126 indicating a good agreement between actual yield and simulated yield thus the distributed aquacrop model can be able to simulate the regional yield and used to couple with the nmofdcp model to optimize irrigation water resources 3 2 the system s outputs the optimal water allocation and the satisfactory degree of the yield and the satisfactory degree of water productivity can be obtained after 200 iterations between the distributed aquacrop model and the nmofdcp model the variations of objective functions with iteration numbers and the relationship between the two objective functions are shown in fig 7 a c there are 2 groups of optimal pareto water allocation schemes and the first group corresponds to the maximum satisfactory degree of the yield and another group corresponds to the maximum satisfactory degree of water productivity which are the 35th individual after 134 iterations and the 81st individual after 188 iterations separately fig 7 c shows that two objective functions are contradictory and the first 50 individuals tend to achieve the maximum satisfactory degree of yield while the last 50 individuals more prefer to reach the higher satisfactory degree of water productivity which is caused by the characters of the pga method besides the differences in water allocation and objective values are compared under two groups of optimal pareto solutions from three aspects 1 the output analysis at the irrigation district scale 2 the output analysis at the crop scale and 3 the output analysis at the decision making unit scale dmu the relationships amid three layer analysis are as follows the obtained optimal 472 water allocation per area decision variables are categorized into the water allocation per area of 134 dmus and the water allocations of 134 dmus are calculated by water allocations per area with the corresponding planting areas the water allocations of 134 dmus are categorized into four crops among 24 irrigation districts based on the relationship between irrigation districts and dmus the yield per area of 134 dmus is attained from the distributed aquacrop model and the yields of 134 dmus are calculated by multiplying the yields per area with the corresponding planting areas the yields of 134 dmus are classified into four crops amid 24 irrigation districts the water productivity of 134 dmus is calculated by the yield per area dividing the water allocation per area the water productivity of each crop is calculated by the yield dividing the water allocation and the water productivity of each irrigation district is calculated by the yield dividing the irrigation amount at the irrigation district scale the outputs analysis at the dmu scale is the analysis of water allocation per area yield per area and water productivity of each dmu the outputs analysis at the crop scale is the analysis of water allocation yield and water productivity of four crops the outputs analysis at the irrigation district scale is the analysis of water allocation yield and water productivity of each irrigation district and the system s outputs at three layers are recalculated based on the optimal water allocation scheme of 472 decision variables and the results of the three layers analysis are shown in figs 8 13 3 2 1 the system ouput analysis at the irrigation district scale fig 8 a c are the optimal water allocations yields and water productivities of 24 irrigation districts under 35th and 81st individuals fig 8 a shows the water allocations of most irrigation districts under the 35th individual are higher than the 81st individual and water allocations of a few irrigation districts under the 81st individual are bigger than the 35th taking the yingke yk and xinba xb as examples the water allocations of yk are 6799 6 104 m3 and 6235 1 104 m3 respectively and the water allocations of xb are 2726 7 104 m3 and 2889 8 104 m3 separately for 35th and 81st individuals this is because the optimal water allocation under the 35th individual is more likely to achieve the higher satisfactory degree of the yield which has a positive relationship with water allocation under deficient irrigation besides the optimal water allocation gives considerations to both the maximum satisfactory degree of the yield and maximum satisfactory degree of water productivity it discloses that water allocation of daman dm is highest and followed by xigan xg wujiang wj luotuocheng ltc yk ganjun gj shangsan ss youlian yl and xinhua xh and the water allocations in these irrigation districts exceed the average water allocation for the 35th individual the water allocation of hongyazi hyz is lowest ranked by huazhaizi hzz liuba lb nijiangying njy anyang ay yanuan yn pingchuan pc luocheng lc dahuwan dhw sanqing sq shahe sh liaoqian lq xiaotun xt and banqiao bq and the water allocations in these irrigation districts are below the average water allocation for the 35th individual the differences in water allocations amid 24 irrigation districts are casued by the crop types and planting areas in general the irrigation districts with larger planting areas and high area proportion of high water consumption areas e g seed corn will have more water allocation for example the proportion of the seed corn takes 64 and 2 5 of total crop areas which are 2 07 104 hm2 and 0 11 104 hm2 for dm and hyz individually thus it is essential to analyze the water allocation of each crop at the crop scale fig 8 b shows that the average yields are 1112 2 104 kg and 1111 2 104 kg for 35th and 81st individuals respectively the yield under the 35th individual is higher than the 81st individual besides the yield sort is similar to the water allocation sort amid 24 irrigation districts indicating the water allocation has a positive effect on the yield under deficit irrigation moreover differences in yields of most irrigation districts are relatively small but the differences in water allocations are relatively high this can be explained by reasons that excessive irrigation at each irrigation date will lead to deep infiltration that is ineffective for yield increment moreover the yield has no obvious relationship with irrigation because of the water exchanges in the soil layer and trigged water stress it discloses that the yield ratio is not equal to the planting area ratio for 24 irrigation districts which is because the irrigation district has the bigger area proportion of the high yield crop e g vegetable will have more yield fig 8 c discloses that the average water productivity under the 35th individual is lower than the 81st individual the difference in average water productivity under two individuals is 0 15 kg m3 which means adopting the optimal water allocation under 81st individual will increase the 0 15 kg yield per unit of water allocation taking the water productivity under the 81st individual as an example the lc possess the highest water productivity followed by dm ss njy hzz hyz dhw xg ltc xb and xh and the water productivity in these irrigation districts exceed the average water productivity besides the water productivity of bq is lowest ranked by ay lb yl and gj below the average water productivity the differences in water productivity rank amid 24 irrigation districts are caused by the ratio between the yield and water allocation where the irrigation district with higher yield and lower water allocation will own higher water productivity that means the crop types affect water allocations yields and water productivities of irrigation districts and thus it is vital to analyze the crop compositions of irrigation districts at the crop scale fig 9 shows the optimal water allocations of four crops of 24 irrigation districts under two individuals at the crop scale it indicates that the water allocations of four crops at most irrigation districts are similar with water allocations at the district scale between two individuals besides the average water allocation of the seed corn is highest followed by the vegetable field corn and wheat which is caused by the different water demands taking the 35th individual as an example it implies that the water allocation of the field corn at the yk is highest and that of the bq is lowest besides the planting area ratio of the filed corn between yk and yl is 0 93 and the water allocation ratio is 0 64 presenting unequal relationship between the planting area and water allocation this means that water allocation of one crop is different for various weather conditions or soil types the water allocation of the seed corn in the dm is highest followed by the xg wj ltc ss and bq same with the water allocation rank at the irrigation district scale the water allocation orders of the vegetable are consistent with the water allocation orders at the irrigation district scale it illustrates that the irrigation district with a higher area ratio of the seed corn and vegetable owns bigger water allocation the seed corn vegetable and wheat also own the unbalanced relationship between water allocation ratio and planting area ratio among 24 irrigation districts fig 10 shows optimal yields of four crops among 24 irrigation districts under two individuals the results show that regulations of yields of four crops are similar with the yields at the irrigation district scale presenting a nonlinear relationship between the yield and water allocation moreover it implies that the average yield of vegetables is highest followed by seed corn field corn and wheat this is because the yield per area of vegetable is highest and the planting area of seed corn is biggest it shows that the yield of the field corn at yk is maximum while that at the ltc is the minimum for the 35th individual the decreasing order of yield of the seed corn is the dm xg wj ltc and ss consistent with the yield rank at the irrigation district scale it illustrates that the yield of seed corn is an important component of the yield of the irrigation district the planting area ratio and the yield ratio between yk and gj are 0 96 and 1 01 separately presenting an unbalanced relationship between the area and the yield the yields and areas of field corn wheat and vegetable also present above regulations caused by various weather conditions and soil types fig 11 shows the optimal water productivities of four crops under two individuals it discloses that the average water productivity of vegetables is highest followed by the wheat seed corn and field corn this is because water productivity is affected by the yield and water allocation and crop with higher yield and lower water allocation will have bigger water productivity the field corn at dhw possesses the biggest water productivity and that at ay has the lowest water productivity for the 81st individual the results indicate that water productivities of the field corn seed corn vegetable and wheat also affected by soils and weathers in summary it is crucial to ascertain the effects of water conditions and soil types on water allocation yield and water productivity at the dmu scale 3 2 2 the system ouput analysis at the decision making unit scale fig 12 is the optimal water allocation per area of four crops under two individuals at the dmu scale the water allocation per area of four crops at partial dmus are selected and the selection criterion is that the dmus can presents the water allocation per area covering all kinds of weather conditions and soil types taking the field corn as an example there are 6 kinds of combinations of weather and soil types including the zhangye station and t1 zhangye station and t4 linze station and t1 linze station and t4 gaotai station and t1 and gaotao station and t4 and the corresponding dmus are dm 2 yk 2 ay bq sq 3 yl 4 sq 1 yl 2 sq 1 yl 2 and dhw 2 hyz 2 and the water allocations of the other three crops at corresponding dmus are in fig 12 it indicates that water allocation per area of the field corn changes from 6140 m3 hm2 and 8180 m3 hm2 the water allocation per area of the seed corn varies from 5840 m3 hm2 to 8680 m3 hm2 the water allocation of the wheat fluctuates from 3690 m3 hm2 to 5390 m3 hm2 and the water allocation of the vegetables alters from 5450 m3 hm2 to 8350 m3 hm2 it illustrates that the water allocation per area exits differences for each crop and this is caused by the different weather conditions and soil types it discloses that water allocation of each crop at two irrigation districts with the same soil types and weather conditions are different because there are no constraints to limit the ineffective water loss e g deep infiltration therefore the same irrigation amount is conducted to uncover effects of soil types and weather conditions on water allocation per area fig 13 is the optimal yield per area and water productivity of four crops at the dmu scale under the 35th individual it shows that the yield per area of the field corn ranges from 9426 kg hm2 to 11 199 kg hm2 and the yield per area of the seed corn changes from 9022 kg hm2 to 10 006 kg hm2 and the yield per area of the wheat varies from 6198 kg hm2 to 7013 kg hm2 and the yield per area of the vegetables alters from 60 600 kg hm2 to 69 592 kg hm2 the differences in the yield per area for one crop among different dmus are casued by various soil types and weather conditions the water productivity of the field corn ranges from 1 17 kg m3 to 1 79 kg m3 and the water productivity of the seed corn changes from 1 15 kg m3 to 1 57 kg m3 and water productivity of the wheat varies from 1 20 kg m3 to 1 85 kg m3 and the water productivity of the vegetables alters from 8 33 kg m3 to 11 72 kg m3 it illustrates that water productivity of one crop presents obvious variations which is influenced by soil types and weather conditions it also indicates that the yield per area and water productivity exist differences for the dmus with the same weather condition and soil type thus the same irrigation amount is input to the above dmuts to figure out the effects of soil types and weather conditions on yield per area and water productivity firstly the effects of soil types on the yield per area and water productivity under the same irrigation scheduling are conducted taking zhangye station as an example the yield and water productivity for field corn under t2 is biggest followed by t4 t1 and t3 the other crops with linze station and gaotai weather conditions also have the above regulations it is because the different soil types have different field capacities and wilting points and own different water containing capacities and water stresses such as the water stress reducing leaf expansion stomatal closure and early canopy senescence they all affect the crop evapotransporation water allocation yield and water productivity for example the field capacity of t1 is biggest followed by t3 t4 and t2 and thus the water containing capacity of t1 is highest followed by t3 t4 and t2 the soil water content threshold trigging the water stress is negative with the difference between field capacity and wilting point and thus the water stress under t2 is smallest followed by t3 t4 and t1 under the same irrigation scheduling because irrigation numbers are limited the water stress occurs in the two relatively long irrigation intervals and thus the water stress under t2 is smallest followed by t4 t3 and t1 under the same irirgation amount secondly the influences of weather conditions on the yield per area and water productivity under the same irrigation scheduling are operated there are three weather conditions including zhangye station linze station and gaotai station it shows that the yield per area and water productivity under gaotai is biggest followed by linze and zhangye station which is caused by the different precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature the zhangye station has the highest evapotranspiration and precipitation followed by linze station and gaotai station but the difference between evapotranspiration and precipitation under gaotai station is lowest ranked by linze and zhangye station and thus water demand of crop under gaotai is more easily to be satisfied under the same irrigation scheduling followed by linze station and gaotai station besides the difference between maximum temperature and minimum temperature also affects the yield per area by influencing the temperature water stress in general the higher difference in temperature under the allowable temperature is more beneficial to increasing the yield and thus the yield under gaotai with the maximum difference between maximum temperature and minimum temperature is biggest ranked by linze and zhangye station the yield per area and water productivity ranks of other crops and four soil types present the above regulations therefore figuring out the above regulation can help managers make the optimal water allocation schemes the effects of water allocation pattern on the yield per area and water productivity are explored by increasing or decreasing the water allocation at four irrigation dates taking the one dmu at dhw donated as dhw 1 as an example the four irrigation dates of the filed corn are 49th day 70th day 101st day and 125th day corresponding to the jointing trumpet stage heading stage grouting stage and mature stage respectively the irrigation amounts at four irrigation dates are 202 mm 86 mm 133 mm and 193 mm separately four cases are formulated to compare the variations of the yield per area and water productivity under different water allocation pattern case1 replace the water allocation at 49th day by the water allocation at 70th day 101st day and 125th day in turn which means the irrigation amount at the 49th day decreases by 116 mm 69 mm and 9 mm compared with the water allocation of 202 mm separately cases 2 4 are changing water allocation of 70th day 101st day and 125th day by water allocation at other three days similar with the case 1 separately the results show that the yield per area decreases for exchanging the water allocation between 49th day and 70th day while the yield per area increases under the other two combinations 49th day and 101st day and 49th day and 125th day this is because the reduction in water allocation brings out higher water pressure triggering early canopy senescence at the jointing trumpet stage it also discloses increasing irrigation amounts at the grouting stage and mature stage contributes to the increase in yield while decreasing the irrigation amount at the jointing trumpet stage is not beneficial to increasing the yield the results indicate that the obvious increase or decrease in water allocation will lead to an increase or decrease in the yield while the slight variation of water allocation makes no sense besides the water allocation at the jointing trumpet stage grouting stage and mature stage significantly affects yield and increasing water allocation appropriately at these growth periods is beneficial to increase the yield per area consequently the nmofdcp approach can get compromised optimal water allocation schemes with consideration of two objectives the water allocation schemes under the 35th individual focus on the maximum satisfactory degree of yield while that under the 81st individual is more concerned with the satisfactory degree of water productivity if decision makers prefer more to the maximum yield they can choose the water allocation schemes under the 35th individual if decision makers want to achieve higher water productivity they can select the water allocation schemes under the 81st individual the actual irrigation scheduling obatined from the local survey will be compared with optimal water allocation schemes attained from the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model shown as table 3 3 3 discussion 3 3 1 comparison with actual water allocation schemes the actual water allocation is obtained from the local survey and the results are shown in table 3 compared with the actual water allocation the total water allocation schemes under 35th and 81st individuals save 2 53 108 m3 and 3 78 108 m3 individually and the satisfactory degree of yield and water productivity improves 0 0038 0 0024 0 0893 and 0 1479 respectively this means yields enlarge by 3980 103 kg 2460 103 kg and water productivity increases by 0 36 kg m3 and 0 6 kg m3 separately it demonstrates that the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model could increase the yield and improve water use efficiency besides the water allocation yield per area and water productivity of each crop under various weather conditions and soil types are different and thus the spatial heterogeneities of weather conditions and soil types should be considered in the process of decision making however the above factors are not considered in the actual water allocation and thus the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model has more robustness in the actual irrigation water allocation management system 3 3 2 comparison with distributed aquacrop gis simulation model li et al developed a distirbuted aquacrop gis for modeling crop water consumption and water productivity in the middle reaches of heihe river basin li et al 2016a 2016b they assessed water consumptions yield and water use efficiency of 22 irrigation districts under historical irrigation scheduling however they do not analyze the impacts of soil types crops types weather conditions and irrigations on the yield and water use efficiency besides they cannot get the optimal water allocation schemes with consideration of both yields and water use efficiency therefore the developed model has higher robustness 3 3 3 comparison with optimization models yue et al fitted jessen function to describe the nonlinear relationship between the yield and irrigation and further guide water allocation yue et al 2020 it can reflect the water stress on yields by fitting the sensitivity indicator of each growth period however they cannot quantify daily soil water stress on yields and neglected influences of soil water exchanges in soil layers on the yields and water use efficiency besides the jessen functions with consideration of spatial heterogeneities of soils crops weathers and irrigation are hard to be fitted therefore the obatined water allocation may be not follow actual situations this means the developed model is more applicable for irrigation water resources management 4 conclusion in this paper the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is developed for irrigation water resources management under uncertainty the nonlinear multi objective programming nmop fuzzy dependent chance programming fdcp are coupled with the distributed aquacrop model it is applied to a case study of the middle heihe river basin to allocate irrigation water resources to the field corn seed corn wheat and vegetable to verify its application and the results show that the proposed model can be a reliable and effective tool the significant findings of this paper are that 1 the distributed aquacrop model with consideration of spatial heterogeneities of weather conditions soil types and crop types is developed which can simulate regional yield more accurately and broaden applications of the aquacrop model at a single scale 2 the distributed aquacrop nmop model is established which can get optimal water allocation schemes considering multiple objectives and effects of soil water stresses and water exchanges 3 the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is established and it can deal with the uncertainties presented as asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers and tradeoff relationships between the yield and fuzzy goals of yield and the relationship between water productivity and fuzzy goals of water productivity it demonstrates that the developed model is applicable for addressing agricultural water allocation problem in arid and semi arid districts however the water distribution system affects water depth flow velocity canal infiltration and flow continuity and further the water allocation which should be considered as a series of constraints in the future work besides the model can only deal with the uncertainties presented as fuzzy numbers and the more uncertain parameters such as stochastic variables should be incorporated into the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china no 41871199 appendix the initial two objective functions are maximizing the crop yield and maximizing the crop water productivity shown as follows objective1 maximizing the crop yield maximize f 1 i 1 134 a i y i objective 2 maximizing the water productivity maximize f 2 i 1 134 a i y i i 1 134 a i wa i because of the decision makers usually require objective functions satisfy the goal set by themselves and the goals have fuzziness characters due to the subjectiveness of decision makers and thus the relationship between objective function and the goal is transformed into the relationship between objective function and fuzzy goals b b 1 b 2 b 3 which can be measured by the credibility measure and its expression is as follows objective function f a x distribution functions of the credibility measure c r a x b 0 a x b 1 a x b 1 2 b 2 b 1 b 1 a x b 2 b 3 2 b 2 a x 2 b 3 b b 2 a x b 3 1 a x b 3 where f is objective function b is the fuzzy goals presented as asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers b b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 1 b 2 and b 3 are minimum possible value possible value and maximum possible value of fuzzy numbers respectively cr is the credibility degree which measured the degree of objective function fulfilling the fuzzy goals it usually be set greater than 0 5 to avoid the unsuitable satisfactory degree and violation risk in management thus the above equation is transformed as following format max γ b 3 2 b 2 a x 2 b 3 b 2 when a x b where γ is the credibility level satisfactory degree and thus two objective functions are transformed into objective functions of maximizing the satisfactory degrees of yield and water productivity shown as follows objective 1 maximizing satisfactory degree of crop yield 9 maximize f 1 ty 3 2 ty 2 i 1 134 a i y i 2 t y 3 t y 2 objective 2 maximizing satisfactory degree of water productivity 10 maximize f 2 wp 3 2 wp 2 i 1 134 a i y i i 1 134 a i wa i 2 wp 3 wp 2 where asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers of total yield are t y t y 1 t y 2 t y 3 and asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers of total water productivity are w p w p 1 w p 2 w p 3 ty 2 ty 3 wp 2 and wp 3 are possible value and maximum possible value of fuzzy yield and the possible value and maximum possible value of fuzzy water productivity respectively 
10210,in the agricultural water resources system the regional yield is hard to be simulated accurately under the impacts of spatial heterogeneities of soil weather and crop types the optimal water allocation schemes may be not in accordance with actual conditions due to neglecting the actual crop growth process meanwhile the uncertainties in the simulation optimization models are not easy to be addressed to deal with the above problems this paper develops a framework of the distributed aquacrop simulation nonlinear multi objective dependent chance programming distributed aquacrop nmofdcp for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties this developed model is applied to a case study of irrigation water resources management in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin in china the 134 homogeneous decision making units dmus are divided to depict the spatial heterogeneities of the study area and 472 decision variables irrigation amount for 134 dmus are optimized moreover the model deals with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy goals and tradeoffs relationships between objectives of the yield and water productivity and measures the satisfactory degrees between objectives and their fuzzy goals two groups of pareto solutions corresponding to the maximum satisfactory degree of the yield and the maximum satisfactory degree of the water productivity are obtained by the parallel genetic algorithm pga method respectively in addition water allocation satisfactory degree of the yield and satisfactory degree of water productivity are analyzed at the decision making unit scale crop scale and irrigation district scale separately besides the effects of three weather conditions and four soil types on the system s outputs are conducted the results show that weather conditions and soil types have obvious effects on the system s outputs at three analysis scales and different water allocation patterns at the growth period affect the yield and water productivity keywords distributed simulation optimization model distributed aquacrop modeling nonlinear multi objective dependent chance programming parallel genetic algorithm uncertainty 1 introduction heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin of china the middle heihe river basin is an important food production base and irrigation occupies 83 of the total available water resources in the basin zhao et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 thus water resources play an important role in meeting the demand of food for the growing population however the significantly increasing water use leads to an inevitable water scarcity problem aggravating competition of water users singh 2012 lu et al 2016 therefore a reasonable water allocation scheme appears to be necessary to relieve water use stress improve water productivity and increase the crop yield to address above concerns a large number of simulation models and optimization models are developed for agricultural water resources management lu et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 zhang and guo 2018 the simulation models are usually used to get the answer of what if and optimization models deal with the question of what is the best under given set of constraints singh and panda 2013 for example simulation models usually conduct irrigation water resources management by simulating the crop yields under given water allocation schemes and selecting the scheme with highest crop yield they are incapable of getting globally optimal solution under the condition of limited water availability besides traversal method which selects the best one through comparing a series of water allocation alternatives needs to run the simulation model multiple times and is complex and time consuming the optimization models can get optimal water allocation schemes under a series of constraints however the complex simulation will make solution difficult and they need to simplify the simulation process usually by fitting water production functions of crops such as jessen function and quadratic function this will lead to that the optimal schemes may be not in accordance with actual situations because the fitted functions ignore the physical process of crop growth and the influences of spatial heterogeneities of weather and soil types on the yield gaur et al 2011 sedki and ouazar 2011 singh 2014 therefore it is essential to find a good way to couple simulation models with optimization models aimed at this problem previous studies often choose to focus on one or two aspects from spatial distribution temporal variability many crops and multiple objectives latifi et al 2019 hatamkhani et al 2020 rezapour tabari and soltani 2013 they cannot conduct optimizations to allocate water resources to many types of crops at different growth periods considering spatial heterogeneities of soils and weathers and deal with the many contradictory objectives moreover they are incapable of coping with uncertain parameters in simulation optimization models therefore the appropriate simulation optimization model considering the above problems needs to be established to simulate yields of crops at multiple irrigation districts with consideration of spatial heterogeneities of the above elements the distributed crop simulation model is required to be developed there are many distributed crop simulation models such as distributed hydrus epic model hao et al 2015 gswap model xu et al 2011 distributed aquacrop gis model and distributed swap epic model jiang et al 2015 among these models the distributed aquacrop gis model can achieve balances between robustness and simplicity thus is suitable to integrate with optimization models andarzian et al 2011 abedinpour et al 2012 trombetta et al 2016 li et al 2016a 2016b due to the nonlinearity of simulation model and multiple objectives the associated optimization models would belong to the nonlinear multi objective programming nmop as mentioned before the previous studies that develop the nobp model to conduct irrigation water resources management neglect spatial variability and simplified crop growth by the water production function yazdi 2014 wang et al 2019 nevertheless their expressions of optimization problems can also provide some references to our study there are mainly three kinds of uncertain parameters in the water resource management system including interval numbers fuzzy numbers and stochastic variables compared with interval numbers and stochastic variables fuzzy numbers can make balances between accuracy and simplicity and thus it has been widely used in expressing uncertainties of parameters in reality decision makers usually require the economic benefit not less than the goal of managers the goal of economic benefit has fuzziness because of managers subjectivities and knowledge thus the fuzzy dependent chance programming fdcp can be applied to address fuzzy goals of economic benefit to get optimal water allocation schemes corresponding to maximum satisfactory degrees and improve ability of the distributed simulation optimization model of handling fuzzy parameters peng and zhou 2011 wang et al 2018 therefore the fdcp model can be incorporated with the distributed simulation optimization model for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties the global optimal solutions of the distributed simulation optimization are hardly obtained by the conventional approaches due to its complicacy the genetic algorithm method ga has been widely used to address the above problem there are many kinds of ga methods such as parallel selection algorithm pga nsga ii method and weight coefficient transformation method cho et al 2004 amy et al 2005 yang et al 2008 among these methods the pga method is operated easily and thus it is adopted to solve the distributed simulation optimization models in this paper in this study a distributed aquacrop nonlinear multi objective fuzzy dependent chance programming distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is developed in this paper for irrigation water resources management under uncertainties it includes nonlinear multi objective programming nmop and fuzzy dependent chance programming fdcp and the distributed aquacrop model firstly the distributed aquacrop based on the arcgis considering spatial heterogeneities of soils weathers crops and irrigations on yields is developed which broadens applications of the aquacrop model at the single point scale secondly the distributed aquacrop nmop model is proposed which can get optimal water allocation schemes considering multiple objectives of the yield and water productivity and effects of daily soil water stresses and water exchanges in soil layers on yields thirdly the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is established by integrating the fdcp model into the distributed aquacrop nmop model which can deal with uncertainties presented as fuzzy goals of the yield and water productivity and measure the satisfactory degree between the yield water productivity and its fuzzy goals finally the optimal water allocation schemes and corresponding satisfactory degrees of the objectives can be obtained by using the pga method the developed distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is applied to a real case study of an irrigation water resources management system in the heihe river basin gansu province china to verify its application moreover results analysis at the irrigation district scale the crop scale and the decision making units scale are conducted and compared 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area is located in the middle reaches of heihe river basin hrb 97 37 102 06 e 37 44 42 40 n zhangye city gansu province northwest china and the total irrigation area is 2 56 104 km2 shown in fig 1 the study area includes 24 irrigation districts i e daman irrigation area represented by dm and four main crops e g field corn seed corn wheat and vegetable which are shown in fig 2 a b the zhangye 101 28 e 38 55 n linze 100 6 e 39 09 n and gaotai 99 47 e 39 22 n meteorological stations are used to monitor the meteorological features of the upstream midstream and downstream of the study area respectively the mean annual precipitation is 124 mm 113 mm and 103 mm and the mean annual evapotranspiration is 1174 mm 1103 mm and 1039 mm for 3 weather stations separately the variation rate of precipitation changes from 9 to 17 and the variation of evapotranspiration ranges from 6 to 11 respectively it shows that spatial differences in weather elements are relatively small and the single weather station can represent weather conditions of the surrounding irrigation districts where the corresponding relationship between the weather station and irrigation districts can be attained by the theissen polygon method operated at the gis platform because the rainfall is far less than evapotranspiration and thus most crop yields are derived from irrigation and the main water resources are extracted from the heihe river and supplementary groundwater resource there are main four soil types and the spatial distribution is shown in fig 2 c the first soil type t1 is composed of the silty loam at upper and lower layers the second soil type t2 consists of the silty loam and sandy loam the third soil type t3 includes the silty loam and loam the fourth soil type t4 is composed of loams each soil type has different field capacity and wilting points and thus owns and has different water retaining and ventilation capacities the 134 decision making units dmus are formed for 24 irrigation districts by overlapping the crop type layer soil type layer irrigation district boundary layer and the weather condition layer based on the gis platform there are 48 basic dmus composed of three weather types four soil types and four crop types and each irrigation district consists of different basic dmus moreover 134 dmus are formulated for 24 irrigation districts which have the characters of weather conditions crop types soil types and irrigation district types each unit has the same weather condition crop type soil type and irrigation district and the division result is shown in fig 2 d the crop simulation models can conduct irrigation water resources management by assessing the yield under a series of water allocation schemes but it can get the optimal water allocation schemes because of the nonlinear relationship between the yield and irrigation the optimization models can get the optimal water allocation schemes which may not follow the actual situation because of neglecting the growth crop process and simplifying the associated constraints thus it is essential to develop a simulation optimization model to conduct agricultural water resources management the spatial heterogeneities of weather conditions soil types and crop types should be considered in to the simulation optimization model when optimizing irrigation water resources is conducted at the regional scale because they affect the regional yield and water productivity thus a distributed simulation optimization model is desired to be established to optimize the irrigation water resources at regional scale with consideration of the spatial heterogeneities of weather condition soil types and crop types besides the agricultural water resources system is full of uncertainties such as randomness of runoff and fuzziness of goals caused by the subjectivity of managers these uncertain parameters affect the robustness of decisions thus the uncertainties require to be considered in the distributed simulation optimization model 2 2 distributed aquacrop modeling the aquacrop model is a crop growth simulation model http www fao org land water databases andsoftware aquacrop en it can simulate the crop yield and evaluate the response of the yield on irrigation under deficient irrigation the irrigation amount at each fixed irrigation date is optimized because irrigation amount plays an important role in the crop yield and water productivity moreover the broad irrigation is adopted in this paper the principles of the yield simulations are as follows firstly crop transpiration is simulated based on the green canopy cover cc secondly biomass is computed based on the crop transpiration finally the yield is calculated through multiplying biomass by the harvest index the detailed calculation steps are as follows aquacrop training handbooks the simulation of crop transpiration is as follows 1 t r k s cc k ctr x et 0 2 cc 1 72 cc cc 2 o 3 cc 3 3 et 0 0

kpa dry and wet constant the person correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and mean relative error mre are used to calibrate the aquacrop model at the single point scale the equations of statistical indicators are shown as follows 7 r i 1 n y i y y i ˆ y ˆ i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i ˆ y ˆ 2 8 rmse i 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 n 9 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i ˆ y i ˆ 100 where y ˆ and y are simulated

and the ratio between the rmse and average observed value less than 20 and the mre within 10 indicate the simulation accuracy of the distributed aquacrop at the single point scale can be adopted jiang et al 2015 the aquacrop model at single point scale can simulate the single point crop yield but it is unable to simulate the regional yield due to the influences of spatial heterogeneities of soil types weather conditions and crop types the distributed aquacrop model is developed based on the calibrated aquacrop model at a single point scale and the arcgis the steps of the distributed aquacrop modeling are as follows 1 overly the weather conditions layers crop types layer soil types layers and irrigation districts boundary layers and forming 134 homogeneous decision making units dmus where each dmu has the same weather condition crop and soil type and irrigation district which is operated in the gis platform 2 prepare the multiple groups of input data of the multiple aquacrop models at the single point scale where the numbers of groups of input data equal to the numbers of the dmus 3 generate the several groups of control files pro of the aquacrop model where the numbers of control files equal to the numbers of the dmus 4 input the control files into the aquacrop plug in folder http www fao org aquacrop and operating the acsav60 exe to get the crop yields of 134dmus 5 sum the yields of dmus to get the regional yield the distributed aquacrop model is calibrated by the determined coefficient r 2 through comparing the differences between actual statistical yield and simulated yield 10 r 2 1 i 1 n y i ˆ y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the r 2 ranges from 0 to1 and the r 2 larger than 0 6 is regarded as good simulation accuracy of the distributed aquacrop model jiang et al 2015 2 3 nonlinear multi objective fuzzy dependent chance programming optimization modeling a nonlinear multi objective programming fuzzy dependent chance programming nmofdcp optimization model is established to deal with the asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers and tradeoff the relationship amid multiple objectives and the expressions are as follows the detailed formulation of the optimization model is

subscripts of decision making units dmus and the growth period of the crop respectively the growth periods of the field corn and seed corn are divided into four growth stages while these of the wheat and vegetable are divided into three growth periods separately wa it refers to water allocation of the crop at the i th dmu at the t th growth period decision variables m3 hm2 which means water resources are allocated to the dmus at the growth period scale thus each dmu with wheat or vegetable has three decision variables and the dmu with field corn or seed corn has four decision variables the numbers of dmus for the field corn seed corn wheat and vegetable are 20 50 28 and 36 in the whole study area respectively thus 472 20 4 50 4 28 3 36 3 numbers of decision variables for 134 dmus

collection the input data of the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model include data of the distributed aquacrop model and data of the nmofdcp model which are described separately 2 4 1 the data collection for distributed aquacrop model the input data of the distributed aquacrop model are composed of weather data crop parameters soil parameters groundwater irrigation scheduling and field management the weather data in the year 2012 include rainfall temperature and other weather data are obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn the evapotranspiration is calculated by the p m equation the crop parameters and soil parameters are calibrated by the observed field data and simulated data which are operated at the aquacrop model the irrigation date is attained from the local survey and the irrigation amount is derived from the chromosomes generated by the ga method the irrigation dates of the field corn are 49th day 70th day 101st day and 125th day those of the seed corn are 37th day 64th day 93rd day and 116th day and those of wheat are 27th day 55th day and 83rd day and those of vegetable are 12th day 53rd day and 68th day respectively where the date is the distance from planting date of the crop the field management is got from the local survey 2 4 2 the data collection for optimization model the input data of the nmofdcp model consist of planting areas of crops crop yield water productivity fuzzy goals of the yield and fuzzy goals of water productivity the minimum and maximum water demand the available surface water and groundwater resources and canal water use coefficient the planting areas of dmus are extracted from the crop type layer based on the arcgis which is re categorized into the planting areas of four crops at 24 irrigation districts shown in fig 3 the yield is the sum of yields of 134 dmus obtained from running the distributed aquacrop model and the water productivity is calculated by yield dividing water allocation the asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers of the yield are 219 185 232 595 2 855 777 104 kg which are calculated by multiplying the yield per area by planting areas of all dmus the distributed aquacrop model simulates the yield per area of each dmu under the minimum water demand regular water demand and maximum water demand respectively the maximum water demand is calculated by multiplying the crop coefficient by the potential evapotranspiration the minimum water demand refers to li et al 2016a 2016b and the regular water demand is the average value of minimum water demand and maximum water demand the fuzzy numbers of water productivity are 1 23 1 62 3 63 kg m3 the available surface water and groundwater and canal water use coefficient are attained from the water conservancy annual report of zhangye city of the year 2012 the related parameters are shown in table 1 2 5 solving algorithm the parallel genetic algorithm pga is used to solve the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model the numbers of decision variables are 472 and the numbers of individuals are set as 100 the maximum generation takes 200 and the crossover probability and mutation probability are 0 7 and 0 01 respectively in this paper the toolbox of gatbx proposed by sheffield university is the basis to support the pga approach and it includes mainly functions of creating population calculating the fitness value selection crossover and mutation which are used to generate select crossover and mutate individuals and form new individuals to evolutions the steps of pga to solve the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model are as follows 1 generate the initial chromosomes based on the crtbp function that is a population creation function where the input data includes the upper and lower boundary numbers of decision variables and binary digits of decisions 2 calculate the fitness values of chromosomes based on the ranking function and values of objective functions the first 50 individuals are input into the first objective function to calculate the satisfactory degree of the yield of individuals and the last 50 individuals are input into the second objective function to calculate the satisfactory degree of water productivity of individuals 3 select the 50 individuals with higher fitness values based on the first objective value and the 50 individuals with higher fitness values based on the second objective value where the stochastic universal sampling selection is adopted to select the individuals 4 combine the selected individuals to form the new chromosomes and conduct crossover and mutation operation to chromosomes 5 generate the new chromosome 6 turn to the step 2 and repeat the steps 2 5 until the generation reaches the maximum generation or the objective functions are convergent 2 6 distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model fig 4 shows the working steps of the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model firstly the initial 100 random chromosomes irrigation amount created by the pga method are input into the nmofdcp model secondly the nmofdcp model calls the distributed aquacrop model to simulate yields of 100 individuals by inputting the 100 individuals into the 134 irr files of the distributed aquacrop model respectively moreover the yields of 134 dmus of 100 individuals are used to calculate the objective values of individuals e g the satisfactory degree of yield and the satisfactory degree of water productivity under a series of constraints such as water availability constraints water demand constraints thirdly the objective values regarded as fitness values are used to select the individuals with higher fitness values and then conduct the operations of crossover and mutation to the individuals to further form new 100 chromosomes finally the new chromosomes are input into the nmofdcp model and then the second and third steps are repeated until the generation reaches the maximum generation or the objective values are convergent this process concerns a large number of iterations between the distributed aquacrop model and the nmofdcp model the code is run based on the matlab platform and the operations of creating initial chromosomes selection crossover and mutation are based on the gatbx toolbox 3 results analysis and discussion 3 1 the calibration of the distributed aquacrop model the field observed data includes green canopy cover cc biomass b and soil water content swc and crop yield the data of 16 observed points are used for calibrate the crop parameters and soil parameters the relationship between simulated values and observed values of the green canopy cover biomass and soil water content are shown in fig 5 the statistical values of r rmse and mre of above crop indictors are shown in table 2 the r and rmse of the green canopy cover of four crops all exceed 0 93 and are less than 15 respectively indicating that the green canopy cover of four crops can be simulated well by the aquacrop model the r and rmse of the biomass of seed corn and filed corn surpass 0 96 and are less than 2 0 separately illustrating that simulated biomass agrees well with the observed values the r and rmse of the soil water content of four crops are all in the acceptable ranges disclosing that a good agreement between observed soil water content and simulated soil water content the mre and rmse of the yield of four crops are in the reasonable ranges indicating that the aquacrop model can simulate the yields of four crops well in summary the aquacrop model can simulate the green canopy cover biomass soil water content and yield well for four crops thus it is used selected as a basis to conduct the distributed aquacrop modeling the observed yield and simulated yield of the corn wheat and vegetable under the year 2012 are compared to validate the regional distributed aquacrop model moreover the result is shown in fig 6 it shows that the r 2 is 0 9126 indicating a good agreement between actual yield and simulated yield thus the distributed aquacrop model can be able to simulate the regional yield and used to couple with the nmofdcp model to optimize irrigation water resources 3 2 the system s outputs the optimal water allocation and the satisfactory degree of the yield and the satisfactory degree of water productivity can be obtained after 200 iterations between the distributed aquacrop model and the nmofdcp model the variations of objective functions with iteration numbers and the relationship between the two objective functions are shown in fig 7 a c there are 2 groups of optimal pareto water allocation schemes and the first group corresponds to the maximum satisfactory degree of the yield and another group corresponds to the maximum satisfactory degree of water productivity which are the 35th individual after 134 iterations and the 81st individual after 188 iterations separately fig 7 c shows that two objective functions are contradictory and the first 50 individuals tend to achieve the maximum satisfactory degree of yield while the last 50 individuals more prefer to reach the higher satisfactory degree of water productivity which is caused by the characters of the pga method besides the differences in water allocation and objective values are compared under two groups of optimal pareto solutions from three aspects 1 the output analysis at the irrigation district scale 2 the output analysis at the crop scale and 3 the output analysis at the decision making unit scale dmu the relationships amid three layer analysis are as follows the obtained optimal 472 water allocation per area decision variables are categorized into the water allocation per area of 134 dmus and the water allocations of 134 dmus are calculated by water allocations per area with the corresponding planting areas the water allocations of 134 dmus are categorized into four crops among 24 irrigation districts based on the relationship between irrigation districts and dmus the yield per area of 134 dmus is attained from the distributed aquacrop model and the yields of 134 dmus are calculated by multiplying the yields per area with the corresponding planting areas the yields of 134 dmus are classified into four crops amid 24 irrigation districts the water productivity of 134 dmus is calculated by the yield per area dividing the water allocation per area the water productivity of each crop is calculated by the yield dividing the water allocation and the water productivity of each irrigation district is calculated by the yield dividing the irrigation amount at the irrigation district scale the outputs analysis at the dmu scale is the analysis of water allocation per area yield per area and water productivity of each dmu the outputs analysis at the crop scale is the analysis of water allocation yield and water productivity of four crops the outputs analysis at the irrigation district scale is the analysis of water allocation yield and water productivity of each irrigation district and the system s outputs at three layers are recalculated based on the optimal water allocation scheme of 472 decision variables and the results of the three layers analysis are shown in figs 8 13 3 2 1 the system ouput analysis at the irrigation district scale fig 8 a c are the optimal water allocations yields and water productivities of 24 irrigation districts under 35th and 81st individuals fig 8 a shows the water allocations of most irrigation districts under the 35th individual are higher than the 81st individual and water allocations of a few irrigation districts under the 81st individual are bigger than the 35th taking the yingke yk and xinba xb as examples the water allocations of yk are 6799 6 104 m3 and 6235 1 104 m3 respectively and the water allocations of xb are 2726 7 104 m3 and 2889 8 104 m3 separately for 35th and 81st individuals this is because the optimal water allocation under the 35th individual is more likely to achieve the higher satisfactory degree of the yield which has a positive relationship with water allocation under deficient irrigation besides the optimal water allocation gives considerations to both the maximum satisfactory degree of the yield and maximum satisfactory degree of water productivity it discloses that water allocation of daman dm is highest and followed by xigan xg wujiang wj luotuocheng ltc yk ganjun gj shangsan ss youlian yl and xinhua xh and the water allocations in these irrigation districts exceed the average water allocation for the 35th individual the water allocation of hongyazi hyz is lowest ranked by huazhaizi hzz liuba lb nijiangying njy anyang ay yanuan yn pingchuan pc luocheng lc dahuwan dhw sanqing sq shahe sh liaoqian lq xiaotun xt and banqiao bq and the water allocations in these irrigation districts are below the average water allocation for the 35th individual the differences in water allocations amid 24 irrigation districts are casued by the crop types and planting areas in general the irrigation districts with larger planting areas and high area proportion of high water consumption areas e g seed corn will have more water allocation for example the proportion of the seed corn takes 64 and 2 5 of total crop areas which are 2 07 104 hm2 and 0 11 104 hm2 for dm and hyz individually thus it is essential to analyze the water allocation of each crop at the crop scale fig 8 b shows that the average yields are 1112 2 104 kg and 1111 2 104 kg for 35th and 81st individuals respectively the yield under the 35th individual is higher than the 81st individual besides the yield sort is similar to the water allocation sort amid 24 irrigation districts indicating the water allocation has a positive effect on the yield under deficit irrigation moreover differences in yields of most irrigation districts are relatively small but the differences in water allocations are relatively high this can be explained by reasons that excessive irrigation at each irrigation date will lead to deep infiltration that is ineffective for yield increment moreover the yield has no obvious relationship with irrigation because of the water exchanges in the soil layer and trigged water stress it discloses that the yield ratio is not equal to the planting area ratio for 24 irrigation districts which is because the irrigation district has the bigger area proportion of the high yield crop e g vegetable will have more yield fig 8 c discloses that the average water productivity under the 35th individual is lower than the 81st individual the difference in average water productivity under two individuals is 0 15 kg m3 which means adopting the optimal water allocation under 81st individual will increase the 0 15 kg yield per unit of water allocation taking the water productivity under the 81st individual as an example the lc possess the highest water productivity followed by dm ss njy hzz hyz dhw xg ltc xb and xh and the water productivity in these irrigation districts exceed the average water productivity besides the water productivity of bq is lowest ranked by ay lb yl and gj below the average water productivity the differences in water productivity rank amid 24 irrigation districts are caused by the ratio between the yield and water allocation where the irrigation district with higher yield and lower water allocation will own higher water productivity that means the crop types affect water allocations yields and water productivities of irrigation districts and thus it is vital to analyze the crop compositions of irrigation districts at the crop scale fig 9 shows the optimal water allocations of four crops of 24 irrigation districts under two individuals at the crop scale it indicates that the water allocations of four crops at most irrigation districts are similar with water allocations at the district scale between two individuals besides the average water allocation of the seed corn is highest followed by the vegetable field corn and wheat which is caused by the different water demands taking the 35th individual as an example it implies that the water allocation of the field corn at the yk is highest and that of the bq is lowest besides the planting area ratio of the filed corn between yk and yl is 0 93 and the water allocation ratio is 0 64 presenting unequal relationship between the planting area and water allocation this means that water allocation of one crop is different for various weather conditions or soil types the water allocation of the seed corn in the dm is highest followed by the xg wj ltc ss and bq same with the water allocation rank at the irrigation district scale the water allocation orders of the vegetable are consistent with the water allocation orders at the irrigation district scale it illustrates that the irrigation district with a higher area ratio of the seed corn and vegetable owns bigger water allocation the seed corn vegetable and wheat also own the unbalanced relationship between water allocation ratio and planting area ratio among 24 irrigation districts fig 10 shows optimal yields of four crops among 24 irrigation districts under two individuals the results show that regulations of yields of four crops are similar with the yields at the irrigation district scale presenting a nonlinear relationship between the yield and water allocation moreover it implies that the average yield of vegetables is highest followed by seed corn field corn and wheat this is because the yield per area of vegetable is highest and the planting area of seed corn is biggest it shows that the yield of the field corn at yk is maximum while that at the ltc is the minimum for the 35th individual the decreasing order of yield of the seed corn is the dm xg wj ltc and ss consistent with the yield rank at the irrigation district scale it illustrates that the yield of seed corn is an important component of the yield of the irrigation district the planting area ratio and the yield ratio between yk and gj are 0 96 and 1 01 separately presenting an unbalanced relationship between the area and the yield the yields and areas of field corn wheat and vegetable also present above regulations caused by various weather conditions and soil types fig 11 shows the optimal water productivities of four crops under two individuals it discloses that the average water productivity of vegetables is highest followed by the wheat seed corn and field corn this is because water productivity is affected by the yield and water allocation and crop with higher yield and lower water allocation will have bigger water productivity the field corn at dhw possesses the biggest water productivity and that at ay has the lowest water productivity for the 81st individual the results indicate that water productivities of the field corn seed corn vegetable and wheat also affected by soils and weathers in summary it is crucial to ascertain the effects of water conditions and soil types on water allocation yield and water productivity at the dmu scale 3 2 2 the system ouput analysis at the decision making unit scale fig 12 is the optimal water allocation per area of four crops under two individuals at the dmu scale the water allocation per area of four crops at partial dmus are selected and the selection criterion is that the dmus can presents the water allocation per area covering all kinds of weather conditions and soil types taking the field corn as an example there are 6 kinds of combinations of weather and soil types including the zhangye station and t1 zhangye station and t4 linze station and t1 linze station and t4 gaotai station and t1 and gaotao station and t4 and the corresponding dmus are dm 2 yk 2 ay bq sq 3 yl 4 sq 1 yl 2 sq 1 yl 2 and dhw 2 hyz 2 and the water allocations of the other three crops at corresponding dmus are in fig 12 it indicates that water allocation per area of the field corn changes from 6140 m3 hm2 and 8180 m3 hm2 the water allocation per area of the seed corn varies from 5840 m3 hm2 to 8680 m3 hm2 the water allocation of the wheat fluctuates from 3690 m3 hm2 to 5390 m3 hm2 and the water allocation of the vegetables alters from 5450 m3 hm2 to 8350 m3 hm2 it illustrates that the water allocation per area exits differences for each crop and this is caused by the different weather conditions and soil types it discloses that water allocation of each crop at two irrigation districts with the same soil types and weather conditions are different because there are no constraints to limit the ineffective water loss e g deep infiltration therefore the same irrigation amount is conducted to uncover effects of soil types and weather conditions on water allocation per area fig 13 is the optimal yield per area and water productivity of four crops at the dmu scale under the 35th individual it shows that the yield per area of the field corn ranges from 9426 kg hm2 to 11 199 kg hm2 and the yield per area of the seed corn changes from 9022 kg hm2 to 10 006 kg hm2 and the yield per area of the wheat varies from 6198 kg hm2 to 7013 kg hm2 and the yield per area of the vegetables alters from 60 600 kg hm2 to 69 592 kg hm2 the differences in the yield per area for one crop among different dmus are casued by various soil types and weather conditions the water productivity of the field corn ranges from 1 17 kg m3 to 1 79 kg m3 and the water productivity of the seed corn changes from 1 15 kg m3 to 1 57 kg m3 and water productivity of the wheat varies from 1 20 kg m3 to 1 85 kg m3 and the water productivity of the vegetables alters from 8 33 kg m3 to 11 72 kg m3 it illustrates that water productivity of one crop presents obvious variations which is influenced by soil types and weather conditions it also indicates that the yield per area and water productivity exist differences for the dmus with the same weather condition and soil type thus the same irrigation amount is input to the above dmuts to figure out the effects of soil types and weather conditions on yield per area and water productivity firstly the effects of soil types on the yield per area and water productivity under the same irrigation scheduling are conducted taking zhangye station as an example the yield and water productivity for field corn under t2 is biggest followed by t4 t1 and t3 the other crops with linze station and gaotai weather conditions also have the above regulations it is because the different soil types have different field capacities and wilting points and own different water containing capacities and water stresses such as the water stress reducing leaf expansion stomatal closure and early canopy senescence they all affect the crop evapotransporation water allocation yield and water productivity for example the field capacity of t1 is biggest followed by t3 t4 and t2 and thus the water containing capacity of t1 is highest followed by t3 t4 and t2 the soil water content threshold trigging the water stress is negative with the difference between field capacity and wilting point and thus the water stress under t2 is smallest followed by t3 t4 and t1 under the same irrigation scheduling because irrigation numbers are limited the water stress occurs in the two relatively long irrigation intervals and thus the water stress under t2 is smallest followed by t4 t3 and t1 under the same irirgation amount secondly the influences of weather conditions on the yield per area and water productivity under the same irrigation scheduling are operated there are three weather conditions including zhangye station linze station and gaotai station it shows that the yield per area and water productivity under gaotai is biggest followed by linze and zhangye station which is caused by the different precipitation evapotranspiration and temperature the zhangye station has the highest evapotranspiration and precipitation followed by linze station and gaotai station but the difference between evapotranspiration and precipitation under gaotai station is lowest ranked by linze and zhangye station and thus water demand of crop under gaotai is more easily to be satisfied under the same irrigation scheduling followed by linze station and gaotai station besides the difference between maximum temperature and minimum temperature also affects the yield per area by influencing the temperature water stress in general the higher difference in temperature under the allowable temperature is more beneficial to increasing the yield and thus the yield under gaotai with the maximum difference between maximum temperature and minimum temperature is biggest ranked by linze and zhangye station the yield per area and water productivity ranks of other crops and four soil types present the above regulations therefore figuring out the above regulation can help managers make the optimal water allocation schemes the effects of water allocation pattern on the yield per area and water productivity are explored by increasing or decreasing the water allocation at four irrigation dates taking the one dmu at dhw donated as dhw 1 as an example the four irrigation dates of the filed corn are 49th day 70th day 101st day and 125th day corresponding to the jointing trumpet stage heading stage grouting stage and mature stage respectively the irrigation amounts at four irrigation dates are 202 mm 86 mm 133 mm and 193 mm separately four cases are formulated to compare the variations of the yield per area and water productivity under different water allocation pattern case1 replace the water allocation at 49th day by the water allocation at 70th day 101st day and 125th day in turn which means the irrigation amount at the 49th day decreases by 116 mm 69 mm and 9 mm compared with the water allocation of 202 mm separately cases 2 4 are changing water allocation of 70th day 101st day and 125th day by water allocation at other three days similar with the case 1 separately the results show that the yield per area decreases for exchanging the water allocation between 49th day and 70th day while the yield per area increases under the other two combinations 49th day and 101st day and 49th day and 125th day this is because the reduction in water allocation brings out higher water pressure triggering early canopy senescence at the jointing trumpet stage it also discloses increasing irrigation amounts at the grouting stage and mature stage contributes to the increase in yield while decreasing the irrigation amount at the jointing trumpet stage is not beneficial to increasing the yield the results indicate that the obvious increase or decrease in water allocation will lead to an increase or decrease in the yield while the slight variation of water allocation makes no sense besides the water allocation at the jointing trumpet stage grouting stage and mature stage significantly affects yield and increasing water allocation appropriately at these growth periods is beneficial to increase the yield per area consequently the nmofdcp approach can get compromised optimal water allocation schemes with consideration of two objectives the water allocation schemes under the 35th individual focus on the maximum satisfactory degree of yield while that under the 81st individual is more concerned with the satisfactory degree of water productivity if decision makers prefer more to the maximum yield they can choose the water allocation schemes under the 35th individual if decision makers want to achieve higher water productivity they can select the water allocation schemes under the 81st individual the actual irrigation scheduling obatined from the local survey will be compared with optimal water allocation schemes attained from the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model shown as table 3 3 3 discussion 3 3 1 comparison with actual water allocation schemes the actual water allocation is obtained from the local survey and the results are shown in table 3 compared with the actual water allocation the total water allocation schemes under 35th and 81st individuals save 2 53 108 m3 and 3 78 108 m3 individually and the satisfactory degree of yield and water productivity improves 0 0038 0 0024 0 0893 and 0 1479 respectively this means yields enlarge by 3980 103 kg 2460 103 kg and water productivity increases by 0 36 kg m3 and 0 6 kg m3 separately it demonstrates that the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model could increase the yield and improve water use efficiency besides the water allocation yield per area and water productivity of each crop under various weather conditions and soil types are different and thus the spatial heterogeneities of weather conditions and soil types should be considered in the process of decision making however the above factors are not considered in the actual water allocation and thus the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model has more robustness in the actual irrigation water allocation management system 3 3 2 comparison with distributed aquacrop gis simulation model li et al developed a distirbuted aquacrop gis for modeling crop water consumption and water productivity in the middle reaches of heihe river basin li et al 2016a 2016b they assessed water consumptions yield and water use efficiency of 22 irrigation districts under historical irrigation scheduling however they do not analyze the impacts of soil types crops types weather conditions and irrigations on the yield and water use efficiency besides they cannot get the optimal water allocation schemes with consideration of both yields and water use efficiency therefore the developed model has higher robustness 3 3 3 comparison with optimization models yue et al fitted jessen function to describe the nonlinear relationship between the yield and irrigation and further guide water allocation yue et al 2020 it can reflect the water stress on yields by fitting the sensitivity indicator of each growth period however they cannot quantify daily soil water stress on yields and neglected influences of soil water exchanges in soil layers on the yields and water use efficiency besides the jessen functions with consideration of spatial heterogeneities of soils crops weathers and irrigation are hard to be fitted therefore the obatined water allocation may be not follow actual situations this means the developed model is more applicable for irrigation water resources management 4 conclusion in this paper the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is developed for irrigation water resources management under uncertainty the nonlinear multi objective programming nmop fuzzy dependent chance programming fdcp are coupled with the distributed aquacrop model it is applied to a case study of the middle heihe river basin to allocate irrigation water resources to the field corn seed corn wheat and vegetable to verify its application and the results show that the proposed model can be a reliable and effective tool the significant findings of this paper are that 1 the distributed aquacrop model with consideration of spatial heterogeneities of weather conditions soil types and crop types is developed which can simulate regional yield more accurately and broaden applications of the aquacrop model at a single scale 2 the distributed aquacrop nmop model is established which can get optimal water allocation schemes considering multiple objectives and effects of soil water stresses and water exchanges 3 the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model is established and it can deal with the uncertainties presented as asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers and tradeoff relationships between the yield and fuzzy goals of yield and the relationship between water productivity and fuzzy goals of water productivity it demonstrates that the developed model is applicable for addressing agricultural water allocation problem in arid and semi arid districts however the water distribution system affects water depth flow velocity canal infiltration and flow continuity and further the water allocation which should be considered as a series of constraints in the future work besides the model can only deal with the uncertainties presented as fuzzy numbers and the more uncertain parameters such as stochastic variables should be incorporated into the distributed aquacrop nmofdcp model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this study was financially supported by national natural science foundation of china no 41871199 appendix the initial two objective functions are maximizing the crop yield and maximizing the crop water productivity shown as follows objective1 maximizing the crop yield maximize f 1 i 1 134 a i y i objective 2 maximizing the water productivity maximize f 2 i 1 134 a i y i i 1 134 a i wa i because of the decision makers usually require objective functions satisfy the goal set by themselves and the goals have fuzziness characters due to the subjectiveness of decision makers and thus the relationship between objective function and the goal is transformed into the relationship between objective function and fuzzy goals b b 1 b 2 b 3 which can be measured by the credibility measure and its expression is as follows objective function f a x distribution functions of the credibility measure c r a x b 0 a x b 1 a x b 1 2 b 2 b 1 b 1 a x b 2 b 3 2 b 2 a x 2 b 3 b b 2 a x b 3 1 a x b 3 where f is objective function b is the fuzzy goals presented as asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers b b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 1 b 2 and b 3 are minimum possible value possible value and maximum possible value of fuzzy numbers respectively cr is the credibility degree which measured the degree of objective function fulfilling the fuzzy goals it usually be set greater than 0 5 to avoid the unsuitable satisfactory degree and violation risk in management thus the above equation is transformed as following format max γ b 3 2 b 2 a x 2 b 3 b 2 when a x b where γ is the credibility level satisfactory degree and thus two objective functions are transformed into objective functions of maximizing the satisfactory degrees of yield and water productivity shown as follows objective 1 maximizing satisfactory degree of crop yield 9 maximize f 1 ty 3 2 ty 2 i 1 134 a i y i 2 t y 3 t y 2 objective 2 maximizing satisfactory degree of water productivity 10 maximize f 2 wp 3 2 wp 2 i 1 134 a i y i i 1 134 a i wa i 2 wp 3 wp 2 where asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers of total yield are t y t y 1 t y 2 t y 3 and asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers of total water productivity are w p w p 1 w p 2 w p 3 ty 2 ty 3 wp 2 and wp 3 are possible value and maximum possible value of fuzzy yield and the possible value and maximum possible value of

10211,achieving rice self sufficiency in west africa will require an expansion of the irrigated rice area under water scarce conditions however little is known about how much area can be irrigated and where and when water saving practices could be used the objective of this study was to assess potentially irrigable lands for irrigated rice cultivation under water saving technology in burkina faso a two step spatially explicit approach was developed and implemented firstly machine learning models namely random forest rf and maximum entropy maxent were deployed in ecological niche modeling enm approach to assess the land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation spatial datasets on topography soil characteristics climate parameters land use and water were used along with the current distribution of irrigated rice locations in burkina faso to drive enms secondly the climatic suitability for alternate wetting and drying awd an irrigation management method for saving water in rice cultivation in irrigated systems was assessed by using a simple water balance model for the two main growing seasons february to june and july to november on a dekadal time scale the evaluation metrics of the enms such as the area under the curve and percentage correctly classified showed values higher than 80 for both rf and maxent the top four predictors of land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation were exchangeable sodium percentage exchangeable potassium depth to the groundwater table and distance to stream networks and rivers potentially suitable lands for rice cultivation in burkina faso were estimated at 21 1 105 ha the whole dry season was found suitable for awd implementation against 25 100 of the wet season soil percolation was the main driver of the variation in irrigated land suitability for awd in the wet season the integrated modeling and water balance assessment approach used in this study can be applied to other west african countries to guide investment

in rainfed lowland 2 6 t ha and rainfed upland 1 7 t ha dossou yovo et al 2020 secondly due to temperature changes rainfall variability and expected future climate change impacts in rainfed rice systems van oort and zwart 2018 singh et al 2017 li et al 2015 improvements in farmers adaptive capacity due to the expansion of irrigation facilities may reduce rice production losses birthal et al 2015 although irrigated rice holds tremendous potential in fulfilling many west african countries agendas of becoming rice self sufficient geospatial analysis to assess potentially irrigable land is often not explored it is therefore relevant to quantify where and how much land is potentially suitable for irrigated rice cultivation under water saving technologies previous studies assessed the suitability of lands to crop cultivation at the regional and continental scales gumma et al 2014 hentze et al 2016 lobell and asner 2004 xiong et al 2017 pittman et al 2010 while these studies significantly improved our understanding of the general pattern of agricultural land they mostly focused on the current planted areas based on satellite imagery more holistic approaches for suitability analysis took into account the crop requirement for optimal allocation in the context of future cropland expansion such possibilities have been widely assessed through agricultural land suitability analysis alsa a global land use planning approach for land resources allocation in line with sustainability development goals sdgs of the united nations akpoti et al 2019 one such approach used qualitative and parametric methods to evaluate land suitability for irrigated rice in west african sahel based on soil units soil fertility and water management dondeyne et al 1995 west african rice development environment has been characterized based on climate soil topography land types and rice systems with an emphasis on inland valleys andriesse and fresco 1991 windmeijer and andriesse 1993 andriesse et al 1994 other studies used multi criteria evaluation mce to estimate map suitability for irrigation potential under current and future climate change in ghana and ethiopia schmitter et al 2018 worqlul et al 2019 these methods are broadly classified as deductive which rely on physiology and other biophysical requirements new advances in inductive methods such as ecological niche models have provided means to take advantage of spatial big data for estimating the potential for agricultural development a recent approach has used ecological niche modeling to map quantitatively inland valleys suitability for rice production using machine learning methods akpoti et al 2020 the approach based on geospatial predictive modeling uses rice occurrence along with environmental biophysical predictors of rice contrary to asian conditions where large scale rice growing areas can be mapped by coarse scale modis data peng et al 2011 sakamoto et al 2005 salmon et al 2015 xiao et al 2006 2005 west african rice areas are sparse in a heterogeneous environment thus the application of the ecological niche modeling approach which not only has the advantage to predict the current distribution of irrigated rice areas but also identify suitable areas for development can aid in sustainable irrigated area expansion many irrigation schemes are inefficient and irrigation water productivity is low in burkina faso dembele et al 2012 sawadogo et al 2020 to improve water use efficiency through the reduction of irrigated water use many technologies have been introduced including alternate wetting and drying awd alternate wetting and drying is a water saving technology developed by the international rice research institute irri and is based on the fact that continuous flooding is not required for rice fields to achieve high yields bouman et al 2007 once the transplanted seedlings are well established the field water depth can fall to a threshold depth below the soil surface for a certain period before the field is irrigated implementation of awd among farmers particularly in asia has been very site specific in terms of the timing frequency and duration of the non flooded periods in some regions of asia rice fields are flooded every 6 8 days or 4 5 days depending on the soil texture howell et al 2015 norton et al 2017 yao et al 2012 the irri s recommendations of safe awd consist of three key elements a flooding for 2 weeks to avoid transplanting shock and suppress weeds b flooding during the flowering stage to avoid yield reduction due to water stress at this sensitive stage of rice development and c awd during all other periods with irrigation applied to 5 cm above the soil surface whenever water table falls to 15 cm below the soil surface lampayan et al 2015 a meta analysis of awd applications showed that on average awd reduced water input by 25 and increased water productivity by 24 without a yield penalty carrijo et al 2017 in addition to the aforementioned benefits awd reduced methane emission by 53 on average jiang et al 2019 and therefore has the potential to reduce water input and greenhouse gas emission while maintaining rice yields studies showed that awd can be applied in a dry environment such as the sahelian environment of west africa de vries et al 2010 djaman et al 2018 these assessments showed that awd can be deployed in both dry and wet seasons with comparable rice yields djaman et al 2018 and in some cases better than in continuously flooded fields de vries et al 2010 understanding the potentially irrigable land area while at the same time optimizing irrigation water use was identified as one of the priority actions in the burkina faso national rice development strategy bfnrds 2011 thus the objective of this study was to assess potentially irrigable lands for rice cultivation under water saving technology in burkina faso to achieve this objective an integrated approach of two principal steps was developed and implemented firstly an ensemble of models was used to assess the land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation secondly a simple water balance approach was adopted to estimate the climatic suitability of awd for water saving the results will provide policy makers and the development sector more insight into future suitable areas and opportunities for introducing awd in irrigated rice systems development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in burkina faso 6 w and 3 e 9 n and 15 n a landlocked country in west africa the topography of the country is mainly characterized by a low relief plain with a gently undulating landscape elevation between 142 m and 705 m the country has two main seasons one rainy season from june to september and one dry season from october to may burkina faso is divided into three main climatic zones sahelian zone 280 600 mm sub sahelian zone 600 900 and north sudanese zone 900 1200 mm see fig 1 burkina faso s economy mainly relies on rainfed agriculture with the majority of the workforce in the agricultural sector cereals are the main food resource for the population and are produced on smallholder farmland of less than 5 ha with rice being the fourth most cultivated cereal in terms of both land area and production in 2018 the cereals harvested area was 4 505 001 ha with a production of 4 991 259 tons of which harvested area paddy rice was 170 158 ha while the production was 160 949 tons fao 2019 three main cropping systems for rice are used in burkina faso including rainfed upland rainfed lowland and irrigated system according to the burkina faso national rice development strategy report lowland is the main rice ecology across all regions in the country bfnrds 2011 it accounts for 67 of the rice land area and supplies 42 of national rice production with average yields from 1 3 t ha to 2 5 t ha also rainfed rice growing represents about 10 of the rice land area and provides 5 of national rice production at an average yield of 1 t ha some irrigated areas of minor extent can be found mainly in the direct vicinity of dammed lakes between 1984 and 2009 irrigated rice growing accounted for an average of 23 of the rice land area and provided nearly 53 of national rice production bfnrds 2011 2 2 framework for mapping potentially irrigable lands for rice cultivation under water saving technology we deployed a two step spatially explicit integrated approach to map potential areas for irrigated rice expansion under alternate wetting and drying awd conditions see fig 2 in the first step we used the ecological niche modeling concept elith and franklin 2013 peterson 2006 that relates the known location of irrigated rice to relevant predictors and projected suitable unvisited areas the approach is widely used for species distribution modeling crimmins et al 2013 evangelista et al 2008 guisan and zimmermann 2000 and is now applied to agricultural suitability mapping akpoti et al 2020 estes et al 2013 heumann et al 2011 nabout et al 2012 ramírez gil et al 2018 we developed the modeling procedure in the software for assisted habitat modeling sahm morisette et al 2013 using two machine learning algorithms namely maximum entropy maxent and random forest rf in the second step we followed nelson et al 2015 to define the suitability for awd using a water balance approach by defining excess water balance and deficit water balance 2 2 1 potential for irrigated rice mapping 2 2 1 1 irrigated rice geographical locations data data on irrigated rice area locations were derived from the system of rice intensification sri international networks and resources center website http sri ciifad cornell edu countries burkinafaso index html the data comprises the coordinates of the rice fields the village name and other administrative attributes the data represents 31 locations distributed across the 3 climatic zones of burkina faso and were used as reference see fig 1a we used google earth pro high resolution images to inspect each of the rice locations and to digitize the polygons of the rice areas we further used each of the polygons to randomly generates 10 points within the digitized area to minimize the oversampling of each polygon which may induce model overfit we filtered the points by random sampling so that no pairs of points were below 1 5 km we also dropped any one pair of the sites which were too close in the initial dataset finally points that fell within waterways and other undesired features were removed the overall irrigated rice occurrence datasets resulted in a total of 226 points 2 2 1 2 environmental predictors selection of land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation a set of environmental predictors see table 1 and fig 3 was used to characterize the biophysical conditions of irrigated rice systems the predictors correspond to climate conditions surface and groundwater water and energy fluxes vegetation conditions soil physical and chemical properties and topography the candidate environmental predictors were pre selected based on previous suitability mapping for rice akpoti et al 2020 danvi et al 2016 heumann et al 2011 masoud et al 2013 and agricultural cropland irrigation potential schmitter et al 2018 worqlul et al 2019 high spatial resolution of bioclimatic variables were obtained from worldclim version 2 1 climate data https worldclim org fick and hijmans 2017 these climatic predictors profiled long term 1970 2000 annual trends climate seasonality and limiting environmental predictors irrigated rice cultivation relies on water availability we used distance to stream networks as a proxy for access to surface water high density stream networks were first derived from digital elevation model dem then euclidian distance was computed groundwater was represented in the modeling with the depth to groundwater table data obtained from fan et al 2017 and two categorical raster data of groundwater storage and groundwater yield obtained from macdonald et al 2012 groundwater variables are important as they are linked to climate aquifer types and porosity proximity to rivers and borehole yields under different hydrogeological conditions macdonald et al 2012 water and energy fluxes were represented by long term mean 1970 2000 of annual potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith evapotranspiration pet equation for reference crop obtained from trabucco and zomer 2018 and solar radiation from worldclim database these predictors are related to quantitative measures for deficit or surplus of water balance liu et al 2016 and the production of biomass and crop yield zhi peng et al 2017 normalized difference spectral indices have been widely used for characterizing irrigated rice environments gumma et al 2014 jeong et al 2012 sakamoto et al 2007 tornos et al 2015 we considered the 5 years average 2015 2019 of the soil adjusted vegetation index savi and normalized difference flood index ndfi derived from terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis vegetation indices mod13a3 version 6 monthly l3 global 1 km products these indices were computed using a tool for automatic preprocessing of modis time series modistsp package in r busetto and ranghetti 2017 as 1 ndfi red swir 2 red swir 2 2 savi nir red nir red 0 5 1 0 5 where red swir2 and nir are respectively cloud free red band 630 690 nm the short wave infrared band 2090 2350 nm and near infrared 780 900 nm modis products selected soil property maps of africa at 250 m resolution afsoilgrids250m hengl et al 2015 hengl et al 2017 were aggregated by weighted depth up to 30 cm to represent soil physico chemical properties in the models the 30 cm limit was considered as rice roots are usually contained within the puddled layer and muddy topsoil of 10 20 cm bouman et al 2007 we also derived exchangeable sodium percentage esp and base saturation percentage bsp computed based on soil exchangeable sodium esna the total exchangeable bases esb and cation exchange capacity cec as 3 esp esna 100 cec 4 bsp esb 100 cec topography is one of the key factors that control the spatial pattern of water availability grabs et al 2009 we used a digital elevation model dem from which we derived slopes and topographical wetness index twi to represent topographical variations in the models the twi of each pixel in the study area is a function of the upslope area a per unit contour length and the local slope tanb as 5 twi ln a tan b the final selection of the predictors was based on the step wise elimination of the least contributing variables and collinearity among variables a threshold of r 80 of pearson correlation was used to exclude any one of highly paired correlated variables see fig 4 a process considered as very important to ensure the independence among the predictors jarnevich et al 2015 twenty predictors were used in the final modeling 2 2 1 3 maximum entropy maxent and random forest rf models settings maxent is one the most widely used predictive modeling method due to its high predictive accuracy even under a low sample size along with the user friendly settings of the model halvorsen et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 the maxent model developed by phillips et al 2006 is based on the use of presence only data and a set of environmental predictors constraints the model was tuned based on model setting guidelines by phillips and dudík 2008 and phillips et al 2009 we maintained the 5000 iterations in the initial setting while the evaluation metrics stabilized around 11 000 background points also rf has been used in many presence backgrounds predictive modeling where the approach outperforms many other models mi et al 2017 stohlgren et al 2010 the model is a classification and regression learning method based on an ensemble of decision trees breiman 2011 rf was tuned based on the number of randomly selected predictor variables at each node the number of trees in the forest and the smallest node size for splitting as implemented in the package randomforest in r breiman et al 2011 in this study we used 6 1500 and 5 for the number of randomly selected predictor variables at each node the number of trees in the forest and the smallest node size for splitting respectively all the predictors were aggregated and resampled to a 90 m x 90 m grid using the nearest neighbor and majority filter methods for non categorical and categorical raster datasets respectively the modeling is based on the irrigated rice occurrence data along with randomly generated absence data as previously used by akpoti et al 2020 we used the kernel density estimate duong 2015 to randomly generate 11 000 background data training and testing datasets comprised 60 and 40 of the initial dataset respectively 2 2 1 4 threshold selection to discriminate between suitable and unsuitable areas from the continuous probability surface of the models predictions a threshold that maximizes the sensitivity specificity 2 was used the sum maximizer threshold was shown to be one of the best performing across varying modeling settings jiménez valverde and lobo 2007 c liu et al 2013 m liu et al 2013 this threshold minimizes the mean of the error rate for irrigated rice locations and the error rate for background samples we used the consensus forecast approach based on a simple mean to estimate the central tendency across both maxent and rf algorithms crimmins et al 2013 2 2 1 5 model evaluation to evaluate the models performance we considered widely used spatial predictive evaluation metrics including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc the percentage correctly classified pcc the sensitivity i e prediction of true presence specificity i e prediction of background points the kappa statistic and the true skill statistics tss together they provide the level of accuracy of the modeling assignment 2 3 climatic suitability assessment of the alternate wetting and drying awd we followed nelson et al 2015 to define the climatic suitability for awd using a water balance equation fig 5 and eq 6 6 i pcp c et s d pot pc where i is irrigated water supply pcp is precipitation c is capillary rise et is potential evapotranspiration of a specific type of well watered crop s is lateral seepage d is a surface inflow or drainage and pot pc is potential percolation in farmers fields water loss due to seepage the subsurface movement of water from one rice field to the other is often compensated by seepage inflow from another field schmitter et al 2015 therefore water loss through seepage was neglected in eq 6 irrigated rice fields are surrounded by bunds to store water in the rice fields in burkina faso thus resulting in negligible water loss through drainage the contribution of capillary rise in meeting water requirements for rice cultivation can be substantial if there is non flooded aerobic soil however in flooded rice fields soil percolation prevents capillary rise into the root zone and therefore capillary rise is often neglected in the water balance equation in awd capillary rise during the non flooding period may provide extra water to the crop in schemes where there is a shallow groundwater table bouman et al 2007 however water input through capillary rise was not included in the water balance equation due to a lack of spatial datasets on the capillary rise this might result in a bias in the water balance assessment in schemes with a shallow groundwater table based on the above mentioned assumptions and following nelson et al 2015 the water balance equation was simplified in eq 7 7 i pcp et pot pc 8 i pcp et pot pc 0 awd is an irrigation technology developed to produce rice with less water compared with the conventional approach of continuous flooding bouman et al 2007 following nelson et al 2015 we assumed that awd is suitable in a given period if there is a deficit water balance eq 8 and unsuitable otherwise eq 9 9 water balance deficit if pcp et pot pc 0 10 water balance excess if pcp et pot pc 0 the water balance was computed based on dekadal time steps corresponding to a total of 36 dekads in the year 3 dekads for each month this temporal resolution is justified by the fact that irrigation or drainage water management decisions are often taken on a weekly or fortnightly basis nelson et al 2015 we used 10 years average 2010 2019 of the dekad average daily in a dekad mm day precipitation data obtained from the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao portal to monitor water productivity through open access of remotely sensed derived data wapor v2 fao 2020 this precipitation product of 5 km resolution is based on the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps dataset which is a well performing satellite rainfall products over burkina faso dembélé and zwart 2016 the spatial distributions of the dekad precipitation variations are displayed in fig 6 similarly we considered the reference et dekad product of the wapor v2 database fao 2020 fig 7 et is the reference evapotranspiration dekad in mm day a sum of the soil evaporation e and canopy transpiration t of a hypothetical reference crop a well watered grass surface which is based on the fao method allen et al 1998 percolation rate on the rice field is influenced by soil factors including soil structure texture bulk density mineralogy organic matter content and the salt type and concentration bouman et al 2007 although the soil structure is changed by the physical action of puddling resulting in a hard pan there still variation in percolation rates among different soil texture classes for example bouman et al 2007 reported a value of 1 5 mm day in heavy clay soils to 25 30 mm day in sandy and sandy loam we used the approach developed by nelson et al 2015 by defining the percolation rate as a function of soil texture classes potential percolation pot pc which defines the upper limit of the rate of percolation into the subsoil due to the uncertainties associated with the texture classes percolation rates a sensitivity analysis used in the aforementioned research was adopted using 4 main sensitivity categories first a lower bound of pot pc as a function of soil texture classes were defined followed by an upper bound of pot pc then a basic setting which corresponds to pot pc rates that lie between the lower and the upper bounds see table 2 we finally considered fixed values of pot pc for the entire national scale of burkina faso of 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 mm day we used the texture data of the soil property maps of africa at 250 m resolution afsoilgrids250m hengl et al 2015 we used aggregation by weighted depth up to 30 cm of the pot pc using the first 3 standard depths an area coverage description of the texture classes at each depth over burkina faso is reported in table 3 showing the dominance of the sandy loam sandy clay loam and clay loam classes two growing seasons for irrigated rice exist in burkina faso that coincide with the dry and the wet seasons the first rice growing season extends from february to june referred to as dry season rice and the second season from july to december referred to as wet season rice rice cannot be cultivated from january to mid february due to low temperatures brought by the dry air harmattan winds blowing from the sahara we computed the awd climatic suitability based on the two growing seasons we then masked the awd climatic suitability with the potential suitability for irrigated rice cultivation as previously described 3 results 3 1 rice suitability assessment 3 1 1 evaluation of irrigated rice ecological niche models evaluation of the two models i e maxent and rf of the potential suitability distribution of irrigated rice in burkina faso shows high performing metrics with auc and pcc on training data higher than 92 and pcc 90 respectively similarly the models depict high performance when applied on independent test data with auc equals to 92 and pcc 81 overall rf showed higher consistency in the evaluation metrics compared with maxent with both models performing better than random auc 50 see table 4 rf evaluation metrics showed a smaller difference between training and testing which may represent an advantage in predicting unvisited suitable conditions for irrigated rice 3 1 2 predictors importance and excluded variables from the final model settings exchangeable sodium percentage esp exchangeable potassium esk groundwater table depth wtd euclidean distance to stream networks strdist and precipitation of the warmest quarter bio18 represent in that order the top 5 predictors for both rf and maxent fig 8 the results show that soil salinity fertility and water availability for irrigated rice including groundwater and surface water along with rainfall were key predictors of irrigated rice the five next top predictors were evapotranspiration et the normalized difference flood index ndfi annual mean temperature bio1 soil depth depth and total phosphorus tphos other predictors which were initially considered in the model development were finally excluded either due to their least contribution to the models or their high correlation with other predictors table 1 for example groundwater productivity although important to measure groundwater availability for irrigation was dropped from the models due to its weak contribution on the other hand solar radiation although important for rice plant growth was excluded due to its high collinearity with aet r 0 92 in total 18 predictors were excluded see table 1 3 1 3 relationship between the most relevant predictors and land suitability for irrigated rice fig 9 shows the response curves of the most important predictors of land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation exchangeable sodium percentage esp shows a positively skewed distribution with a maximum value of 9 esp response curve suggests that irrigated rice suitability decreases with soil salinity where esp is higher 9 a similar right skewed curve is shown for soil organic carbon stock ocs with a peak value of 75 tons ha soil bulk density bld with a maximum value of 1250 kg m3 and soil clay content of around 20 for maximum suitability aet shows a negatively skewed response with a peak value of 850 mm warmest quarter precipitation bio18 shows the highest suitability between 100 and 150 mm in a bell shaped response curve however the annual mean temperature shows a complex and positively skewed response curve with maximum suitability around 27 5 c a similar response shape is shown for available soil water capacity wwp with maximum suitability around 17 5 results show that irrigated rice suitability increases with exchangeable potassium esk soil depth depth normalized difference flood index ndfi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and cation exchange capacity cec in an exponential convex truncated normal distribution linear response curves respectively predictors such as depth to groundwater table wtd distance to stream network and soil silt content decrease with higher suitability land suitability for irrigated rice increased with groundwater storage value although no change in suitability is observed above the value of 1000 mm 3 1 4 spatial prediction of potential suitability for irrigated rice cultivation the potential for a suitable irrigable rice area is estimated at 25 0 105 ha for maxent and 20 7 105 ha for rf the consensus estimate of the suitable rice area is 21 1 105 ha the spatial distribution of predicted suitability is mapped in fig 10 the results show that suitable lands are mostly located within the latitudes 10 12 5 n from the west to east of the country this domain corresponds to the sub sahelian climatic zone and the north sudanese climatic zone see fig 1 for the climatic zones of burkina faso within the aforementioned domain three main clusters can be observed the first cluster corresponds to the location 5 5 2 7 w 10 12 n in the north sudanese climatic zone the second cluster corresponds to 2 7 w 0 11 12 5 n which falls mostly within the sub sahelian climatic zone the third cluster of suitable land is located around the 11 5 n 2 e of the sub sahelian climatic zone in general the sahelian climatic zone is marginally suitable for irrigated rice compared with the two other climatic zones the validation of the modeled suitable areas by comparison between the digitalized rice based on satellite imagery and modeled data showed a good agreement fig 11 confirming the pcc 81 previously reported and the potential for expansion 3 2 climatic suitability of alternate wetting and drying awd the totality of the dekads in the dry season are classified as suitable for awd the dry season awd results are expected due to low precipitation 0 6 mm day see fig 6 and high reference evapotranspiration 5 10 mm day see fig 7 even at the onset of the wet season in the north sudanese climatic zone where the precipitation values are close to 6 mm day any combination of et pot pc always exceeds pcp which results in a water balance deficit for the entire areas classified as potentially suitable for awd the awd climatic suitability during the wet season july to october under fixed values of pot pc is reported in fig 12 while awd climatic suitability where pot pc is a function of the soil texture see table 2 is depicted in fig 13 results show that for all fixed values of pot pc the month of july dekads 19 21 is mostly suitable for awd where pcp values are less than 4 mm day this in the exception of the last dekad of july under pot pc of 1 and 2 mm day where pcp values of 4 5 mm day exceed in some areas the combination of both 1 mm day pot pc and the pet values of 3 6 mm day the temporal variability of water balance excess and deficit is explained by the precipitation pattern with slow onset in june and maximum precipitation values in august september with a slow decrease toward october dekads 25 27 awd suitability also follows the precipitation pattern for relatively higher fixed values of pot pc such as 4 and 5 mm day in general with increasing pot pc only peaking precipitation months become unsuitable for awd such that for pot pc of 10 mm day or higher the entire area potentially suitable for irrigated rice also becomes suitable for awd overall taking into account the full length of the wet season 25 dekads 28 30 58 dekads 19 20 26 30 67 dekads 19 21 26 30 75 dekads 19 21 25 30 83 dekads 19 22 dekads 25 33 and 100 of the dekads are suitable for awd for pot pc values of 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 mm day respectively see supplementary material dekads that are partly suitable are mostly located in the central south east sub sahelian climatic zone and the north sahelian zone see fig 14 the awd under low boundary settings shows that 58 of the dekads 26 33 are suitable in the wet season fig 15 the upper boundary settings show that 100 suitability for awd supplementary material similarly awd is suitable in all months except for short periods between august september for basic settings supplementary material 4 discussions 4 1 potential for irrigated rice expansion many publications showed that there is a scope for irrigated rice expansion in africa xie et al 2014 you et al 2011 lançon and erenstein 2002 owing to the small fraction of agricultural land irrigated at present and considerable unused water sources wiggins and lankford 2019 it is estimated that investment in new irrigation schemes can raise the share of irrigated rice in domestic production from less than 10 on average presently to more than 50 in the coming year seck 2008 this article used a comprehensive ecological niche approach to estimate the potential for irrigated rice cultivation in burkina faso based on two machine learning methods including maxent and rf it was estimated that 20 7 105 ha to 25 0 105 ha are potentially suitable for irrigated rice cultivation in burkina faso these estimates were 9 11 folds higher than the existing potential for irrigation of 233 500 ha as reported in many documents including the burkina faso national rice development strategy report bfnrds 2011 this figure was rather close to the 350 000 ha potentially irrigable land for rice as reported in barghouti and lemoigne 1990 and fao 1986 while others reported a higher value of 720 000 ha biswas 1986 the discrepancies between the modeling results and the previous estimates were mainly explained by the methodological approaches as explained by van der wijngaart et al 2019 the estimation of 233 500 ha was based on biophysical and socio economic methods following a cost benefit analysis this approach relies on spatial production allocation model spam where national and sub national agricultural statistics for crop production are downscaled to approximately 10 km 10 km grid as described in xie et al 2017 xie et al 2014 and you et al 2011 on the other hand the estimated 350 000 ha and 720 000 ha were based on existing dams and the cost of water delivery to irrigated farmlands barghouti and lemoigne 1990 thus these potential irrigable lands are rather based on both biophysical and socio economic variables and existing irrigation infrastructures another estimate based on soil and terrain suitability for surface irrigation showed that burkina faso has 5438 000 ha suitable for rice irrigation frenken 1997 in our approach we used digitized irrigated rice areas of currently known rice production areas in burkina faso to train the models in an inductive approach these locations are along rivers river flood plains lowland inland valleys and flood plains which are near small medium and big reservoirs thus the modeling results infer potential for irrigated rice expansion by implicitly considering the likelihood of water availability and other suitable biophysical conditions key to future interventions in irrigation infrastructures development for irrigated rice area expansion the computed difference in the suitability maps for rf and maxent is mainly due to the specification in the threshold s values and methods rf showed consistency in the evaluation metrics with smaller differences between training and testing data in other studies rf has shown the best performance compared with other methods under limited data conditions mi et al 2017 since we have limited training data the use of maxent represents an advantage due to its generative learning nature phillips et al 2006 the distribution of the potential suitability was also explained by the predictors importance the modeling shows that exchangeable sodium percentage esp and exchangeable potassium esk were top predictors the response curve of esp showed that suitability decreases from an optimum value of 5 toward an upper boundary of 50 this corresponds to the optimum less than 20 and marginal 20 40 conditions of irrigated rice systems frenken 1997 previous studies indicated soil salinity as one of the main constraints to irrigated rice cultivation abe et al 2010 mel et al 2019 the response curve of esk showed increasing suitability with increasing esk values to an upper limit of 2 2 cmol kg which is in agreement with previous findings saito et al 2019 the variable importance also shows that depth to groundwater table wtd and distance to stream networks and rivers are also top predictors and have decreasing suitability with their increasing values both predictors which are proxies to groundwater and surface water availability for irrigation imply that the estimated distribution of potentially suitable land for rice irrigation corresponds to relatively high water availability in the sahelian context soil depth is considered as the limiting factor in irrigated rice systems dondeyne et al 1995 the models show that suitability increases with soil depth probably due to the lower risk of prolonged rice field submergence which often leads to crop failure singh et al 2009 the overall trends in predictors response curves reconcile well with irrigated rice crop requirements conferring to the models a strong ecological sense following acceptable ecological niche model development hirzel and le lay 2008 the spatially explicit distribution of potential suitability for irrigated rice shows that the majority of the suitable land lies below latitude 13 n in three mains clusters around the southwest central and southeast the distribution of the suitable land corresponds to the sub sahelian climatic zone within the 600 900 mm isohyets and the north sudanese climatic zone within the 900 1200 mm isohyets only selected hotspots of suitable areas are located in the sahelian climatic zone within the 200 600 mm isohyets the southwest spatial distribution of suitable areas is in agreement with irrigated agricultural areas presented in knauer et al 2017 based on existing land use and land cover data also the overall potential distribution of irrigable land is in agreement with a map presented in taverner and barry 2020 4 2 suitability of irrigated rice area to the awd method of irrigation in the arid and dry sub humid zone of west africa reducing water for irrigation while at the same time keeping good yield is strategic for food security and adapting to water scarcity in this study we evaluated the climatic suitability of awd at the national scale of burkina faso during both dry and wet seasons the results indicated that all dekads in the dry season were deemed suitable for awd following similar results found in the philippines nelson et al 2015 the application of awd water saving technology is challenged by many factors including soil types and climate yang et al 2017 such that djaman et al 2018 recommended the testing of awd under various soil texture conditions and water regimes thus to account for uncertainties associated with potential soil percolation rates pot pc a sensitivity analysis was conducted by testing pot pc fixed values of 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 mm day and by also defining pot pc as a function of texture classes in three different settings namely the low boundaries where pot pc values were set to minimum the upper boundary where pot pc were grossly high and the intermediate pot pc values under fixed pot pc settings awd suitability in the wet season was partially or totally suitable in dekads 19 21 july and in dekads 25 30 september october this suggests that awd is feasible in wet season in burkina faso currently awd is not used in the wet season which might result in reduced water stress and higher rice yield this is in line with the conclusion that during the wet season in the sahel awd can be implemented de vries et al 2010 our results also substantiate the findings of johnson et al 2020 who assessed the agronomic performance of awd during four growing seasons two wet and two dry in four irrigation schemes in burkina faso and reported that awd can be practiced in the dry and wet seasons with a reduction in the irrigation water use by 32 and 25 respectively compared with the farmers conventional practice of irrigation however it is also acknowledged that awd adoption in the rainy season or at least some parts of the rainy season may be limited since rice systems are often in low lying valleys and it may not be possible to dry the field especially in high rainfall years adhya et al 2014 carrijo et al 2017 this condition is true for burkina faso in the dekads 22 24 august september where the country receives the peak precipitation following the south north gradient and in scenarios where pot pc were relatively low less than 3 mm day and lower boundary conditions irrespective of pot pc spatial variability the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of water balance excess and deficit in the wet season under the safe awd recommended by irri rice fields are kept flooded during the first two weeks after transplanting to prevent transplanting shock and suppress weeds and during the flowering stage to avoid water stress at this sensitive stage and all other growing periods our assessment of awd suitability did not consider such periods where rice fields should be maintained flooded if all farmers transplanted rice seedlings in dekad 4 using a 120 days rice variety then dekads 4 and 5 two weeks after transplanting and decades 11 13 flowering stage will be considered unsuitable for awd however not all farmers transplant rice seedlings in the same decade therefore our study provides a window for awd application on a national scale soil properties that favor awd yield and promote low water use relative to continuous flooding were previously reported carrijo et al 2017 yield losses with awd compared with cf were found to be pronounced in soils with ph 7 soil organic carbon 1 and clay soil carrijo et al 2017 besides soil salinity might increase with awd in schemes with a deeper groundwater table due to capillary rise letey et al 2011 although our awd suitability assessment did not specifically include soil properties and groundwater depth we used these variables to identify suitable land for irrigated rice areas and evaluate awd suitability in the identified potentially suitable land 4 3 viewpoints on other water saving strategies in irrigated rice systems the increased water scarcity for crop productions requires methods and best water management practices that result in less water usage in irrigated rice systems these water saving strategies try to reduce the unproductive water losses through seepage percolation and evaporation at the irrigated rice field scale while the full discussion on the water saving strategies in irrigated rice schemes is beyond the scope of this paper we presented here a brief of such strategies that may be promoted or may need further research in west africa for more sustainable irrigated rice production a aerobic rice systems these systems are characterized by rice cultivation in non flooded and non saturated soil with supplemental irrigation when needed bouman et al 2005 aerobic rice leads to the lowest water consumption compared with the traditional flooded rice but also the lowest yield while the risk of crop failure due to drought is high nie et al 2012 peng et al 2006 the low yield in aerobic systems represents the main limitation to its widespread adoption by small scale farmers nie et al 2012 besides for sahelian conditions such as in burkina faso a thorough understanding of the opportunities and threats is still needed in the viewpoints of knowledge labor and energy requirements b ground cover rice production system gcrps or mulching mulching is another water saving technology through the reduction of runoff and soil water evapotranspiration which increases soil moisture retention by covering the ground with straw other crop residues or plastic sheets jabran et al 2015 studies showed that mulching improved both soil moisture and yields dossou yovo et al 2016 while controlling weeds germination and development c liu et al 2013 m liu et al 2013 qin et al 2006 and pest and diseases erenstein 2003 ngosong et al 2019 however in an irrigated system the performance of mulching is limited by the high soil moisture that limits the decomposition of organic matter and generates high methane emission kreye et al 2007 besides in the sahelian environment such as in burkina faso mulch availability is often limited contributing to the poor adoption of this technology by small scale farmers erenstein 2003 c the system of rice intensification sri sri is an ensemble of rice systems management practices based on 4 principles wide spacing young seedling use of organic fertilizer and awd see satyanarayana et al 2007 for review on sri and its historical development experiments conducted on sri demonstrated its benefits on water saving yield increase and soil fertility improvement dobermann 2004 mcdonald et al 2006 sheehy et al 2004 however sri has not been widely adopted by small scale farmers due to several reasons including high labor requirement and organic fertilizer often limiting particularly in the sahelian environment where rainfall is too low and livestock production requires organic matter among the water saving technologies awd has been widely advocated for its potential to reduce water consumption methane emission while maintaining rice yield compared with the traditional approach of conventional flooding however more research is needed on the effects of awd on labour requirements and soil fertility 4 4 outlooks several studies showed the greenhouse gas emissions ghgs reduction potential of the awd with large reductions in methane emissions reported in compared to continuous flooding clements et al 2011 lahue et al 2016 wang et al 2020 this aspect is critical in the west african situation where rice area expansion is unavoidable to meet the national rice self sufficiency agenda while keeping the promise of sustainable intensification goals a study on a biophysical suitability mapping for awd in the philippines and thailand demonstrated an approach to quantify ghgs at the national scale sander et al 2017 prangbang et al 2020 given this context it is important to deploy this method in west africa to support ghg inventory in the national communications to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in the rice sectors in a large agricultural water management context especially in a transboundary watershed e g the volta basin it is recommended a general adoption of the water saving concept a detailed spatial explicit mapping and quantification of irrigation water use and its productivity from field scale to regional scales while considering awd is a prerequisite for planning improving and managing irrigation systems lampayan et al 2015 future research may also consider how socio economic factors may influence the adoption of awd among smallholder rice farmers howell et al 2015 5 conclusion to achieve rice self sufficiency in west africa governments and the private sector need to invest in area expansion of irrigated rice production climate change is expected however to negatively affect water resource availability thus planning and development of new rice areas must be done conjunctively with the adoption of water saving irrigation management technologies to develop policies plan investment and make informed decisions accurate and reliable spatial information on irrigated rice potential for sustainable development is essential to fill this gap and support policymakers planners and other stakeholders in burkina faso we developed a spatially explicit and integrated approach to map the potential areas for irrigated rice expansion under the water saving alternate wetting and drying awd water management technology we assessed that between 20 7 105 ha and 25 0 105 hectares are potentially suitable for irrigated rice in burkina faso the major predictors for irrigated rice potential were exchangeable sodium percentage exchangeable potassium depth to groundwater table and distance to stream networks and rivers this indicated the importance of soil chemical properties as well as groundwater and surface water importance for irrigated rice given that the ecological niche approach used in this study infers optimum conditions from observed irrigated rice areas the method offers a tool that is robust for planning sustainable agricultural development by providing a major predictor of optimum location and their partial response to the suitability level of that location the climatic suitability for awd indicated that about all dekads of the dry season was deemed climatically suitable for awd besides an additional 25 100 of the wet season was found climatically suitable for awd soil percolation rate was the main driver of awd suitability during the wet season the framework used in this study can guide investment in irrigated rice expansion and awd scaling for water saving greenhouse gas mitigation and ecosystem services preservation all unknown in the west african region further studies should evaluate the boundary conditions in irrigation systems that are required for large scale adoption of awd this study did not consider the cost of water delivery to potentially irrigable rice areas future studies may consider this option in cost benefit analysis also future research may include water storage reservoirs and or dams as predictors and their impact

10211,achieving rice self sufficiency in west africa will require an expansion of the irrigated rice area under water scarce conditions however little is known about how much area can be irrigated and where and when water saving practices could be used the objective of this study was to assess potentially irrigable lands for irrigated rice cultivation under water saving technology in burkina faso a two step spatially explicit approach was developed and implemented firstly machine learning models namely random forest rf and maximum entropy maxent were deployed in ecological niche modeling enm approach to assess the land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation spatial datasets on topography soil characteristics climate parameters land use and water were used along with the current distribution of irrigated rice locations in burkina faso to drive enms secondly the climatic suitability for alternate wetting and drying awd an irrigation management method for saving water in rice cultivation in irrigated systems was assessed by using a simple water balance model for the two main growing seasons february to june and july to november on a dekadal time scale the evaluation metrics of the enms such as the area under the curve and percentage correctly classified showed values higher than 80 for both rf and maxent the top four predictors of land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation were exchangeable sodium percentage exchangeable potassium depth to the groundwater table and distance to stream networks and rivers potentially suitable lands for rice cultivation in burkina faso were estimated at 21 1 105 ha the whole dry season was found suitable for awd implementation against 25 100 of the wet season soil percolation was the main driver of the variation in irrigated land suitability for awd in the wet season the integrated modeling and water balance assessment approach used in this study can be applied to other west african countries to guide investment in irrigated rice area expansion while adapting to climate change keywords alternate wetting and drying climatic suitability ecological niche modeling predictors water balance 1 introduction rice consumption has steadily increased in sub saharan africa while domestic rice production hardly meets the demand in burkina faso for example the national rice self sufficiency ratio was 30 between 2008 and 2018 africa rice center 2018 nonetheless burkina faso s national rice development strategy nrds emphasizes intensification and expansion of irrigated rice production systems to achieve rice self sufficiency bfnrds 2011 there is potential for enhancing rice production through increasing rice yield on existing land intensification improving rainfed lowland rice areas and expanding areas under irrigation through diffusion and adoption of technologies seck et al 2010 among the five rice cropping systems in west africa i e rainfed upland rainfed lowlands irrigated lowlands deepwater and mangrove swamps balasubramanian et al 2007 the irrigated rice systems hold a promising future for several reasons firstly the average rice yield in irrigated lowland of 3 8 t ha is higher than yields in rainfed lowland 2 6 t ha and rainfed upland 1 7 t ha dossou yovo et al 2020 secondly due to temperature changes rainfall variability and expected future climate change impacts in rainfed rice systems van oort and zwart 2018 singh et al 2017 li et al 2015 improvements in farmers adaptive capacity due to the expansion of irrigation facilities may reduce rice production losses birthal et al 2015 although irrigated rice holds tremendous potential in fulfilling many west african countries agendas of becoming rice self sufficient geospatial analysis to assess potentially irrigable land is often not explored it is therefore relevant to quantify where and how much land is potentially suitable for irrigated rice cultivation under water saving technologies previous studies assessed the suitability of lands to crop cultivation at the regional and continental scales gumma et al 2014 hentze et al 2016 lobell and asner 2004 xiong et al 2017 pittman et al 2010 while these studies significantly improved our understanding of the general pattern of agricultural land they mostly focused on the current planted areas based on satellite imagery more holistic approaches for suitability analysis took into account the crop requirement for optimal allocation in the context of future cropland expansion such possibilities have been widely assessed through agricultural land suitability analysis alsa a global land use planning approach for land resources allocation in line with sustainability development goals sdgs of the united nations akpoti et al 2019 one such approach used qualitative and parametric methods to evaluate land suitability for irrigated rice in west african sahel based on soil units soil fertility and water management dondeyne et al 1995 west african rice development environment has been characterized based on climate soil topography land types and rice systems with an emphasis on inland valleys andriesse and fresco 1991 windmeijer and andriesse 1993 andriesse et al 1994 other studies used multi criteria evaluation mce to estimate map suitability for irrigation potential under current and future climate change in ghana and ethiopia schmitter et al 2018 worqlul et al 2019 these methods are broadly classified as deductive which rely on physiology and other biophysical requirements new advances in inductive methods such as ecological niche models have provided means to take advantage of spatial big data for estimating the potential for agricultural development a recent approach has used ecological niche modeling to map quantitatively inland valleys suitability for rice production using machine learning methods akpoti et al 2020 the approach based on geospatial predictive modeling uses rice occurrence along with environmental biophysical predictors of rice contrary to asian conditions where large scale rice growing areas can be mapped by coarse scale modis data peng et al 2011 sakamoto et al 2005 salmon et al 2015 xiao et al 2006 2005 west african rice areas are sparse in a heterogeneous environment thus the application of the ecological niche modeling approach which not only has the advantage to predict the current distribution of irrigated rice areas but also identify suitable areas for development can aid in sustainable irrigated area expansion many irrigation schemes are inefficient and irrigation water productivity is low in burkina faso dembele et al 2012 sawadogo et al 2020 to improve water use efficiency through the reduction of irrigated water use many technologies have been introduced including alternate wetting and drying awd alternate wetting and drying is a water saving technology developed by the international rice research institute irri and is based on the fact that continuous flooding is not required for rice fields to achieve high yields bouman et al 2007 once the transplanted seedlings are well established the field water depth can fall to a threshold depth below the soil surface for a certain period before the field is irrigated implementation of awd among farmers particularly in asia has been very site specific in terms of the timing frequency and duration of the non flooded periods in some regions of asia rice fields are flooded every 6 8 days or 4 5 days depending on the soil texture howell et al 2015 norton et al 2017 yao et al 2012 the irri s recommendations of safe awd consist of three key elements a flooding for 2 weeks to avoid transplanting shock and suppress weeds b flooding during the flowering stage to avoid yield reduction due to water stress at this sensitive stage of rice development and c awd during all other periods with irrigation applied to 5 cm above the soil surface whenever water table falls to 15 cm below the soil surface lampayan et al 2015 a meta analysis of awd applications showed that on average awd reduced water input by 25 and increased water productivity by 24 without a yield penalty carrijo et al 2017 in addition to the aforementioned benefits awd reduced methane emission by 53 on average jiang et al 2019 and therefore has the potential to reduce water input and greenhouse gas emission while maintaining rice yields studies showed that awd can be applied in a dry environment such as the sahelian environment of west africa de vries et al 2010 djaman et al 2018 these assessments showed that awd can be deployed in both dry and wet seasons with comparable rice yields djaman et al 2018 and in some cases better than in continuously flooded fields de vries et al 2010 understanding the potentially irrigable land area while at the same time optimizing irrigation water use was identified as one of the priority actions in the burkina faso national rice development strategy bfnrds 2011 thus the objective of this study was to assess potentially irrigable lands for rice cultivation under water saving technology in burkina faso to achieve this objective an integrated approach of two principal steps was developed and implemented firstly an ensemble of models was used to assess the land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation secondly a simple water balance approach was adopted to estimate the climatic suitability of awd for water saving the results will provide policy makers and the development sector more insight into future suitable areas and opportunities for introducing awd in irrigated rice systems development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in burkina faso 6 w and 3 e 9 n and 15 n a landlocked country in west africa the topography of the country is mainly characterized by a low relief plain with a gently undulating landscape elevation between 142 m and 705 m the country has two main seasons one rainy season from june to september and one dry season from october to may burkina faso is divided into three main climatic zones sahelian zone 280 600 mm sub sahelian zone 600 900 and north sudanese zone 900 1200 mm see fig 1 burkina faso s economy mainly relies on rainfed agriculture with the majority of the workforce in the agricultural sector cereals are the main food resource for the population and are produced on smallholder farmland of less than 5 ha with rice being the fourth most cultivated cereal in terms of both land area and production in 2018 the cereals harvested area was 4 505 001 ha with a production of 4 991 259 tons of which harvested area paddy rice was 170 158 ha while the production was 160 949 tons fao 2019 three main cropping systems for rice are used in burkina faso including rainfed upland rainfed lowland and irrigated system according to the burkina faso national rice development strategy report lowland is the main rice ecology across all regions in the country bfnrds 2011 it accounts for 67 of the rice land area and supplies 42 of national rice production with average yields from 1 3 t ha to 2 5 t ha also rainfed rice growing represents about 10 of the rice land area and provides 5 of national rice production at an average yield of 1 t ha some irrigated areas of minor extent can be found mainly in the direct vicinity of dammed lakes between 1984 and 2009 irrigated rice growing accounted for an average of 23 of the rice land area and provided nearly 53 of national rice production bfnrds 2011 2 2 framework for mapping potentially irrigable lands for rice cultivation under water saving technology we deployed a two step spatially explicit integrated approach to map potential areas for irrigated rice expansion under alternate wetting and drying awd conditions see fig 2 in the first step we used the ecological niche modeling concept elith and franklin 2013 peterson 2006 that relates the known location of irrigated rice to relevant predictors and projected suitable unvisited areas the approach is widely used for species distribution modeling crimmins et al 2013 evangelista et al 2008 guisan and zimmermann 2000 and is now applied to agricultural suitability mapping akpoti et al 2020 estes et al 2013 heumann et al 2011 nabout et al 2012 ramírez gil et al 2018 we developed the modeling procedure in the software for assisted habitat modeling sahm morisette et al 2013 using two machine learning algorithms namely maximum entropy maxent and random forest rf in the second step we followed nelson et al 2015 to define the suitability for awd using a water balance approach by defining excess water balance and deficit water balance 2 2 1 potential for irrigated rice mapping 2 2 1 1 irrigated rice geographical locations data data on irrigated rice area locations were derived from the system of rice intensification sri international networks and resources center website http sri ciifad cornell edu countries burkinafaso index html the data comprises the coordinates of the rice fields the village name and other administrative attributes the data represents 31 locations distributed across the 3 climatic zones of burkina faso and were used as reference see fig 1a we used google earth pro high resolution images to inspect each of the rice locations and to digitize the polygons of the rice areas we further used each of the polygons to randomly generates 10 points within the digitized area to minimize the oversampling of each polygon which may induce model overfit we filtered the points by random sampling so that no pairs of points were below 1 5 km we also dropped any one pair of the sites which were too close in the initial dataset finally points that fell within waterways and other undesired features were removed the overall irrigated rice occurrence datasets resulted in a total of 226 points 2 2 1 2 environmental predictors selection of land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation a set of environmental predictors see table 1 and fig 3 was used to characterize the biophysical conditions of irrigated rice systems the predictors correspond to climate conditions surface and groundwater water and energy fluxes vegetation conditions soil physical and chemical properties and topography the candidate environmental predictors were pre selected based on previous suitability mapping for rice akpoti et al 2020 danvi et al 2016 heumann et al 2011 masoud et al 2013 and agricultural cropland irrigation potential schmitter et al 2018 worqlul et al 2019 high spatial resolution of bioclimatic variables were obtained from worldclim version 2 1 climate data https worldclim org fick and hijmans 2017 these climatic predictors profiled long term 1970 2000 annual trends climate seasonality and limiting environmental predictors irrigated rice cultivation relies on water availability we used distance to stream networks as a proxy for access to surface water high density stream networks were first derived from digital elevation model dem then euclidian distance was computed groundwater was represented in the modeling with the depth to groundwater table data obtained from fan et al 2017 and two categorical raster data of groundwater storage and groundwater yield obtained from macdonald et al 2012 groundwater variables are important as they are linked to climate aquifer types and porosity proximity to rivers and borehole yields under different hydrogeological conditions macdonald et al 2012 water and energy fluxes were represented by long term mean 1970 2000 of annual potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith evapotranspiration pet equation for reference crop obtained from trabucco and zomer 2018 and solar radiation from worldclim database these predictors are related to quantitative measures for deficit or surplus of water balance liu et al 2016 and the production of biomass and crop yield zhi peng et al 2017 normalized difference spectral indices have been widely used for characterizing irrigated rice environments gumma et al 2014 jeong et al 2012 sakamoto et al 2007 tornos et al 2015 we considered the 5 years average 2015 2019 of the soil adjusted vegetation index savi and normalized difference flood index ndfi derived from terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis vegetation indices mod13a3 version 6 monthly l3 global 1 km products these indices were computed

afsoilgrids250m hengl et al 2015 hengl et al 2017 were aggregated by weighted depth up to 30 cm to represent soil physico chemical properties in the models the 30 cm limit was considered as rice roots are usually contained within the puddled layer and muddy topsoil of 10 20 cm bouman et al 2007 we also derived exchangeable sodium percentage esp and base saturation percentage bsp computed based on soil exchangeable sodium esna the total exchangeable bases esb and cation exchange capacity cec as 3 esp esna 100 cec 4 bsp esb 100 cec topography is one of the key factors that control the spatial pattern of water availability grabs et al 2009 we used a digital elevation model dem from which we derived slopes and topographical wetness index twi to represent topographical variations in the models the twi of each pixel in the study area is a function of the upslope area a per unit contour length and the local slope tanb as 5 twi ln a tan b the final selection of the predictors was based on the step wise elimination of the least contributing variables and collinearity among variables a threshold of r 80 of pearson correlation was used to exclude any one of highly paired correlated variables see fig 4 a process considered as very important to ensure the independence among the predictors jarnevich et al 2015 twenty predictors were used in the final modeling 2 2 1 3 maximum entropy maxent and random forest rf models settings maxent is one the most widely used predictive modeling method due to its high predictive accuracy even under a low sample size along with the user friendly settings of the model halvorsen et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 the maxent model developed by phillips et al 2006 is based on the use of presence only data and a set of environmental predictors constraints the model was tuned based on model setting guidelines by phillips and dudík 2008 and phillips et al 2009 we maintained the 5000 iterations in the initial setting while the evaluation metrics stabilized around 11 000 background points also rf has been used in many presence backgrounds predictive modeling where the approach outperforms many other models mi et al 2017 stohlgren et al 2010 the model is a classification and regression learning method based on an ensemble of decision trees breiman 2011 rf was tuned based on the number of randomly selected predictor variables at each node the number of trees in the forest and the smallest node size for splitting as implemented in the package randomforest in r breiman et al 2011 in this study we used 6 1500 and 5 for the number of randomly selected predictor variables at each node the number of trees in the forest and the smallest node size for splitting respectively all the predictors were aggregated and resampled to a 90 m x 90 m grid using the nearest neighbor and majority filter methods for non categorical and categorical raster datasets respectively the modeling is based on the irrigated rice occurrence data along with randomly generated absence data as previously used by akpoti et al 2020 we used the kernel density estimate duong 2015 to randomly generate 11 000 background data training and testing datasets comprised 60 and 40 of the initial dataset respectively 2 2 1 4 threshold selection to discriminate between suitable and unsuitable areas from the continuous probability surface of the models predictions a threshold that maximizes the sensitivity specificity 2 was used the sum maximizer threshold was shown to be one of the best performing across varying modeling settings jiménez valverde and lobo 2007 c liu et al 2013 m liu et al 2013 this threshold minimizes the mean of the error rate for irrigated rice locations and the error rate for background samples we used the consensus forecast approach based on a simple mean to estimate the central tendency across both maxent and rf algorithms crimmins et al 2013 2 2 1 5 model evaluation to evaluate the models performance we considered widely used spatial predictive evaluation metrics including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc the percentage correctly classified pcc the sensitivity i e prediction of true presence specificity i e prediction of background points the kappa statistic and the true skill statistics tss together they provide the level of accuracy of the modeling assignment 2 3 climatic suitability assessment of the alternate wetting and drying awd we followed nelson et al 2015 to define the climatic suitability for awd using a water balance equation fig 5 and eq 6 6 i pcp c et s d pot pc where i is irrigated water supply pcp is precipitation c is capillary rise et is potential evapotranspiration of a specific type of well watered crop s is lateral seepage d is a surface inflow or drainage and pot pc is potential percolation in farmers fields water loss due to seepage the subsurface movement of water from one rice field to the other is often compensated by seepage inflow from another field schmitter et al 2015 therefore water loss through seepage was neglected in eq 6 irrigated rice fields are surrounded by bunds to store water in the rice fields in burkina faso thus resulting in negligible water loss through drainage the contribution of capillary rise in meeting water requirements for rice cultivation can be substantial if there is non flooded aerobic soil however in flooded rice fields soil percolation prevents capillary rise into the root zone and therefore capillary rise is often neglected in the water balance equation in awd capillary rise during the non flooding period may provide extra water to the crop in schemes where there is a shallow groundwater table bouman et al 2007 however water input through capillary rise was not included in the water balance equation due to a lack of spatial datasets on the capillary rise this might result in a bias in the water balance assessment in schemes with a shallow groundwater table based on the above mentioned assumptions and following nelson et al 2015 the water balance equation was simplified in eq 7 7 i pcp et pot pc 8 i pcp et pot pc 0 awd is an irrigation technology developed to produce rice with less water compared with the conventional approach of continuous flooding bouman et al 2007 following nelson et al 2015 we assumed that awd is suitable in a given period if there is a deficit water balance eq 8 and unsuitable otherwise eq 9 9 water balance deficit if pcp et pot pc 0 10 water balance excess if pcp et pot pc 0 the water balance was computed based on dekadal time steps corresponding to a total of 36 dekads in the year 3 dekads for each month this temporal resolution is justified by the fact that irrigation or drainage water management decisions are often taken on a weekly or fortnightly basis nelson et al 2015 we used 10 years average 2010 2019 of the dekad average daily in a dekad mm day precipitation data obtained from the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao portal to monitor water productivity through open access of remotely sensed derived data wapor v2 fao 2020 this precipitation product of 5 km resolution is based on the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps dataset which is a well performing satellite rainfall products over burkina faso dembélé and zwart 2016 the spatial distributions of the dekad precipitation variations are displayed in fig 6 similarly we considered the reference et dekad product of the wapor v2 database fao 2020 fig 7 et is the reference evapotranspiration dekad in mm day a sum of the soil evaporation e and canopy transpiration t of a hypothetical reference crop a well watered grass surface which is based on the fao method allen et al 1998 percolation rate on the rice field is influenced by soil factors including soil structure texture bulk density mineralogy organic matter content and the salt type and concentration bouman et al 2007 although the soil structure is changed by the physical action of puddling resulting in a hard pan there still variation in percolation rates among different soil texture classes for example bouman et al 2007 reported a value of 1 5 mm day in heavy clay soils to 25 30 mm day in sandy and sandy loam we used the approach developed by nelson et al 2015 by defining the percolation rate as a function of soil texture classes potential percolation pot pc which defines the upper limit of the rate of percolation into the subsoil due to the uncertainties associated with the texture classes percolation rates a sensitivity analysis used in the aforementioned research was adopted using 4 main sensitivity categories first a lower bound of pot pc as a function of soil texture classes were defined followed by an upper bound of pot pc then a basic setting which corresponds to pot pc rates that lie between the lower and the upper bounds see table 2 we finally considered fixed values of pot pc for the entire national scale of burkina faso of 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 mm day we used the texture data of the soil property maps of africa at 250 m resolution afsoilgrids250m hengl et al 2015 we used aggregation by weighted depth up to 30 cm of the pot pc using the first 3 standard depths an area coverage description of the texture classes at each depth over burkina faso is reported in table 3 showing the dominance of the sandy loam sandy clay loam and clay loam classes two growing seasons for irrigated rice exist in burkina faso that coincide with the dry and the wet seasons the first rice growing season extends from february to june referred to as dry season rice and the second season from july to december referred to as wet season rice rice cannot be cultivated from january to mid february due to low temperatures brought by the dry air harmattan winds blowing from the sahara we computed the awd climatic suitability based on the two growing seasons we then masked the awd climatic suitability with the potential suitability for irrigated rice cultivation as previously described 3 results 3 1 rice suitability assessment 3 1 1 evaluation of irrigated rice ecological niche models evaluation of the two models i e maxent and rf of the potential suitability distribution of irrigated rice in burkina faso shows high performing metrics with auc and pcc on training data higher than 92 and pcc 90 respectively similarly the models depict high performance when applied on independent test data with auc equals to 92 and pcc 81 overall rf showed higher consistency in the evaluation metrics compared with maxent with both models performing better than random auc 50 see table 4 rf evaluation metrics showed a smaller difference between training and testing which may represent an advantage in predicting unvisited suitable conditions for irrigated rice 3 1 2 predictors importance and excluded variables from the final model settings exchangeable sodium percentage esp exchangeable potassium esk groundwater table depth wtd euclidean distance to stream networks strdist and precipitation of the warmest quarter bio18 represent in that order the top 5 predictors for both rf and maxent fig 8 the results show that soil salinity fertility and water availability for irrigated rice including groundwater and surface water along with rainfall were key predictors of irrigated rice the five next top predictors were evapotranspiration et the normalized difference flood index ndfi annual mean temperature bio1 soil depth depth and total phosphorus tphos other predictors which were initially considered in the model development were finally excluded either due to their least contribution to the models or their high correlation with other predictors table 1 for example groundwater productivity although important to measure groundwater availability for irrigation was dropped from the models due to its weak contribution on the other hand solar radiation although important for rice plant growth was excluded due to its high collinearity with aet r 0 92 in total 18 predictors were excluded see table 1 3 1 3 relationship between the most relevant predictors and land suitability for irrigated rice fig 9 shows the response curves of the most important predictors of land suitability for irrigated rice cultivation exchangeable sodium percentage esp shows a positively skewed distribution with a maximum value of 9 esp response curve suggests that irrigated rice suitability decreases with soil salinity where esp is higher 9 a similar right skewed curve is shown for soil organic carbon stock ocs with a peak value of 75 tons ha soil bulk density bld with a maximum value of 1250 kg m3 and soil clay content of around 20 for maximum suitability aet shows a negatively skewed response with a peak value of 850 mm warmest quarter precipitation bio18 shows the highest suitability between 100 and 150 mm in a bell shaped response curve however the annual mean temperature shows a complex and positively skewed response curve with maximum suitability around 27 5 c a similar response shape is shown for available soil water capacity wwp with maximum suitability around 17 5 results show that irrigated rice suitability increases with exchangeable potassium esk soil depth depth normalized difference flood index ndfi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and cation exchange capacity cec in an exponential convex truncated normal distribution linear response curves respectively predictors such as depth to groundwater table wtd distance to stream network and soil silt content decrease with higher suitability land suitability for irrigated rice increased with groundwater storage value although no change in suitability is observed above the value of 1000 mm 3 1 4 spatial prediction of potential suitability for irrigated rice cultivation the potential for a suitable irrigable rice area is estimated at 25 0 105 ha for maxent and 20 7 105 ha for rf the consensus estimate of the suitable rice area is 21 1 105 ha the spatial distribution of predicted suitability is mapped in fig 10 the results show that suitable lands are mostly located within the latitudes 10 12 5 n from the west to east of the country this domain corresponds to the sub sahelian climatic zone and the north sudanese climatic zone see fig 1 for the climatic zones of burkina faso within the aforementioned domain three main clusters can be observed the first cluster corresponds to the location 5 5 2 7 w 10 12 n in the north sudanese climatic zone the second cluster corresponds to 2 7 w 0 11 12 5 n which falls mostly within the sub sahelian climatic zone the third cluster of suitable land is located around the 11 5 n 2 e of the sub sahelian climatic zone in general the sahelian climatic zone is marginally suitable for irrigated rice compared with the two other climatic zones the validation of the modeled suitable areas by comparison between the digitalized rice based on satellite imagery and modeled data showed a good agreement fig 11 confirming the pcc 81 previously reported and the potential for expansion 3 2 climatic suitability of alternate wetting and drying awd the totality of the dekads in the dry season are classified as suitable for awd the dry season awd results are expected due to low precipitation 0 6 mm day see fig 6 and high reference evapotranspiration 5 10 mm day see fig 7 even at the onset of the wet season in the north sudanese climatic zone where the precipitation values are close to 6 mm day any combination of et pot pc always exceeds pcp which results in a water balance deficit for the entire areas classified as potentially suitable for awd the awd climatic suitability during the wet season july to october under fixed values of pot pc is reported in fig 12 while awd climatic suitability where pot pc is a function of the soil texture see table 2 is depicted in fig 13 results show that for all fixed values of pot pc the month of july dekads 19 21 is mostly suitable for awd where pcp values are less than 4 mm day this in the exception of the last dekad of july under pot pc of 1 and 2 mm day where pcp values of 4 5 mm day exceed in some areas the combination of both 1 mm day pot pc and the pet values of 3 6 mm day the temporal variability of water balance excess and deficit is explained by the precipitation pattern with slow onset in june and maximum precipitation values in august september with a slow decrease toward october dekads 25 27 awd suitability also follows the precipitation pattern for relatively higher fixed values of pot pc such as 4 and 5 mm day in general with increasing pot pc only peaking precipitation months become unsuitable for awd such that for pot pc of 10 mm day or higher the entire area potentially suitable for irrigated rice also becomes suitable for awd overall taking into account the full length of the wet season 25 dekads 28 30 58 dekads 19 20 26 30 67 dekads 19 21 26 30 75 dekads 19 21 25 30 83 dekads 19 22 dekads 25 33 and 100 of the dekads are suitable for awd for pot pc values of 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 mm day respectively see supplementary material dekads that are partly suitable are mostly located in the central south east sub sahelian climatic zone and the north sahelian zone see fig 14 the awd under low boundary settings shows that 58 of the dekads 26 33 are suitable in the wet season fig 15 the upper boundary settings show that 100 suitability for awd supplementary material similarly awd is suitable in all months except for short periods between august september for basic settings supplementary material 4 discussions 4 1 potential for irrigated rice expansion many publications showed that there is a scope for irrigated rice expansion in africa xie et al 2014 you et al 2011 lançon and erenstein 2002 owing to the small fraction of agricultural land irrigated at present and considerable unused water sources wiggins and lankford 2019 it is estimated that investment in new irrigation schemes can raise the share of irrigated rice in domestic production from less than 10 on average presently to more than 50 in the coming year seck 2008 this article used a comprehensive ecological niche approach to estimate the potential for irrigated rice cultivation in burkina faso based on two machine learning methods including maxent and rf it was estimated that 20 7 105 ha to 25 0 105 ha are potentially suitable for irrigated rice cultivation in burkina faso these estimates were 9 11 folds higher than the existing potential for irrigation of 233 500 ha as reported in many documents including the burkina faso national rice development strategy report bfnrds 2011 this figure was rather close to the 350 000 ha potentially irrigable land for rice as reported in barghouti and lemoigne 1990 and fao 1986 while others reported a higher value of 720 000 ha biswas 1986 the discrepancies between the modeling results and the previous estimates were mainly explained by the methodological approaches as explained by van der wijngaart et al 2019 the estimation of 233 500 ha was based on biophysical and socio economic methods following a cost benefit analysis this approach relies on spatial production allocation model spam where national and sub national agricultural statistics for crop production are downscaled to approximately 10 km 10 km grid as described in xie et al 2017 xie et al 2014 and you et al 2011 on the other hand the estimated 350 000 ha and 720 000 ha were based on existing dams and the cost of water delivery to irrigated farmlands barghouti and lemoigne 1990 thus these potential irrigable lands are rather based on both biophysical and socio economic variables and existing irrigation infrastructures another estimate based on soil and terrain suitability for surface irrigation showed that burkina faso has 5438 000 ha suitable for rice irrigation frenken 1997 in our approach we used digitized irrigated rice areas of currently known rice production areas in burkina faso to train the models in an inductive approach these locations are along rivers river flood plains lowland inland valleys and flood plains which are near small medium and big reservoirs thus the modeling results infer potential for irrigated rice expansion by implicitly considering the likelihood of water availability and other suitable biophysical conditions key to future interventions in irrigation infrastructures development for irrigated rice area expansion the computed difference in the suitability maps for rf and maxent is mainly due to the specification in the threshold s values and methods rf showed consistency in the evaluation metrics with smaller differences between training and testing data in other studies rf has shown the best performance compared with other methods under limited data conditions mi et al 2017 since we have limited training data the use of maxent represents an advantage due to its generative learning nature phillips et al 2006 the distribution of the potential suitability was also explained by the predictors importance the modeling shows that exchangeable sodium percentage esp and exchangeable potassium esk were top predictors the response curve of esp showed that suitability decreases from an optimum value of 5 toward an upper boundary of 50 this corresponds to the optimum less than 20 and marginal 20 40 conditions of irrigated rice systems frenken 1997 previous studies indicated soil salinity as one of the main constraints to irrigated rice cultivation abe et al 2010 mel et al 2019 the response curve of esk showed increasing suitability with increasing esk values to an upper limit of 2 2 cmol kg which is in agreement with previous findings saito et al 2019 the variable importance also shows that depth to groundwater table wtd and distance to stream networks and rivers are also top predictors and have decreasing suitability with their increasing values both predictors which are proxies to groundwater and surface water availability for irrigation imply that the estimated distribution of potentially suitable land for rice irrigation corresponds to relatively high water availability in the sahelian context soil depth is considered as the limiting factor in irrigated rice systems dondeyne et al 1995 the models show that suitability increases with soil depth probably due to the lower risk of prolonged rice field submergence which often leads to crop failure singh et al 2009 the overall trends in predictors response curves reconcile well with irrigated rice crop requirements conferring to the models a strong ecological sense following acceptable ecological niche model development hirzel and le lay 2008 the spatially explicit distribution of potential suitability for irrigated rice shows that the majority of the suitable land lies below latitude 13 n in three mains clusters around the southwest central and southeast the distribution of the suitable land corresponds to the sub sahelian climatic zone within the 600 900 mm isohyets and the north sudanese climatic zone within the 900 1200 mm isohyets only selected hotspots of suitable areas are located in the sahelian climatic zone within the 200 600 mm isohyets the southwest spatial distribution of suitable areas is in agreement with irrigated agricultural areas presented in knauer et al 2017 based on existing land use and land cover data also the overall potential distribution of irrigable land is in agreement with a map presented in taverner and barry 2020 4 2 suitability of irrigated rice area to the awd method of irrigation in the arid and dry sub humid zone of west africa reducing water for irrigation while at the same time keeping good yield is strategic for food security and adapting to water scarcity in this study we evaluated the climatic suitability of awd at the national scale of burkina faso during both dry and wet seasons the results indicated that all dekads in the dry season were deemed suitable for awd following similar results found in the philippines nelson et al 2015 the application of awd water saving technology is challenged by many factors including soil types and climate yang et al 2017 such that djaman et al 2018 recommended the testing of awd under various soil texture conditions and water regimes thus to account for uncertainties associated with potential soil percolation rates pot pc a sensitivity analysis was conducted by testing pot pc fixed values of 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 mm day and by also defining pot pc as a function of texture classes in three different settings namely the low boundaries where pot pc values were set to minimum the upper boundary where pot pc were grossly high and the intermediate pot pc values under fixed pot pc settings awd suitability in the wet season was partially or totally suitable in dekads 19 21 july and in dekads 25 30 september october this suggests that awd is feasible in wet season in burkina faso currently awd is not used in the wet season which might result in reduced water stress and higher rice yield this is in line with the conclusion that during the wet season in the sahel awd can be implemented de vries et al 2010 our results also substantiate the findings of johnson et al 2020 who assessed the agronomic performance of awd during four growing seasons two wet and two dry in four irrigation schemes in burkina faso and reported that awd can be practiced in the dry and wet seasons with a reduction in the irrigation water use by 32 and 25 respectively compared with the farmers conventional practice of irrigation however it is also acknowledged that awd adoption in the rainy season or at least some parts of the rainy season may be limited since rice systems are often in low lying valleys and it may not be possible to dry the field especially in high rainfall years adhya et al 2014 carrijo et al 2017 this condition is true for burkina faso in the dekads 22 24 august september where the country receives the peak precipitation following the south north gradient and in scenarios where pot pc were relatively low less than 3 mm day and lower boundary conditions irrespective of pot pc spatial variability the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of water balance excess and deficit in the wet season under the safe awd recommended by irri rice fields are kept flooded during the first two weeks after transplanting to prevent transplanting shock and suppress weeds and during the flowering stage to avoid water stress at this sensitive stage and all other growing periods our assessment of awd suitability did not consider such periods where rice fields should be maintained flooded if all farmers transplanted rice seedlings in dekad 4 using a 120 days rice variety then dekads 4 and 5 two weeks after transplanting and decades 11 13 flowering stage will be considered unsuitable for awd however not all farmers transplant rice seedlings in the same decade therefore our study provides a window for awd application on a national scale soil properties that favor awd yield and promote low water use relative to continuous flooding were previously reported carrijo et al 2017 yield losses with awd compared with cf were found to be pronounced in soils with ph 7 soil organic carbon 1 and clay soil carrijo et al 2017 besides soil salinity might increase with awd in schemes with a deeper groundwater table due to capillary rise letey et al 2011 although our awd suitability assessment did not specifically include soil properties and groundwater depth we used these variables to identify suitable land for irrigated rice areas and evaluate awd suitability in the identified potentially suitable land 4 3 viewpoints on other water saving strategies in irrigated rice systems the increased water scarcity for crop productions requires methods and best water management practices that result in less water usage in irrigated rice systems these water saving strategies try to reduce the unproductive water losses through seepage percolation and evaporation at the irrigated rice field scale while the full discussion on the water saving strategies in irrigated rice schemes is beyond the scope of this paper we presented here a brief of such strategies that may be promoted or may need further research in west africa for more sustainable irrigated rice production a aerobic rice systems these systems are characterized by rice cultivation in non flooded and non saturated soil with supplemental irrigation when needed bouman et al 2005 aerobic rice leads to the lowest water consumption compared with the traditional flooded rice but also the lowest yield while the risk of crop failure due to drought is high nie et al 2012 peng et al 2006 the low yield in aerobic systems represents the main limitation to its widespread adoption by small scale farmers nie et al 2012 besides for sahelian conditions such as in burkina faso a thorough understanding of the opportunities and threats is still needed in the viewpoints of knowledge labor and energy requirements b ground cover rice production system gcrps or mulching mulching is another water saving technology through the reduction of runoff and soil water evapotranspiration which increases soil moisture retention by covering the ground with straw other crop residues or plastic sheets jabran et al 2015 studies showed that mulching improved both soil moisture and yields dossou yovo et al 2016 while controlling weeds germination and development c liu et al 2013 m liu et al 2013 qin et al 2006 and pest and diseases erenstein 2003 ngosong et al 2019 however in an irrigated system the performance of mulching is limited by the high soil moisture that limits the decomposition of organic matter and generates high methane emission kreye et al 2007 besides in the sahelian environment such as in burkina faso mulch availability is often limited contributing to the poor adoption of this technology by small scale farmers erenstein 2003 c the system of rice intensification sri sri is an ensemble of rice systems management practices based on 4 principles wide spacing young seedling use of organic fertilizer and awd see satyanarayana et al 2007 for review on sri and its historical development experiments conducted on sri demonstrated its benefits on water saving yield increase and soil fertility improvement dobermann 2004 mcdonald et al 2006 sheehy et al 2004 however sri has not been widely adopted by small scale farmers due to several reasons including high labor requirement and organic fertilizer often limiting particularly in the sahelian environment where rainfall is too low and livestock production requires organic matter among the water saving technologies awd has been widely advocated for its potential to reduce water consumption methane emission while maintaining rice yield compared with the traditional approach of conventional flooding however more research is needed on the effects of awd on labour requirements and soil fertility 4 4 outlooks several studies showed the greenhouse gas emissions ghgs reduction potential of the awd with large reductions in methane emissions reported in compared to continuous flooding clements et al 2011 lahue et al 2016 wang et al 2020 this aspect is critical in the west african situation where rice area expansion is unavoidable to meet the national rice self sufficiency agenda while keeping the promise of sustainable intensification goals a study on a biophysical suitability mapping for awd in the philippines and thailand demonstrated an approach to quantify ghgs at the national scale sander et al 2017 prangbang et al 2020 given this context it is important to deploy this method in west africa to support ghg inventory in the national communications to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in the rice sectors in a large agricultural water management context especially in a transboundary watershed e g the volta basin it is recommended a general adoption of the water saving concept a detailed spatial explicit mapping and quantification of irrigation water use and its productivity from field scale to regional scales while considering awd is a prerequisite for planning improving and managing irrigation systems lampayan et al 2015 future research may also consider how socio economic factors may influence the adoption of awd among smallholder rice farmers howell et al 2015 5 conclusion to achieve rice self sufficiency in west africa governments and the private sector need to invest in area expansion of irrigated rice production climate change is expected however to negatively affect water resource availability thus planning and development of new rice areas must be done conjunctively with the adoption of water saving irrigation management technologies to develop policies plan investment and make informed decisions accurate and reliable spatial information on irrigated rice potential for sustainable development is essential to fill this gap and support policymakers planners and other stakeholders in burkina faso we developed a spatially explicit and integrated approach to map the potential areas for irrigated rice expansion under the water saving alternate wetting and drying awd water management technology we assessed that between 20 7 105 ha and 25 0 105 hectares are potentially suitable for irrigated rice in burkina faso the major predictors for irrigated rice potential were exchangeable sodium percentage exchangeable potassium depth to groundwater table and distance to stream networks and rivers this indicated the importance of soil chemical properties as well as groundwater and surface water importance for irrigated rice given that the ecological niche approach used in this study infers optimum conditions from observed irrigated rice areas the method offers a tool that is robust for planning sustainable agricultural development by providing a major predictor of optimum location and their partial response to the suitability level of that location the climatic suitability for awd indicated that about all dekads of the dry season was deemed climatically suitable for awd besides an additional 25 100 of the wet season was found climatically suitable for awd soil percolation rate was the main driver of awd suitability during the wet season the framework used in this study can guide investment in irrigated rice expansion and awd scaling for water saving greenhouse gas mitigation and ecosystem services preservation all unknown in the west african region further studies should evaluate the boundary conditions in irrigation systems that are required for large scale adoption of awd this study did not consider the cost of water delivery to potentially irrigable rice areas future studies may consider this option in cost benefit analysis also future research may include water storage reservoirs and or dams as predictors and their impact

10212,water scarcity seriously hinders the sustainable development of the fruit tree crops intercropping system in the loess gully area of western shanxi the combination of mulch measures and appropriate irrigation would help to maintain soil moisture and improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue this study investigated the combined effects of mulch and irrigation on soil water and root distribution yield and water use of an apple soybean intercropping system a three year field trial was performed with two factors two types of mulch namely straw mulch m1 and plastic mulch m2 and three levels of maximum irrigation 55 70 or 85 of field capacity fc which were designated w1 w2 and w3 respectively three groups of non irrigation controls i e ck0 no mulch ck1 straw mulch and ck2 plastic mulch were also included these results indicated that the soil water contents swc in each treatment initially decreased and then increased with increasing distance from the tree whereas it increased gradually with depth the swcs in various sampling points under straw mulch was generally higher than under plastic mulch the root length density rld of apple tree decreased with increasing distance from the tree in the horizontal direction while the opposite trend was observed for soybean the rld of both apple tree and soybean in the soil layer 0 60 cm under plastic mulch was higher than that under straw mulch and increased with increased irrigation level the underground interspecific competition intensity index uicii of the apple soybean intercropping system under straw mulch was higher than that under plastic mulch and increased with the increased irrigation amount water consumption soybean yield and wue under plastic mulch were significantly higher than under straw mulch the results of this study suggested that the combination of plastic mulch and irrigation water supplied at 70 85 fc could effectively increase the yield and wue of the apple soybean intercropping system keywords agroforestry fruit tree crops intercropping mulch soil water content root distribution 1 introduction agroforestry is an efficient strategy for appropriate and sustainable land use and it integrates the spatial and temporal combination of different species to fully utilize natural resources sun et al 2018a agroforestry plays an important role in controlling soil erosion and alleviating the conflicts between agriculture and forestry tsonkova et al 2012 charbonnier et al 2017 in the past 10 years agroforestry has been widely practiced in the loess area of western shanxi in which apple malus pumila m and soybean glycine max l merr are important economic tree species and food crops due to the poor yield of young apple trees local farmers generally grow soybean as an intercrop for a more efficient use of land and higher economic returns and this system has become the main local agroforestry model yun et al 2012 however western shanxi is chronically short of soil water because of the scarce and unevenly distributed precipitation and groundwater below 50 m depth gao et al 2016 ling et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a in addition a clean cultivation strategy often applied for soil moisture management in the region can not meet the strong soil moisture demand of an intercropping system and is prone to soil erosion and nutrient loss and therefore to lower productivity gao et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 it is therefore necessary to implement effective soil water control strategies to replace the traditional clean cultivation strategy and to make up for its defects soil mulch measures can effectively improve soil physiochemical properties and water conditions thereby promoting plant growth and increasing crop yields vincent caboud et al 2019 mohammad et al 2019 plastic and straw are the most commonly used mulch materials plastic mulch reduces soil surface evaporation by providing a physical barrier and increases soil temperature crop yield and water use efficiency wue xing et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 whereas straw mulch can keep the soil structure loose reduce surface runoff and increase soil infiltration and soil water storage chen et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 yin et al 2015 found that straw mulch increased the wue of the wheat corn intercropping system by 46 however during the vigorous growth period of the apple soybean intercropping system a single mulch measure is unlikely to meet the huge gap between water supply and plant demand zheng et al 2016 it is therefore necessary to combine mulch and irrigation measures to solve the problem of water shortage in the critical growth period of the intercropping system however the water consumption in an intercropping system is not simply the sum of water consumption of two monoculture crops yin et al 2018 2020 the combination of mulch and irrigation has a complex effect on water competition and complementary utilization effects which make soil water a more complicated component of an intercropping system therefore it is necessary to explore the complex interplay between water supply and demand in a fruit tree crops intercropping system served by a combination of mulch and irrigation previous studies have shown that copious amounts of irrigation can alleviate interspecies competition in maize pea intercropping systems under plastic mulch and will increase the yield of both crops zhao et al 2019b in a drip irrigated maize tomato intercropping system with plastic mulch the soil water content swc and root length density rld in the top soil layer increased as the quantity of water supplied increased whereas the rld in the deeper layer 30 100 cm displayed the opposite trend li et al 2017 there were some differences between the tree crops and crops crops intercropping compared with crops the root system of tree has a larger distribution which gives them a strong competitive advantage over water and fertilizer acquisition in tree crops intercropping systems sanchez 1995 however there have been few studies of the fruit tree crops intercropping system under the combination of mulch and irrigation and the mechanism of interspecies interaction is not clearly understood developing implementable and effective measures to increase the moisture retention alleviate underground interspecific competition and improve the wue in the fruit tree crops intercropping system are key issues that need to be solved urgently the main objectives of this study were to investigate 1 the effect of mulch and irrigation regimes on the soil moisture and root distribution of the apple soybean intercropping system and 2 the effect of mulch and irrigation regimes on the yield and wue of the apple soybean intercropping system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental site was located at maziqu in the forest ecosystem studies national observation and research station jixian shanxi china 36 01 n 110 45 e the study field is part of a gully area on the loess plateau and the surface soil is quaternary aeolian loess the soil is slightly alkaline ph 7 9 and low in nutrients with less than 1 organic matter the climate is temperate continental the average annual precipitation is 576 mm of which roughly 60 is received during june august whereas the annual average potential evaporation is 1729 mm the annual average temperature is

characteristics and actual operating conditions of fruit tree crops intercropping in the study area an apple soybean intercropping system was established in the apple boutique demonstration park in maziqu jixian shanxi province the apple trees short branch red fuji had been planted in 2013 and were yet to start bearing fruit they were planted in rows 5 m apart and oriented east west within each row the trees were 4 m apart the average plant height was 3 9 m the diameter at breast height was 7 cm the north south crown width was 3 2 m the east west crown width was 3 6 m and the crown height was 3 2 m soybean jindou no 35 was initially 2017 sown in rows that were 0 9 m from the rows of apple tree and had a spacing of 0 3 0 4 m fig 1 to reduce the competition between apple tree and soybean the spacing of soybean was increased in 2018 and 2019 thus the row spacing between soybean and apple tree rows was 1 0 m and the spacing of soybean was 0 35 0 50 m soybean was sown on april 12 in 2017 april 19 in 2018 and april 22 in 2019 each plot covered 14 m2 and consisted of two apple trees with plot edges 1 0 m away from the trees the sampling points remained the same in all three years of the trial fig 2 before ploughing the following basal dose was applied by spreading fertilizer evenly over the area n 412 4 kg ha 1 p2o5 168 8 kg ha 1 and k2o 168 8 kg ha 1 the experiment consisted of two soil mulches namely straw mulch m1 and plastic mulch m2 and three levels of irrigation the straw mulch was in the form of maize stalks harvested from the previous year which were cut into pieces 5 10 cm long the cut straw was used as mulch between the crop rows after the emergence of soybean the straw mulch was 5 cm thick the plastic film which was of white polyethylene and 0 005 mm thick was applied before sowing soybean two rows of soybean were covered with one sheet of plastic mulch with 60 cm width and 70 cm width in 2017 and in 2018 2019 fig 2 by considering the suitable soil moisture range of apple tree and soybean gao et al 2013 three levels of maximum irrigation were designed 55 w1 70 w2 and 85 w3 of fc because most of the fine roots of young apple tree and soybean are found in the 0 60 cm soil layer sun et al 2018a irrigation was supplied with the aim of wetting that layer the field experiment was laid out in a randomized block design consisting of a total of six combinations of mulch and irrigation levels and three non irrigated controls namely ck0 no mulch ck1 straw mulch and ck2 plastic mulch with three replications a total of 27 plots were included because the apple tree had not begun to produce fruit yet irrigation was provided during the critical growth stages of soybean namely the branching podding and filling stages in 2018 due to abundant precipitation at the podding stage irrigation was withheld in all treatments the swc was determined in each treatment before irrigation and the measurement was then used to calculate the volume of irrigation required to reach the target swc link et al 2015 border irrigation was used to supply water and a water meter was used to control the volume of irrigation a buffer zone 2 m wide was maintained between adjacent plots to prevent any significant water exchange between plots the irrigation quota of the different treatments is shown in table 1 the volume of irrigation water was calculated using the following equation man et al 2014 1 m 10 γ h θ w θ 0 where m is the amount of irrigation water γ is the soil bulk density in the target soil layer h is the depth of the target soil layer θ w is the target soil gravimetric water content and θ 0 is the soil gravimetric water content before irrigation 2 3 data collection and measurements 2 3 1 meteorological measurements precipitation and temperature were monitored by an automatic weather station at 1 h intervals precipitation during the growth period of soybean was 427 6 mm in 2017 398 0 mm in 2018 and 326 3 mm in 2019 precipitation was more evenly distributed during the growth stages in 2017 concentrated mostly during the podding and filling stages in 2018 and concentrated mostly during the maturity stage in 2019 with correspondingly less precipitation during the other growth stages fig 3 by the standards set by the shanxi institute of meteorological sciences 2017 and 2018 were normal water years whereas 2019 was a dry year 2 3 2 soil water measurements the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer was determined at 10 cm intervals at points 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m from the tree using time domain reflectometry tdr probes trime pico iph imko ettlingen germany fig 2 and gravimetric measurements were used to verify the tdr measurements skaggs et al 2004 measurements were conducted before sowing during the branching podding filling and maturity stages before irrigation and after rainfall 2 3 3 root measurements at the filling stage aug 26 2017 aug 23 2018 and aug 25 2019 roots were sampled using a root drill with a diameter of 10 cm the sampling points were the same as those used for determining swc root samples were collected at 20 cm intervals to the maximum depth of 60 cm root samples were soaked in water for 2 h and roots were separated from the soil by shaking the sieve 0 2 mm mesh and 30 cm diameter the roots of apple trees and soybean were distinguished by their different color apple trees roots were red whereas soybean roots were yellowish after scanning roots with a root scanner rld was estimated by analysing the images of roots using the winrhizo software ver 2003b reagent instruments inc quebec canada 2 3 4 yield measurements grain yield of soybean was determined in plots at maturity stage oct 19 2017 oct 18 2018 and oct 12 2019 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 underground interspecific competition intensity index uicii the intensity of competition for water between the roots of apple tree and soybean was quantified by calculating the degree of overlap between the

p si are the proportions of fine roots of apple tree and soybean respectively in the i th soil layer in relation to all the layers 0 60 cm 2 4 2 water consumption et the water balance equation was used to calculate the et of the apple soybean intercropping system at each growth stage chai et al 2014 3 et 1 2 i p u r f w where et 1 2 is the et mm in each growth period i is the irrigation water volume mm p is the effective precipitation mm u is the amount of groundwater recharge mm r is surface run off f is the amount of deep leakage mm and δw is the difference between soil water storage at the beginning and end of each stage because the experimental field was level the surface run off was assumed to be zero the water table was 50 m below the surface and therefore groundwater recharge of the surface soil layer was also assumed to be zero because the swc at 50 60 cm was less than fc after either each round of irrigation or each spell of rain deep leakage was assumed to be zero thus the values of r u and f were considered to be negligible 2 4 3 water use efficiency wue wue in the intercropping system was expressed as the ratio of soybean yield to et across the intercropping area yan

lsd test was applied to compare differences among the values of treatments on swcs uicii et soybean yield and wue p 0 05 a general linear model glm was used to analyze the effects of mulch measures amount of irrigation water and mulch irrigation interaction on swcs graphs were generated using origin ver 9 0 origin lab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal distribution of soil water in 2017 and 2019 in every treatment the swcs initially decreased and then increased as the crop continued to grow with the minimum swc reached during the podding and filling stages however the opposite trend was observed in 2018 with the maximum swc reached during the podding stage at a given level of irrigation swcs of apple soybean intercropping system under straw mulch was generally higher than that under plastic mulch table 2 mulch irrigation and mulch irrigation interaction had very significant effects p 0 01 on the variation in swcs of the intercropping system fig 4 the swcs of all treatments decreased initially and then increased as the distance from the tree increased during 2017 2019 fig 4 in 2017 the swc was the highest at 0 5 m from the tree and lowest at 1 5 2 0 m in 2018 and 2019 the minimum swc was recorded 1 0 m from the tree with the swc of this area under plastic mulch being less than that under straw mulch this suggested that the location with the highest soil water consumption progressively migrated towards the tree from a distance of 1 5 2 0 m as the intercropping year increased especially under plastic mulch for a given level of irrigation the swcs at various distances from the tree under straw mulch was generally higher than that under plastic mulch under the same mulch the swcs for the different irrigation levels at the same location had not obvious change law during the growth stage the swcs of every treatment increased with depth throughout the entire growth period although the change of swcs in the deeper layer 30 60 cm was smaller than that in the top layer 0 30 cm the magnitude of the change in the top layer was greater in 2018 and 2019 than in 2017 fig 5 at a given level of irrigation the swcs of each layer under straw mulch were generally higher than under plastic mulch during 2017 2019 under the same mulch the swcs of different layers remained unaffected by the level of irrigation except in 2019 when the swcs of different layers under straw mulch was significantly different p 0 05 among the three irrigation levels the swcs of the upper soil 0 30 cm was the highest under the w3 irrigation level while the swc of the subsoil 30 60 cm was the highest under the w2 irrigation level 3 2 spatial distribution of fine roots 3 2 1 apple tree in 2017 2019 the rld of apple tree in each treatment decreased with increasing distance from the tree fig 7 fine roots were confined mainly to the zone 0 5 1 0 m from the tree in 2017 the fine roots in this zone as a proportion of the total roots in the entire zone within a radius of 2 5 m from the tree varied from 52 67 to 91 48 being higher under straw mulch than under plastic mulch the corresponding proportions were 57 70 68 99 in 2018 and 60 74 63 70 in 2019 these values in mulched plots combined with irrigation were only greater than that in ck0 by 6 50 17 41 in 2018 and by 1 00 4 87 in 2019 the combined effect of mulch and irrigation on the horizontal distribution of fine roots decreased with increased planting years in 2017 the fine roots of apple tree from all treatments were mainly confined to the 0 20 cm soil layer but this gradually shifted to the deeper soil layers as the trees grew in 2018 and 2019 fine roots were mainly confined to the 20 40 cm soil layer with the proportion of fine roots in that layer being 35 53 51 15 in 2018 and 40 45 51 80 in 2019 and this proportion increased as the level of irrigation increased for a given quantity of irrigation the rld of apple tree under plastic mulch was higher than that under straw mulch in the 0 60 cm soil layer being 52 62 65 14 in 2017 but only 29 72 38 88 in 2019 fig 6 this indicated that plastic mulch was more conducive to the growth of fine roots although this gap decreased over time without irrigation the rld in ck1 was less than that in ck0 whereas in ck2 the rld was greater than that in ck0 in 2018 and 2019 with the same mulch the rld increased with increased irrigation level but the proportion of fine roots in the zone 1 5 2 5 m from the tree and in the deeper soil layer 40 60 cm decreased as the level of irrigation increased the treatment with the largest rld value in the 0 60 cm soil layer was m2w3 throughout the experiment 3 2 2 soybean throughout the trial and in all treatments the soybean rld in the horizontal direction was smallest at 0 5 m from the tree and the values displayed an increasing trend with increasing distance from the tree although this trend was not significant in 2018 fig 8 in the vertical direction rld decreased sharply as the depth increased the fine roots of soybean were mainly distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer and fine roots in this soil layer as a proportion of all roots in the 0 60 cm soil layer increased with increasing intercropping years being 55 12 64 74 in 2017 67 45 78 36 in 2018 and 71 14 80 62 in 2019 however the rld in the deeper layer 40 60 cm decreased over time although to a lesser extent the rld in ck1 and ck2 was higher than in ck0 compared to the values under straw mulch the rld in the 0 60 cm soil layer under plastic mulch increased by 1 92 9 03 in 2017 1 06 31 88 in 2018 and 5 66 28 23 in 2019 for the same mulch treatments the rld in the 0 60 cm soil layer increased as the level of irrigation increased fig 6 straw and plastic mulch treatments proved superior to ck0 in increasing the proportion of fine roots of soybean in the 0 20 cm soil layer under plastic mulch the proportion of fine roots in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased as the level of irrigation increased whereas the opposite trend was observed under straw mulch in 2018 the rld of soybean in all treatments was generally higher than that in 2017 and 2019 and the maximum rld was observed in m2w3 throughout the experiment 3 2 3 underground interspecific competition intensity index below ground competition between the root systems of apple tree and soybean occurred mainly in the zone 0 5 1 0 m from the tree the uicii was the highest at 0 5 m from the tree and decreased as the distance increased table 3 except for treatment m2w1 the uicii was higher 0 9 for the treatments at 0 5 1 0 m from the tree in 2017 the uicii in ck0 and ck1 at 2 0 2 5 m from the tree was zero showing weak competition in this area the uicii at 0 5 1 0 m was greater than that at 1 5 2 5 m by 30 09 140 14 in 2018 and 29 15 287 01 in 2019 at a given level of irrigation the uicii under straw mulch was generally higher than that under plastic mulch demonstrating a better alleviation of the competition between the underground root systems in the intercropping system by plastic mulch under the same mulch the uicii generally increased as the level of irrigation increased and the phenomenon was more pronounced in 2018 2019 in 2018 and 2019 the uicii for all treatments was weaker than that in ck0 and the uicii was lowest in m2w1 in general the uicii of apple soybean intercropping tended to decrease with increasing planting years and the difference between treatments also decreased the uicii of each treatment in 2019 was significantly lower than that in 2017 except for the m2w2 treatment 3 3 water consumption and soybean yield for a given level of irrigation et soybean yield and wue under plastic mulch were significantly higher p 0 05 than under straw mulch table 4 plastic mulch treatments produced soybean yield was greater by 16 22 34 05 and 32 11 and wue was greater by 13 98 31 40 and 28 22 than straw mulch treatments in 2017 2019 respectively under the same mulch et was positively correlated with the level of irrigation in 2017 and 2018 soybean yield and wue under plastic mulch initially increased and then decreased with the increasing irrigation amount whereas wue under straw mulch was negatively correlated with the irrigation water volume in 2019 soybean yield increased with the increasing irrigation amount and wue under both soil mulches increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation volume in 2017 et and soybean yield from every treatment were significantly higher p 0 05 than in 2018 and 2019 however the soybean yield from each treatment increased most compared to ck0 in 2019 mulch combined with irrigation resulted in the lowest wue in 2018 in 2017 and 2019 the maximum et was observed in the podding filling or filling maturity stages whereas in 2018 the highest et occurred only during the podding filling stage which was much larger than that in other stages the treatment with the highest et throughout the entire growing period was m2w3 in all three years the largest soybean yield was recorded in the m2w2 treatment in 2017 2018 and in the m2w3 treatment in 2019 under straw and plastic mulch wue was lowest when the level of irrigation was highest 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal distribution of soil water mulch measures reduce the evaporation of soil moisture anikwe et al 2007 yu et al 2018 whereas irrigation directly increases the swc at the same time the swc is also affected by the different et of different plant types and the overlapping or non overlapping root systems in different growth periods gao et al 2010 in this study the soil moisture of four consecutive growth periods in the intercropping system was analyzed and it was found that the swcs for each treatment in 2017 and 2019 was smallest during the podding and filling stages but was largest in 2018 during the podding stage table 2 this was likely because the incoming solar radiation was stronger during the podding and filling stages than in other growth periods and apple tree and soybean undergo vigorous growth resulting in higher evapotranspiration in the intercropping system than during the other growth periods however in 2018 32 41 130 1 mm of all precipitation received during the entire growth period was concentrated in the podding stage making the water input of the intercropping system higher than the et and resulting in the highest swc occurring during this stage the swcs for all treatments in 2017 2019 followed a v shaped pattern with distance from the tree and the areas with the lowest swc gradually migrated towards the tree with increasing intercropping years fig 4 however in an earlier study involving a pecan cotton alley cropping system wanvestraut et al 2004 showed that swc increased with incremental distance from the tree this inconsistency was likely attributable to the low et in the region 0 5 1 0 m from the apple tree in the current study this region was completely covered by the crowns of the apple tree with the apple canopy blocking part of the solar radiation thereby reducing the evaporation of soil moisture at the same time the fruit trees were young and their water requirements were small the root system of apple tree can cause a hydraulic lift of the soil moisture from the deeper and wetter soil layer along the gradient of the soil water potential richards and caldwell 1987 thereby increasing the swc near the tree the apple rld at 0 5 1 0 m from the tree increased with planting year fig 7 which accelerated the absorption of soil moisture in this area this process led to the position where the lowest swc shifted toward the tree the apple rld was higher under the plastic mulch than under the straw mulch which led a greater migration of the lowest swc areas towards the tree compared to plastic mulch straw mulch treatments had higher swcs in both the horizontal and vertical directions under the same level of irrigation because plastic mulch maintained a higher soil temperature and available water li et al 2013 it allowed plants to grow more vigorously xing et al 2012 yu et al 2018 with a higher transpiration rate moreover the plastic mulch hindered the contact and infiltration of some precipitation with the soil thus resulting in a lower swc in 2019 the swcs of each layer among the different irrigation levels treated with straw mulch was significantly different and the swc of the upper soil layer 0 30 cm was highest in the w3 treatment whereas the swc of the deeper soil layer 30 60 cm was highest in the w2 treatment fig 5 because of the limited precipitation in 2019 the larger volume of irrigation water in the w3 treatment would make the upper soil layers more humid however this would also lead to an enhanced moisture evaporation from surface soil and water competition between plants in the intercropping system the et in the upper soil layers increased accordingly part of the et in the upper layer was replenished through soil capillary processes from deeper soil layers which led to the deeper soil layer 30 60 cm having a lower swc under the w3 treatment than under the w2 treatment the plastic mulch also effectively reduced soil evaporation which explained the overall insignificant difference in the swcs in each layer between the different irrigation levels 4 2 spatial distribution of fine roots the spatial distribution of the roots of tree and annual crops in an agroforestry system reflects their ability to compete for belowground resources kumar et al 1999 smith et al 1999 the phenotype and distribution of roots are influenced in turn by the availability of water and nutrients in soil adiku et al 2001 jha et al 2017 our study observed that the fine roots of apple tree were mainly distributed in the zone 0 5 1 0 m from the tree and had a tendency to decrease with increasing distance from the tree fig 7 while the soybean roots presented the opposite distribution trend fig 8 this result was consistent with previous findings in a walnut soybean intercropping system as reported by xu et al 2013 the effect of plastic mulch on thermal enhancement and water preservation was better than that of straw mulch and was more conducive to the development of early crop growth and root growth chen et al 2007 therefore compared with the straw mulch treatment the rld of apple tree and soybean was higher under the plastic mulch treatment under the same irrigation level as the apple tree roots gradually grew into the deeper soil layers over time the effect of the mulch on their growth was reduced resulting in a narrowing of the gap between the two types of mulch treatment over time in addition the rld of apple tree and soybean increased with the increase in the amount of irrigation but the proportion of apple tree fine roots in the zone 1 5 2 5 m from the tree and in the 40 60 cm soil layer decreased with the increase in the level of irrigation this was likely attributable to the increased irrigation promoting the growth of soybean roots and the increase in soybean rld then inhibited the growth of apple tree fine roots at 1 5 2 5 m from the tree sun et al 2018b apple tree roots consumed less energy to absorb soil moisture from the shallower layers than deeper soil layers liu et al 2020 more irrigation would increase the moisture content of shallow soil layers which would slow the growth of the fine roots of apple tree in the deeper soil layers therefore fine roots of apple tree were increasingly confined to the zone near the trunk as the volume of irrigation increased the proportion of soybean fine roots in the 0 20 cm soil layer under the plastic mulch increased with the increase in the amount of irrigation but the opposite trend was apparent under the straw mulch this was likely because the physical barrier of the plastic mulch hindered the infiltration of water thereby retaining the irrigation water in the shallow soil layers however the straw mulch had little effect on water infiltration and the soil texture was also looser which facilitated the downward movement of the wetting front of the irrigation water more irrigation thus promoted the growth of the fine roots of soybean in the deeper soil layers thereby lowering their proportion in the surface layer under the straw mulch the proportion of soybean fine roots in the 0 20 cm soil layer under the plastic mulch was higher than that under straw mulch fig 8 it also led to a higher spatial differentiation of fine root niche of component crops distribution under plastic mulch thereby reducing the uicii therefore under the straw mulch the uicii was generally higher than that for the plastic mulch on the other hand higher levels of irrigation also attracted the fine roots of apple tree to the top soil layer thereby intensifying competition in that layer this explains why the uicii increased with increasing irrigation amount agroforestry systems result in strong interspecies competition between trees and annual crops to adapt to the environment fine roots show a strong plasticity and the growth and distribution of roots changes as required zamora et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 given the sufficient soil moisture in the deeper layers and the inherent growth characteristics of apple tree their roots moved deeper over time whereas in soybean mulch and irrigation favored the growth of fine roots in the shallower layers hence the increasing proportion of fine soybean roots in the 0 20 cm layer over time the change in the root distribution of the two species decreased the competition for soil moisture and nutrients wang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 which is why the uicii decreased as the apple tree grew older 4 3 soybean yield and water consumption water absorption by roots is closely related to the rld van noordwijk 1993 lobet et al 2014 ma et al 2019 found that the soil water storage and the rld were negatively correlated in a wheat maize intercropping system at a given level of irrigation the rld in both apple tree and soybean was greater under plastic mulch fig 6 which enabled a greater water uptake by plants leading to a greater et the et of podding filling stage was much higher than other stages in 2018 this phenomenon was different from 2017 and 2019 because of precipitation being concentrated during the podding and filling stages in 2018 resulting in a greater swc than during branching and maturity the higher swc met the water demand for crops growth but also increased evapotranspiration which explains why the maximum et occurred in podding filling stage the soybean yield of the intercropping system in 2017 and 2018 under both mulches increased following irrigation but decreased as the level of irrigation increased this observation was inconsistent with that of zhou et al 2019 who found that in an apple maize intercropping system the maize yield increased as the level of irrigation increased the reason for this discrepancy may be that maize differs in its water consumption characteristics from soybean maize needs more water during the growing period however higher levels of irrigation boosted the physiological activity of soybean and delayed the senescence of leaves and reproductive growth the air temperature in the later growth period decreased thereby slowing down the accumulation of dry matter ultimately resulting in a lower soybean yield the et of the intercropping system was positively correlated with the level of irrigation which is why wue was lowest in the w3 treatment because 2019 was a dry year the low water input increased the positive impact of the mulches on yield qin et al 2015 the increase in the soybean yield of each treatment compared to ck0 was greater in 2019 than in 2017 2018 in 2017 and 2018 the highest soybean yield was obtained in the m2w2 treatment but in 2019 it was obtained from m2w3 in 2017 and 2019 the wue in m2w2 was slightly smaller than that in ck2 whereas in 2018 the same treatment recorded the highest wue the uicii value under plastic mulch was lower than that under straw mulch and under no mulch in summary plastic mulch and 70 85 fc irrigation was the optimum combination for the apple soybean intercropping system in the region 5 conclusions the results from a three year field trial of the apple soybean intercropping system suggested that compared to straw mulch plastic mulch had higher soil moisture consumption with lower swcs in both the horizontal and vertical directions moreover plastic mulch increased the extent of the shift in the location of the minimum swc in the horizontal direction towards the tree plastic mulch also proved more conducive to the growth of the fine roots of apple tree and soybean than straw mulch and the rld in both species was positively correlated to the level of irrigation soybean roots under plastic mulch tended to converge in the top soil layer as the amount of irrigation water increased but the opposite trend was observed under straw mulch which was not conducive to the separation of the apple tree and soybean root niches therefore the combination of plastic mulch and irrigation strategies was more conducive to the alleviation of competition among species the et soybean yield and wue were significantly higher under plastic mulch than straw mulch in 2017 and 2018 the highest soybean yield was recorded in the m2w2 treatment whereas in 2019 it was recorded in m2w3 and it had a higher wue and a lower uicii value therefore to increase the yield and wue of the apple soybean intercropping system in the loess gully area of western shanxi and to ease the interspecies competition in the intercropping system it is recommended to adopt a combination of plastic mulch and 70 85 fc maximum irrigation declaration of

10212,water scarcity seriously hinders the sustainable development of the fruit tree crops intercropping system in the loess gully area of western shanxi the combination of mulch measures and appropriate irrigation would help to maintain soil moisture and improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue this study investigated the combined effects of mulch and irrigation on soil water and root distribution yield and water use of an apple soybean intercropping system a three year field trial was performed with two factors two types of mulch namely straw mulch m1 and plastic mulch m2 and three levels of maximum irrigation 55 70 or 85 of field capacity fc which were designated w1 w2 and w3 respectively three groups of non irrigation controls i e ck0 no mulch ck1 straw mulch and ck2 plastic mulch were also included these results indicated that the soil water contents swc in each treatment initially decreased and then increased with increasing distance from the tree whereas it increased gradually with depth the swcs in various sampling points under straw mulch was generally higher than under plastic mulch the root length density rld of apple tree decreased with increasing distance from the tree in the horizontal direction while the opposite trend was observed for soybean the rld of both apple tree and soybean in the soil layer 0 60 cm under plastic mulch was higher than that under straw mulch and increased with increased irrigation level the underground interspecific competition intensity index uicii of the apple soybean intercropping system under straw mulch was higher than that under plastic mulch and increased with the increased irrigation amount water consumption soybean yield and wue under plastic mulch were significantly higher than under straw mulch the results of this study suggested that the combination of plastic mulch and irrigation water supplied at 70 85 fc could effectively increase the yield and wue of the apple soybean intercropping system keywords agroforestry fruit tree crops intercropping mulch soil water content root distribution 1 introduction agroforestry is an efficient strategy for appropriate and sustainable land use and it integrates the spatial and temporal combination of different species to fully utilize natural resources sun et al 2018a agroforestry plays an important role in controlling soil erosion and alleviating the conflicts between agriculture and forestry tsonkova et al 2012 charbonnier et al 2017 in the past 10 years agroforestry has been widely practiced in the loess area of western shanxi in which apple malus pumila m and soybean glycine max l merr are important economic tree species and food crops due to the poor yield of young apple trees local farmers generally grow soybean as an intercrop for a more efficient use of land and higher economic returns and this system has become the main local agroforestry model yun et al 2012 however western shanxi is chronically short of soil water because of the scarce and unevenly distributed precipitation and groundwater below 50 m depth gao et al 2016 ling et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a in addition a clean cultivation strategy often applied for soil moisture management in the region can not meet the strong soil moisture demand of an intercropping system and is prone to soil erosion and nutrient loss and therefore to lower productivity gao et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 it is therefore necessary to implement effective soil water control strategies to replace the traditional clean cultivation strategy and to make up for its defects soil mulch measures can effectively improve soil physiochemical properties and water conditions thereby promoting plant growth and increasing crop yields vincent caboud et al 2019 mohammad et al 2019 plastic and straw are the most commonly used mulch materials plastic mulch reduces soil surface evaporation by providing a physical barrier and increases soil temperature crop yield and water use efficiency wue xing et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 whereas straw mulch can keep the soil structure loose reduce surface runoff and increase soil infiltration and soil water storage chen et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 yin et al 2015 found that straw mulch increased the wue of the wheat corn intercropping system by 46 however during the vigorous growth period of the apple soybean intercropping system a single mulch measure is unlikely to meet the huge gap between water supply and plant demand zheng et al 2016 it is therefore necessary to combine mulch and irrigation measures to solve the problem of water shortage in the critical growth period of the intercropping system however the water consumption in an intercropping system is not simply the sum of water consumption of two monoculture crops yin et al 2018 2020 the combination of mulch and irrigation has a complex effect on water competition and complementary utilization effects which make soil water a more complicated component of an intercropping system therefore it is necessary to explore the complex interplay between water supply and demand in a fruit tree crops intercropping system served by a combination of mulch and irrigation previous studies have shown that copious amounts of irrigation can alleviate interspecies competition in maize pea intercropping systems under plastic mulch and will increase the yield of both crops zhao et al 2019b in a drip irrigated maize tomato intercropping system with plastic mulch the soil water content swc and root length density rld in the top soil layer increased as the quantity of water supplied increased whereas the rld in the deeper layer 30 100 cm displayed the opposite trend li et al 2017 there were some differences between the tree crops and crops crops intercropping compared with crops the root system of tree has a larger distribution which gives them a strong competitive advantage over water and fertilizer acquisition in tree crops intercropping systems sanchez 1995 however there have been few studies of the fruit tree crops intercropping system under the combination of mulch and irrigation and the mechanism of interspecies interaction is not clearly understood developing implementable and effective measures to increase the moisture retention alleviate underground interspecific competition and improve the wue in the fruit tree crops intercropping system are key issues that need to be solved urgently the main objectives of this study were to investigate 1 the effect of mulch and irrigation regimes on the soil moisture and root distribution of the apple soybean intercropping system and 2 the effect of mulch and irrigation regimes on the yield and wue of the apple soybean intercropping system 2 materials and methods 2 1

maziqu jixian shanxi province the apple trees short branch red fuji had been planted in 2013 and were yet to start bearing fruit they were planted in rows 5 m apart and oriented east west within each row the trees were 4 m apart the average plant height was 3 9 m the diameter at breast height was 7 cm the north south crown width was 3 2 m the east west crown width was 3 6 m and the crown height was 3 2 m soybean jindou no 35 was initially 2017 sown in rows that were 0 9 m from the rows of apple tree and had a spacing of 0 3 0 4 m fig 1 to reduce the competition between apple tree and soybean the spacing of soybean was increased in 2018 and 2019 thus the row spacing between soybean and apple tree rows was 1 0 m and the spacing of soybean was 0 35 0 50 m soybean was sown on april 12 in 2017 april 19 in 2018 and april 22 in 2019 each plot covered 14 m2 and consisted of two apple trees with plot edges 1 0 m away from the trees the sampling points remained the same in all three years of the trial fig 2 before ploughing the following basal dose was applied by spreading fertilizer evenly over the area n 412 4 kg ha 1 p2o5 168 8 kg ha 1 and k2o 168 8 kg ha 1 the experiment consisted of two soil mulches namely straw mulch m1 and plastic mulch m2 and three levels of irrigation the straw mulch was in the form of maize stalks harvested from the previous year which were cut into pieces 5 10 cm long the cut straw was used as mulch between the crop rows after the emergence of soybean the straw mulch was 5 cm thick the plastic film which was of white polyethylene and 0 005 mm thick was applied before sowing soybean two rows of soybean were covered with one sheet of plastic mulch with 60 cm width and 70 cm width in 2017 and in 2018 2019 fig 2 by considering the suitable soil moisture range of apple tree and soybean gao et al 2013 three levels of maximum irrigation were designed 55 w1 70 w2 and 85 w3 of fc because most of the fine roots of young apple tree and soybean are found in the 0 60 cm soil layer sun et al 2018a irrigation was supplied with the aim of wetting that layer the field experiment was laid out in a randomized block design consisting of a total of six combinations of mulch and irrigation levels and three non irrigated controls namely ck0 no mulch ck1 straw mulch and ck2 plastic mulch with three replications a total of 27 plots were included because the apple tree had not begun to produce fruit yet irrigation was provided during the critical growth stages of soybean namely the branching podding and filling stages in 2018 due to abundant precipitation at the podding stage irrigation was withheld in all treatments the swc was determined in each treatment before irrigation and the measurement was then used to calculate the volume of irrigation required to reach the target swc link et al 2015 border irrigation was used to supply water and a water meter was used to control the volume of irrigation a buffer zone 2 m wide was maintained between adjacent plots to prevent any significant water exchange between plots the irrigation quota of the different treatments is shown in table 1 the volume of irrigation water was calculated using the following equation man et al 2014 1 m 10 γ h θ w θ 0 where m is the amount of irrigation water γ is the soil bulk density in the target soil layer h is the depth of the target soil layer θ w is the target soil gravimetric water content and θ 0 is the soil gravimetric water content before irrigation 2 3 data collection and measurements 2 3 1 meteorological measurements precipitation and temperature were monitored by an automatic weather station at 1 h intervals precipitation during the growth period of soybean was 427 6 mm in 2017 398 0 mm in 2018 and 326 3 mm in 2019 precipitation was more evenly distributed during the growth stages in 2017 concentrated mostly during the podding and filling stages in 2018 and concentrated mostly during the maturity stage in 2019 with correspondingly less precipitation during the other growth stages fig 3 by the standards set by the shanxi institute of meteorological sciences 2017 and 2018 were normal water years whereas 2019 was a dry year 2 3 2 soil water measurements the swc of the 0 60 cm soil layer was determined at 10 cm intervals at points 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m from the tree using time domain reflectometry tdr probes trime pico iph imko ettlingen germany fig 2 and gravimetric measurements were used to verify the tdr measurements skaggs et al 2004 measurements were conducted before sowing during the branching podding filling and maturity stages before irrigation and after rainfall 2 3 3 root measurements at the filling stage aug 26 2017 aug 23 2018 and aug 25 2019 roots were sampled using a root drill with a diameter of 10 cm the sampling points were the same as those used for determining swc root samples were collected at 20 cm intervals to the maximum depth of 60 cm root samples were soaked in water for 2 h and roots were separated from the soil by shaking the sieve 0 2 mm mesh and 30 cm diameter the roots of apple trees and soybean were distinguished by their different color apple trees roots were red whereas soybean roots were yellowish after scanning roots with a root scanner rld was estimated by analysing the images of roots using the winrhizo software ver 2003b reagent instruments inc quebec canada 2 3 4 yield measurements grain yield of soybean was determined in plots at maturity stage oct 19 2017 oct 18 2018 and oct 12 2019 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 underground interspecific competition intensity index uicii the intensity of competition for water between the roots of apple tree and soybean was quantified by calculating the degree of overlap between the

used to calculate the et of the apple soybean intercropping system at each growth stage chai et al 2014 3 et 1 2 i p u r f w where et 1 2 is the et mm in each growth period i is the irrigation water volume mm p is the effective precipitation mm u is the amount of groundwater recharge mm r is surface run off f is the amount of deep leakage mm and δw is the difference between soil water storage at the beginning and end of each stage because the experimental field was level the surface run off was assumed to be zero the water table was 50 m below the surface and therefore groundwater recharge of the surface soil layer was also assumed to be zero because the swc at 50 60 cm was less than fc after either each round of irrigation or each spell of rain deep leakage was assumed to be zero thus the values of r u and f were considered to be negligible 2 4 3 water use efficiency wue wue in the intercropping system was expressed as the ratio of soybean yield to et across the intercropping area yan

amount of irrigation water and mulch irrigation interaction on swcs graphs were generated using origin ver 9 0 origin lab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal distribution of soil water in 2017 and 2019 in every treatment the swcs initially decreased and then increased as the crop continued to grow with the minimum swc reached during the podding and filling stages however the opposite trend was observed in 2018 with the maximum swc reached during the podding stage at a given level of irrigation swcs of apple soybean intercropping system under straw mulch was generally higher than that under plastic mulch table 2 mulch irrigation and mulch irrigation interaction had very significant effects p 0 01 on the variation in swcs of the intercropping system fig 4 the swcs of all treatments decreased initially and then increased as the distance from the tree increased during 2017 2019 fig 4 in 2017 the swc was the highest at 0 5 m from the tree and lowest at 1 5 2 0 m in 2018 and 2019 the minimum swc was recorded 1 0 m from the tree with the swc of this area under plastic mulch being less than that under straw mulch this suggested that the location with the highest soil water consumption progressively migrated towards the tree from a distance of 1 5 2 0 m as the intercropping year increased especially under plastic mulch for a given level of irrigation the swcs at various distances from the tree under straw mulch was generally higher than that under plastic mulch under the same mulch the swcs for the different irrigation levels at the same location had not obvious change law during the growth stage the swcs of every treatment increased with depth throughout the entire growth period although the change of swcs in the deeper layer 30 60 cm was smaller than that in the top layer 0 30 cm the magnitude of the change in the top layer was greater in 2018 and 2019 than in 2017 fig 5 at a given level of irrigation the swcs of each layer under straw mulch were generally higher than under plastic mulch during 2017 2019 under the same mulch the swcs of different layers remained unaffected by the level of irrigation except in 2019 when the swcs of different layers under straw mulch was significantly different p 0 05 among the three irrigation levels the swcs of the upper soil 0 30 cm was the highest under the w3 irrigation level while the swc of the subsoil 30 60 cm was the highest under the w2 irrigation level 3 2 spatial distribution of fine roots 3 2 1 apple tree in 2017 2019 the rld of apple tree in each treatment decreased with increasing distance from the tree fig 7 fine roots were confined mainly to the zone 0 5 1 0 m from the tree in 2017 the fine roots in this zone as a proportion of the total roots in the entire zone within a radius of 2 5 m from the tree varied from 52 67 to 91 48 being higher under straw mulch than under plastic mulch the corresponding proportions were 57 70 68 99 in 2018 and 60 74 63 70 in 2019 these values in mulched plots combined with irrigation were only greater than that in ck0 by 6 50 17 41 in 2018 and by 1 00 4 87 in 2019 the combined effect of mulch and irrigation on the horizontal distribution of fine roots decreased with increased planting years in 2017 the fine roots of apple tree from all treatments were mainly confined to the 0 20 cm soil layer but this gradually shifted to the deeper soil layers as the trees grew in 2018 and 2019 fine roots were mainly confined to the 20 40 cm soil layer with the proportion of fine roots in that layer being 35 53 51 15 in 2018 and 40 45 51 80 in 2019 and this proportion increased as the level of irrigation increased for a given quantity of irrigation the rld of apple tree under plastic mulch was higher than that under straw mulch in the 0 60 cm soil layer being 52 62 65 14 in 2017 but only 29 72 38 88 in 2019 fig 6 this indicated that plastic mulch was more conducive to the growth of fine roots although this gap decreased over time without irrigation the rld in ck1 was less than that in ck0 whereas in ck2 the rld was greater than that in ck0 in 2018 and 2019 with the same mulch the rld increased with increased irrigation level but the proportion of fine roots in the zone 1 5 2 5 m from the tree and in the deeper soil layer 40 60 cm decreased as the level of irrigation increased the treatment with the largest rld value in the 0 60 cm soil layer was m2w3 throughout the experiment 3 2 2 soybean throughout the trial and in all treatments the soybean rld in the horizontal direction was smallest at 0 5 m from the tree and the values displayed an increasing trend with increasing distance from the tree although this trend was not significant in 2018 fig 8 in the vertical direction rld decreased sharply as the depth increased the fine roots of soybean were mainly distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer and fine roots in this soil layer as a proportion of all roots in the 0 60 cm soil layer increased with increasing intercropping years being 55 12 64 74 in 2017 67 45 78 36 in 2018 and 71 14 80 62 in 2019 however the rld in the deeper layer 40 60 cm decreased over time although to a lesser extent the rld in ck1 and ck2 was higher than in ck0 compared to the values under straw mulch the rld in the 0 60 cm soil layer under plastic mulch increased by 1 92 9 03 in 2017 1 06 31 88 in 2018 and 5 66 28 23 in 2019 for the same mulch treatments the rld in the 0 60 cm soil layer increased as the level of irrigation increased fig 6 straw and plastic mulch treatments proved superior to ck0 in increasing the proportion of fine roots of soybean in the 0 20 cm soil layer under plastic mulch the proportion of fine roots in the 0 20 cm soil layer increased as the level of irrigation increased whereas the opposite trend was observed under straw mulch in 2018 the rld of soybean in all treatments was generally higher than that in 2017 and 2019 and the maximum rld was observed in m2w3 throughout the experiment 3 2 3 underground interspecific competition intensity index below ground competition between the root systems of apple tree and soybean occurred mainly in the zone 0 5 1 0 m from the tree the uicii was the highest at 0 5 m from the tree and decreased as the distance increased table 3 except for treatment m2w1 the uicii was higher 0 9 for the treatments at 0 5 1 0 m from the tree in 2017 the uicii in ck0 and ck1 at 2 0 2 5 m from the tree was zero showing weak competition in this area the uicii at 0 5 1 0 m was greater than that at 1 5 2 5 m by 30 09 140 14 in 2018 and 29 15 287 01 in 2019 at a given level of irrigation the uicii under straw mulch was generally higher than that under plastic mulch demonstrating a better alleviation of the competition between the underground root systems in the intercropping system by plastic mulch under the same mulch the uicii generally increased as the level of irrigation increased and the phenomenon was more pronounced in 2018 2019 in 2018 and 2019 the uicii for all treatments was weaker than that in ck0 and the uicii was lowest in m2w1 in general the uicii of apple soybean intercropping tended to decrease with increasing planting years and the difference between treatments also decreased the uicii of each treatment in 2019 was significantly lower than that in 2017 except for the m2w2 treatment 3 3 water consumption and soybean yield for a given level of irrigation et soybean yield and wue under plastic mulch were significantly higher p 0 05 than under straw mulch table 4 plastic mulch treatments produced soybean yield was greater by 16 22 34 05 and 32 11 and wue was greater by 13 98 31 40 and 28 22 than straw mulch treatments in 2017 2019 respectively under the same mulch et was positively correlated with the level of irrigation in 2017 and 2018 soybean yield and wue under plastic mulch initially increased and then decreased with the increasing irrigation amount whereas wue under straw mulch was negatively correlated with the irrigation water volume in 2019 soybean yield increased with the increasing irrigation amount and wue under both soil mulches increased and then decreased with increasing irrigation volume in 2017 et and soybean yield from every treatment were significantly higher p 0 05 than in 2018 and 2019 however the soybean yield from each treatment increased most compared to ck0 in 2019 mulch combined with irrigation resulted in the lowest wue in 2018 in 2017 and 2019 the maximum et was observed in the podding filling or filling maturity stages whereas in 2018 the highest et occurred only during the podding filling stage which was much larger than that in other stages the treatment with the highest et throughout the entire growing period was m2w3 in all three years the largest soybean yield was recorded in the m2w2 treatment in 2017 2018 and in the m2w3 treatment in 2019 under straw and plastic mulch wue was lowest when the level of irrigation was highest 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal distribution of soil water mulch measures reduce the evaporation of soil moisture anikwe et al 2007 yu et al 2018 whereas irrigation directly increases the swc at the same time the swc is also affected by the different et of different plant types and the overlapping or non overlapping root systems in different growth periods gao et al 2010 in this study the soil moisture of four consecutive growth periods in the intercropping system was analyzed and it was found that the swcs for each treatment in 2017 and 2019 was smallest during the podding and filling stages but was largest in 2018 during the podding stage table 2 this was likely because the incoming solar radiation was stronger during the podding and filling stages than in other growth periods and apple tree and soybean undergo vigorous growth resulting in higher evapotranspiration in the intercropping system than during the other growth periods however in 2018 32 41 130 1 mm of all precipitation received during the entire growth period was concentrated in the podding stage making the water input of the intercropping system higher than the et and resulting in the highest swc occurring during this stage the swcs for all treatments in 2017 2019 followed a v shaped pattern with distance from the tree and the areas with the lowest swc gradually migrated towards the tree with increasing intercropping years fig 4 however in an earlier study involving a pecan cotton alley cropping system wanvestraut et al 2004 showed that swc increased with incremental distance from the tree this inconsistency was likely attributable to the low et in the region 0 5 1 0 m from the apple tree in the current study this region was completely covered by the crowns of the apple tree with the apple canopy blocking part of the solar radiation thereby reducing the evaporation of soil moisture at the same time the fruit trees were young and their water requirements were small the root system of apple tree can cause a hydraulic lift of the soil moisture from the deeper and wetter soil layer along the gradient of the soil water potential richards and caldwell 1987 thereby increasing the swc near the tree the apple rld at 0 5 1 0 m from the tree increased with planting year fig 7 which accelerated the absorption of soil moisture in this area this process led to the position where the lowest swc shifted toward the tree the apple rld was higher under the plastic mulch than under the straw mulch which led a greater migration of the lowest swc areas towards the tree compared to plastic mulch straw mulch treatments had higher swcs in both the horizontal and vertical directions under the same level of irrigation because plastic mulch maintained a higher soil temperature and available water li et al 2013 it allowed plants to grow more vigorously xing et al 2012 yu et al 2018 with a higher transpiration rate moreover the plastic mulch hindered the contact and infiltration of some precipitation with the soil thus resulting in a lower swc in 2019 the swcs of each layer among the different irrigation levels treated with straw mulch was significantly different and the swc of the upper soil layer 0 30 cm was highest in the w3 treatment whereas the swc of the deeper soil layer 30 60 cm was highest in the w2 treatment fig 5 because of the limited precipitation in 2019 the larger volume of irrigation water in the w3 treatment would make the upper soil layers more humid however this would also lead to an enhanced moisture evaporation from surface soil and water competition between plants in the intercropping system the et in the upper soil layers increased accordingly part of the et in the upper layer was replenished through soil capillary processes from deeper soil layers which led to the deeper soil layer 30 60 cm having a lower swc under the w3 treatment than under the w2 treatment the plastic mulch also effectively reduced soil evaporation which explained the overall insignificant difference in the swcs in each layer between the different irrigation levels 4 2 spatial distribution of fine roots the spatial distribution of the roots of tree and annual crops in an agroforestry system reflects their ability to compete for belowground resources kumar et al 1999 smith et al 1999 the phenotype and distribution of roots are influenced in turn by the availability of water and nutrients in soil adiku et al 2001 jha et al 2017 our study observed that the fine roots of apple tree were mainly distributed in the zone 0 5 1 0 m from the tree and had a tendency to decrease with increasing distance from the tree fig 7 while the soybean roots presented the opposite distribution trend fig 8 this result was consistent with previous findings in a walnut soybean intercropping system as reported by xu et al 2013 the effect of plastic mulch on thermal enhancement and water preservation was better than that of straw mulch and was more conducive to the development of early crop growth and root growth chen et al 2007 therefore compared with the straw mulch treatment the rld of apple tree and soybean was higher under the plastic mulch treatment under the same irrigation level as the apple tree roots gradually grew into the deeper soil layers over time the effect of the mulch on their growth was reduced resulting in a narrowing of the gap between the two types of mulch treatment over time in addition the rld of apple tree and soybean increased with the increase in the amount of irrigation but the proportion of apple tree fine roots in the zone 1 5 2 5 m from the tree and in the 40 60 cm soil layer decreased with the increase in the level of irrigation this was likely attributable to the increased irrigation promoting the growth of soybean roots and the increase in soybean rld then inhibited the growth of apple tree fine roots at 1 5 2 5 m from the tree sun et al 2018b apple tree roots consumed less energy to absorb soil moisture from the shallower layers than deeper soil layers liu et al 2020 more irrigation would increase the moisture content of shallow soil layers which would slow the growth of the fine roots of apple tree in the deeper soil layers therefore fine roots of apple tree were increasingly confined to the zone near the trunk as the volume of irrigation increased the proportion of soybean fine roots in the 0 20 cm soil layer under the plastic mulch increased with the increase in the amount of irrigation but the opposite trend was apparent under the straw mulch this was likely because the physical barrier of the plastic mulch hindered the infiltration of water thereby retaining the irrigation water in the shallow soil layers however the straw mulch had little effect on water infiltration and the soil texture was also looser which facilitated the downward movement of the wetting front of the irrigation water more irrigation thus promoted the growth of the fine roots of soybean in the deeper soil layers thereby lowering their proportion in the surface layer under the straw mulch the proportion of soybean fine roots in the 0 20 cm soil layer under the plastic mulch was higher than that under straw mulch fig 8 it also led to a higher spatial differentiation of fine root niche of component crops distribution under plastic mulch thereby reducing the uicii therefore under the straw mulch the uicii was generally higher than that for the plastic mulch on the other hand higher levels of irrigation also attracted the fine roots of apple tree to the top soil layer thereby intensifying competition in that layer this explains why the uicii increased with increasing irrigation amount agroforestry systems result in strong interspecies competition between trees and annual crops to adapt to the environment fine roots show a strong plasticity and the growth and distribution of roots changes as required zamora et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 given the sufficient soil moisture in the deeper layers and the inherent growth characteristics of apple tree their roots moved deeper over time whereas in soybean mulch and irrigation favored the growth of fine roots in the shallower layers hence the increasing proportion of fine soybean roots in the 0 20 cm layer over time the change in the root distribution of the two species decreased the competition for soil moisture and nutrients wang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 which is why the uicii decreased as the apple tree grew older 4 3 soybean yield and water consumption water absorption by roots is closely related to the rld van noordwijk 1993 lobet et al 2014 ma et al 2019 found that the soil water storage and the rld were negatively correlated in a wheat maize intercropping system at a given level of irrigation the rld in both apple tree and soybean was greater under plastic mulch fig 6 which enabled a greater water uptake by plants leading to a greater et the et of podding filling stage was much higher than other stages in 2018 this phenomenon was different from 2017 and 2019 because of precipitation being concentrated during the podding and filling stages in 2018 resulting in a greater swc than during branching and maturity the higher swc met the water demand for crops growth but also increased evapotranspiration which explains why the maximum et occurred in podding filling stage the soybean yield of the intercropping system in 2017 and 2018 under both mulches increased following irrigation but decreased as the level of irrigation increased this observation was inconsistent with that of zhou et al 2019 who found that in an apple maize intercropping system the maize yield increased as the level of irrigation increased the reason for this discrepancy may be that maize differs in its water consumption characteristics from soybean maize needs more water during the growing period however higher levels of irrigation boosted the physiological activity of soybean and delayed the senescence of leaves and reproductive growth the air temperature in the later growth period decreased thereby slowing down the accumulation of dry matter ultimately resulting in a lower soybean yield the et of the intercropping system was positively correlated with the level of irrigation which is why wue was lowest in the w3 treatment because 2019 was a dry year the low water input increased the positive impact of the mulches on yield qin et al 2015 the increase in the soybean yield of each treatment compared to ck0 was greater in 2019 than in 2017 2018 in 2017 and 2018 the highest soybean yield was obtained in the m2w2 treatment but in 2019 it was obtained from m2w3 in 2017 and 2019 the wue in m2w2 was slightly smaller than that in ck2 whereas in 2018 the same treatment recorded the highest wue the uicii value under plastic mulch was lower than that under straw mulch and under no mulch in summary plastic mulch and 70 85 fc irrigation was the optimum combination for the apple soybean intercropping system in the region 5 conclusions the results from a three year field trial of the apple soybean intercropping system suggested that compared to straw mulch plastic mulch had higher soil moisture consumption with lower swcs in both the horizontal and vertical directions moreover plastic mulch increased the extent of the shift in the location of the minimum swc in the horizontal direction towards the tree plastic mulch also proved more conducive to the growth of the fine roots of apple tree and soybean than straw mulch and the rld in both species was positively correlated to the level of irrigation soybean roots under plastic mulch tended to converge in the top soil layer as the amount of irrigation water increased but the opposite trend was observed under straw mulch which was not conducive to the separation of the apple tree and soybean root niches therefore the combination of plastic mulch and irrigation strategies was more conducive to the alleviation of competition among species the et soybean yield and wue were significantly higher under plastic mulch than straw mulch in 2017 and 2018 the highest soybean yield was recorded in the m2w2 treatment whereas in 2019 it was recorded in m2w3 and it had a higher wue and a lower uicii value therefore to increase the yield and wue of the apple soybean intercropping system in the loess gully area of western shanxi and to ease the interspecies competition in the intercropping system it is recommended to adopt a combination of plastic mulch and 70 85 fc maximum irrigation declaration of

10213,increasing agricultural water use eﬃciency wue and water productivity wp is imperative to alleviate water scarcity and achieve sustainable agriculture in inland river basins the confusion on the use of the two indicators at demarcated scales in this issue has been addressed analysis of the literature however lacks evaluation of the most proper management scale the heihe river basin hrb in china was selected as the study area and wue and wp were calculated spatially at the field crop irrigation district and county scales using the remote sensing based evapotranspiration et grid rainfall land use and statistical data in addition the most proper management scale was firstly evaluated by comparing wue and wp based on statistical properties and spatial distributions the results show that higher wue and wp were observed at the field crop scale the differences between wue and wp are significant at field crop scale but the gap narrows with increasing spatial scale spatial analysis reveals that wp was higher in the plain oasis area and lower in the mountainous and desert oasis area among three scales the wue and wp are relatively lower and the variances of them are relatively larger at the irrigation district scale wue ranges from 0 1 to 0 85 mean 0 34 and wp varies from 0 08 kg m3 to 0 8 kg m3 mean 0 48 kg m3 across irrigation districts in the whole basin the large differences indicate the presence of a tremendous management gap among irrigation districts we thus declare that mesoscale views are more suitable and irrigation district scale is the most proper management scale for resolving water resource utilization problems in arid river basins further agricultural water management at the irrigation district scale should target at improving irrigation technology and adjusting crop structure keywords water use efficiency water productivity optimum management scale irrigated agriculture river basin 1 introduction achieving water savings in existing

agriculture is the major user of water resources worldwide by consuming about 70 of total withdrawn water fao 2017 this figure is still rising as un reports forecast that water demand is projected to grow more than 40 to feed 9 8 billion people by 2050 wwdr 2017 climate change has further aggravated the frequency and intensity of droughts and led to the declining stock of freshwater resources in the past decades cai et al 2003 grafton et al 2013 huang et al 2016 gleick 2018 despite the major reduction and rising demand for freshwater resources the efficiency of irrigation water use remains very low and the performance of water management schemes is far from satisfactory rosegrant et al 2009 bakker 2012 dalin et al 2015 the situation is even worse in most inland river basins with intensive irrigated agriculture cheng et al 2014 many countries have implemented target water resources assessment management regimes yet agricultural water management still faces challenges arising from the fact that problems practices and objectives differ from different management scales wue and wp are two widely used indicators of decision making in agricultural water management they are designed to facilitate the allocation of water resources in river basins but lay on different circumstances wue the ratio of effective water demand to water use is more reliant on natural processes and therefore is feasible for crop and field irrigation water management molden et al 1998 cai et al 2003 levidow et al 2014 wp represents the output or income per unit of water resource which is a relatively comprehensive performance term at different management scales and is widely used in an optimal allocation of water resources in socio economic systems kassam et al 2007 bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 comas et al 2019 it is increasingly recognized that the relationship between agricultural water use and the overall wue or wp is crucial for guiding water resources management an accurate

techniques garcia et al 2014 liu et al 2016 ma et al 2018 the field measurement is point specific which lacks spatial information on water resources and the upscaling of the et components to district or basin scale is infeasible considering the spatial variance of soil irrigation crop pattern droogers et al 2010 hu and jia 2015 xu et al 2019 et measurement through remote sensing techniques based on uniform analytical procedures gives a spatial and temporal variation of water requirements thus has wider applicability among different spatial scales droogers et al 2010 cammalleri et al 2013 garcia et al 2014 gao et al 2017 given the large amounts of water involved even small changes in agricultural wue and wp could have large implications for local water budgets jensen 2007 eliasson 2015 perry et al 2017 grafton et al 2018 therefore the high spatial and temporal resolution of et is needed to quantify wue and wp whereas due to the technical limitations that available remote sensing data cannot fulfill high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution simultaneously xu et al 2019 the integration of multi source data has been proposed as an effective way to obtain high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution et efficiency and productivity analysis related to multiple scales and users is the prerequisite to realize reasonable water use the two terms involve a wide range of disciplines including hydrology irrigation engineering agronomy and economics berbel and mateos 2014 torres et al 2016 previously published studies show that both of the two terms are widely applied at different scales including crop level irrigation districts basin to the whole country heydari 2014 du et al 2018 fan et al 2018 lee and jung 2018 yu et al 2020 overall these studies reflect on important implications on how to manage water at different perspectives eg closing agricultural yield gaps through engineering methods du et al 2018 blango et al 2019 seeking the highest economic value of water use wang et al 2015 parihar et al 2016 araya et al 2019 updating of irrigation technology xue and ren 2016 zhang et al 2019 raising agriculture water price and so on huang et al 2010 doeffinger and hall 2020 however they were based on different disciplines and likely to cause confusion which will lead to improper management decisions existing literature has increasingly considered the scale effect when estimating the efficiency and productivity of irrigation water zwart et al 2010 wichelns 2014 attar et al 2020 however the level of aggregation of most analyses do not allow a universal conclusion to be drawn specifically for the arid and semi arid regions empirical studies have provided detailed analyses of the applicability of wue and wp at the crop district basin and county level gleick et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 paredes et al 2018 ahn et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however there is still lack of consensus on the suitability of the two indicators and how they should be used pereira et al 2012 fernández et al 2020 for example adoption of an advanced irrigation system is supposed to be the most efficient way to improve wue and wp at the crop and district level whereas there is little or no benefit when this shift to the basin or county scale loeve et al 2004 cai et al 2011 grafton et al 2018 nevertheless the above studies relied mostly on qualitative analysis so far no work has yet presented a quantitative evaluation framework of wue and wp that accounts for the optimum management scale issues aiming to determine the most proper management scale and strengthen decision making in agricultural water management our study develop a uniform analytical framework for evaluation of wue and wp based on spatial land surface data with socio economic analysis the purposes of this paper are 1 to calculate and assess wue and wp indicators at field crop irrigation district and county scales respectively in the heihe river basin 2 to evaluate the most proper management scale in agriculture management decision making based on statistic properties and spatial distributions of these two indicators 3 to formulate rational strategies for improving the agricultural water management in the arid and semi arid regions this study innovatively proposes a quantitative evaluation framework by calculating the dual objectives of wue and wp at different management scales to find the most proper management scale in agricultural water management the proposed evaluation framework helps to make solid conclusions on the relationship between management scale and water use parameters including wue and wp the results can provide scientific support for agricultural water resources management in the hrb and the proposed evaluation framework and specific findings will also be applicable to other arid and semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hrb the second largest inland river basin in china originates from qilian mountains and ends in lake juyanhai in inner mongolia it can be divided into three major geomorphological units including the upper reaches the southern qilian mountains the middle reaches the hexi corridor and the lower reaches the northern alxa high plain zhangye city one of the prefectural cities of gansu province is located in the middle reaches and covers an area of 42 000 km2 with six counties in its governance including ganzhou shandan minle gaotai linze and sunan county zhangye is a typical arid to semi arid region with mean annual precipitation ranges from less than 100 250 mm and the annual potential evaporation is 1 400 mm soil moisture stresses are therefore common without irrigation as an important agricultural production base zhangye city occupies 95 of cultivated land 2 668 km2 91 of the population and more than 80 of gdp in hrb it is also one of the 12 key national commercial grain bases with wheat corn rice oilseed rape flax and other crops wheat and maize production account for almost 90 of cropland irrigation agriculture is the largest user of water there accounting for nearly 90 of total water use inefficient irrigation methods such as flood and furrow irrigation are still the main irrigation schemes in this region the average efficiency of irrigation systems here is far below the national level 40 vs 65 wang et al 2015 the ecological water diversion project ewdp was implemented in 2000 in hrb by diverting 0 95 billion cubic meters of water to downstream to restore the ecological environment li et al 2018 the water left for the middle reaches of hrb is greatly reduced leading to the excessive exploitation of groundwater there are more than 4000 pumping wells distributed in the middle reaches of hrb over pumping of groundwater has led to deterioration of ecosystem in the middle hrb to resolve the water conflicts in hrb it is necessary to examine wue and wp at different hydrologic domains to achieve sustainable water resource utilization 2 2 data resources different sources of data including remote sensing based evapotranspiration et data grid rainfall data crop distribution and statistical data were used to spatially evaluate wue and wp in hrb the land surface et was calculated with the revised surface energy balance system sebs model considering that remote sensing data have different spatial and temporal resolutions where the high spatial resolution and time resolution are incompatible at present the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data with high temporal resolution and the fine spatial resolution landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm data were fused to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution et ma et al 2018 data were collected during the crop growth period april to october in 2012 the detailed information of the sebs model and et data acquirement procedure can be found in liu et al 2016 precipitation data were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn to ensure spatial consistency we interpolated the 0 5 0 5 lattice dataset into 1 km monthly precipitation data by the spatial interpolation software anusplin the average precipitation in the middle reaches of hrb was about 234 mm and gradually decreased from the qilian mountain in the south to the corridor plain fig 1b the spatial distribution of crops is needed to figure out irrigation water demand by agriculture the land use data of hrb in 2012 were interpreted from hj ccd imagery in addition to the traditional land use category the detailed crop classification was added to the cultivated land area based on field survey data crop information such as barley wheat corn oilseed rape alfalfa and cotton was included fig 1c the field survey was conducted in august 2014 in 24 irrigation districts in the middle reaches of hrb stratified random sampling was conducted to get the samples for every land cover type in all about 400 crop plots covering 16 kinds of crops were investigated they were used as validation samples in land cover mapping of different crop types besides the detailed input output information and the irrigation ways and amount of irrigation water applied to the selected plots were also collected through household interviews the accuracy of land cover use mapping was evaluated with samples collected from field surveys and the high spatial resolution remote sensing data within google earth by computing the validation confusion matrix a very high mapping accuracy of 94 1 and a high kappa coefficient of 0 9423 were observed which showed a very high mapping accuracy of the classification socio economic data and other statistical data were collected from the statistical year book of zhangye zhangye statistical bureau 2000 information on irrigation water plan and irrigation for each irrigation district were collected from local water resource bureaus irrigation water management at the farm level was explored via household surveys including the input output of agriculture production and water consumption by different crops gis shapefiles used for deriving and calculation of et and rainfall at different scales were collected from environmental and ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china http westdc westgis ac cn 2 3 definition of water use efficiency and water productivity water use efficiency is represented as the fraction of water beneficially used over total water applied burt et al 1997 perry 2007 from the perspective of individual crops it is usually defined as the ratio of crop water demand to total water applied in a sense where et plays a decisive role in determining the amount of irrigation water for different crops the actual crop water demand can be obtained from crop et c minus rain supplement p during its growth period and water use can be represented by irrigation water quota q c at the district level wue of district i wue i known as the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water is represented as the ratio of the amount of effectively used irrigation water we i to the amount of water withdrawn from rivers or aquifers including surface water and groundwater withdrawal i for district i wue at the county scale wue b can be represented by the amount of effectively used agricultural water et minus rain to the total agricultural water used wp provides a notion and attributes a specific value of the productivity of water that can be optimized wp of a specific crop can be represented as the ratio of yield to et alpha it is much more a biophysical index of crop characteristics at the irrigation district wp can be denoted as the agricultural output per cubic meter of water extracted at the county scale wp is the contribution of water to regional agricultural output wp can also be applied in a wider sense by attributing different values to the numerator this is commonly done in water evaluation approaches where economic attributes can be given in monetary terms dinar 1993 molden et al 2010 economic wp provides a tool to attribute value and productivity to all water uses and users in a hydrological domain not only those pertaining to irrigated agriculture it quantifies and qualifies the potential to raise the productivity of low value water use cells to those of similar water use in high value cells or to transform low value water uses into high economic water uses the combination of these two indicators is a necessity to make a more scientific and strategic decision in water resource management fernández et al 2020 wue and wp evaluated at different scales are listed in table 1 3 spatial distribution of et and effective irrigation water demand based on the revised sebs model et for the hrb during the crop growth period was obtained the schematic diagram of et in hrb was shown in fig 1a the average maximum and minimum values of main physical parameters and et data in irrigated areas were calculated based on spatial techniques for the whole hrb et varied from 0 to 794 mm which generally decreased with increasing elevation et above an elevation of 4500 m was quite small due to the relatively low temperature cropland interpreted from remote sensing imagery showed that maize cultivation prevails in the study area with a planting area of 1979 km2 which was widely distributed in ganzhou linze and gaotai county fig 1c followed were wheat and barley that were mainly planted in the high altitude low temperature regions of minle and shandan county the estimated average et of farmland was about 467 mm et for different crops namely et c was determined as follows first spatial correlation between crop sample and et data was conducted to obtain the et of each crop sample and then was further averaged to obtain the mean et of each crop during the growth period et for maize and wheat was within the range of 490 694 mm and 303 514 mm with an average of 528 mm and 373 mm respectively in the growing season fig 2 among all the crops maize had the largest et during the growth period it was similar to the results from li et al 2016 where the estimated et for irrigated maize in hrb was 496 600 mm by aquacrop model and 545 691 mm from jiang et al 2015 by swap epic model effective irrigation water demand is an important indicator for irrigators or managers to resort to a more efficient irrigation plan the spatial distribution of effective irrigation water demand determined by et and precipitation was depicted in fig 3 hot spots of crop effective irrigation water demand mainly distributed in the middle reach of hrb where maize occupies most of the planting area we also noticed that the average effective irrigation water demands by maize barley and wheat were 317 mm 287 mm and 275 mm respectively demonstrating that maize needs more irrigation water during the growing season considering that the annual precipitation in the farmland area was about 234 mm which is about half of et it can be noticed that crop growth was largely dependent on irrigation in the middle reaches of hrb according to the annual report of water conservancy management of zhangye city in 2012 the average irrigation water depth to unit planting area in the study area was about 583 mm and the estimated irrigation water consumption of wheat and maize during the growth period was about 6 000 m3 ha and 9 000 m3 ha respectively when compared with the estimated effective irrigation water demand it can be inferred that irrigation water use in hrb was far exceeding the actual water demand 4 wue and wp at the different scales based on crop et precipitation and crop yield above wue and wp for different crops in the study area were obtained wues for maize wheat and barley are 0 74 0 73 and 0 56 respectively fig 4 as the main crop in the study area wue of maize was far lower than those of wheat and barley taking into account the large planting area of maize in the hrb there was still space to reduce irrigation water use by improving wue of maize the yield of different crops also showed strong spatial variation fig 5 high yield mainly occurred in the middle reaches of hrb where maize occupies most of the cropland according to the statistical data collected from zhangye statistical bureau the output of maize accounted for 62 of the total agricultural output in the middle hrb the average yield of maize was 560 kg ha which was almost twice those of wheat and barley wp of the main crops was determined by the yield and effective irrigation water demand results from our analysis showed that wp of maize was high and varied from 1 5 kg m3 to 2 0 kg m3 and wp of wheat was about 1 20 kg m3 taking into account the sales prices of different crops the economic wps of maize wheat and barley were 4 2 yuan m3 3 0 yuan m3 and 2 8 yuan m3 respectively fig 4 it can be seen that though the wue of maize was low among the three crops the economic wp was much higher than the other two crops it implies that crop price needs to be considered with wue improvement to enhance economic wp for different crops irrigation districts are the basic units for agricultural water resource allocation and irrigation plan making in china the spatial differences of wue and wp were large among irrigation districts table 2 wues of the 24 main irrigation districts ranged from 0 1 to 0 85 with a mean average of 0 34 and wp varied from 0 08 kg m3 to 0 89 kg m3 with a mean average of 0 48 kg m3 wue was minimized in the pingchuan irrigation district in linze county and maximized in the tongziba irrigation district in minle county both the highest wp 0 89 kg m3 for huazhai and lowest wp 0 088 kg m3 for xijun appeared in ganzhou district wp was relatively low for irrigation districts located in gaotai county this was consistent with results from li et al 2017 where water productivity in the irrigated areas of the middle hrb was spatially varied and quite small due to excessive irrigation water use wue and wp were much dependable on water withdrawal at the irrigation districts water withdrawal density namely water withdrawal per unit area was spatially different among the irrigation districts table 2 irrigation districts with a large amount of water withdrawal were mainly located on the two sides of heihe river mainstream including pingchuan yanuan and banqiao irrigation districts in linze county and xijun and yingke irrigation districts located in ganzhou district water withdrawal density was less than 600 mm in tongziba huazhai hongshuihe irrigation districts which were all located far from the mainstream the largest water withdrawal density was 2 047 mm in the pingchuan irrigation district it was almost 4 8 times the water withdrawal in sigou irrigation district from the statistical data collected from the water resources bulletin of zhangye city the total water consumption was 1 9 billion m3 for all districts and the average irrigation water use was about 6 930 m3 per ha at the district level this figure was smaller than the water quota applied at the field scale the gap between actual water used at the field and the district scale was substantially due to the influence of the hydrological process in irrigation previous researches showed that deep percolation loss and canal conveyance loss accounted for 40 of the total water use in the hrb jiang et al 2015 to evaluate water consumption and economic productivity in the whole middle reaches we extended our study from the typical districts to the county scales for the whole basin as for the counties wues of shandan county and minle county were 0 62 and 0 71 respectively which were higher than those of ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county table 3 the result was in accordance with the findings at the district scale where wue of mountainous areas was higher than that of flood plain areas besides the average wue and wp at the county scale were higher than that of the district scale according to the discharge data collected at yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge the volume of water flows through the two gorges was 1 93 billion and 1 11 billion m3 respectively implying the water consumed in the whole middle reaches of hrb was 0 82 billion m3 regardless of rain supplement according to the statistical data the grain yield of the whole middle reaches was 1 12 million tons with an economic output of 6 8 billion yuan the produced value of each drop in the economic system of the whole basin was only 58 yuan m3 which was far below the national average of 105 yuan m3 economic wp varies greatly among regions due to the regional industry structure fig 6 economic wp of jiayuguan was 480 yuan m3 whereas the economic wps of gaotai county linze county minle county jinta county and ganzhou district is lower than 50 yuan m3 the large discrepancy was mainly attributed to the agriculture dominant industry structure where agriculture was centered in the middle reaches of hrb for example ganzhou district accounted for 26 of agricultural output in the whole basin with a planting area of 61 ha followed by jinta county linze county and gaotai county with the proportion of agricultural output exceeding 30 of the regional gdp to discuss the variations of water management indicators among three scales wue and wp were compared and analyzed here as shown in fig 7 the annual average values of both wue and wp were relatively lower and the variances of them were relatively larger at the irrigation district scale fig 7a as fig 7b shows unlike county and field crop scales the irrigation district scale exhibited the heterogeneous values between wue and wp interestingly higher agricultural wue than wp was only observed at the county scale fig 7b it may be attributed to the low economic outputs for agricultural products such as the sales prices of crops compared to the low wue in some irrigation districts the consistent wue and wp in other districts may be due to their abundant groundwater groundwater was proven to contribute more than 16 of regional et for the irrigation district attar et al 2020 from the statistics it can be seen that decision making on management at irrigation districts scale can improve efficient uses of water in agriculture from the perspective of wue and wp when evaluating water resource use from the perspective of mean wue ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 at three scales crop structure and efficiency of irrigation process are important directions of agricultural water saving in irrigation management 5 discussion the aim of delineating the utility of wue and wp at demarcated scales in resolving irrigation water scarcity problems is to guide the formulation of agricultural water management strategies in arid and semi arid river basins the purpose of this study is to calculate the dual objectives of wue and wp at the field crop irrigation district and county scales to evaluate the optimal water management scale for agricultural areas researchers have addressed the theoretical utility of efficiency and productivity depending on the scales of analysis and comparison of a single type of indicators among different scales in management decisions cai et al 2011 wichelns 2014 li et al 2017 fernández et al 2020 however less attention has been paid to the evaluation and validation of the most proper management scale on relevant indicators for agricultural water resources results from our analysis show that wue ranges from 0 1 to 0 85 mean 0 34 and wp varies from 0 08 kg m3 to 0 8 kg m3 mean 0 48 kg m3 across irrigation districts in the whole basin the large differences indicate the presence of a tremendous management gap among irrigation districts therefore mesoscale views were considered more suitable for detecting the problem of water resource utilization in some irrigation districts that s to say policymakers should emphasize irrigation district management and irrigation district managers should make specific decisions for different irrigation districts aiming to improve the efficiency of the irrigation process a popular intervention is the provision of support for transitioning to drip irrigation which outperforms furrow irrigation and flood irrigation during the past years the local government has put many efforts into irrigation facility construction such as canal lining water conservancy facility upgrading and metering equipment installation and the canal systems and water conservancy facilities have been greatly improved whereas several studies have shown that such interventions do not necessarily provide real water savings jensen 2007 van halsema and vincent 2012 grafton et al 2018 adjustment of the corresponding crop structures to achieve water saving and economic objectives is preferred in irrigation districts from statistical data of agriculture production collected in zhangye city it can be found that the total applied irrigation water in hrb increased by 8 8 from 2007 to 2012 crop transformation and cultivated land expansion contributed to 23 and 77 of the total change respectively where the grain crop ratio diminished and the economic crop ratio rose li et al 2018 however though economic crops consume less water than maize and other grains the slack market demand and the lack of comparative advantage restricted the adjustment of regional planting structure different from previous researches we do not observe the increment effect of wue and wp as research scales increase in our study wue at the field crop scale 0 70 is higher than that at the district scale 0 34 the explanation about the conclusion that wue is greater at larger scales eg from field scale to the district scale usually lies in that water withdrawn from a water source is returned to the hydrologic system ma et al 2018 whereas the main problem associated with the conclusion is that it only takes into account the unique hydrologic and physical characteristics of water resources however the factors contributing to the differences of wue and wp at different scales are complex including not only hydrological circle but also climate condition planting structure and management system previous researches show that temperature and precipitation in the past three decades jointly enhanced crop wue by 8 1 30 6 in hrb jiang et al 2015 xue et al 2017 from this perspective the evaluation of wue and wp needs to be diverted from the process based technical engineering system to the management scheme and policy dimension to simulate more accurately the regional crop water consumption and wue a more detailed investigation of the soil the regional distribution of crop types irrigation scheduling is required the results in this study still need further verification because of the uncertainties associated with the estimation of wue and wp parts of the uncertainties arise from the estimation of et though et was estimated based on high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing data in this research the uncertainties associated with model inputs and parameterizations will lead to estimation error kustas et al 2016 as researches showed that the rmse values of daily et vary from 0 5 to 1 0 mm day at the field scale cammalleri et al 2013 ma et al 2018 besides exchanges between the surface water and groundwater will potentially influence soil moisture and thus will lead to the change of wue whereas this is not discussed in this paper for it calls for the support of hydrological models which are too complicated to be conducted here whereas the limitations do not prevent this research from providing a conceptual framework for the measurement of wue and wp and enhancing our understanding of water consumption at different scales in such a complex river basin 6 conclusions this study evaluates the most proper management scale for the efficiency and productivity of irrigation water achieving water savings in existing use through the increase in wue and wp in agriculture has been suggested as the most available path to solving the water dispute in inland river basins the literature shows confusion and a lack of consensus on the use of indicators at different scales and supports irrigation water management strategies separately at the crop regional or irrigation scheme scale yet to the most proper of our knowledge few studies have emphasized on which management scale is the most appropriate for irrigation agriculture in arid and semi arid areas therefore this study provides new insight into evaluating the most proper management scale for the limited water resources by proposing a comprehensive comparison between wue and wp the heihe river basin in china is regarded as an ideal case study due to water scarcity large agricultural water consumption and low beneficial water use fraction to maximize economic and social welfare for the whole basin the two indicators should be combined to make more informative water management decisions we found that the two indicators of wue and wp perform differently at different spatial scales when assessing water resource use combining wue and wp our findings show that these two indicators are significantly different and heterogeneous at the irrigation district scale the large differences indicate the presence of a tremendous management gap among irrigation districts this implies to consider the irrigation scale as the most proper management scale on irrigation water resources which policymakers should target irrigation technology and spatial crop structure are important directions of agricultural water management at the irrigation district scale however the jevons paradox phenomenon should be taken care of in the adoption of irrigation technology to avoid expanding of agriculture as declared by many researchers the water price instrument based on the market mechanism can help regulate the extravagant water consumption and promote water conservation and the rational allocation of water resources in the future a properly functioning water market accompanied with clearly defined and legally enforceable water rights is the guarantee for water resources to flow successfully from agricultural to nonagricultural sectors the discrepancy of water utilization goals at different management scales calls for the comprehensive evaluation of wue and wp at different management scales this study can be used as a reference in agricultural water resources management for other arid and semi arid river basins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

10213,increasing agricultural water use eﬃciency wue and water productivity wp is imperative to alleviate water scarcity and achieve sustainable agriculture in inland river basins the confusion on the use of the two indicators at demarcated scales in this issue has been addressed analysis of the literature however lacks evaluation of the most proper management scale the heihe river basin hrb in china was selected as the study area and wue and wp were calculated spatially at the field crop irrigation district and county scales using the remote sensing based evapotranspiration et grid rainfall land use and statistical data in addition the most proper management scale was firstly evaluated by comparing wue and wp based on statistical properties and spatial distributions the results show that higher wue and wp were observed at the field crop scale the differences between wue and wp are significant at field crop scale but the gap narrows with increasing spatial scale spatial analysis reveals that wp was higher in the plain oasis area and lower in the mountainous and desert oasis area among three scales the wue and wp are relatively lower and the variances of them are relatively larger at the irrigation district scale wue ranges from 0 1 to 0 85 mean 0 34 and wp varies from 0 08 kg m3 to 0 8 kg m3 mean 0 48 kg m3 across irrigation districts in the whole basin the large differences indicate the presence of a tremendous management gap among irrigation districts we thus declare that mesoscale views are more suitable and irrigation district scale is the most proper management scale for resolving water resource utilization problems in arid river basins further agricultural water management at the irrigation district scale should target at improving irrigation technology and adjusting crop structure keywords water use efficiency water productivity optimum management scale irrigated agriculture river basin 1 introduction achieving water savings in existing use through the increase of water use eﬃciency wue and water productivity wp in agriculture has been suggested as the most available path to solving the water dispute in inland river basins irrigated agriculture is the major user of water resources worldwide by consuming about 70 of total withdrawn water fao 2017 this figure is still rising as un reports forecast that water demand is projected to grow more than 40 to feed 9 8 billion people by 2050 wwdr 2017 climate change has further aggravated the frequency and intensity of droughts and led to the declining stock of freshwater resources in the past decades cai et al 2003 grafton et al 2013 huang et al 2016 gleick 2018 despite the major reduction and rising demand for freshwater resources the efficiency of irrigation water use remains very low and the performance of water management schemes is far from satisfactory rosegrant et al 2009 bakker 2012 dalin et al 2015 the situation is even worse in most inland river basins with intensive irrigated agriculture cheng et al 2014 many countries have implemented target water resources assessment management regimes yet agricultural water management still faces challenges arising from the fact that problems practices and objectives differ from different management scales wue and wp are two widely used indicators of decision making in agricultural water management they are designed to facilitate the allocation of water resources in river basins but lay on different circumstances wue the ratio of effective water demand to water use is more reliant on natural processes and therefore is feasible for crop and field irrigation water management molden et al 1998 cai et al 2003 levidow et al 2014 wp represents the output or income per unit of water resource which is a relatively comprehensive performance term at different management scales and is widely used in an optimal allocation of water resources in socio economic systems kassam et al 2007 bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 comas et al 2019 it is increasingly recognized that the relationship between agricultural water use and the overall wue or wp is crucial for guiding water resources management an accurate estimate of land surface evapotranspiration et is a scientific basis for the quantification of wue and wp there are two broad ways for assessing et including field experiments and remote sensing techniques garcia et al 2014 liu et al 2016 ma et al 2018 the field measurement is point specific which lacks spatial information on water resources and the upscaling of the et components to district or basin scale is infeasible considering the spatial variance of soil irrigation crop pattern droogers et al 2010 hu and jia 2015 xu et al 2019 et measurement through remote sensing techniques based on uniform analytical procedures gives a spatial and temporal variation of water requirements thus has wider applicability among different spatial scales droogers et al 2010 cammalleri et al 2013 garcia et al 2014 gao et al 2017 given the large amounts of water involved even small changes in agricultural wue and wp could have large implications for local water budgets jensen 2007 eliasson 2015 perry et al 2017 grafton et al 2018 therefore the high spatial and temporal resolution of et is needed to quantify wue and wp whereas due to the technical limitations that available remote sensing data cannot fulfill high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution simultaneously xu et al 2019 the integration of multi source data has been proposed as an effective way to obtain high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution et efficiency and productivity analysis related to multiple scales and users is the prerequisite to realize reasonable water use the two terms involve a wide range of disciplines including hydrology irrigation engineering agronomy and economics berbel and mateos 2014 torres et al 2016 previously published studies show that both of the two terms are widely applied at different scales including crop level irrigation districts basin to the whole country heydari 2014 du et al 2018 fan et al 2018 lee and jung 2018 yu et al 2020 overall these studies reflect on important implications on how to manage water at different perspectives eg closing agricultural yield gaps through engineering methods du et al 2018 blango et al 2019 seeking the highest economic value of water use wang et al 2015 parihar et al 2016 araya et al 2019 updating of irrigation technology xue and ren 2016 zhang et al 2019 raising agriculture water price and so on huang et al 2010 doeffinger and hall 2020 however they were based on different disciplines and likely to cause confusion which will lead to improper management decisions existing literature has increasingly considered the scale effect when estimating the efficiency and productivity of irrigation water zwart et al 2010 wichelns 2014 attar et al 2020 however the level of aggregation of most analyses do not allow a universal conclusion to be drawn specifically for the arid and semi arid regions empirical studies have provided detailed analyses of the applicability of wue and wp at the crop district basin and county level gleick et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 paredes et al 2018 ahn et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however there is still lack of consensus on the suitability of the two indicators and how they should be used pereira et al 2012 fernández et al 2020 for example adoption of an advanced irrigation system is supposed to be the most efficient way to improve wue and wp at the crop and district level whereas there is little or no benefit when this shift to the basin or county scale loeve et al 2004 cai et al 2011 grafton et al 2018 nevertheless the above studies relied mostly on qualitative analysis so far no work has yet presented a quantitative evaluation framework of wue and wp that accounts for the optimum management scale issues aiming to determine the most proper management scale and strengthen decision making in agricultural water management our study develop a uniform analytical framework for evaluation of wue and wp based on spatial land surface data with socio economic analysis the purposes of this paper are 1 to calculate and assess wue and wp indicators at field crop irrigation district and county scales respectively in the heihe river basin 2 to evaluate the most proper management scale in agriculture management decision making based on statistic properties and spatial distributions of these two indicators 3 to formulate rational strategies for improving the agricultural water management in the arid and semi arid regions this study innovatively proposes a quantitative evaluation framework by calculating the dual objectives of wue and wp at different management scales to find the most proper management scale in agricultural water management the proposed evaluation framework helps to make solid conclusions on the relationship between management scale and water use parameters including wue and wp the results can provide scientific support for agricultural water resources management in the hrb and the proposed evaluation framework and specific findings will also be applicable to other arid and semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hrb the second largest inland river basin in china originates from qilian mountains and ends in lake juyanhai in inner mongolia it can be divided into three major geomorphological units including the upper reaches the southern qilian mountains the middle reaches the hexi corridor and the lower reaches the northern alxa high plain zhangye city one of the prefectural cities of gansu province is located in the middle reaches and covers an area of 42 000 km2 with six counties in its governance including ganzhou shandan minle gaotai linze and sunan county zhangye is a typical arid to semi arid region with mean annual precipitation ranges from less than 100 250 mm and the annual potential evaporation is 1 400 mm soil moisture stresses are therefore common without irrigation as an important agricultural production base zhangye city occupies 95 of cultivated land 2 668 km2 91 of the population and more than 80 of gdp in hrb it is also one of the 12 key national commercial grain bases with wheat corn rice oilseed rape flax and other crops wheat and maize production account for almost 90 of cropland irrigation agriculture is the largest user of water there accounting for nearly 90 of total water use inefficient irrigation methods such as flood and furrow irrigation are still the main irrigation schemes in this region the average efficiency of irrigation systems here is far below the national level 40 vs 65 wang et al 2015 the ecological water diversion project ewdp was implemented in 2000 in hrb by diverting 0 95 billion cubic meters of water to downstream to restore the ecological environment li et al 2018 the water left for the middle reaches of hrb is greatly reduced leading to the excessive exploitation of groundwater there are more than 4000 pumping wells distributed in the middle reaches of hrb over pumping of groundwater has led to deterioration of ecosystem in the middle hrb to resolve the water conflicts in hrb it is necessary to examine wue and wp at different hydrologic domains to achieve sustainable water resource utilization 2 2 data resources different sources of data including remote sensing based evapotranspiration et data grid rainfall data crop distribution and statistical data were used to spatially evaluate wue and wp in hrb the land surface et was calculated with the revised surface energy balance system sebs model considering that remote sensing data have different spatial and temporal resolutions where the high spatial resolution and time resolution are incompatible at present the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data with high temporal resolution and the fine spatial resolution landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm data were fused to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution et ma et al 2018 data were collected during the crop growth period april to october in 2012 the detailed information of the sebs model and et data acquirement procedure can be found in liu et al 2016 precipitation data were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn to ensure spatial consistency we interpolated the 0 5 0 5 lattice dataset into 1 km monthly precipitation data by the spatial interpolation software anusplin the average precipitation in the middle reaches of hrb was about 234 mm and gradually decreased from the qilian mountain in the south to the corridor plain fig 1b the spatial distribution of crops is needed to figure out irrigation water demand by agriculture the land use data of hrb in 2012 were interpreted from hj ccd imagery in addition to the traditional land use category the detailed crop classification was added to the cultivated land area based on field survey data crop information such as barley wheat corn oilseed rape alfalfa and cotton was included fig 1c the field survey was conducted in august 2014 in 24 irrigation districts in the middle reaches of hrb stratified random sampling was conducted to get the samples for every land cover type in all about 400 crop plots covering 16 kinds of crops were investigated they were used as validation samples in land cover mapping of different crop types besides the detailed input output information and the irrigation ways and amount of irrigation water applied to the selected plots were also collected through household interviews the accuracy of land cover use mapping was evaluated with samples collected from field surveys and the high spatial resolution remote sensing data within google earth by computing the validation confusion matrix a very high mapping accuracy of 94 1 and a high kappa coefficient of 0 9423 were observed which showed a very high mapping accuracy of the classification socio economic data and other statistical data were collected from the statistical year book of zhangye zhangye statistical bureau 2000 information on irrigation water plan and irrigation for each irrigation district were collected from local water resource bureaus irrigation water management at the farm level was explored via household surveys including the input output of agriculture production and water consumption by different crops gis shapefiles used for deriving and calculation of et and rainfall at different scales were collected from environmental and ecological science data center for west china national natural science foundation of china http westdc westgis ac cn 2 3 definition of water use efficiency and water productivity water use efficiency is represented as the fraction of water beneficially used over total water applied burt et al 1997 perry 2007 from the perspective of individual crops it is usually defined as the ratio of crop water demand to total water applied in a sense where et plays a decisive role in determining the amount of irrigation water for different crops the actual crop water demand can be obtained from crop et c minus rain supplement p during its growth period and water use can be represented by irrigation water quota q c at the district level wue of district i wue i known as the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water is represented as the ratio of the amount of effectively used irrigation water we i to the amount of water withdrawn from rivers or aquifers including surface water and groundwater withdrawal i for district i wue at the county scale wue b can be represented by the amount of effectively used agricultural water et minus rain to the total agricultural water used wp provides a notion and attributes a specific value of the productivity of water that can be optimized wp of a specific crop can be represented as the ratio of yield to et alpha it is much more a biophysical index of crop characteristics at the irrigation district wp can be denoted as the agricultural output per cubic meter of water extracted at the county scale wp is the contribution of water to regional agricultural output wp can also be applied in a wider sense by attributing different values to the numerator this is commonly done in water evaluation approaches where economic attributes can be given in monetary terms dinar 1993 molden et al 2010 economic wp provides a tool to attribute value and productivity to all water uses and users in a hydrological domain not only those pertaining to irrigated agriculture it quantifies and qualifies the potential to raise the productivity of low value water use cells to those of similar water use in high value cells or to transform low value water uses into high economic water uses the combination of these two indicators is a necessity to make a more scientific and strategic decision in water resource management fernández et al 2020 wue and wp evaluated at different scales are listed in table 1 3 spatial distribution of et and effective irrigation water demand based on the revised sebs model et for the hrb during the crop growth period was obtained the schematic diagram of et in hrb was shown in fig 1a the average maximum and minimum values of main physical parameters and et data in irrigated areas were calculated based on spatial techniques for the whole hrb et varied from 0 to 794 mm which generally decreased with increasing elevation et above an elevation of 4500 m was quite small due to the relatively low temperature cropland interpreted from remote sensing imagery showed that maize cultivation prevails in the study area with a planting area of 1979 km2 which was widely distributed in ganzhou linze and gaotai county fig 1c followed were wheat and barley that were mainly planted in the high altitude low temperature regions of minle and shandan county the estimated average et of farmland was about 467 mm et for different crops namely et c was determined as follows first spatial correlation between crop sample and et data was conducted to obtain the et of each crop sample and then was further averaged to obtain the mean et of each crop during the growth period et for maize and wheat was within the range of 490 694 mm and 303 514 mm with an average of 528 mm and 373 mm respectively in the growing season fig 2 among all the crops maize had the largest et during the growth period it was similar to the results from li et al 2016 where the estimated et for irrigated maize in hrb was 496 600 mm by aquacrop model and 545 691 mm from jiang et al 2015 by swap epic model effective irrigation water demand is an important indicator for irrigators or managers to resort to a more efficient irrigation plan the spatial distribution of effective irrigation water demand determined by et and precipitation was depicted in fig 3 hot spots of crop effective irrigation water demand mainly distributed in the middle reach of hrb where maize occupies most of the planting area we also noticed that the average effective irrigation water demands by maize barley and wheat were 317 mm 287 mm and 275 mm respectively demonstrating that maize needs more irrigation water during the growing season considering that the annual precipitation in the farmland area was about 234 mm which is about half of et it can be noticed that crop growth was largely dependent on irrigation in the middle reaches of hrb according to the annual report of water conservancy management of zhangye city in 2012 the average irrigation water depth to unit planting area in the study area was about 583 mm and the estimated irrigation water consumption of wheat and maize during the growth period was about 6 000 m3 ha and 9 000 m3 ha respectively when compared with the estimated effective irrigation water demand it can be inferred that irrigation water use in hrb was far exceeding the actual water demand 4 wue and wp at the different scales based on crop et precipitation and crop yield above wue and wp for different crops in the study area were obtained wues for maize wheat and barley are 0 74 0 73 and 0 56 respectively fig 4 as the main crop in the study area wue of maize was far lower than those of wheat and barley taking into account the large planting area of maize in the hrb there was still space to reduce irrigation water use by improving wue of maize the yield of different crops also showed strong spatial variation fig 5 high yield mainly occurred in the middle reaches of hrb where maize occupies most of the cropland according to the statistical data collected from zhangye statistical bureau the output of maize accounted for 62 of the total agricultural output in the middle hrb the average yield of maize was 560 kg ha which was almost twice those of wheat and barley wp of the main crops was determined by the yield and effective irrigation water demand results from our analysis showed that wp of maize was high and varied from 1 5 kg m3 to 2 0 kg m3 and wp of wheat was about 1 20 kg m3 taking into account the sales prices of different crops the economic wps of maize wheat and barley were 4 2 yuan m3 3 0 yuan m3 and 2 8 yuan m3 respectively fig 4 it can be seen that though the wue of maize was low among the three crops the economic wp was much higher than the other two crops it implies that crop price needs to be considered with wue improvement to enhance economic wp for different crops irrigation districts are the basic units for agricultural water resource allocation and irrigation plan making in china the spatial differences of wue and wp were large among irrigation districts table 2 wues of the 24 main irrigation districts ranged from 0 1 to 0 85 with a mean average of 0 34 and wp varied from 0 08 kg m3 to 0 89 kg m3 with a mean average of 0 48 kg m3 wue was minimized in the pingchuan irrigation district in linze county and maximized in the tongziba irrigation district in minle county both the highest wp 0 89 kg m3 for huazhai and lowest wp 0 088 kg m3 for xijun appeared in ganzhou district wp was relatively low for irrigation districts located in gaotai county this was consistent with results from li et al 2017 where water productivity in the irrigated areas of the middle hrb was spatially varied and quite small due to excessive irrigation water use wue and wp were much dependable on water withdrawal at the irrigation districts water withdrawal density namely water withdrawal per unit area was spatially different among the irrigation districts table 2 irrigation districts with a large amount of water withdrawal were mainly located on the two sides of heihe river mainstream including pingchuan yanuan and banqiao irrigation districts in linze county and xijun and yingke irrigation districts located in ganzhou district water withdrawal density was less than 600 mm in tongziba huazhai hongshuihe irrigation districts which were all located far from the mainstream the largest water withdrawal density was 2 047 mm in the pingchuan irrigation district it was almost 4 8 times the water withdrawal in sigou irrigation district from the statistical data collected from the water resources bulletin of zhangye city the total water consumption was 1 9 billion m3 for all districts and the average irrigation water use was about 6 930 m3 per ha at the district level this figure was smaller than the water quota applied at the field scale the gap between actual water used at the field and the district scale was substantially due to the influence of the hydrological process in irrigation previous researches showed that deep percolation loss and canal conveyance loss accounted for 40 of the total water use in the hrb jiang et al 2015 to evaluate water consumption and economic productivity in the whole middle reaches we extended our study from the typical districts to the county scales for the whole basin as for the counties wues of shandan county and minle county were 0 62 and 0 71 respectively which were higher than those of ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county table 3 the result was in accordance with the findings at the district scale where wue of mountainous areas was higher than that of flood plain areas besides the average wue and wp at the county scale were higher than that of the district scale according to the discharge data collected at yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge the volume of water flows through the two gorges was 1 93 billion and 1 11 billion m3 respectively implying the water consumed in the whole middle reaches of hrb was 0 82 billion m3 regardless of rain supplement according to the statistical data the grain yield of the whole middle reaches was 1 12 million tons with an economic output of 6 8 billion yuan the produced value of each drop in the economic system of the whole basin was only 58 yuan m3 which was far below the national average of 105 yuan m3 economic wp varies greatly among regions due to the regional industry structure fig 6 economic wp of jiayuguan was 480 yuan m3 whereas the economic wps of gaotai county linze county minle county jinta county and ganzhou district is lower than 50 yuan m3 the large discrepancy was mainly attributed to the agriculture dominant industry structure where agriculture was centered in the middle reaches of hrb for example ganzhou district accounted for 26 of agricultural output in the whole basin with a planting area of 61 ha followed by jinta county linze county and gaotai county with the proportion of agricultural output exceeding 30 of the regional gdp to discuss the variations of water management indicators among three scales wue and wp were compared and analyzed here as shown in fig 7 the annual average values of both wue and wp were relatively lower and the variances of them were relatively larger at the irrigation district scale fig 7a as fig 7b shows unlike county and field crop scales the irrigation district scale exhibited the heterogeneous values between wue and wp interestingly higher agricultural wue than wp was only observed at the county scale fig 7b it may be attributed to the low economic outputs for agricultural products such as the sales prices of crops compared to the low wue in some irrigation districts the consistent wue and wp in other districts may be due to their abundant groundwater groundwater was proven to contribute more than 16 of regional et for the irrigation district attar et al 2020 from the statistics it can be seen that decision making on management at irrigation districts scale can improve efficient uses of water in agriculture from the perspective of wue and wp when evaluating water resource use from the perspective of mean wue ranging from 0 3 to 0 6 at three scales crop structure and efficiency of irrigation process are important directions of agricultural water saving in irrigation management 5 discussion the aim of delineating the utility of wue and wp at demarcated scales in resolving irrigation water scarcity problems is to guide the formulation of agricultural water management strategies in arid and semi arid river basins the purpose of this study is to calculate the dual objectives of wue and wp at the field crop irrigation district and county scales to evaluate the optimal water management scale for agricultural areas researchers have addressed the theoretical utility of efficiency and productivity depending on the scales of analysis and comparison of a single type of indicators among different scales in management decisions cai et al 2011 wichelns 2014 li et al 2017 fernández et al 2020 however less attention has been paid to the evaluation and validation of the most proper management scale on relevant indicators for agricultural water resources results from our analysis show that wue ranges from 0 1 to 0 85 mean 0 34 and wp varies from 0 08 kg m3 to 0 8 kg m3 mean 0 48 kg m3 across irrigation districts in the whole basin the large differences indicate the presence of a tremendous management gap among irrigation districts therefore mesoscale views were considered more suitable for detecting the problem of water resource utilization in some irrigation districts that s to say policymakers should emphasize irrigation district management and irrigation district managers should make specific decisions for different irrigation districts aiming to improve the efficiency of the irrigation process a popular intervention is the provision of support for transitioning to drip irrigation which outperforms furrow irrigation and flood irrigation during the past years the local government has put many efforts into irrigation facility construction such as canal lining water conservancy facility upgrading and metering equipment installation and the canal systems and water conservancy facilities have been greatly improved whereas several studies have shown that such interventions do not necessarily provide real water savings jensen 2007 van halsema and vincent 2012 grafton et al 2018 adjustment of the corresponding crop structures to achieve water saving and economic objectives is preferred in irrigation districts from statistical data of agriculture production collected in zhangye city it can be found that the total applied irrigation water in hrb increased by 8 8 from 2007 to 2012 crop transformation and cultivated land expansion contributed to 23 and 77 of the total change respectively where the grain crop ratio diminished and the economic crop ratio rose li et al 2018 however though economic crops consume less water than maize and other grains the slack market demand and the lack of comparative advantage restricted the adjustment of regional planting structure different from previous researches we do not observe the increment effect of wue and wp as research scales increase in our study wue at the field crop scale 0 70 is higher than that at the district scale 0 34 the explanation about the conclusion that wue is greater at larger scales eg from field scale to the district scale usually lies in that water withdrawn from a water source is returned to the hydrologic system ma et al 2018 whereas the main problem associated with the conclusion is that it only takes into account the unique hydrologic and physical characteristics of water resources however the factors contributing to the differences of wue and wp at different scales are complex including not only hydrological circle but also climate condition planting structure and management system previous researches show that temperature and precipitation in the past three decades jointly enhanced crop wue by 8 1 30 6 in hrb jiang et al 2015 xue et al 2017 from this perspective the evaluation of wue and wp needs to be diverted from the process based technical engineering system to the management scheme and policy dimension to simulate more accurately the regional crop water consumption and wue a more detailed investigation of the soil the regional distribution of crop types irrigation scheduling is required the results in this study still need further verification because of the uncertainties associated with the estimation of wue and wp parts of the uncertainties arise from the estimation of et though et was estimated based on high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing data in this research the uncertainties associated with model inputs and parameterizations will lead to estimation error kustas et al 2016 as researches showed that the rmse values of daily et vary from 0 5 to 1 0 mm day at the field scale cammalleri et al 2013 ma et al 2018 besides exchanges between the surface water and groundwater will potentially influence soil moisture and thus will lead to the change of wue whereas this is not discussed in this paper for it calls for the support of hydrological models which are too complicated to be conducted here whereas the limitations do not prevent this research from providing a conceptual framework for the measurement of wue and wp and enhancing our understanding of water consumption at different scales in such a complex river basin 6 conclusions this study evaluates the most proper management scale for the efficiency and productivity of irrigation water achieving water savings in existing use through the increase in wue and wp in agriculture has been suggested as the most available path to solving the water dispute in inland river basins the literature shows confusion and a lack of consensus on the use of indicators at different scales and supports irrigation water management strategies separately at the crop regional or irrigation scheme scale yet to the most proper of our knowledge few studies have emphasized on which management scale is the most appropriate for irrigation agriculture in arid and semi arid areas therefore this study provides new insight into evaluating the most proper management scale for the limited water resources by proposing a comprehensive comparison between wue and wp the heihe river basin in china is regarded as an ideal case study due to water scarcity large agricultural water consumption and low beneficial water use fraction to maximize economic and social welfare for the whole basin the two indicators should be combined to make more informative water management decisions we found that the two indicators of wue and wp perform differently at different spatial scales when assessing water resource use combining wue and wp our findings show that these two indicators are significantly different and heterogeneous at the irrigation district scale the large differences indicate the presence of a tremendous management gap among irrigation districts this implies to consider the irrigation scale as the most proper management scale on irrigation water resources which policymakers should target irrigation technology and spatial crop structure are important directions of agricultural water management at the irrigation district scale however the jevons paradox phenomenon should be taken care of in the adoption of irrigation technology to avoid expanding of agriculture as declared by many researchers the water price instrument based on the market mechanism can help regulate the extravagant water consumption and promote water conservation and the rational allocation of water resources in the future a properly functioning water market accompanied with clearly defined and legally enforceable water rights is the guarantee for water resources to flow successfully from agricultural to nonagricultural sectors the discrepancy of water utilization goals at different management scales calls for the comprehensive evaluation of wue and wp at different management scales this study can be used as a reference in agricultural water resources management for other arid and semi arid river basins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

10214,allometry is extensively used to describe the scaling relationship between individual size and metabolite allocation micro field rain harvesting system can improve soil water availability and thus alter the allocation of individual biomass among organs yet the eco physiological mechanism based on allometric scaling theory has been little investigated under various mulching conditions a field experiment was conducted using maize variety yuyuan7879 in juja kenya for two growing seasons cross year from 2015 to 2016 and from 2016 to 2017 respectively four treatments were designed as ridge furrow mulching rfm with black plastic mulching rfmb transparent plastic mulching rfmt grass straw mulching rfmg and conventional flat planting ck we found that rfmb rfmt and rfmg significantly increased grain yield by 106 109 and 32 in 2015 and 101 96 and 30 in 2016 respectively in comparison with ck mulching treatments improved soil temperature and moisture and significantly increased crop water productivity cwp mulching treatments drastically changed the allometric relationship between metabolic rate leaf biomass and individual size lgy αlgx lgβ and optimized the size dependent reproductive allocation in the relationship between leaf biomass y axis vs aboveground biomass x axis mulching treatments significantly declined the value of α α 1 p 0 01 suggesting that less photosynthetic product was allocated in leaves in mulching treatments than in ck as for the allometric relationship between grain yield and aboveground biomass the α was generally significantly more than 1 in rfmb and rfmt and significantly less than 1 in rfmg and ck demonstrating that more photosynthates were allocated to reproductive growth under plastic mulching also the variation of allometric relationship between reproductive and vegetative biomass provided further evidence that plastic mulching facilitated substance transportation from vegetative to reproductive organs in conclusion plastic mulching significantly improved soil hydrothermal condition increased individual reproductive allocation and ultimately improved grain yield and cwp at population level keywords ridge furrow mulching maize reproductive allocation allometric relationship semiarid kenya 1 introduction allometry is extensively used to describe the scaling relationship between trait size and body size gayon 2000 using a dynamic and developmental perspective the standard dictionary definition of allometry is the growth of one part of an organism relative to the growth of the entire organism or some other part of it klinkhamer 1995 this relationship is generally expressed using a power function y axb where y and x refer to the trait size and body size respectively a is the allometric constant and b is the allometric coefficient huxley 1932 huxley and teissier 1936 at a logarithmic scale this relationship becomes linear as log y log a b log x where log a is the intercept and b is the slope egset et al 2012 energy allocation is one of the central concepts in ecology providing the theoretical basis explaining different growth and reproduction strategies jackson et al 1997 from allometric perspective energy allocation is generally viewed as a size dependent process in higher plant in this case allometry can elucidate the quantitative relationship between growth and allocation qin et al 2013 higher plants can produce biomass and then distribute it to different structures with the respective function for individual survival growth and development this can reflect internal coordination of different aspects of organ development and underlie physiological processes for the development of functional structural plant models guo et al 2012 to most extent the plasticity in allocation can be understood as a change in a plant s allometric trajectory in response to growth environment weiner 2004 for dryland crops such as maize the biomass allocation plasticity may imply the mechanisms underlying yield formation and crop water productivity particularly under the improved soil moisture or temperature conditions recent progress indicated that ridge furrow mulching rfm system displayed great potential to improve crop production and reduce surface runoff in rainfed agricultural areas chai et al 2014 eldoma et al 2016 zhou et al 2009 currently rfm system has become a principal form of crop production in northwest china chai et al 2014 kiers et al 2008 this farming system generally comprises three major components with alternative ridge furrow configuration units soil surface mulching with various materials and furrow culture management the ridges and furrows are used to collect and retain rainwater and the wide low ridges can be used for operation by farmer eldoma et al 2016 the mulching material including plastic film plant straw and others serve as a medium to modify soil water thermal balance and suppress weeds chai et al 2014 technically rainwater collected by ridges is first channelled to furrow surface and then infiltrated into deep soil prolonging water availability for plant sown in furrows zhou et al 2009 the planting in furrows can offer advantageous condition such as light thermal moisture air nutrient then crop can maximize water uptake from furrows for growth and development mo et al 2016 under different mulching with polyethylene film transparent or black film or grass straw the hydro thermal condition will be significantly changed in rainfed maize field the individual size and energy allocation are frequently affected by soil hydro thermal status it is a fundamental issue to improve the hydro thermal environment plant size and yield under rfm system in rainfed maize field therefore how to alter the individual size and allocation of energy among organs from the perspective of metabolic theory is critical till now there is little information available to address the above issue metabolic scaling theory provides an efficient tool to analyze energy distribution and metabolic rate in rainfed crop production kenya is located at the east africa plateau eap where arid and semiarid areas cover more than half of total area it is characterized as low and erratic rainfall and extensive evaporation nicholson 2001 li et al 2013b in semiarid kenya water availability is the primary limiting factor for crop growth brashares et al 2011 insufficient harvest and utilization of rainwater frequently lead to soil degradation and nutrient loss which cause the productivity gap between current and potential yield barron and okwach 2005 maize zea mays l production plays a critical role in regional food security as it is by far the primary staple food for most people living there grace et al 2014 the rfm system has been proved to significantly improve maize yield and wue in northwest china liu et al 2010 since it can increase soil temperature li et al 2013a prevent soil moisture loss and improve water availability jia et al 2006 it also can reduce soil surface evaporation zhang et al 2013 and change ground light and temperature conditions thus improving water use efficiency zhou et al 2009 yields and economic benefits zhao et al 2012 it is unclear whether the rfm system exerts a similar effect in semiarid eap moreover the mechanism underlying plant ecology perspective is also not clear in the semiarid environment water availability is a major constraint to influence the growth and individual size particularly in dryland crop reproductive allocation should be analyzed and interpreted allometrically because ratios or fractions such as reproductive effort re or harvest index hi are size dependent cereal breeders should focus on reproductive allometry when interpreting hi and select for allometric patterns that are most advantageous in a given agronomic context especially when there is large variation in productivity among individuals locations or years qin et al 2013 existing studies indicated that the allometric slope exponent of the r v relationship decreased with increasing elevation in plant populations guo et al 2012 qin et al 2013 the slope of log r log v relationship under the fertilized conditions was significantly greater than that of non fertilization wang et al 2014 in most cases metabolic scaling theory provided an efficient approach to analyze energy distribution and metabolic efficiency in rainfed crop production therefore we proposed a hypothesis that allometric scaling may account for water productivity and yield formation in crop farming system of rfm the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to determine yield formation and water use in dryland maize under rfm system in semiarid kenya 2 to elucidate the size dependent metabolic rule and 3 to clarify how allometric theory as a key eco physiological approach account for water productivity in light of allometry theory we conducted the interdisciplinary research incorporating crop cultivation science plant physiology and population ecology it is expected that the high yielding and water saving mechanism would be elucidated and analyzed using the allometry theory in the rfm farming system in semiarid east african plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the experimental farm

micro field rain harvesting farming system was used in this study including alternative ridge furrow configuration units soil surface mulching with various materials and furrow culture management mfrhs fig 1 one of core configuration of mfrhs was alternating ridges and furrows and each ridge furrow unit comprised a wide low ridge 0 6 m in width and 0 10 m in height and a narrow high ridge 0 4 m in width and 0 15 m in height the naturally occurring furrows at the junction between wide low ridge and narrow high ridge can be used for collecting water and sowing crops the crops were planted in the furrows in order to use water more effectively before sowing plastic film was laid out over the plot where two pieces of plastic films were jointed in the midline between wide and narrow ridges and the joint was fixed stably by placing soil on the top of film weeds can be manually cleared through lifting film at junction of two pieces of films during the growing season usually the weeds can be oppressed by film and can not grow there were two growing seasons in this study i e two cross year growing seasons the first growing season ranged from november 2015 to march 2016 and the second one covered from october 2016 to january 2017 to get a more convenient expression we called them as 2015 growing season and 2016 growing season in 2015 growing season maize was sown on november 22nd 2015 and harvested on february 16th 2016 with the precipitation of 157 7 mm and the growing period of 86 days in 2016 growing season sowing period was october 10 2016 and harvesting period was january 8th 2017 respectively over 90 days with 192 34 mm four treatments were designed as 1 ridge and furrow with mulching black plastic film rfmb 2 ridge and furrow with mulching transparent plastic film

field corporation of china lanzhou china and the thickness of transparent film was 0 012 mm while the black film was 0 014 mm the experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replicates in both growing seasons each plot was 5 m long and 4 8 m wide 75 kg rotten sheep manure was applied in each plot the planting density was 165 plants per plot equal to 6 9 104 plants

pre sowing rainfall amount was much higher 244 2 mm in 2015 and 163 6 mm in 2016 than average value of multiple years 81 7 mm data was provided by juja meteorological station kenya fig 2 actually the rainfall amount in first growing season was 157 7 mm in order to eliminate influence of rainfall factor on experiment the sowing date was postponed but the initial soil moisture was higher in 2015 than in 2016 according to the multi year records 582 4 mm and 20 12 c a general trend was that year 2015 was relatively hot and wet 875 6 mm and 21 03 c and year 2016 was relatively cool and dry 727 9

38 5 163 55 11 75 and 0 mm which was lower by 47 63 46 38 17 52 and 4 24 mm than the same month in last 9 years in this study initial soil moisture at sowing was obviously greater in 2015 than in 2016 and the difference in soil water storage between sowing and harvesting stages sws was also greater in 2015 i e 170 9 mm than in 2016 i e 148 2 mm table 1 the sws was higher by 19 43 in rfmb 15 1 in rfmt and 10 53 in rfmg in 2015 and 15 99 in rfmb 17 41 in rfmt and 8 16 in rfmg in 2016 respectively in comparison with ck the evapotranspiration in control group was 328 6 mm and 340 5 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively rfmb rfmt and rfmg decreased the evapotranspiration by 10 1 7 85 5 48 and 6 96 7 58 3 55 in two years respectively plastic mulching significantly increased topsoil temperature across two growing seasons topsoil temperature was increased by 2 07 c 2015 and 1 48 c 2016 in rfmb and 2 44 c 2015 and 2 56 c 2016 in rfmt respectively compared with ck fig 2 transparent film mulching led to higher soil temperature than black film mulching in both growing seasons yet grass straw mulching turned to reduce soil temperature by 1 4 c in 2015 and 1 67 c in 2016 respectively compared with ck fig 2 better thermal condition facilitated the accumulation of aboveground biomass while larger plant individual tended to allocate more dry matter into grain fig 4 3 2 grain yield water use and yield formation in response to rfm treatments rfm treatments significantly improved grain yield and crop water productivity cwp and lowered the evaporation amount across two growing seasons table 1 compared with ck rfmb and rfmt increased grain yield by 106 56 and 109 24 in 2015 and 101 51 and 96 14 in 2016 respectively table 1 grass straw mulching rfmg increased the yield by 32 68 and 30 45 in 2015 and 2016 respectively straw and plastic mulching significantly reduced the evaporation and improved cwp accordingly the cwpg was increased by 130 127 14 and 40 29 in 2015 and 114 29 111 11 and 34 92 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg in addition the cwpa was enhanced by 83 07 80 09 and 35 35 in 2015 and 76 45 68 18 and 31 82 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively table 1 there were no significant differences in bract weight row number per ear kernel weight per ear and 100 grain weight per ear between two plastic mulching treatments table 2 however the bract weight per ear in ck was the lowest i e 11 58 g and 8 5 g in 2015 and 2016 respectively the bract weight per ear was increased by 66 58 23 4 and 52 59 in 2015 and 58 2 58 59 and 16 71 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively moreover row number per ear under ck was 13 02 and 12 96 in 2015 and 2016 respectively it was increased on average by 36 94 42 63 and 23 96 in 2015 and 36 19 39 74 and 21 68 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively the kernel weight per ear was 39 44 g and 35 47 g under ck it was increased by 97 9 102 28 98 in 2015 and 99 77 94 78 and 29 49 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively table 2 on the other hand the 100 grain weight per ear was significantly increased by 21 4 27 41 and 15 06 in 2015 16 9 19 76 and 8 49 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg compared with ck respectively table 2 the kernel abortion was lowered by 40 75 39 69 and 5 25 in 2015 and 32 04 44 38 and 7 4 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively the cob weight was also improved by 87 66 98 73 and 8 98 in 2015 and 101 44 100 19 and 24 06 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively the kernel number per ear was massively improved by 63 03 58 52 and 20 72 in 2015 and 70 84 62 62 and 19 32 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively the bare tip length was decreased by 27 98 24 13 and 1 46 in 2015 and 15 4 31 84 and 2 59 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively as a result the greatest yield and above ground biomass were achieved in rfmt in 2015 and in rfmb in 2016 respectively the greatest cwpg and cwpa were recorded in rfmb across two growing seasons table 2 the minimum water consumption within growing season was observed in rfmb in 2015 and rfmt in 2016 respectively 3 3 the relationship between metabolic rate leaf biomass and individual size under rfm leaf growth and its proportion with other typical organs were recorded in this study table 3 two plastic mulching treatments significantly enhanced leaf area compared with straw mulching and ck no significant difference was observed between straw mulching and ck table 3 in addition specific leaf area flag followed a similar situation as leaf area did among four treatments the ratio of leaf to aboveground biomass varied from the treatments the ratio ranked as ck rfmg rfmt rfmb across two growing seasons table 3 mulching treatments changed the size dependent allometric pattern lgy αlgx lgβ in comparison with ck the relationship between leaf biomass y axis vs aboveground biomass x axis followed a similar trend α 1 among various treatments across two growing seasons and the mulching treatments significantly declined the value of α p 0 01 table 4 a fig 3 the lowest value of α was observed in the black plastic mulching treatment rfmb i e 0 738 in 2015 and 0 804 in 2016 respectively and the highest value of α was in ck 0 938 in 2015 and 0 912 in 2016 respectively the α of rfmt was similar as that of rfmb in two growing seasons and that of rfmg was in the middle on the other hand the intercepts among three mulching treatments were of no obvious change it was noted that most data fell into the right ride of crossing point between regression lines 3 4 size dependent reproductive allocation under rfm the allometric relationships of log grain yield vs log aboveground biomass and log reproductive biomass vs log vegetative biomass were compared table 4 b c figs 4 and 5 the allometric relationship between grain yield and aboveground biomass was typically size dependent there were generally two parameters to determine the changes in allometric scaling i e the exponent α and the intercept in the relationship between log grain yield and log aboveground biomass the intercept was 81 4 in 2015 and 72 8 in 2016 respectively and it dropped down to below 130 in 2015 and 119 in 2016 in mulching treatments the lowest values were found in rfmb and rfmt in two growing seasons in the meantime the α was generally significantly more than the constant 1 in rfmb and rfmt in two growing seasons table 4 b fig 4 in contrast it was generally significantly less than 1 in rfmg and ck in two seasons and the values of ck were the lowest as aforementioned there was a crossing point between two regression lines which were drawn from ck and each treatment it was noted that most data was allocated in the right side of crossing point since the intercepts among the treatments were of pronounced differences with each other this trend suggested that plastic mulching treatments can distribute more photosynthetic products into reproductive growth in terms of a given individual size relatively grass straw mulching and ck followed an opposite trend table 4 b fig 4 finally the allometric relationships between reproductive and vegetative r v growth and the reproductive efforts in four treatments were compared table 4 c fig 5 a general trend of reproductive effort re was to increase orderly from ck to rfmb the re was 0 268 in 2015 and 0 258 in 2016 respectively and increased to 0 27 in 2015 and 0 263 in 2016 in grass straw mulching respectively the greatest values of re were found in rfmb and rfmt ranging from 0 314 to 0 327 across two growing seasons table 3 this outcome was similar as the trend of size dependent reproductive allocation see the above it was also supported by the r v relationship fig 5 the slope of r v regression equation was the lowest in ck only 9 7 in 2015 and 8 7 in 2016 respectively it ranged from 11 to 20 in three mulching treatments across two growing seasons table 4 c fig 5 in relatively hot and wet 2015 the slope was 11 9 in rfmb 12 1 in rfmt and 14 4 in rfmg respectively in relatively cool and dry 2016 it reached up to 11 0 in rfmb 20 6 in rfmt and 19 4 in rfmg respectively table 4 c 4 discussion in semiarid rainfed environment the rfms substantially improved soil water availability rainfall can be harvested and transformed into the runoff on the ridge surface thereafter the runoff would be collected in the furrow and then stored in the root zone soils in this case crop water consumption mode was changed accordingly the evaporation would be reduced in the early growth period while the transpiration was increased in the late growth period since deep soil water can be transferred to the upper soil layer for better absorption by crops the improvement on soil water availability provided a solid basis for the increased accumulation of dry matter and crop water productivity under rfms despite overall increase in aboveground production the dry matter allocation into different functional organs i e leaves stem and grain etc is of significant importance metabolic scaling theory provided a powerful tool to analyze energy distribution and metabolic efficiency in rainfed crop production allometric relationship is considered as an adaptive strategy in the life history of higher plant stearns 1992 weiss 1999 crop would modify to adapt to changes of environment due to rfm system s improvement on micro ecological environment especially the growth environment of roots the soil microorganism diversity and activity can be improved massively li et al 2004 which help provide suitable soil temperature and nutrition for crop growth in present study the application of rfm significantly improved the hydrological table 1 and thermal conditions fig 2 and accordingly modified the allometric relationship under rfm farming pattern crop grew more robust with enough moisture nutrient and suitable temperature around roots in soil li et al 2004 chai et al 2014 at the same time leaves as assimilation organs whose photosynthetic function would become stronger leaf is a critical organ to perform the photosynthetic carbon assimilation and leaf biomass can be used as a physiological indicator to reflect metabolic rate in higher plant those physiological and biochemical response enabled the rfmb rfmt treatments to reduce slope value table 3 increase intercept value in the allometry equation between leaf biomass and aboveground biomass fig 3 it suggested that under the same size of aboveground biomass condition rfmb and rfmt allocated less energy and biomass to leaves to say fewer leaves can provide the energy or biomass to meet the demand required by whole plant growth in the same way rfmb and rfmt allocated more energy or biomass to grain yield in allometric relationship between grain and aboveground biomass table 4 according to fig 3 and table 3 the results indicated that more photosynthetic products would be allocated in leaves under a given biomass increase in aboveground part in ck to say less energy would be fixed in leaves under the same condition in mulching treatments particularly in rfmb and rfmt in control group ck more photosynthetic assimilation products were stored in leaves the other organs particularly reproductive organs acquired fewer products the opposite outcome was observed in mulching treatments this would benefit the improvements on grain yield and cwp another explanation is that crops with the same aboveground biomass can produce more grain yield in rfm treatments fig 4 as is well recognized allometric growth is closely associated with body size which is bound to change the allometry of leaf vs aboveground biomass as well as grain yield vs aboveground biomass weiner and thomas 1992 allometric protocol is a standardized tool to quantify size dependent eco physiological process particularly including biomass partitioning and ontogenesis qin et al 2013 due to the improvement of moisture and temperature conditions individuals would grow larger in the rfm treatments thus optimizing life history strategy and allocating more biomass or energy to reproductive organs this would ultimately obtain better fitness weiner et al 2009 this mechanism can be illuminated from the modification in the slope of r v relationship which was caused by the variation of altitude and nutrient status in the living environment of plants guo et al 2012 wang et al 2016 we first employed the principles of classic ecology to elucidate water productivity and yield formation in the rfm system the yield formation and water use can be mechanically explained by allometric relationship between leaf biomass and body size since its allometric exponent 1 was decreased under the rfm condition in this case relatively less energy was allocated in leaves also allometric relationship between grain yield and body size provided supporting evidence for the above phenomenon since its allometric exponent was increased in the rfm system and relatively more energy was transferred to reproductive organs in conclusion the rfm application significantly improved soil water availability and thereby boosted yield and cwpg in semiarid kenya 5 conclusions crops produce biomass and then allocate some of it to reproductive organs allometric protocols have become a standardized tool to quantify the characteristics of reproductive allocation and water use in the present study micro field rainwater harvesting system mfrhs substantially improved soil water storage and soil temperature in rainfed maize fields with the improvement on soil hydro thermal status grain yield and cwp can be increased massively under mfrhs the allometric relationships between leaf mass vs body size and seed mass vs body size were modified so as to allocate more mass or energy to grain filling for the first time we explained why the rfm system can improve grain yield at the population level using the allometric scaling theory i e metabolic theory in ecology in the allometry relationship between leaf biomass i e metabolic rate and body size the slope was significantly less than 1 regardless of treatments while the slopes in rfm treatments were increased in the allometric relationship between grain biomass and body size the slope was significantly less than 1 across all treatments while it was reduced in rfm treatments this phenomenon demonstrated that in rfm farming system more energy or mass would be shifted into grain yield and accordingly less energy or mass into leaves it also suggested that as a result of rfm application the functional trait of leaves would become more powerful and accordingly the same size leaves can support or supply larger individual body according to principle of size dependence metabolic theory individual maize body should grow larger under the conditions of rfm application therefore it can be argued that rfm farming system can modify the allometric exponent and then optimize energy allocation strategy for improving production and water use efficiency the findings would help further enhance the insight into the adaptability and feasibility of rfm farming system credit authorship contribution statement xiao feng zhang conceptualization data curation

10214,allometry is extensively used to describe the scaling relationship between individual size and metabolite allocation micro field rain harvesting system can improve soil water availability and thus alter the allocation of individual biomass among organs yet the eco physiological mechanism based on allometric scaling theory has been little investigated under various mulching conditions a field experiment was conducted using maize variety yuyuan7879 in juja kenya for two growing seasons cross year from 2015 to 2016 and from 2016 to 2017 respectively four treatments were designed as ridge furrow mulching rfm with black plastic mulching rfmb transparent plastic mulching rfmt grass straw mulching rfmg and conventional flat planting ck we found that rfmb rfmt and rfmg significantly increased grain yield by 106 109 and 32 in 2015 and 101 96 and 30 in 2016 respectively in comparison with ck mulching treatments improved soil temperature and moisture and significantly increased crop water productivity cwp mulching treatments drastically changed the allometric relationship between metabolic rate leaf biomass and individual size lgy αlgx lgβ and optimized the size dependent reproductive allocation in the relationship between leaf biomass y axis vs aboveground biomass x axis mulching treatments significantly declined the value of α α 1 p 0 01 suggesting that less photosynthetic product was allocated in leaves in mulching treatments than in ck as for the allometric relationship between grain yield and aboveground biomass the α was generally significantly more than 1 in rfmb and rfmt and significantly less than 1 in rfmg and ck demonstrating that more photosynthates were allocated to reproductive growth under plastic mulching also the variation of allometric relationship between reproductive and vegetative biomass provided further evidence that plastic mulching facilitated substance transportation from vegetative to reproductive organs in conclusion plastic mulching significantly improved soil hydrothermal condition increased individual reproductive allocation and ultimately improved grain yield and cwp at population level keywords ridge furrow mulching maize reproductive allocation allometric relationship semiarid kenya 1 introduction allometry is extensively used to describe the scaling relationship between trait size and body size gayon 2000 using a dynamic and developmental perspective the standard dictionary definition of allometry is the growth of one part of an organism relative to the growth of the entire organism or some other part of it klinkhamer 1995 this relationship is generally expressed using a power function y axb where y and x refer to the trait size and body size respectively a is the allometric constant and b is the allometric coefficient huxley 1932 huxley and teissier 1936 at a logarithmic scale this relationship becomes linear as log y log a b log x where log a is the intercept and b is the slope egset et al 2012 energy allocation is one of the central concepts in ecology providing the theoretical basis explaining different growth and reproduction strategies jackson et al 1997 from allometric perspective energy allocation is generally viewed as a size dependent process in higher plant in this case allometry can elucidate the quantitative relationship between growth and allocation qin et al 2013 higher plants can produce biomass and then distribute it to different structures with the respective function for individual survival growth and development this can reflect internal coordination of different aspects of organ development and underlie physiological processes for the development of functional structural plant models guo et al 2012 to most extent the plasticity in allocation can be understood as a change in a plant s allometric trajectory in response to growth environment weiner 2004 for dryland crops such as maize the biomass allocation plasticity may imply the mechanisms underlying yield formation and crop water productivity particularly under the improved soil moisture or temperature conditions recent progress indicated that ridge furrow mulching rfm system displayed great potential to improve crop production and reduce surface runoff in rainfed agricultural areas chai et al 2014 eldoma et al 2016 zhou et al 2009 currently rfm system has become a principal form of crop production in northwest china chai et al 2014 kiers et al 2008 this farming system generally comprises three major components with alternative ridge furrow configuration units soil surface mulching with various materials and furrow culture management the ridges and furrows are used to collect and retain rainwater and the wide low ridges can be used for operation by farmer eldoma et al 2016 the mulching material including plastic film plant straw and others serve as a medium to modify soil water thermal balance and suppress weeds chai et al 2014 technically rainwater collected by ridges is first channelled to furrow surface and then infiltrated into deep soil prolonging water availability for plant sown in furrows zhou et al 2009 the planting in furrows can offer advantageous condition such as light thermal moisture air nutrient then crop can maximize water uptake from furrows for growth and development mo et al 2016 under different mulching with polyethylene film transparent or black film or grass straw the hydro thermal condition will be significantly changed in rainfed maize field the individual size and energy allocation are frequently affected by soil hydro thermal status it is a fundamental issue to improve the hydro thermal environment plant size and yield under rfm system in rainfed maize field therefore how to alter the individual size and allocation of energy among organs from the perspective of metabolic theory is critical till now there is little information available to address the above issue metabolic scaling theory provides an efficient tool to analyze energy distribution and metabolic rate in rainfed crop production kenya is located at the east africa plateau eap where arid and semiarid areas cover more than half of total area it is characterized as low and erratic rainfall and extensive evaporation nicholson 2001 li et al 2013b in semiarid kenya water availability is the primary limiting factor for crop growth brashares et al 2011 insufficient harvest and utilization of rainwater frequently lead to soil degradation and nutrient loss which cause the productivity gap between current and potential yield barron and okwach 2005 maize zea mays l production plays a critical role in regional food security as it is by far the primary staple food for most people living there grace et al 2014 the rfm system has been proved to significantly improve maize yield and wue in northwest china liu et al 2010 since it can increase soil temperature li et al 2013a prevent soil moisture loss and improve water availability jia et al 2006 it also can reduce soil surface evaporation zhang et al 2013 and change ground light and temperature conditions thus improving water use efficiency zhou et al 2009 yields and economic benefits zhao et al 2012 it is unclear whether the rfm system exerts a similar effect in semiarid eap moreover the mechanism underlying plant ecology perspective is also not clear in the semiarid environment water availability is a major constraint to influence the growth and individual size particularly in dryland crop reproductive allocation should be analyzed and interpreted allometrically because ratios or fractions such as reproductive effort re or harvest index hi are size dependent cereal breeders should focus on reproductive allometry when interpreting hi and select for allometric patterns that are most advantageous in a given agronomic context especially when there is large variation in productivity among individuals locations or years qin et al 2013 existing studies indicated that the allometric slope exponent of the r v relationship decreased with increasing elevation in plant populations guo et al 2012 qin et al 2013 the slope of log r log v relationship under the fertilized conditions was significantly greater than that of non fertilization wang et al 2014 in most cases metabolic scaling theory provided an efficient approach to analyze energy distribution and metabolic efficiency in rainfed crop production therefore we proposed a hypothesis that allometric scaling may account for water productivity and yield formation in crop farming system of rfm the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to determine yield formation and water use in dryland maize under rfm system in semiarid kenya 2 to elucidate the size dependent metabolic rule and 3 to clarify how allometric theory as a key eco physiological approach account for water productivity in light of allometry theory we conducted the interdisciplinary research incorporating crop cultivation science plant physiology and population ecology it is expected that the high yielding and water saving mechanism would be elucidated and analyzed using the allometry theory in the rfm farming system in semiarid east african plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the experimental farm

micro field rain harvesting farming system was used in this study including alternative ridge furrow configuration units soil surface mulching with various materials and furrow culture management mfrhs fig 1 one of core configuration of mfrhs was alternating ridges and furrows and each ridge furrow unit comprised a wide low ridge 0 6 m in width and 0 10 m in height and a narrow high ridge 0 4 m in width and 0 15 m in height the naturally occurring furrows at the junction between wide low ridge and narrow high ridge can be used for collecting water and sowing crops the crops were planted in the furrows in order to use water more effectively before sowing plastic film was laid out over the plot where two pieces of plastic films were jointed in the midline between wide and narrow ridges and the joint was fixed stably by placing soil on the top of film weeds can be manually cleared through lifting film at junction of two pieces of films during the growing season usually the weeds can be oppressed by film and can not grow there were two growing seasons in this study i e two cross year growing seasons the first growing season ranged from november 2015 to march 2016 and the second one covered from october 2016 to january 2017 to get a more convenient expression we called them as 2015 growing season and 2016 growing season in 2015 growing season maize was sown on november 22nd 2015 and harvested on february 16th 2016 with the precipitation of 157 7 mm and the growing period of 86 days in 2016 growing season sowing period was october 10 2016 and harvesting period was january 8th 2017 respectively over 90 days with 192 34 mm four treatments were designed as 1 ridge and furrow with mulching black plastic film rfmb 2 ridge and furrow with mulching transparent plastic film rfmt 3 ridge and furrow with mulching grass straw rfmg and 4 flat plant local conventional farming pattern ck the plastic film material was polyethylene with the width of 120 cm made by lanzhou gold field corporation of china lanzhou china and the thickness of transparent film was 0 012 mm while the black film was 0 014 mm the experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replicates in both growing seasons each plot was 5 m long and 4 8 m wide 75 kg rotten sheep manure was applied in each plot the planting density was 165 plants per plot equal to 6 9 104 plants per hectare with 30 cm between plants for both growing seasons china s middle late mature maize variety yuyuan7879 was sown in the furrows using a hole sowing machine 2 3 measurements and methods soil water content swc was determined gravimetrically each 20 days at each 20 cm increment within the depth of 120 cm across each whole growing season in each plot soil samples were taken in the center of furrows with three replicates using a soil auger 5 cm diameter 20 cm height the swc was also measured before sowing and after harvesting in the meantime soil bulk density was determined at each 20 cm layer throughout the soil profile of 120 cm the average soil bulk density across soil layers was 1 49 g cm3 soil water storage sws mm was calculated as follows sws swc δ b h where swc is soil water

to total water consumption evapotranspiration et over the whole growing season in study site crop growth was completely dependent on precipitation and the precipitation was too low to bring about drainage at the underground below 1 m there was no runoff due to the ridges around each ridge furrow plot and no irrigation was applied throughout the whole growing season seasonal evapotranspiration et in each plot was determined using the equation et p δ w where p is total precipitation in one growing season mm and w is the difference in sws between before sowing and after harvesting crop water productivity of grain yield cwpg and of aboveground biomass cwpa was calculated as follows cwp g y et cwp a a et where y is grain yield kg ha a is above ground biomass kg ha and et is evapotranspiration amount in each growing season in addition soil temperature was measured at the topsoil of 20 cm in the middle point between two individual plant in the furrow using the u disk

pre sowing rainfall amount was much higher 244 2 mm in 2015 and 163 6 mm in 2016 than average value of multiple years 81 7 mm data was provided by juja meteorological station kenya fig 2 actually the rainfall amount in first growing season was 157 7 mm in order to eliminate influence of rainfall factor on experiment the sowing date was postponed but the initial soil moisture was higher in 2015 than in 2016 according to the multi year records 582 4 mm and 20 12 c a general trend was that year 2015 was relatively hot and wet 875 6 mm and 21 03 c and year 2016 was relatively cool and dry 727 9

38 5 163 55 11 75 and 0 mm which was lower by 47 63 46 38 17 52 and 4 24 mm than the same month in last 9 years in this study initial soil moisture at sowing was obviously greater in 2015 than in 2016 and the difference in soil water storage between sowing and harvesting stages sws was also greater in 2015 i e 170 9 mm than in 2016 i e 148 2 mm table 1 the sws was higher by 19 43 in rfmb 15 1 in rfmt and 10 53 in rfmg in 2015 and 15 99 in rfmb 17 41 in rfmt and 8 16 in rfmg in 2016 respectively in comparison with ck the evapotranspiration in control group was 328 6 mm and 340 5 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively rfmb rfmt and rfmg decreased the evapotranspiration by 10 1 7 85 5 48 and 6 96 7 58 3 55 in two years respectively plastic mulching significantly increased topsoil temperature across two growing seasons topsoil temperature was increased by 2 07 c 2015 and 1 48 c 2016 in rfmb and 2 44 c 2015 and 2 56 c 2016 in rfmt respectively compared with ck fig 2 transparent film mulching led to higher soil temperature than black film mulching in both growing seasons yet grass straw mulching turned to reduce soil temperature by 1 4 c in 2015 and 1 67 c in 2016 respectively compared with ck fig 2 better thermal condition facilitated the accumulation of aboveground biomass while larger plant individual tended to allocate more dry matter into grain fig 4 3 2 grain yield water use and yield formation in response to rfm treatments rfm treatments significantly improved grain yield and crop water productivity cwp and lowered the evaporation amount across two growing seasons table 1 compared with ck rfmb and rfmt increased grain yield by 106 56 and 109 24 in 2015 and 101 51 and 96 14 in 2016 respectively table 1 grass straw mulching rfmg increased the yield by 32 68 and 30 45 in 2015 and 2016 respectively straw and plastic mulching significantly reduced the evaporation and improved cwp accordingly the cwpg was increased by 130 127 14 and 40 29 in 2015 and 114 29 111 11 and 34 92 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg in addition the cwpa was enhanced by 83 07 80 09 and 35 35 in 2015 and 76 45 68 18 and 31 82 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively table 1 there were no significant differences in bract weight row number per ear kernel weight per ear and 100 grain weight per ear between two plastic mulching treatments table 2 however the bract weight per ear in ck was the lowest i e 11 58 g and 8 5 g in 2015 and 2016 respectively the bract weight per ear was increased by 66 58 23 4 and 52 59 in 2015 and 58 2 58 59 and 16 71 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively moreover row number per ear under ck was 13 02 and 12 96 in 2015 and 2016 respectively it was increased on average by 36 94 42 63 and 23 96 in 2015 and 36 19 39 74 and 21 68 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively the kernel weight per ear was 39 44 g and 35 47 g under ck it was increased by 97 9 102 28 98 in 2015 and 99 77 94 78 and 29 49 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively table 2 on the other hand the 100 grain weight per ear was significantly increased by 21 4 27 41 and 15 06 in 2015 16 9 19 76 and 8 49 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg compared with ck respectively table 2 the kernel abortion was lowered by 40 75 39 69 and 5 25 in 2015 and 32 04 44 38 and 7 4 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively the cob weight was also improved by 87 66 98 73 and 8 98 in 2015 and 101 44 100 19 and 24 06 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively the kernel number per ear was massively improved by 63 03 58 52 and 20 72 in 2015 and 70 84 62 62 and 19 32 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively the bare tip length was decreased by 27 98 24 13 and 1 46 in 2015 and 15 4 31 84 and 2 59 in 2016 in rfmb rfmt and rfmg respectively as a result the greatest yield and above ground biomass were achieved in rfmt in 2015 and in rfmb in 2016 respectively the greatest cwpg and cwpa were recorded in rfmb across two growing seasons table 2 the minimum water consumption within growing season was observed in rfmb in 2015 and rfmt in 2016 respectively 3 3 the relationship between metabolic rate leaf biomass and individual size under rfm leaf growth and its proportion with other typical organs were recorded in this study table 3 two plastic mulching treatments significantly enhanced leaf area compared with straw mulching and ck no significant difference was observed between straw mulching and ck table 3 in addition specific leaf area flag followed a similar situation as leaf area did among four treatments the ratio of leaf to aboveground biomass varied from the treatments the ratio ranked as ck rfmg rfmt rfmb across two growing seasons table 3 mulching treatments changed the size dependent allometric pattern lgy αlgx lgβ in comparison with ck the relationship between leaf biomass y axis vs aboveground biomass x axis followed a similar trend α 1 among various treatments across two growing seasons and the mulching treatments significantly declined the value of α p 0 01 table 4 a fig 3 the lowest value of α was observed in the black plastic mulching treatment rfmb i e 0 738 in 2015 and 0 804 in 2016 respectively and the highest value of α was in ck 0 938 in 2015 and 0 912 in 2016 respectively the α of rfmt was similar as that of rfmb in two growing seasons and that of rfmg was in the middle on the other hand the intercepts among three mulching treatments were of no obvious change it was noted that most data fell into the right ride of crossing point between regression lines 3 4 size dependent reproductive allocation under rfm the allometric relationships of log grain yield vs log aboveground biomass and log reproductive biomass vs log vegetative biomass were compared table 4 b c figs 4 and 5 the allometric relationship between grain yield and aboveground biomass was typically size dependent there were generally two parameters to determine the changes in allometric scaling i e the exponent α and the intercept in the relationship between log grain yield and log aboveground biomass the intercept was 81 4 in 2015 and 72 8 in 2016 respectively and it dropped down to below 130 in 2015 and 119 in 2016 in mulching treatments the lowest values were found in rfmb and rfmt in two growing seasons in the meantime the α was generally significantly more than the constant 1 in rfmb and rfmt in two growing seasons table 4 b fig 4 in contrast it was generally significantly less than 1 in rfmg and ck in two seasons and the values of ck were the lowest as aforementioned there was a crossing point between two regression lines which were drawn from ck and each treatment it was noted that most data was allocated in the right side of crossing point since the intercepts among the treatments were of pronounced differences with each other this trend suggested that plastic mulching treatments can distribute more photosynthetic products into reproductive growth in terms of a given individual size relatively grass straw mulching and ck followed an opposite trend table 4 b fig 4 finally the allometric relationships between reproductive and vegetative r v growth and the reproductive efforts in four treatments were compared table 4 c fig 5 a general trend of reproductive effort re was to increase orderly from ck to rfmb the re was 0 268 in 2015 and 0 258 in 2016 respectively and increased to 0 27 in 2015 and 0 263 in 2016 in grass straw mulching respectively the greatest values of re were found in rfmb and rfmt ranging from 0 314 to 0 327 across two growing seasons table 3 this outcome was similar as the trend of size dependent reproductive allocation see the above it was also supported by the r v relationship fig 5 the slope of r v regression equation was the lowest in ck only 9 7 in 2015 and 8 7 in 2016 respectively it ranged from 11 to 20 in three mulching treatments across two growing seasons table 4 c fig 5 in relatively hot and wet 2015 the slope was 11 9 in rfmb 12 1 in rfmt and 14 4 in rfmg respectively in relatively cool and dry 2016 it reached up to 11 0 in rfmb 20 6 in rfmt and 19 4 in rfmg respectively table 4 c 4 discussion in semiarid rainfed environment the rfms substantially improved soil water availability rainfall can be harvested and transformed into the runoff on the ridge surface thereafter the runoff would be collected in the furrow and then stored in the root zone soils in this case crop water consumption mode was changed accordingly the evaporation would be reduced in the early growth period while the transpiration was increased in the late growth period since deep soil water can be transferred to the upper soil layer for better absorption by crops the improvement on soil water availability provided a solid basis for the increased accumulation of dry matter and crop water productivity under rfms despite overall increase in aboveground production the dry matter allocation into different functional organs i e leaves stem and grain etc is of significant importance metabolic scaling theory provided a powerful tool to analyze energy distribution and metabolic efficiency in rainfed crop production allometric relationship is considered as an adaptive strategy in the life history of higher plant stearns 1992 weiss 1999 crop would modify to adapt to changes of environment due to rfm system s improvement on micro ecological environment especially the growth environment of roots the soil microorganism diversity and activity can be improved massively li et al 2004 which help provide suitable soil temperature and nutrition for crop growth in present study the application of rfm significantly improved the hydrological table 1 and thermal conditions fig 2 and accordingly modified the allometric relationship under rfm farming pattern crop grew more robust with enough moisture nutrient and suitable temperature around roots in soil li et al 2004 chai et al 2014 at the same time leaves as assimilation organs whose photosynthetic function would become stronger leaf is a critical organ to perform the photosynthetic carbon assimilation and leaf biomass can be used as a physiological indicator to reflect metabolic rate in higher plant those physiological and biochemical response enabled the rfmb rfmt treatments to reduce slope value table 3 increase intercept value in the allometry equation between leaf biomass and aboveground biomass fig 3 it suggested that under the same size of aboveground biomass condition rfmb and rfmt allocated less energy and biomass to leaves to say fewer leaves can provide the energy or biomass to meet the demand required by whole plant growth in the same way rfmb and rfmt allocated more energy or biomass to grain yield in allometric relationship between grain and aboveground biomass table 4 according to fig 3 and table 3 the results indicated that more photosynthetic products would be allocated in leaves under a given biomass increase in aboveground part in ck to say less energy would be fixed in leaves under the same condition in mulching treatments particularly in rfmb and rfmt in control group ck more photosynthetic assimilation products were stored in leaves the other organs particularly reproductive organs acquired fewer products the opposite outcome was observed in mulching treatments this would benefit the improvements on grain yield and cwp another explanation is that crops with the same aboveground biomass can produce more grain yield in rfm treatments fig 4 as is well recognized allometric growth is closely associated with body size which is bound to change the allometry of leaf vs aboveground biomass as well as grain yield vs aboveground biomass weiner and thomas 1992 allometric protocol is a standardized tool to quantify size dependent eco physiological process particularly including biomass partitioning and ontogenesis qin et al 2013 due to the improvement of moisture and temperature conditions individuals would grow larger in the rfm treatments thus optimizing life history strategy and allocating more biomass or energy to reproductive organs this would ultimately obtain better fitness weiner et al 2009 this mechanism can be illuminated from the modification in the slope of r v relationship which was caused by the variation of altitude and nutrient status in the living environment of plants guo et al 2012 wang et al 2016 we first employed the principles of classic ecology to elucidate water productivity and yield formation in the rfm system the yield formation and water use can be mechanically explained by allometric relationship between leaf biomass and body size since its allometric exponent 1 was decreased under the rfm condition in this case relatively less energy was allocated in leaves also allometric relationship between grain yield and body size provided supporting evidence for the above phenomenon since its allometric exponent was increased in the rfm system and relatively more energy was transferred to reproductive organs in conclusion the rfm application significantly improved soil water availability and thereby boosted yield and cwpg in semiarid kenya 5 conclusions crops produce biomass and then allocate some of it to reproductive organs allometric protocols have become a standardized tool to quantify the characteristics of reproductive allocation and water use in the present study micro field rainwater harvesting system mfrhs substantially improved soil water storage and soil temperature in rainfed maize fields with the improvement on soil hydro thermal status grain yield and cwp can be increased massively under mfrhs the allometric relationships between leaf mass vs body size and seed mass vs body size were modified so as to allocate more mass or energy to grain filling for the first time we explained why the rfm system can improve grain yield at the population level using the allometric scaling theory i e metabolic theory in ecology in the allometry relationship between leaf biomass i e metabolic rate and body size the slope was significantly less than 1 regardless of treatments while the slopes in rfm treatments were increased in the allometric relationship between grain biomass and body size the slope was significantly less than 1 across all treatments while it was reduced in rfm treatments this phenomenon demonstrated that in rfm farming system more energy or mass would be shifted into grain yield and accordingly less energy or mass into leaves it also suggested that as a result of rfm application the functional trait of leaves would become more powerful and accordingly the same size leaves can support or supply larger individual body according to principle of size dependence metabolic theory individual maize body should grow larger under the conditions of rfm application therefore it can be argued that rfm farming system can modify the allometric exponent and then optimize energy allocation strategy for improving production and water use efficiency the findings would help further enhance the insight into the adaptability and feasibility of rfm farming system credit authorship contribution statement xiao feng zhang conceptualization data curation
