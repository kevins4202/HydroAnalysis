4145,accurate estimation of groundwater recharge in regions with limited water and thick unsaturated zones is challenging because of the limited water flux this study aims to employ multiple tracers and methods to investigate the mechanism of groundwater recharge in the thick loess deposits of china we collected soil samples under different vegetation unconfined groundwater and precipitation to determine the water isotopes δ2h δ18o and 3h chloride cl nitrate no3 then these tracers were employed to estimate recharge rates with methods considering the differences in shallow and deep rooted vegetation as well as those in unsaturated and saturated zones results indicated that local precipitation predominantly recharges groundwater through matrix flow at a velocity of 14 5 cm year 1 with the residence time of 200 years the recharge rates range from 0 to 37 mm year 1 equivalent to 0 7 of annual average precipitation however the deep rooted vegetation greatly reduced deep drainage compared with shallow rooted vegetation which will perturb the current hydraulic connectivity between unsaturated and saturated zones the multiple tracers and methods can complement each other to enhance the understanding of groundwater recharge mechanisms the indicated relationship between recharge form and land use suggests the urgency in developing strategies to balance the agroforestry system and water resource sustainability keywords groundwater recharge mechanism tracer methods loess covered regions 1 introduction groundwater greatly contributes to the livelihoods of billions of people and most irrigated agriculture worldwide chen et al 2004 doll et al 2014 gao et al 2018 gleeson et al 2010 however groundwater resources are limited and decreasing in quantity because of the increasing water demand doll et al 2014 scanlon et al 2005 particularly groundwater depletion has occurred across the globe abrishamchi et al 2020 hu et al 2019 rodell et al 2009 wada et al 2010 as such understanding how groundwater is recharged appears to be particularly important gleeson et al 2010 singh et al 2019 but the groundwater recharge mechanism remains unclear in most areas therefore investigation of groundwater recharge can provide essential information for the effective management and sustainable utilization of groundwater resources groundwater recharge is generally referred to deep drainage in unsaturated zone or total recharge in saturated zone and the two terms are used interchangeably in most studies cartwright et al 2020 sukhija et al 2003 the former refers to water flux that potentially enters groundwater through soil also as the potential recharge while the latter represents water reaching the water table also as the actual recharge huang et al 2020 however groundwater recharge is complex and affected by multiple factors i e vegetation soil conditions and climate barua et al 2021 cooper et al 1990 holman 2006 in particular as the deep drainage is relatively low in regions with thick unsaturated zones and arid climate the recharge forms can greatly affect groundwater recharge as such the magnitude of recharge may depend on the recharge mechanism huang et al 2019 sukhija et al 2003 specifically in the thick unsaturated zones it may take years or decades for precipitation to travel through the soils and reach the water table in terms of matrix flow huang et al 2020 phillips 1994 zimmermann et al 1966 however preferential flow only requires a few hours or days to recharge groundwater beven 2010 tan et al 2017b therefore it is primary to qualitatively identify recharge forms before estimating recharge rates of groundwater in the thick vadose zone previous studies indicated a large difference in the recharge forms rates of groundwater in space and time barua et al 2021 bedaso and wu 2021 jasechko et al 2014 scanlon et al 2006 for example in the loess plateau of china with thick loess cover several types of recharge forms have been detected from different sites i e piston flow huang et al 2020 preferential flow xu and chen 2010 yan and wang 1983 dual flow huang et al 2019 the piston flow has been concluded as the main recharge form because heterogeneous processes impossibly occur in the homogeneous loess deposits li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 yang and fu 2017 while the preferential flow can only occur in some limited regions with preferential paths including soil crevices root pore and fissures huang et al 2019 xiang et al 2019 however the recharge mechanisms remain controversial in the thick loess deposits and the recharge rates in groundwater are still unclear although the potential recharge can be directly measured by a lysimeter the actual recharge can hardly be accurately measured in regions with low water flux allison and hughes 1983 as such various direct and indirect approaches have been explored for this purpose including numerical models awan and ismaeel 2014 döll and fiedler 2008 li et al 2019a water table fluctuation jie et al 2011 leduc et al 1997 schilling et al 2004 hydrological budgets ahmed and umar 2008 maréchal et al 2006 and tracer techniques allision et al 1994 scanlon 2000 by contrast tracer techniques are superior in regions with low recharge rates allison and hughes 1983 barnes and allison 1988 three types of tracers i e labeled environmental and historical tracers have been widely used barnes and allison 1988 barua et al 2021 li et al 2019c scanlon et al 2006 yang et al 2018 however as the tracer based methods have uncertainties and limitations different techniques estimate recharge over different spatial and temporal and may yield large biases scanlon et al 2002 specifically chloride mass balance cmb method is suitable for those affected little by fertilization and root system allison and hughes 1978 scanlon et al 2005 while tracer peak method is based on the application of a high concentration of tracer in a given year allision et al 1994 huang et al 2016 especially tritium as an ideal tracer is superior in determining the potential recharge in the unsaturated zone allision et al 1994 li et al 2018 considering the applicability and prerequisite assumption of different tracers the combined utilization of multiple tracers associated with the corresponding methods is more robust for the identification and estimation of groundwater recharge barua et al 2021 scanlon et al 2006 the objectives of this study are to employ several methods associated with multiple environmental tracers i e δ2h δ18o cl and no3 and a historical tracer 3h for investigating recharge mechanism of groundwater in a thick loess covered region with limited water the novelty of this study may include two aspects i we employed multiple tracers and methods to complement each other to investigate the groundwater recharge in a dry region where the limited recharge hinders accurate estimation of recharge amount and ii we investigated the groundwater recharge in a region with thick unsaturated zone which may prevent its hydraulic connectivity with saturated zone and complicate the recharge conditions the techniques for recharge estimation and the results for recharge in regions with thick unsaturated zones may be referred by other similar studies to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted in the daning county 110 27 111 01 e and 36 16 36 36 n shanxi province of china fig 1 a b the study area in the tableland is located in the northern part of the loess plateau with a loess depth of 150 200 m zhu et al 2018 the percentages of sand silt and clay in soil are 56 5 23 7 and 19 8 respectively the soil bulk density is 1 25 g cm 3 from the bottom to the top the loess deposits include three layers i e wucheng q1 lishi q2 and malan loess q3 formed in different periods fig 1c liu et al 2014 the malan loess with a thickness of 20 30 m is distributed as the topsoil the lishi loess is loosened with a thickness of 100 150 m characterized by relatively large porosity and hydraulic conductivity of 0 14 0 46 m d 1 and is an ideal aquifer huang et al 2017b the wucheng loess has a thickness of 30 50 m commonly crops out at the bottom the groundwater has a water table of 40 to 60 m decreasing from the middle to the edge huang et al 2017b the tableland is deeply cut by the adjacent valley to bedrock with a flat surface and little surface runoff implying that the acquire cannot be recharged by lateral flow or rivers but can only receive water from precipitation the discharge of groundwater mainly occurs in the form of springs in gullies and exploitation the study area is situated in sub humid to semi arid zones and characterized as a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with mean annual temperature and precipitation of 10 4 c and 528 4 mm 53 of which falls in the rainy season july to september 1957 2017 the agricultural cultivation mainly includes farmland wheat maize and economic orchards apple peach and is typically rainfed agriculture without irrigation farmland is a long term land use type but has been partly converted to orchards since the 1990s 2 2 sampling and analyzing we collected soil samples considering vegetation with different root systems i e shallow and deep rooted vegetation the former refers to farmland f rotated with wheat and maize while the latter refers to apple and peach orchards with varying tree ages the fruit orchards were converted from farmlands and currently planted with apple trees of 8 a8 and 25 years old a25 and peach trees of 12 years old p12 respectively fig 1b based on the paired point sampling approach the maximum distance among the selected four sites was less than 1 8 km and had similar climate and soil conditions therefore the differences in the sampled soils are likely to originate from vegetation change which has been validated by our previous study in which the soil water profiles at five sites under the same land use type were similar huang et al 2018 and for legacy nitrate effects on groundwater quality ji et al 2020 as such it is not necessary to conduct replicated sampling for each land use type which will be further discussed later groundwater samples were collected once a month from a well while precipitation was collected for each wet day between september 2018 and april 2020 for soil sampling we collected soils at 20 cm intervals from each site in which the drilling depths ranged between 15 and 20 m in august 2018 the soil samples collected were divided into two parts one part was used for the measurement of gravimetric water contents and magnetic susceptibility and the other for measurement of isotope chloride and nitrate contents we extracted waters from the collected soils using a li 2100 vacuum distillation system lica china which is similar to other cryogenic vacuum extraction systems newberry et al 2017 orlowski et al 2018 specifically samples were heated at 100 c for 2 h to ensure complete evaporation and then the evaporative vapor was captured via the cryogenic system for isotope analysis we only extracted soil water under farmland for tritium analysis because the deep rooted vegetation had negative impacts on soil water huang et al 2018 li et al 2019a we used air dried soil 10 g to measure the magnetic susceptibility ms by a bartington ms2 system the cl and no3 concentrations of soil water was measured by adding ultrapure water 50 ml to an oven dried soil sample 10 g respectively samples were agitated intermittently for 8 h and filtered through 0 45 μm filters to collect the supernatant solution for the subsequent analysis using ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 thermal fisher scientific usa the isotopes δ18o and δ2h in soil water rainfall and groundwater were determined using lgr liwa v2 isotopic liquid water analyzer los gatos research inc usa with a precision of 0 5 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o for tritium analysis the extracted soil water of 8 ml was mixed with scintillation solution at a ratio of 8 12 for preparation then was stored in dark for 12 h before testing tritium concentration was calculated as count per minute cpm averaged over a counting duration of 500 min measured by a liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkin elmer with a detection limit of 2 0 tu a detailed description of this procedure can be found in li et al 2019c according to background values of no tritium water the measured cpm was subsequently transformed into tritium units tu with a precision of 1 tu 2 3 estimating groundwater recharge rates 2 3 1 identifying recharge form as for the estimation of deep drainage and actual recharge the determination of recharge forms is critical for groundwater recharge huang et al 2019 sukhija et al 2003 as such it is crucial to first identify the recharge forms specifically if the tracers in groundwater are under steady state and similar to those in deep soils or the tracers in soils resemble a parabolic curve it may suggest matrix flow for recharge allision et al 1994 zimmermann et al 1966 instead either large fluctuations for tracers in groundwater or high tritium contents detected in groundwater suggest preferential flow lin and wei 2006 tan et al 2017b 2 3 2 estimating potential recharge rates assuming water in soils moves downward by matrix flow the potential recharge can be approximated by the tracer peak method and mass balance method if they are affected little by root systems scanlon et al 2002 for the tracer peak depth method the peak values of tracers correspond to a year with large application of that tracer and the depth with tracer peak and the period from that year can be used to estimate infiltration rates eq 1 si and de jong 2007 for the tritium profile to reduce uncertainty for the determination of peak depth a modified gaussian function was used to fit the measured contents as a function of depth which resembles the solution to the convection dispersion equation for a conservative tracer dyck et al 2003 tao et al 2021 the peak depth is defined as the depth that has the highest contents and is determined from the fitted curve according to ottawa data clark and fritz 1997 the tritium peak values in soil profiles were assumed to correspond to the 1963 precipitation inputs from atomic bomb testing li et al 2019c lin and wei 2006 however the high cl contents in soil profiles are related to the original use of kcl fertilizers in1993 since then the cl contained in fertilizers was reduced and no longer applied because of their lack of function and salinization huang et al 2016 the overuse of nitrate fertilizers mainly began in 1980 while their applications were subsequently reduced due to the negative effects on environment and freshwater zhang et al 1996 as there is widespread aerobic condition and absence of organic matter in the loose loess layer in this area nitrate in the soil can be preserved and nitrate loss by denitrification can be neglected huang et al 2017b as such the potential recharge can be calculated using nitrate based on the tracer peak method 1 r m 0 z t θ z d z t where rm is potential recharge mm year 1 θ z is volumetric water content as the function of depth z cm3 cm 3 z t is the tracer peak depth cm t is the period from that year of tracer input year the cmb method has been widely used to estimate recharge rate allison and hughes 1978 huang et al 2017b however the cl contents in the unsaturated zone may be affected by fertilizer application if the impacts of fertilizer application can be excluded the cmb is still applicable for this purpose we attempted to identify a critical depth below which the chloride only comes from atmospheric inputs as the tritium profile presents the depth corresponding to 1963 precipitation tritium the cl below the tritium peak depth is not affected by fertilizer application starting in 1980 and can be used for recharge rate estimation eq 2 2 r l p cl p cl sw where rl and p respectively represent potential recharge and mean annual rainfall mm year 1 cl p and cl sw is cl concentrations in rainfall and soil water mg l 1 the cl contents in precipitation are considered as 1 0 0 4 mg l 1 demonstrated by li et al 2017 the tracer peak depth method and cmb method are applicable to the shallow rooted vegetation with little impact of roots however for the deep rooted vegetation the impacts of roots should be considered and the above methods cannot be directly applied as such we employed a newly developed method based on water balance between shallow and deep rooted vegetation where assuming soil water storage is under steady state for shallow rooted vegetation eq 3 zhang et al 2018 the soil water storage under shallow rooted vegetation is used as a reference to calculate the change in water storage under deep rooted vegetation because of root water uptake 3 r d r δ s w s where rd and r rm or rl are the potential recharge under deep rooted fruit trees and farmland mm year 1 δsws is the mean annual differences of water storage between deep rooted fruit trees and farmland mm year 1 2 3 3 estimating actual recharge rates the cmb method was also employed to estimate actual recharge rtot which is similar to eq 2 but the chloride concentration in soils cl sw was replaced with that in groundwater cl gw 4 r tot p cl p cl gw 3 results 3 1 soil profiles regardless of magnitudes the vertical variations in soil water contents under the four land covers were overall similar fig 2 a which may suggest that our assumption of the four sampling sites have similar soil conditions is reliable further the shapes of water profiles resemble that of magnetic susceptibility fig 2b as the magnetic susceptibility is well correlated with soil texture huang et al 2017b it confirms our aforementioned assumption and suggests that soil conditions may dominate the variability of water profiles however the smaller water contents with increasing stand ages of trees suggest older deep rooted plants consume more water specifically the soil water contents averaged across each profile were 14 2 2 8 12 9 2 9 10 4 3 2 8 5 1 9 under f a8 p12 and a25 respectively table 1 the δ18o profiles of soil water were varying with depths above 6 m but relatively stabilized in soils below 6 m fig 2c most profiles of cl no3 and 3h resembled parabolic curves with single peak values at varying depths fig 2d f suggesting the existence of matrix flow the peak depths were respectively 1 6 4 6 m 1 4 3 8 m and 8 m for cl no3 and 3h responding to fertilization application and nuclear bomb testing in specific the peak depths of cl and no3 were related to the utilization of kcl in 1993 and nitrate fertilizer in 1980 respectively the tritium peak corresponded to the precipitation tritium in 1963 as the land use changes occurred within 30 years the cl in the soil water below 8 m is not affected by fertilizer application and can be used for recharge estimation based on cmb method for the profiles of 8 20 m the tracer contents in soil water averaged for four land use types were 9 7 0 2 13 7 6 0 mg l 1 16 9 21 1 mg l 1 for δ18o cl no3 respectively table 1 the δ18o values were overall similar under four land use types while the values for cl and no3 were getting greater with increasing tree ages which may be caused by the smaller water contents these values can be used to compare with those in groundwater to qualitatively identify the recharge form 3 2 oxygen isotope chloride and nitrate dynamics in groundwater the contents of oxygen isotopes chloride and nitrate in groundwater showed small variations with time fig 3 specifically the δ18o values ranged from 9 5 to 8 5 with an average of 9 2 0 1 mean 1sd the cl contents had a range of 12 1 21 2 mg l 1 with an average of 14 3 3 0 mg l 1 the no3 contents ranged from 10 7 to 16 8 mg l 1 with an average of 14 4 2 0 mg l 1 table 1 compared with groundwater oxygen isotopes in precipitation had a large fluctuation with an average value of 8 8 3 8 but small fluctuations for chloride and nitrate the tracers in groundwater had overall little response to the fluctuation of tracers in precipitation further the average contents of the δ18o cl and no3 in groundwater were not significantly different from those of deep soil water below 8 m t test p 0 05 but significantly higher than those of precipitation t test p 0 05 in addition the tritium content in groundwater was detectable but low with values of 2 3 tu the results from groundwater may suggest that groundwater mostly originates from local precipitation older than 50 years in the form of matrix flow 3 3 comparisons of dual isotope space to further explore the relationships between precipitation soil water and groundwater a comparison was carried out in dual isotope space the isotopes of soil water and groundwater overall deviate from the lmwl local meteoric water line fig 4 suggested that they originated from rainfall but are affected by evaporation fractionation li et al 2017 yang and fu 2017 the isotopes in precipitation had large variations 2 3 to 18 3 for δ18o 18 4 to 131 4 for δ2h while those in deep soil water and groundwater were relatively stable 8 5 to 10 1 for δ18o 68 2 to 88 1 for δ2h by contrast the average isotope compositions of groundwater 9 2 for δ18o 70 7 for δ2h had no significant difference with soil water 9 4 for δ18o 78 3 for δ2h t test p 0 05 but significantly different from precipitation isotopes t test p 0 01 this indicated that the groundwater may originate from the deep drainage in the thick soils instead of direct replenishment of precipitation through preferential paths 3 4 recharge rates the above results from soil profiles and groundwater suggested that the recharge is predominated by matrix flow as such the tracer profiles can be used to calculate potential recharge rates under the shallow rooted vegetation i e farmland by 2018 the application of cl no3 and 3h has passed by 25 38 and 55 years respectively under farmland the infiltration velocity calculated with peak method was 6 4 3 7 and 14 5 cm year 1 for cl no3 and 3h respectively consequently the recharge rates estimated by eq 1 were 11 4 6 6 and 25 8 mm year 1 for cl no3 and 3h respectively accounting for 1 5 of mean annual precipitation the potential recharge rates from the tracer peak depth method represented the values after 1963 which may be referred to as modern potential recharge during the past 50 years the cl in soil profiles below 8 m was used to calculate potential recharge rates since it is not affected by fertilizer application the deep drainage under farmland estimated by the cmb method was 52 8 41 6 mm year 1 eq 2 equivalent to 10 7 of annual average precipitation the values represent recharge occurring before 1963 and can be referred to as long term potential recharge under farmland the long term recharge rates were greater than the modern recharge which may reflect the impacts of climate the actual recharge directly estimated from groundwater data was 37 0 17 2 mm year 1 eq 4 however it should be noted that the deep rooted vegetation would greatly reduce recharge with the modern or long term recharge as a baseline the recharge under deep rooted fruit trees ranged from 0 to 6 mm year 1 eq 3 4 discussions 4 1 uncertainties in recharge estimation based on these methods the estimated recharge ranged from 0 to 52 8 mm year 1 in this study overlapping with global synthesis estimated results 0 2 35 mm year 1 scanlon et al 2006 and agrees with most studies in the loess plateau table 2 the potential recharge based on peak method ranged between 6 6 and 25 8 mm year 1 which reflects water flux in the past 50 years however the recharge was lower than the actual recharge 37 0 17 2 mm year 1 which may attribute to precipitation and or temperature changes barua et al 2021 holman 2006 in particular the tritium tracer has been demonstrated to be superior for recharge form identification and recharge estimation huang et al 2020 lin and wei 2006 and that its peak can be observed clearly in soils in our study areas moreover our previous study assessing the uncertainties in tritium mass balance models for groundwater recharge estimation indicated that the tritium peak method presented reliable recharge values li et al 2019c assuming an episodic recharge may occur after rainstorm but they cannot reach water table in time because of thick unsaturated zones and low infiltration rates as such our estimated potential recharge based on the tritium peak method was reliable as for the cmb methods the largest uncertainty is variable cl concentration over time in precipitation barua et al 2021 cartwright et al 2020 in this study the range of 1 0 0 4 mg l 1 in uncertainty was used as chloride inputs in precipitation to estimate recharge rates li et al 2017 further to validate our assumption we calculated inversely the cl content in precipitation based on the estimated results by the tritium peak method the value of 0 7 mg l 1 fell overall within the interval which suggests the uncertainty interval of 1 0 0 4 mg l 1 was acceptable as chloride inputs in the atmosphere in this study area to accurately estimate recharge rates under deep rooted vegetation we combined the soil water balance method with tracer methods for the potential recharge estimation it may be confused whether is reliable for the combined methods firstly our study area has the same climate soil and hydrogeology further our results indicated the four sampling sites have similar soil conditions which can exclude spatial variations in soils as such the difference in soil water contents under different vegetation covers may only come from vegetation types change in addition soil water under shallow rooted plants can be easily recharged and maintains a long term water balance shi et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 based on the potential recharge under farmland the estimated recharge rates under deep rooted fruit trees should be reliable since water storage in soils was directly calculated from the observation 4 2 recharge mechanism generally speaking groundwater mainly originated from vertical infiltration of precipitation and lateral replenishment of streamflow in most areas mcdonnell et al 2018 tan et al 2017b taylor et al 2012 however it is unlikely that groundwater obtains lateral flow from rivers in the study region since the rivers are far lower than the water table in consequence groundwater may only originate from the recharge of local precipitation which has also been concluded in other loess regions of china huang et al 2020 tan et al 2017a however the groundwater may be recharged by a matrix and or preferential flow which is controversial in the thick loess deposits for example some studies indicated that matrix flow was the sole recharge form in the xifeng loess tableland huang et al 2020 huang et al 2017b while others concluded dual flows for groundwater recharge in the changwu and luochuan loess tableland huang et al 2019 xiang et al 2019 our tracer profiles indicated that the soil water moved downward by matrix flow in the daning loess tableland fig 3 which agrees with most studies in loess covered regions huang et al 2017b huang et al 2019 yang and fu 2017 further the similarity of the δ18o cl and no3 contents between deep soil profiles 8 m and groundwater and lower tritium contents in groundwater confirmed the connectivity between unsaturated and saturated zones in this study table 1 instead if preferential flow recharges groundwater the tritium contents in groundwater should be larger than 3 tu because the precipitation tritium contents range from 3 1 to 93 4 tu between 1953 and 2018 huang et al 2020 however the groundwater is tritium free in our study area lin and wei 2006 found that the tritium in groundwater 20 30 m depth from the surface had values of 34 4 43 4 tu while the soil water below 15 m was almost tritium free suggesting a rapid flow may occur for groundwater recharge in other regions of the loess plateau in particular our estimated long term potential recharge of 52 8 41 6 mm year 1 was a little higher than the total actual recharge 37 0 17 2 mm year 1 as a result the recharge form of groundwater should be matrix flow based on the results of this study and other studies in the loess plateau the matrix flow appears to be a common recharge form however the contributions of matrix flow to total recharge vary with study areas and sampling scales for example based on point scale sampling the matrix flow contributions are 62 in changwu xiang et al 2019 and 53 69 in luochuan huang et al 2019 further similar as this study matrix flow is regarded as the only recharge form in several locations huang et al 2020 huang et al 2017b based on watershed scale sampling matrix flow only accounted for 13 of total recharge for the hei river watershed li et al 2017 the mechanism behind the varied recharge mechanism across the loess plateau cannot be clarified yet theoretically the spatial scale may result in different recharge mechanisms because of the differences in microtopographic features manna et al 2019 sun et al 2015 in particular preferential paths e g cracks and fissures are highly visible at the edge of tablelands and hills which can be activated by surface runoff and or extreme rainfall events xiang et al 2019 as such investigating the subsurface connectivity and porous conditions for different spatial scales may be helpful in answering the spatial variations in recharge mechanisms 4 3 implications groundwater is important freshwater resource ensuring food security and water availability gleeson et al 2016 jasechko and perrone 2021 however the depletion of groundwater has intensified the pressure of water availability konikow and kendy 2005 rodell et al 2009 understanding the processes of groundwater recharge will be fundamentally important for developing reasonable strategies for groundwater management although subsurface water stored in thick unsaturated soils can provide substantial water sources for groundwater li et al 2019b the long transit time to the water table should be considered for water availability our results indicated that precipitation may require over two hundred years to reach the water table 40 m by matrix flow even if preferential flow observed in some landscapes can recharge groundwater its proportion was too small to meet the increasing water demand xiang et al 2019 it is thus urgent to implement effective management policies to maintain the sustainability of water resources with global warming increasing frequency and intensity of droughts will intensify the reliance on groundwater amanambu et al 2020 huang et al 2017a the demand for groundwater will be becoming greater because of growing population expansion of industrial and agricultural activities chen et al 2015 gleeson et al 2010 in particular afforestation had negative effects on groundwater recharge kim and jackson 2012 schwarzel et al 2019 our results indicated that the recharge rates under deep rooted fruit trees have been substantially reduced it will lead to the imbalance of green evapotranspiration and blue water groundwater recharge fluxes as well as that between unsaturated and saturated zones to enhance ecosystem functioning and achieve the sustainability of water availability the tradeoff between green and blue water should be paid great attention in the large scale afforestation areas especially in arid and semiarid regions 5 conclusions the combination of multiple tracers stable isotopes tritium chloride nitrate and methods was used for determining recharge forms and estimate recharge rates of groundwater in this study our results indicated that matrix flow is the predominant recharge form of groundwater in the thick vadose regions here only 0 7 of the annual mean precipitation contributed to groundwater with low renewal rates of groundwater 0 37 mm year 1 it may require hundreds of years for precipitation to reach the water table afforestation has negative effects on groundwater recharge especially deep rooted plants this highlights the need for further investigations on the tradeoff between water consumption of agroforestry ecosystems and the sustainability of water resources in large scale afforestation areas our findings will provide useful information for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the drought sensitive critical zone credit authorship contribution statement

4145,accurate estimation of groundwater recharge in regions with limited water and thick unsaturated zones is challenging because of the limited water flux this study aims to employ multiple tracers and methods to investigate the mechanism of groundwater recharge in the thick loess deposits of china we collected soil samples under different vegetation unconfined groundwater and precipitation to determine the water isotopes δ2h δ18o and 3h chloride cl nitrate no3 then these tracers were employed to estimate recharge rates with methods considering the differences in shallow and deep rooted vegetation as well as those in unsaturated and saturated zones results indicated that local precipitation predominantly recharges groundwater through matrix flow at a velocity of 14 5 cm year 1 with the residence time of 200 years the recharge rates range from 0 to 37 mm year 1 equivalent to 0 7 of annual average precipitation however the deep rooted vegetation greatly reduced deep drainage compared with shallow rooted vegetation which will perturb the current hydraulic connectivity between unsaturated and saturated zones the multiple tracers and methods can complement each other to enhance the understanding of groundwater recharge mechanisms the indicated relationship between recharge form and land use suggests the urgency in developing strategies to balance the agroforestry system and water resource sustainability keywords groundwater recharge mechanism tracer methods loess covered regions 1 introduction groundwater greatly contributes to the livelihoods of billions of people and most irrigated agriculture worldwide chen et al 2004 doll et al 2014 gao et al 2018 gleeson et al 2010 however groundwater resources are limited and decreasing in quantity because of the increasing water demand doll et al 2014 scanlon et al 2005 particularly groundwater depletion has occurred across the globe abrishamchi et al 2020 hu et al 2019 rodell et al 2009 wada et al 2010 as such understanding how groundwater is recharged appears to be particularly important gleeson et al 2010 singh et al 2019 but the groundwater recharge mechanism remains unclear in most areas therefore investigation of groundwater recharge can provide essential information for the effective management and sustainable utilization of groundwater resources groundwater recharge is generally referred to deep drainage in unsaturated zone or total recharge in saturated zone and the two terms are used interchangeably in most studies cartwright et al 2020 sukhija et al 2003 the former refers to water flux that potentially enters groundwater through soil also as the potential recharge while the latter represents water reaching the water table also as the actual recharge huang et al 2020 however groundwater recharge is complex and affected by multiple factors i e vegetation soil conditions and climate barua et al 2021 cooper et al 1990 holman 2006 in particular as the deep drainage is relatively low in regions with thick unsaturated zones and arid climate the recharge forms can greatly affect groundwater recharge as such the magnitude of recharge may depend on the recharge mechanism huang et al 2019 sukhija et al 2003 specifically in the thick unsaturated zones it may take years or decades for precipitation to travel through the soils and reach the water table in terms of matrix flow huang et al 2020 phillips 1994 zimmermann et al 1966 however preferential flow only requires a few hours or days to recharge groundwater beven 2010 tan et al 2017b therefore it is primary to qualitatively identify recharge forms before estimating recharge rates of groundwater in the thick vadose zone previous studies indicated a large difference in the recharge forms rates of groundwater in space and time barua et al 2021 bedaso and wu 2021 jasechko et al 2014 scanlon et al 2006 for example in the loess plateau of china with thick loess cover several types of recharge forms have been detected from different sites i e piston flow huang et al 2020 preferential flow xu and chen 2010 yan and wang 1983 dual flow huang et al 2019 the piston flow has been concluded as the main recharge form because heterogeneous processes impossibly occur in the homogeneous loess deposits li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 yang and fu 2017 while the preferential flow can only occur in some limited regions with preferential paths including soil crevices root pore and fissures huang et al 2019 xiang et al 2019 however the recharge mechanisms remain controversial in the thick loess deposits and the recharge rates in groundwater are still unclear although the potential recharge can be directly measured by a lysimeter the actual recharge can hardly be accurately measured in regions with low water flux allison and hughes 1983 as such various direct and indirect approaches have been explored for this purpose including numerical models awan and ismaeel 2014 döll and fiedler 2008 li et al 2019a water table fluctuation jie et al 2011 leduc et al 1997 schilling et al 2004 hydrological budgets ahmed and umar 2008 maréchal et al 2006 and tracer techniques allision et al 1994 scanlon 2000 by contrast tracer techniques are superior in regions with low recharge rates allison and hughes 1983 barnes and allison 1988 three types of tracers i e labeled environmental and historical tracers have been widely used barnes and allison 1988 barua et al 2021 li et al 2019c scanlon et al 2006 yang et al 2018 however as the tracer based methods have uncertainties and limitations different techniques estimate recharge over different spatial and temporal and may yield large biases scanlon et al 2002 specifically chloride mass balance cmb method is suitable for those affected little by fertilization and root system allison and hughes 1978 scanlon et al 2005 while tracer peak method is based on the application of a high concentration of tracer in a given year allision et al 1994 huang et al 2016 especially tritium as an ideal tracer is superior in determining the potential recharge in the unsaturated zone allision et al 1994 li et al 2018 considering the applicability and prerequisite assumption of different tracers the combined utilization of multiple tracers associated with the corresponding methods is more robust for the identification and estimation of groundwater recharge barua et al 2021 scanlon et al 2006 the objectives of this study are to employ several methods associated with multiple environmental tracers i e δ2h δ18o cl and no3 and a historical tracer 3h for investigating recharge mechanism of groundwater in a thick loess covered region with limited water the novelty of this study may include two aspects i we employed multiple tracers and methods to complement each other to investigate the groundwater recharge in a dry region where the limited recharge hinders accurate estimation of recharge amount and ii we investigated the groundwater recharge in a region with thick unsaturated zone which may prevent its hydraulic connectivity with saturated zone and complicate the recharge conditions the techniques for recharge estimation and the results for recharge in regions with thick unsaturated zones may be referred by other similar studies to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the field experiment was conducted in the daning county 110 27 111 01 e and 36 16 36 36 n shanxi province of china fig 1 a b the study area in the tableland is located in the northern part of the loess plateau with a loess depth of 150 200 m zhu et al 2018 the percentages of sand silt and clay in soil are 56 5 23 7 and 19 8 respectively the soil bulk density is 1 25 g cm 3 from the bottom to the top the loess deposits include three layers i e wucheng q1 lishi q2 and malan loess q3 formed in different periods fig 1c liu et al 2014 the malan loess with a thickness of 20 30 m is distributed as the topsoil the lishi loess is loosened with a thickness of 100 150 m characterized by relatively large porosity and hydraulic conductivity of 0 14 0 46 m d 1 and is an ideal aquifer huang et al 2017b the wucheng loess has a thickness of 30 50 m commonly crops out at the bottom the groundwater has a water table of 40 to 60 m decreasing from the middle to the edge huang et al 2017b the tableland is deeply cut by the adjacent valley to bedrock with a flat surface and little surface runoff implying that the acquire cannot be recharged by lateral flow or rivers but can only receive water from precipitation the discharge of groundwater mainly occurs in the form of springs in gullies and exploitation the study area is situated in sub humid to semi arid zones and characterized as a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with mean annual temperature and precipitation of 10 4 c and 528 4 mm 53 of which falls in the rainy season july to september 1957 2017 the agricultural cultivation mainly includes farmland wheat maize and economic orchards apple peach and is typically rainfed agriculture without irrigation farmland is a long term land use type but has been partly converted to orchards since the 1990s 2 2 sampling and analyzing we collected soil samples considering vegetation with different root systems i e shallow and deep rooted vegetation the former refers to farmland f rotated with wheat and maize while the latter refers to apple and peach orchards with varying tree ages the fruit orchards were converted from farmlands and currently planted with apple trees of 8 a8 and 25 years old a25 and peach trees of 12 years old p12 respectively fig 1b based on the paired point sampling approach the maximum distance among the selected four sites was less than 1 8 km and had similar climate and soil conditions therefore the differences in the sampled soils are likely to originate from vegetation change which has been validated by our previous study in which the soil water profiles at five sites under the same land use type were similar huang et al 2018 and for legacy nitrate effects on groundwater quality ji et al 2020 as such it is not necessary to conduct replicated sampling for each land use type which will be further discussed later groundwater samples were collected once a month from a well while precipitation was collected for each wet day between september 2018 and april 2020 for soil sampling we collected soils at 20 cm intervals from each site in which the drilling depths ranged between 15 and 20 m in august 2018 the soil samples collected were divided into two parts one part was used for the measurement of gravimetric water contents and magnetic susceptibility and the other for measurement of isotope chloride and nitrate contents we extracted waters from the collected soils using a li 2100 vacuum distillation system lica china which is similar to other cryogenic vacuum extraction systems newberry et al 2017 orlowski et al 2018 specifically samples were heated at 100 c for 2 h to ensure complete evaporation and then the evaporative vapor was captured via the cryogenic system for isotope analysis we only extracted soil water under farmland for tritium analysis because the deep rooted vegetation had negative impacts on soil water huang et al 2018 li et al 2019a we used air dried soil 10 g to measure the magnetic susceptibility ms by a bartington ms2 system the cl and no3 concentrations of soil water was measured by adding ultrapure water 50 ml to an oven dried soil sample 10 g respectively samples were agitated intermittently for 8 h and filtered through 0 45 μm filters to collect the supernatant solution for the subsequent analysis using ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 thermal fisher scientific usa the isotopes δ18o and δ2h in soil water rainfall and groundwater were determined using lgr liwa v2 isotopic liquid water analyzer los gatos research inc usa with a precision of 0 5 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o for tritium analysis the extracted soil water of 8 ml was mixed with scintillation solution at a ratio of 8 12 for preparation then was stored in dark for 12 h before testing tritium concentration was calculated as count per minute cpm averaged over a counting duration of 500 min measured by a liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkin elmer with a detection limit of 2 0 tu a detailed description of this procedure can be found in li et al 2019c according to background values of no tritium water the measured cpm was subsequently transformed into tritium units tu with a precision of 1 tu 2 3 estimating groundwater recharge rates 2 3 1 identifying recharge form as for the estimation of deep drainage and actual recharge the determination of recharge forms is critical for groundwater recharge huang et al 2019 sukhija et al 2003 as such it is crucial to first identify the recharge forms specifically if the tracers in groundwater are under steady state and similar to those in deep soils or the tracers in soils resemble a parabolic curve it may suggest matrix flow for recharge allision et al 1994 zimmermann et al 1966 instead either large fluctuations for tracers in groundwater or high tritium contents detected in groundwater suggest preferential flow lin and wei 2006 tan et al 2017b 2 3 2 estimating potential recharge rates assuming water in soils moves downward by matrix flow the potential recharge can be approximated by the tracer peak method and mass balance method if they are affected little by root systems scanlon et al 2002 for the tracer peak depth method the peak values of tracers correspond to a year with large application of that tracer and the depth with tracer peak and the period from that year can be used to estimate infiltration rates eq 1 si and de jong 2007 for the tritium profile to reduce uncertainty for the determination of peak depth a modified gaussian function was used to fit the measured contents as a function of depth which resembles the solution to the convection dispersion equation for a conservative tracer dyck et al 2003 tao et al 2021 the peak depth is defined as the depth that has the highest contents and is determined from the fitted curve according to ottawa data clark and fritz 1997 the tritium peak values in soil profiles were assumed to correspond to the 1963 precipitation inputs from atomic bomb testing li et al 2019c lin and wei 2006 however the high cl contents in soil profiles are related to the original use of kcl fertilizers in1993 since then the cl contained in fertilizers was reduced and no longer applied because of their lack of function and salinization huang et al 2016 the overuse of nitrate fertilizers mainly began in 1980 while their applications were subsequently reduced due to the negative effects on environment and freshwater zhang et al 1996 as there is widespread aerobic condition and absence of organic matter in the loose loess layer in this area nitrate in the soil can be preserved and nitrate loss by denitrification can be neglected huang et al 2017b as such the potential recharge can be calculated using nitrate based on the tracer peak method 1 r m 0 z t θ z d z t where rm is potential recharge mm year 1 θ z is volumetric water content as the function of depth z cm3 cm 3 z t is the tracer peak depth cm t is the period from that year of tracer input year the cmb method has been widely used to estimate recharge rate allison and hughes 1978 huang et al 2017b however the cl contents in the unsaturated zone may be affected by fertilizer application if the impacts of fertilizer application can be excluded the cmb is still applicable for this purpose we attempted to identify a critical depth below which the chloride only comes from atmospheric inputs as the tritium profile presents the depth corresponding to 1963 precipitation tritium the cl below the tritium peak depth is not affected by fertilizer application starting in 1980 and can be used for recharge rate estimation eq 2 2 r l p cl p cl sw where rl and p respectively represent potential recharge and mean annual rainfall mm year 1 cl p and cl sw is cl concentrations in rainfall and soil water mg l 1 the cl contents in precipitation are considered as 1 0 0 4 mg l 1 demonstrated by li et al 2017 the tracer peak depth method and cmb method are applicable to the shallow rooted vegetation with little impact of roots however for the deep rooted vegetation the impacts of roots should be considered and the above methods cannot be directly applied as such we employed a newly developed method based on water balance between shallow and deep rooted vegetation where assuming soil water storage is under steady state for shallow rooted vegetation eq 3 zhang et al 2018 the soil water storage under shallow rooted vegetation is used as a reference to calculate the change in water storage under deep rooted vegetation because of root water uptake 3 r d r δ s w s where rd and r rm or rl are the potential recharge under deep rooted fruit trees and farmland mm year 1 δsws is the mean annual differences of water storage between deep rooted fruit trees and farmland mm year 1 2 3 3 estimating actual recharge rates the cmb method was also employed to estimate actual recharge rtot which is similar to eq 2 but the chloride concentration in soils cl sw was replaced with that in groundwater cl gw 4 r tot p cl p cl gw 3 results 3 1 soil profiles regardless of magnitudes the vertical variations in soil water contents under the four land covers were overall similar fig 2 a which may suggest that our assumption of the four sampling sites have similar soil conditions is reliable further the shapes of water profiles resemble that of magnetic susceptibility fig 2b as the magnetic susceptibility is well correlated with soil texture huang et al 2017b it confirms our aforementioned assumption and suggests that soil conditions may dominate the variability of water profiles however the smaller water contents with increasing stand ages of trees suggest older deep rooted plants consume more water specifically the soil water contents averaged across each profile were 14 2 2 8 12 9 2 9 10 4 3 2 8 5 1 9 under f a8 p12 and a25 respectively table 1 the δ18o profiles of soil water were varying with depths above 6 m but relatively stabilized in soils below 6 m fig 2c most profiles of cl no3 and 3h resembled parabolic curves with single peak values at varying depths fig 2d f suggesting the existence of matrix flow the peak depths were respectively 1 6 4 6 m 1 4 3 8 m and 8 m for cl no3 and 3h responding to fertilization application and nuclear bomb testing in specific the peak depths of cl and no3 were related to the utilization of kcl in 1993 and nitrate fertilizer in 1980 respectively the tritium peak corresponded to the precipitation tritium in 1963 as the land use changes occurred within 30 years the cl in the soil water below 8 m is not affected by fertilizer application and can be used for recharge estimation based on cmb method for the profiles of 8 20 m the tracer contents in soil water averaged for four land use types were 9 7 0 2 13 7 6 0 mg l 1 16 9 21 1 mg l 1 for δ18o cl no3 respectively table 1 the δ18o values were overall similar under four land use types while the values for cl and no3 were getting greater with increasing tree ages which may be caused by the smaller water contents these values can be used to compare with those in groundwater to qualitatively identify the recharge form 3 2 oxygen isotope chloride and nitrate dynamics in groundwater the contents of oxygen isotopes chloride and nitrate in groundwater showed small variations with time fig 3 specifically the δ18o values ranged from 9 5 to 8 5 with an average of 9 2 0 1 mean 1sd the cl contents had a range of 12 1 21 2 mg l 1 with an average of 14 3 3 0 mg l 1 the no3 contents ranged from 10 7 to 16 8 mg l 1 with an average of 14 4 2 0 mg l 1 table 1 compared with groundwater oxygen isotopes in precipitation had a large fluctuation with an average value of 8 8 3 8 but small fluctuations for chloride and nitrate the tracers in groundwater had overall little response to the fluctuation of tracers in precipitation further the average contents of the δ18o cl and no3 in groundwater were not significantly different from those of deep soil water below 8 m t test p 0 05 but significantly higher than those of precipitation t test p 0 05 in addition the tritium content in groundwater was detectable but low with values of 2 3 tu the results from groundwater may suggest that groundwater mostly originates from local precipitation older than 50 years in the form of matrix flow 3 3 comparisons of dual isotope space to further explore the relationships between precipitation soil water and groundwater a comparison was carried out in dual isotope space the isotopes of soil water and groundwater overall deviate from the lmwl local meteoric water line fig 4 suggested that they originated from rainfall but are affected by evaporation fractionation li et al 2017 yang and fu 2017 the isotopes in precipitation had large variations 2 3 to 18 3 for δ18o 18 4 to 131 4 for δ2h while those in deep soil water and groundwater were relatively stable 8 5 to 10 1 for δ18o 68 2 to 88 1 for δ2h by contrast the average isotope compositions of groundwater 9 2 for δ18o 70 7 for δ2h had no significant difference with soil water 9 4 for δ18o 78 3 for δ2h t test p 0 05 but significantly different from precipitation isotopes t test p 0 01 this indicated that the groundwater may originate from the deep drainage in the thick soils instead of direct replenishment of precipitation through preferential paths 3 4 recharge rates the above results from soil profiles and groundwater suggested that the recharge is predominated by matrix flow as such the tracer profiles can be used to calculate potential recharge rates under the shallow rooted vegetation i e farmland by 2018 the application of cl no3 and 3h has passed by 25 38 and 55 years respectively under farmland the infiltration velocity calculated with peak method was 6 4 3 7 and 14 5 cm year 1 for cl no3 and 3h respectively consequently the recharge rates estimated by eq 1 were 11 4 6 6 and 25 8 mm year 1 for cl no3 and 3h respectively accounting for 1 5 of mean annual precipitation the potential recharge rates from the tracer peak depth method represented the values after 1963 which may be referred to as modern potential recharge during the past 50 years the cl in soil profiles below 8 m was used to calculate potential recharge rates since it is not affected by fertilizer application the deep drainage under farmland estimated by the cmb method was 52 8 41 6 mm year 1 eq 2 equivalent to 10 7 of annual average precipitation the values represent recharge occurring before 1963 and can be referred to as long term potential recharge under farmland the long term recharge rates were greater than the modern recharge which may reflect the impacts of climate the actual recharge directly estimated from groundwater data was 37 0 17 2 mm year 1 eq 4 however it should be noted that the deep rooted vegetation would greatly reduce recharge with the modern or long term recharge as a baseline the recharge under deep rooted fruit trees ranged from 0 to 6 mm year 1 eq 3 4 discussions 4 1 uncertainties in recharge estimation based on these methods the estimated recharge ranged from 0 to 52 8 mm year 1 in this study overlapping with global synthesis estimated results 0 2 35 mm year 1 scanlon et al 2006 and agrees with most studies in the loess plateau table 2 the potential recharge based on peak method ranged between 6 6 and 25 8 mm year 1 which reflects water flux in the past 50 years however the recharge was lower than the actual recharge 37 0 17 2 mm year 1 which may attribute to precipitation and or temperature changes barua et al 2021 holman 2006 in particular the tritium tracer has been demonstrated to be superior for recharge form identification and recharge estimation huang et al 2020 lin and wei 2006 and that its peak can be observed clearly in soils in our study areas moreover our previous study assessing the uncertainties in tritium mass balance models for groundwater recharge estimation indicated that the tritium peak method presented reliable recharge values li et al 2019c assuming an episodic recharge may occur after rainstorm but they cannot reach water table in time because of thick unsaturated zones and low infiltration rates as such our estimated potential recharge based on the tritium peak method was reliable as for the cmb methods the largest uncertainty is variable cl concentration over time in precipitation barua et al 2021 cartwright et al 2020 in this study the range of 1 0 0 4 mg l 1 in uncertainty was used as chloride inputs in precipitation to estimate recharge rates li et al 2017 further to validate our assumption we calculated inversely the cl content in precipitation based on the estimated results by the tritium peak method the value of 0 7 mg l 1 fell overall within the interval which suggests the uncertainty interval of 1 0 0 4 mg l 1 was acceptable as chloride inputs in the atmosphere in this study area to accurately estimate recharge rates under deep rooted vegetation we combined the soil water balance method with tracer methods for the potential recharge estimation it may be confused whether is reliable for the combined methods firstly our study area has the same climate soil and hydrogeology further our results indicated the four sampling sites have similar soil conditions which can exclude spatial variations in soils as such the difference in soil water contents under different vegetation covers may only come from vegetation types change in addition soil water under shallow rooted plants can be easily recharged and maintains a long term water balance shi et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 based on the potential recharge under farmland the estimated recharge rates under deep rooted fruit trees should be reliable since water storage in soils was directly calculated from the observation 4 2 recharge mechanism generally speaking groundwater mainly originated from vertical infiltration of precipitation and lateral replenishment of streamflow in most areas mcdonnell et al 2018 tan et al 2017b taylor et al 2012 however it is unlikely that groundwater obtains lateral flow from rivers in the study region since the rivers are far lower than the water table in consequence groundwater may only originate from the recharge of local precipitation which has also been concluded in other loess regions of china huang et al 2020 tan et al 2017a however the groundwater may be recharged by a matrix and or preferential flow which is controversial in the thick loess deposits for example some studies indicated that matrix flow was the sole recharge form in the xifeng loess tableland huang et al 2020 huang et al 2017b while others concluded dual flows for groundwater recharge in the changwu and luochuan loess tableland huang et al 2019 xiang et al 2019 our tracer profiles indicated that the soil water moved downward by matrix flow in the daning loess tableland fig 3 which agrees with most studies in loess covered regions huang et al 2017b huang et al 2019 yang and fu 2017 further the similarity of the δ18o cl and no3 contents between deep soil profiles 8 m and groundwater and lower tritium contents in groundwater confirmed the connectivity between unsaturated and saturated zones in this study table 1 instead if preferential flow recharges groundwater the tritium contents in groundwater should be larger than 3 tu because the precipitation tritium contents range from 3 1 to 93 4 tu between 1953 and 2018 huang et al 2020 however the groundwater is tritium free in our study area lin and wei 2006 found that the tritium in groundwater 20 30 m depth from the surface had values of 34 4 43 4 tu while the soil water below 15 m was almost tritium free suggesting a rapid flow may occur for groundwater recharge in other regions of the loess plateau in particular our estimated long term potential recharge of 52 8 41 6 mm year 1 was a little higher than the total actual recharge 37 0 17 2 mm year 1 as a result the recharge form of groundwater should be matrix flow based on the results of this study and other studies in the loess plateau the matrix flow appears to be a common recharge form however the contributions of matrix flow to total recharge vary with study areas and sampling scales for example based on point scale sampling the matrix flow contributions are 62 in changwu xiang et al 2019 and 53 69 in luochuan huang et al 2019 further similar as this study matrix flow is regarded as the only recharge form in several locations huang et al 2020 huang et al 2017b based on watershed scale sampling matrix flow only accounted for 13 of total recharge for the hei river watershed li et al 2017 the mechanism behind the varied recharge mechanism across the loess plateau cannot be clarified yet theoretically the spatial scale may result in different recharge mechanisms because of the differences in microtopographic features manna et al 2019 sun et al 2015 in particular preferential paths e g cracks and fissures are highly visible at the edge of tablelands and hills which can be activated by surface runoff and or extreme rainfall events xiang et al 2019 as such investigating the subsurface connectivity and porous conditions for different spatial scales may be helpful in answering the spatial variations in recharge mechanisms 4 3 implications groundwater is important freshwater resource ensuring food security and water availability gleeson et al 2016 jasechko and perrone 2021 however the depletion of groundwater has intensified the pressure of water availability konikow and kendy 2005 rodell et al 2009 understanding the processes of groundwater recharge will be fundamentally important for developing reasonable strategies for groundwater management although subsurface water stored in thick unsaturated soils can provide substantial water sources for groundwater li et al 2019b the long transit time to the water table should be considered for water availability our results indicated that precipitation may require over two hundred years to reach the water table 40 m by matrix flow even if preferential flow observed in some landscapes can recharge groundwater its proportion was too small to meet the increasing water demand xiang et al 2019 it is thus urgent to implement effective management policies to maintain the sustainability of water resources with global warming increasing frequency and intensity of droughts will intensify the reliance on groundwater amanambu et al 2020 huang et al 2017a the demand for groundwater will be becoming greater because of growing population expansion of industrial and agricultural activities chen et al 2015 gleeson et al 2010 in particular afforestation had negative effects on groundwater recharge kim and jackson 2012 schwarzel et al 2019 our results indicated that the recharge rates under deep rooted fruit trees have been substantially reduced it will lead to the imbalance of green evapotranspiration and blue water groundwater recharge fluxes as well as that between unsaturated and saturated zones to enhance ecosystem functioning and achieve the sustainability of water availability the tradeoff between green and blue water should be paid great attention in the large scale afforestation areas especially in arid and semiarid regions 5 conclusions the combination of multiple tracers stable isotopes tritium chloride nitrate and methods was used for determining recharge forms and estimate recharge rates of groundwater in this study our results indicated that matrix flow is the predominant recharge form of groundwater in the thick vadose regions here only 0 7 of the annual mean precipitation contributed to groundwater with low renewal rates of groundwater 0 37 mm year 1 it may require hundreds of years for precipitation to reach the water table afforestation has negative effects on groundwater recharge especially deep rooted plants this highlights the need for further investigations on the tradeoff between water consumption of agroforestry ecosystems and the sustainability of water resources in large scale afforestation areas our findings will provide useful information for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the drought sensitive critical zone credit authorship contribution statement

environmental and mining engineering university of adelaide adelaide 5005 sa australia corresponding author probabilistic predictions of streamflow are important in many environmental modelling applications these predictions are often constructed using hydrological models combined with residual error models to describe predictive uncertainty however many objective functions commonly used to calibrate hydrological models make implicit assumptions that do not match the well known heteroscedasticity and skewness of residual errors using a daily scale hydrological model we demonstrate that the use of such inconsistent objective functions in combination with a commonly used residual error model introduces spurious flow dependencies in the mean of residual errors which in turn leads to poor quality probabilistic predictions we then use residual error diagnostics to develop a simple enhanced error model where the error mean depends linearly on the transformed simulated streamflow the enhanced error model is compared with a commonly used reference error model that assumes a zero error mean the empirical case study employs 54 perennial australian catchments the hydrological model gr4j 9 common objective functions and 4 performance metrics reliability precision volumetric bias and errors in the flow duration curve the enhanced error model overcomes the loss of performance caused by inconsistent objective functions and achieves probabilistic predictions comparable to those obtained using consistent objective functions these findings hold for all objective functions used in the case study the enhanced residual error model is expected to facilitate the adoption of probabilistic predictions in the hydrological modelling community in particular it can be used to achieve high quality probabilistic predictions from hydrological models calibrated with a wide range of common objective functions keywords hydrological modelling probabilistic prediction daily streamflow prediction objective function residual error model objective function consistency 1 introduction streamflow predictions produced by hydrological models are widely used in practical environmental and water resource applications including flood and drought risk estimation water resource management water quality assessment and forecasting beck 1985 cloke pappenberger 2009 schewe et al 2014 badham et al 2019 streamflow predictions obtained using hydrological models are inherently uncertain due to often substantial simplifications made when describing natural systems beven 1989 oreskes et al 1994 increasingly hydrological studies and operational services are expected to report the uncertainty in the streamflow predictions along with the predictions themselves welsh et al 2013 ball et al 2016 however the majority of existing conceptual and physical hydrological models e g gr4j hymod hydrogeosphere and others moore 1985 perrin et al 2003 brunner simmons 2012 are deterministic and provide only point predictions probabilistic predictions offer the potential to describe predictive uncertainty e g by providing more information on the likely range of streamflow and can thereby avoid the false sense of security associated with point streamflow predictions biondi et al 2010 farmer vogel 2016 despite the attractiveness of probabilistic methods for describing uncertainty there are several current barriers to the routine inclusion of probabilistic predictions in practical environmental modelling and decision making these barriers include a perceived complexity in generating probabilistic predictions and difficulties in their interpretation pappenberger beven 2006 one such barrier investigated in this study is the impact of the objective function used to calibrate the hydrological model on the ability to achieve high quality e g reliable and precise probabilistic predictions the analyses focus on daily scale predictions which are common in contemporary practice a common approach for probabilistic uncertainty quantification is the residual error model approach in this approach a probabilistic error model the residual error model is added to the deterministic predictions of a hydrological model to represent the combined contribution of multiple sources of errors such as data and model structure errors sorooshian et al 1983 schoups vrugt 2010 evin et al 2014 practical implementations of the residual error model approach typically follow the post processor strategy where the hydrological model parameters are estimated first using an objective function followed by a separate estimation of residual error model parameters engeland et al 2010 evin et al 2014 li et al 2016 mcinerney et al 2018 the more classical joint approach attempts to estimate all parameters simultaneously using a single likelihood function bates campbell 2001 evin et al 2013 smith et al 2015 the post processor approach is particularly attractive for practical applications because at least in principle it enables probabilistic predictions to be generated using hydrological models calibrated with user specified objective functions substantial previous research has identified robust residual error models that produce high quality probabilistic predictions kuczera 1983b smith marshall 2010 wang et al 2012 del giudice et al 2013 cheng et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 to achieve high quality probabilistic predictions the residual error model should provide a realistic description of the statistical properties of the errors in the deterministic predictions common statistical properties of residual errors include but are not limited to their mean heteroscedasticity i e larger errors in larger flows asymmetry skewness and temporal persistence i e multiple consecutive errors with the same sign and similar magnitude sorooshian dracup 1980 bates campbell 2001 evin et al 2013 smith et al 2015 sun et al 2017 residual error models found to perform well at the daily scale include those that transform streamflow using the box cox transformation mcinerney et al 2017 note that the resulting probabilistic predictions should capture not only the time varying properties of observed streamflow but also its overall marginal distribution properties such as the flow duration curve farmer vogel 2016 the considerations behind the choice of an objective function to calibrate the hydrological model is typically quite different from the considerations behind the choice of a residual error model to describe predictive uncertainty the objective function used to calibrate the hydrological model quantifies the goodness of fit between the model and the observed data most hydrological objective functions are selected according to the modelling objectives and the properties of residual errors are seldom considered for example the ubiquitous nash sutcliffe efficiency or nse nash sutcliffe 1970 is used when the interest is primarily in high flows square root and log transformations are often applied to streamflow within the nse objective function to give more weight to low flows dawdy lichty 1968 chapman 1970 pushpalatha et al 2012 the kling gupta efficiency or kge gupta et al 2009 is a more recent objective function based on an explicitly weighted combination of relative variability correlation and bias and is rapidly growing in popularity fowler et al 2016 garcia et al 2017 mizukami et al 2019 some applications use composite objectives functions to balance multiple objectives for example objective functions that combine an nse term and a bias term have been proposed to focus on high flow predictions while constraining mean water balance errors viney et al 2009 vaze et al 2010 in the post processor approach the quality of probabilistic predictions can be expected to depend on both the residual error model and the objective function from a statistical perspective all objective functions make explicit or implicit assumptions about the properties of residual errors for example using the nse goodness of fit metric as an objective function tacitly assumes that errors have a zero mean are homoscedastic and symmetric gaussian with no temporal persistence charnes et al 1976 kavetski 2018 mcinerney et al 2018 these assumptions are inconsistent with known properties of hydrological model residuals and of robust residual error models which typically include heteroscedasticity skewness and persistence this study uses the term objective function inconsistency specifically to describe the modelling scenario in which the assumptions about the mean heteroscedasticity and skewness made by the objective function are different from the assumptions about the mean heteroscedasticity and skewness made by the residual error model and hence do not capture key characteristics of the actual residual errors a typical example of objective function inconsistency relevant to our study and broader practice arises if the hydrological model parameters are calibrated using an objective function without streamflow transformations but predictive uncertainty is estimated using a residual error model that applies a box cox transformation which assumes that the errors are heteroscedastic and skewed these considerations lead to the first question do differences inconsistencies between the assumptions of the objective function and the assumptions of the residual error model impact on the quality of the probabilistic predictions this question is by no means trivial for example evin et al 2014 reported more robust practical performance when the persistence of residual errors was reflected in the residual error model but ignored in the hydrological objective function mcinerney et al 2018 proposed a simple post processor approach that combined least squares and method of moments calibration but limited its analysis to consistent objective functions to our knowledge no studies have evaluated the impact of inconsistent assumptions in the hydrological objective function and the residual error model on probabilistic predictions this is the first key research gap addressed in this study previous studies provide insights into modifications to the residual error model that can assist with predictive quality in scenarios of objective function inconsistency for example the error reduction and representation in stages erris approach developed by li et al 2016 used a four stage calibration approach that included a flow dependent bias correction to the residual error model note that erris is developed for day ahead forecasts and is therefore more complex than typical non forecasting applications erris was trialled with an inconsistent in the terminology of this study hydrological objective function nse and its correction term is of interest here the results of the erris study showed promise however evaluation was limited to a single hydrological objective function and a small number of catchments in another study jiang et al 2019 explored time varying representations of the mean variance and distributional form of residual errors that study was also limited by scale to a single hydrological model objective function and catchment these two studies demonstrate that modifications to the mean parameter of the residual error model warrant investigation however neither study examined if their respective approaches were robust for a wide range of hydrological objective functions and a wide range of catchments this leads to the second research question how robust are modifications or enhancements to the residual error model across a wide range of catchments and a wide range of hydrological model objective functions the study has the following aims 1 understand and evaluate the impact of objective function inconsistency on the quality of probabilistic predictions 2 introduce a simple enhancement to residual error modelling that produces high quality probabilistic predictions when the hydrological objective function is inconsistent for a wide range of catchments and hydrological objective functions a broader objective of this work is to facilitate the uptake of probabilistic predictions by researchers and practitioners in hydrology and water resources hence there is an emphasis on simple and practical modelling approaches that can be incorporated with relatively minor effort into existing and future applications the paper is organised as follows section 2 outlines the theory of probabilistic models used in this work section 3 describes the case study data and methods including the selection of catchments hydrological model objective functions performance metrics and residual error diagnostics section 4 reports the case study results section 5 discusses the findings and provides recommendations for current applications and future research and section 6 summarises the key conclusions of the study 2 theory 2 1 general model setup first let q t θ h denote streamflow predictions at time t obtained using a deterministic hydrological model h with hydrological parameters θ h and inputs x 1 t up to time t 1 q t θ h h θ h x 1 t second define a probabilistic model of streamflow at time t denoted as q t θ x 1 t which is formulated to represent predictive uncertainty due to errors in the data and model structure note that its parameters θ comprise parameters of the deterministic model h as well as any additional parameters of the residual error model the relationship between the deterministic streamflow predictions q t θ h and the probabilistic model of streamflow q t is specified by the residual error model here we formulate the residual error model as additive in transformed space 2 z q t θ z z q t θ h θ z η t where η t is a random error term residual error at time t and z is a transformation function with parameters θ z in this study we use the box cox transformation 3 z q θ z q a λ 1 λ if λ 0 log q a if λ 0 with parameters θ z λ a where λ is a power parameter and a is a shift or offset parameter box cox 1964 the transformation parameters are fixed a priori at λ 0 2 and a 0 in accordance with recommendations made in earlier work to achieve a robust residual error model and high quality probabilistic predictions mcinerney et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 the resulting residual error model is hereafter referred to as the bc02 residual error model the residuals are assumed to be autocorrelated in time which is represented using a first order autoregressive ar1 model sorooshian 1981 bates campbell 2001 evin et al 2014 4 η t μ t ϕ η η t 1 μ t 1 y t where ϕ η is the autoregressive parameter μ t is the mean of residuals at time t and y t is the innovation random component or noise term at time t the innovations are assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation σ y 2 5 y t n 0 σ y 2 the parameters of the residual error model will be denoted collectively as θ η θ μ σ y ϕ η where θ μ denotes parameters of the model for the mean μ t we consider two options for representing the mean μ t which in turn leads to two distinct residual error models model a reference residual error model the reference residual error model makes the common assumption that the mean μ t is constant in time and equal to zero i e μ t 0 kuczera 1983a evin et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 2018 sun et al 2017 model b enhanced residual error model an enhanced residual error model is constructed by assuming that the residual mean μ t is flow dependent and hence varies in time we assume a linear dependence with respect to the transformed streamflow li et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 6 μ t α β z q t θ h θ z where parameters α and β specify the intercept and slope respectively these parameters are grouped as θ μ α β note that the reference residual error model represents a special case of the enhanced residual error model with α 0 and β 0 2 2 model calibration the hydrological model and residual error models are calibrated using the two stage approach outlined in mcinerney et al 2018 in stage 1 the hydrological model parameters θ h are estimated using an objective function and in stage 2 the residual error model parameters θ η are estimated using the method of moments this procedure represents a post processor approach for uncertainty quantification it enables practitioners to undertake uncertainty estimation and probabilistic prediction using hydrological models calibrated with their own objective functions mcinerney et al 2018 in the remainder of the text we use the term scheme that is a modelling scheme to denote a specific combination of objective function stage 1 and residual error model stage 2 2 2 1 stage 1 hydrological model calibration stage 1 calibrates the hydrological model parameters θ h to the observed streamflow q according to an objective function φ 7 θ h argmax θ h φ q q θ h note that transformations such as the box cox transformation in equation 3 may be applied to the observed and deterministic simulated streamflow during stage 1 of the calibration process it is hence convenient to define stage 1 residual errors as 8 η t 1 z q t θ z 1 z q t θ h θ z 1 where θ z 1 are fixed transformation parameters the superscript refers to stage 1 note that these residuals are not used explicitly in calibration or prediction and indeed may or may not even appear directly in the objective function however their properties are pertinent to this study because they allow us to explore the impact of stage 1 assumptions on stage 2 residuals 2 2 2 stage 2 residual error model calibration stage 2 estimates the parameters of the residual error model given the hydrological model parameters θ h estimated in stage 1 and the transformation parameters θ z 2 fixed a priori in stage 2 the stage 2 residual errors η t are computed as 9 η t 2 z q t θ z 2 z q t θ h θ z 2 the transformation parameters θ z 2 used in stage 2 need not take the same values as the transformation parameters θ z 1 used in stage 1 indeed schemes with θ z 1 θ z 2 are of central interest to this study because they represent typical examples of using an inconsistent objective function see section 2 3 parameters θ μ α β are estimated as follows model a reference residual error model the mean is assumed to be equal to zero i e μ t 0 therefore the intercept α and slope β are also both equal to zero model b enhanced residual error model the intercept α and slope β are estimated using linear regression of computed residuals η t on transformed deterministic streamflow z q t θ h θ z 2 the flow dependent mean μ t is then calculated at each time step t using equation 6 the remaining parameters σ y and ϕ η are then estimated using the method of moments as described in appendix a note that stage 2 computations are very fast for both the reference and enhanced residual error models because the hydrological model and its residual errors are both fixed as such stage 2 does not require any new runs of the hydrological model 2 3 objective function consistency and inconsistency in this study a scheme is said to be consistent if the same assumptions regarding the properties of residual errors mean heteroscedasticity and skewness are made by the hydrological objective function in stage 1 and the residual error model in stage 2 this scenario will be referred to as using a consistent objective function in this study our focus is on the consistency of objective functions with respect to common residual error model s established as well performing in previous work an example of a consistent scheme is given as follows stage 1 uses the nse objective function with observed and simulated streamflow transformed using the box cox transformation with parameters λ 0 2 and a 0 and stage 2 uses the bc02 residual error model which also has transformation parameters λ 0 2 and a 0 which was established as well performing in previous studies mcinerney et al 2017 the equivalence of residual error assumptions in stages 1 and 2 of this scheme was shown in previous work e g mcinerney et al 2018 supplementary material s2 in contrast an example of an inconsistent scheme is given by stage 1 using the nse objective function without a streamflow transformation but stage 2 using the bc02 residual error model the difference in transformation parameter values in stages 1 and 2 i e λ 1 1 but λ 2 0 2 corresponds to different assumptions about heteroscedasticity and skewness being made in the two calibration stages inconsistency can also arise from the objective function structure rather than solely from the choice of streamflow transformation for example using the pearson correlation between observed and predicted streamflow as the objective function does not assume that the residuals have a zero mean hence the pearson correlation objective function is inconsistent with a reference residual error model that makes the zero mean assumption even if the same transformation θ z 1 θ z 2 could theoretically be applied in the two calibration stages for some objective functions such as the kling gupta efficiency kge described in gupta et al 2009 the corresponding probabilistic assumptions may still be unknown in which case we consider the objective function to be inconsistent by default the schemes used in this work and their classification as consistent or inconsistent are given in section 3 4 2 4 probabilistic predictions the predictive distribution of streamflow is given by the probabilistic model q t θ x 1 t defined in section 2 1 i e using the combined hydrological model and residual error model with estimated parameters θ and inputs x at time step t assuming the deterministic streamflow prediction q t θ h has already been computed a predictive replicate q t pred r is generated as follows 1 sample innovations from a gaussian distribution 10 y t r n 0 σ y 2 2 calculate residuals using equation 4 11 η t r μ t ϕ η η t 1 r μ t 1 y t r note that for t 1 we sample η 1 r n 0 σ η 2 3 apply the inverse transformation 12 q t pred r z 1 z q t θ h θ z 2 η t r θ z 2 the complete set of all predictive replicates i e the predictive distribution is 13 q pred q t pred r t 1 t r 1 n r where n r is the number of replicates 3 case study material and methods 3 1 catchments and observed data the case study considers 54 australian catchments with a relatively diverse range of hydroclimatology fig 1 shows the locations of these catchments with the köppen hydroclimate zones the majority of catchments are in the temperate and sub tropical zones and there is at least one catchment in every other zone except for the arid central deserts daily rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet and streamflow time series are obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology hydrologic reference stations hrs dataset http www bom gov au water hrs for each catchment 10 years of continuous observed data is selected according to the following criteria i no missing data ii no data flagged as being below release quality and iii no days with zero or low flows with low flows defined as flows below 2 of the mean flow mcinerney et al 2018 ephemeral catchments which do not meet criteria iii are excluded from this study because they require more complex residual error modelling methods smith et al 2010 mcinerney et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the selected time periods vary between catchments with the earliest starting in 1970 and the latest ending in 2012 table s1 in the supplementary material lists the data periods used for each catchment representative results streamflow predictions and residual error diagnostics are illustrated using the yackandandah creek catchment near osborne s flat in victoria gauge 402204 3 2 hydrological model the deterministic hydrological model used in this study is gr4j a daily conceptual rainfall runoff model with two storages and four parameters perrin et al 2003 gr4j has been tested under a range of hydroclimatic conditions and is used in the streamflow forecasting services of france and australia oudin et al 2006 ficchì et al 2016 woldemeskel et al 2018 lerat et al 2020 the gr4j parameters are θ h θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 θ 4 where θ 1 is the capacity of the production soil storage mm θ 2 is the water exchange coefficient mm day θ 3 is the capacity of the routing storage mm and θ 4 is time parameter of the unit hydrograph day the water balance of gr4j is controlled by parameter θ 1 which affects evapotranspiration and by parameter θ 2 which specifies groundwater import export the latter parameter has a particularly direct impact on the gr4j water balance and hence on the mean of the gr4j streamflow predictions and the mean of its residual errors the gr4j parameters are estimated in stage 1 by optimising the objective functions listed in section 3 3 below the optimisation algorithm in the r package airgr is employed coron et al 2017 lerat et al 2020 3 3 objective functions nine hydrological objective functions are considered and are listed in table 1 the objective functions represent distinct goodness of fit metrics for the purposes of calibration but can be grouped into the general categories below 3 3 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency four objective functions are obtained from the nash sutcliffe efficiency or nse nash sutcliffe 1970 by applying the box cox transformation to the observed and simulated streamflow the basic form of the nash sutcliffe efficiency function for general modelled and observed time series y and y respectively is 14 nse y y 1 t 1 t y t y t 2 t 1 t y t mean y 2 where t is the total number of time steps and mean y denotes the mean value of vector y we consider four values of the box cox transformation parameter λ 1 0 5 0 2 and 0 the value λ 1 which corresponds to the case of no transformation is particularly common in hydrological practice the values λ 0 0 2 and 0 5 are also relatively common and have been shown to yield high quality predictions in previous work oudin et al 2006 pushpalatha et al 2012 mcinerney et al 2017 the box cox shift parameter is fixed as a 0 the resulting nse based objective functions are 15 φ nse q q nse q q 16 φ nse bc05 q q nse z q 0 5 0 z q 0 5 0 nse q q 17 φ nse bc02 q q nse z q 0 2 0 z q 0 2 0 nse q 0 2 q 0 2 18 φ nse log q q nse z q 0 0 z q 0 0 nse log q log q in equations 16 18 it is understood that the transformations are applied elementwise the four distinct values of the box cox transformation parameter λ used in the objective functions in equations 15 18 yield distinctly different statistical estimates of model errors and in turn lead to distinctly different optimal parameter values these differences can be used to guide model calibration with the value of λ controlling which flow regime is given greater emphasis during calibration more specifically λ 1 corresponds to the common usage of nse with untransformed streamflow which typically favours the fitting of high flows λ 0 5 corresponds to the nse applied to square root transformed streamflow which is often used to balance the fitting of high and low flows and λ 0 corresponds to the nse applied to log transformed streamflow which is often used to favour the fitting of low flows oudin et al 2006 kaleris langousis 2017 the value λ 0 2 matches the transformation parameter of the residual error model used in this work section 2 1 i e it yields a consistent objective function as per the definition in section 2 3 the correspondence between objective functions and residual error models is summarised in table 2 as noted earlier from a probabilistic modelling perspective using the nash sutcliffe efficiency as an objective function corresponds to making the assumption that the errors in y t follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and constant variance charnes et al 1976 kavetski 2018 mcinerney et al 2018 the use of the box cox transformation can hence also be interpreted as incorporating a representation of error heteroscedasticity and skewness into the objective function 3 3 2 kling gupta efficiency the kling gupta efficiency or kge was derived from a decomposition of the nse into three distinct components namely correlation bias and variability gupta et al 2009 these components can be weighted according to their perceived relevance to the modelling objectives we use the most common basic form of the kge with all component weights set to 1 fowler et al 2016 garcia et al 2017 mizukami et al 2019 mathevet et al 2020 19 kge y y r y y 1 2 mean y mean y 1 2 sdev y sdev y 1 2 where r y y is the pearson correlation coefficient of the modelled and observed quantities y and y and sdev y sdev y are the respective standard deviations the basic kge function can be combined with the box cox transformation in this study we define the following three kge based objective functions 20 φ kge q q kge q q 21 φ kge bc02 q q kge z q 0 2 0 z q 0 2 0 kge q 0 2 q 0 2 22 φ kge bc05 q q kge z q 0 5 0 z q 0 5 0 kge q q which correspond respectively to the standard kge no transformation the kge of bc02 transformed streamflow and the kge of square root transformed streamflow we do not use the log transformation in the kge because this combination was found problematic by santos et al 2018 although the kge bc02 objective function uses the same value of λ as the residual error model it is considered inconsistent by our definition in section 2 3 unlike the nse the implicit assumptions of using the kge as an objective function in probabilistic estimation are not yet clearly established 3 3 3 composite nse bias objective function the nse bias objective function is a composite objective function which combines the standard nse function with an additional bias penalty term to further reduce the error in the total volume of simulated streamflow viney et al 2009 vaze et al 2010 liu et al 2015 gibbs et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the nse bias objective function is defined as follows 23 φ nse bias q q nse q q bias q q where the bias is quantified as 24 bias q q 5 log 1 b q q 2 5 25 b q q mean q mean q mean q the bias term in equation 24 penalises the nse objective function according to a scaled difference between the mean of predictions and the mean of observations see viney et al 2009 for more details the presence of this term is expected to affect the correspondence between the nse objective function and the gaussian assumption about model residuals hence the nse bias function is considered inconsistent with the bc02 residual error model 3 3 4 pearson correlation coefficient the pearson correlation coefficient is a well known measure of statistical goodness of fit in hydrology this quantity is more commonly used for a posteriori model assessment rather than to calibrate the model itself krause et al 2005 muleta 2012 kumar et al 2015 it is included here to provide an objective function that is not based on the nse or kge formulations and as an example of an objective function that is expected to produce poor quality predictions because it does not penalise biases at all the resulting residual errors are hence expected to offer a tough challenge for the residual error models outside of such analyses we do not recommend using the correlation coefficient as an objective function to calibrate hydrological models the r2 objective function is defined as follows 26 φ r2 q q r 2 q q where 27 r y y t 1 t y t mean y y t mean y t 1 t y t mean y 2 t 1 t y t mean y 2 the correlation coefficient is a relatively uncommon objective function in hydrology and hence we do not investigate its use with streamflow transformations as the r2 objective function does not assume a zero mean in the residual errors and does not apply the box cox transformation it is considered inconsistent with the bc02 residual error model 3 4 modelling schemes all modelling schemes in this study use the bc02 residual error model in stage 2 and hence differ in two respects i the objective function used in stage 1 and ii whether the reference or enhanced residual error model is used in stage 2 the schemes examined in this study are summarised in fig 2 and can be classified into the following three groups the benchmark scheme is defined as the scheme that 1 uses the nse bc02 objective function and 2 uses the reference residual error model with assumed zero mean by virtue of criterion 2 in combination with the bc02 residual error model the benchmark scheme uses a consistent objective function according to the definition in section 2 3 the baseline schemes 1 use any of the objective functions listed in section 3 3 except the nse bc02 objective function and 2 use the reference residual error model with assumed zero mean the baseline schemes use inconsistent objective functions the enhanced schemes 1 use any objective function described in section 3 3 and 2 use the enhanced residual error model with flow dependent mean parameter as described in equation 6 all enhanced schemes are considered to use inconsistent objective functions for example the nse objective function in an enhanced scheme is inconsistent for the same reasons as in a baseline scheme the nse bc02 objective function is considered inconsistent in an enhanced scheme because it does not allow for a linear trend in the residuals whereas the enhanced residual error model does hereafter the schemes will be referred to by the objective function and residual error model they use e g the baseline nse scheme uses the nse objective function and the reference residual error model the enhanced kge bc02 scheme uses the kge bc02 objective function and the enhanced residual error model and so forth 3 5 performance evaluation and metrics the probabilistic predictions are evaluated using two measures of predictive performance in the time domain reliability and precision and two measures of goodness of fit to the observed marginal distribution of streamflow volumetric bias and errors in the flow duration curve this performance evaluation is applied in cross validation see section 3 5 5 for more details 3 5 1 reliability reliability refers to the statistical consistency of a predictive distribution see section 2 4 and the observed data it is a key performance attribute in the meteorological and hydrological literature murphy 1973 atger 1999 renard et al 2010 and others the numerical reliability metric used in this study is based on the predictive quantile quantile pqq plot gneiting et al 2007 laio tamea 2007 thyer et al 2009 also referred to as the probability integral transformation pit plot the metric is defined as 28 reliability q pred q 2 t t 1 t f u f q pred t q t f ω f q pred t q t 29 ω f q pred t q t t 1 2 t where f q pred t is the empirical cdf of the predictive distribution at time t f u is the cdf of the uniform distribution u 0 1 and f ω is the empirical cdf of the set ω defined as the set of cdf values of the observed data within the predictive distribution a reliability metric of 0 denotes perfect reliability a reliability metric of 1 represents the worst reliability hence the factor of 2 in equation 28 the reliability metric in equation 28 quantifies the area between the empirical cdf of the set ω and the 1 1 line corresponding to the cdf of the uniform distribution the latter cdf is included explicitly in equation 28 for clarity note that standard statistical goodness of fit tests such as the kolmogorov smirnov test are not suitable for estimating the statistical significance of such departures due to a typically strong auto correlation in the elements of ω mcinerney et al 2017 the metric in equation 28 is used frequently in the hydrological modelling literature to assess the reliability of time varying predictive distributions e g renard et al 2010 evin et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 ammann et al 2019 david et al 2019 and others 3 5 2 precision precision refers to the spread width of uncertainty within the predictive distribution it is quantified using the following precision metric e g mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 ammann et al 2019 david et al 2019 and others 30 precision q pred q 1 n t t 1 n t sdev q t pred 1 n t t 1 n t q t where sdev q t pred sdev q t pred r r 1 n r is the standard deviation i e spread of the predictive replicates q t pred at a given time step t equation 30 represents a measure of the average standard deviation across all time steps scaled by the mean observed streamflow to facilitate comparison across multiple catchments lower values of the precision metric correspond to more precise tighter predictions and are hence preferred note that any improvements in precision need to be evaluated in conjunction with changes in reliability because narrow but unreliable predictions are often highly undesirable in practical applications 3 5 3 volumetric bias the volumetric bias is a measure of how well the predictions represent the long term water balance the corresponding metric is formulated as the absolute relative error between the observed streamflow and the expected value of the probabilistic predictions e g mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 ammann et al 2019 david et al 2019 and others 31 volbias q pred q t 1 n t q t t 1 n t q t pred t 1 n t q t where q t pred is the expected value of the predictive replicates at time step t in statistical terms the bias metric in equation 31 represents an evaluation of the mean of the marginal time invariant predictive distribution in contrast to the reliability and precision metrics which evaluate the quality of the time varying predictive distribution 3 5 4 streamflow variability flow duration curve errors streamflow variability refers to the range of variation and more generally the overall distribution of streamflow over many time steps in this study the ability of the probabilistic predictions to reproduce the overall variability of observed streamflow is quantified using a performance metric based on the flow duration curve fdc in statistical terms this metric represents an evaluation of the complete marginal predictive distribution a measure of relative error in streamflow at the ith percentile of the fdc is defined as 32 ε i fdc q pred q p i q median p i q pred r r 1 n r p i q 100 where p i q is the ith percentile of the observed streamflow p i q pred r is the ith percentile of the rth replicate of probabilistic predictions q pred r and median denotes the median of a set equation 32 is applied at each percentile i 0 1 100 to yield the relative error profile between the fdc curve constructed from the median of the probabilistic predictions and the fdc of observed streamflow note that unlike the preceding metrics which are expressed by a single scalar value the fdc error metric is expressed as a set of values single value per flow percentile 3 5 5 cross validation procedure we implement a leave one year out cross validation procedure over a 10 year period with a 1 year warmup period and 1 year period omitted on either side of the evaluation window to reduce storage memory effects mcinerney et al 2017 see also li et al 2015 for example when generating predictions for the year 2009 the calibration period comprises all years except 2008 2010 once the predictions for all years in the time series are generated in this manner they are concatenated together into a single probabilistic time series and evaluated using the performance metrics listed in section 3 5 3 6 residual error analysis and diagnostics this section describes the residual error analysis used to scrutinise the residual error model and elucidate the impact of using an inconsistent objective function the reference residual error model section 2 2 2 assumes that the normalised residuals η follow a gaussian distribution with a zero mean and constant variance this assumption can be tested using standardised residuals ν defined as 33 ν η σ η if the residual error model assumptions are satisfied ν should follow a standard gaussian distribution i e ν n 0 1 the residual error analysis focuses on the characterisation of the mean of residual errors three related tasks are undertaken task 1 diagnose the limitations of the reference bc02 residual error model when it is combined with inconsistent objective functions this task is undertaken via analysis of stage 2 residuals specifically we are interested in a how well they satisfy the assumption of zero mean and b whether there is any evidence of trends with respect to streamflow task 2 gain insights into how and why the inconsistency in the objective function affects the properties of residual errors this task is undertaken via comparison of stage 1 and stage 2 residuals to determine whether they exhibit fundamental differences task 3 guide the design of remedies for the limitations i e justify the enhanced residual error model this task is undertaken by considering the nature of limitations identified in task 1 above for a given scheme in a given catchment we compute two sets of standardised residuals ν 1 for stage 1 and ν 2 for stage 2 we also compute the corresponding standardised streamflow ψ 1 and ψ 2 scaled to facilitate comparison across multiple schemes and catchments appendices b and c provide definitions of these quantities the key difference between ν 1 and ν 2 and likewise between ψ 1 and ψ 2 is the value of transformation parameter s applied to the deterministic streamflow time series in stage 1 and stage 2 note that for the benchmark scheme which uses a consistent objective function we have ν ν 1 ν 2 and ψ ψ 1 ψ 2 the following analyses are then carried out 1 analysis of residual error characteristics in a representative catchment a for the benchmark scheme nse bc02 plot ν vs ψ calculate the marginal mean mean ν draw the line of best fit and report the estimated slope β of the linear trend scaled to allow for general comparison across all schemes and catchments see appendix c and r 2 of the fit b for a selected baseline scheme nse plot ν 1 vs ψ 1 and ν 2 vs ψ 2 calculate the respective marginal means mean ν 1 and mean ν 2 draw the lines of best fit and report the slopes β 1 and β 2 as well as the respective values of r 2 note that for the nse scheme the stage 1 residuals are untransformed they correspond to λ 1 for a given scheme strongly non zero values of mean ν and or mean ν 2 especially in conjunction with clear trends in the relationships ν vs ψ and or ν 2 vs ψ 2 strongly non zero values of slope β and high values of r 2 would represent evidence to reject the assumption of zero mean residual errors task 1 the relationship ν 1 vs ψ 1 is insightful to understand the impact of a change in streamflow transformation parameters between stages 1 and 2 task 2 the degree of linearity between ν 2 vs ψ 2 informs the suitability of the enhanced residual error model task 3 2 summary analysis of residual error characteristics across multiple catchments in order to ascertain the generality of findings established in the representative catchment a compute the marginal means of standardised residuals in stage 1 mean ν 1 and compare them to zero task 1 and to the marginal means in stage 2 mean ν 2 task 2 b compute the scaled slopes β 1 from stage 1 and compare them to zero tasks 1 and 3 and to β 2 from stage 2 task 2 note that close to zero values mean ν 0 and or β 0 could also occur in the presence of more complex nonlinear dependence between ν vs ψ but would be detected as part of visual analysis section 4 1 2 the detailed residual error analysis is carried out after a single calibration to the entire available time period and does not make use of cross validation this choice avoids potentially confounding artefacts from concatenating residual error time series computed using different estimates of hydrological and residual error model parameters 4 results 4 1 impact of objective function inconsistency this section compares the performance of the benchmark scheme with the baseline schemes in order to determine the extent to which the use of inconsistent objective functions in the baseline schemes impact on the quality of probabilistic predictions thus addressing study aim 1 we then apply residual error diagnostics to compare the stage 1 and stage 2 residuals and appraise them in context of the assumptions made in the residual error model 4 1 1 representative example single catchment fig 3 shows representative streamflow time series reliability pqq plots and distributions of empirical standardised residuals obtained in the yackandandah creek catchment gauge 402204 using cross validation the benchmark scheme top uses the consistent nse bc02 objective function which matches the assumptions of the bc02 residual error model and achieves the following performance metrics reliability 0 035 precision 0 35 and bias 0 016 the baseline nse scheme bottom which uses the inconsistent nse objective function has much worse reliability metric value 0 33 precision metric value 0 56 and bias metric value 0 021 the streamflow probability limits are wider for the baseline nse scheme fig 3d than for the benchmark scheme fig 3a which manifests as a degradation in the precision metric from 0 35 to 0 56 when calculated over the entire evaluation period the pqq plot for the benchmark scheme fig 3b matches the 1 1 line closely indicating that the probabilistic predictions are reliable in contrast the pqq plot for the baseline nse scheme deviates substantially from the 1 1 line indicating poor reliability manifesting as an underestimation of most of the observed data fig 3e finally the empirical distribution of standardised residuals of the benchmark scheme appears in good agreement with the assumed gaussian distribution fig 3c in contrast the empirical residual error distribution of the baseline nse scheme fig 3f is shifted to the right indicating an underestimation bias and has multiple peaks these results clearly illustrate that the change from a consistent objective function benchmark scheme to an inconsistent objective function baseline schemes has a detrimental impact on performance as quantified using the reliability precision and bias metrics notably the residual diagnostics suggest that the reference residual error model zero mean no longer matches the assumed distribution 4 1 2 scrutiny of the assumption of zero mean residuals we now scrutinise the assumption of zero mean residuals using the methods described in section 3 6 fig 4 evaluates the assumption that the mean of standardised residuals is approximately zero and independent of the streamflow magnitude in the representative catchment it shows a plot of standardised stage 1 and stage 2 residuals against standardised streamflow predictions for the benchmark scheme nse bc02 and a selected baseline scheme nse the line of best fit is also shown fig 4a shows that the benchmark scheme consistent objective function has standardised residuals with little to no evidence of a non zero mean or of any trends with respect to streamflow close to zero mean of 0 03 and a mild slope of β 0 1 with negligible r 2 0 01 note that for the benchmark scheme stage 1 and stage 2 standardised residuals coincide see section 3 6 similarly fig 4b shows that the baseline nse scheme has stage 1 residuals that also meet the zero mean assumption these residuals have a mean of 0 12 and a slope β 0 08 with negligible r 2 0 01 the fanning out of residuals with respect to the streamflow magnitude is also noted it represents a classic symptom of heteroscedasticity but has little to no impact on the assumption of zero mean residuals in contrast fig 4c shows that the stage 2 residuals of the baseline nse scheme exhibit clear departures from the zero mean assumption the residuals have a mean of 0 56 and display a distinct linear trend with slope β 0 55 and r 2 0 44 this finding indicates that the change in streamflow transformation parameters from stage 1 to stage 2 has introduced or at least substantially exacerbated a non zero mean and a strong flow dependent linear trend in the standardised residuals fig 5 summarises the results of applying a similar analysis across all schemes and all case study catchments fig 5a compares the mean of standardised residuals from stage 1 and stage 2 fig 5b compares the corresponding values for the scaled slope β of the relationship between standardised residuals and standardised streamflow a value of β far from zero indicates a strong flow dependent linear trend in the residuals fig 5a reveals two key results both consistent with the results seen in fig 4 first stage 1 residuals hatched boxes have a mean close to zero for all objective functions except the r2 objective function for example the interquartile range iqr of the stage 1 residual error mean across the case study catchments is 0 01 to 0 12 for the baseline nse scheme and as tight as 0 02 to 0 003 for the baseline nse bc02 and kge bc02 schemes a clearly different behaviour is seen for the r2 scheme which yields stage 1 residuals with a mean in the range of 0 21 to 0 4 see section 5 1 for discussion second stage 2 residuals unhatched boxes have a clearly larger magnitude mean than stage 1 residuals when most inconsistent objective function are used the iqr of stage 2 residual error means is much wider 0 06 to 0 46 for the baseline nse scheme and 0 08 to 0 37 for the baseline kge scheme these ranges clearly contradict the zero mean assumption especially when contrasted to ranges as tight as 0 02 to 0 001 for the benchmark scheme which uses the consistent nse bc02 objective function a notable exception is seen for the baseline kge bc02 scheme which has stage 2 residual error means with an iqr of 0 002 to 0 003 i e very similar to the benchmark scheme in general the magnitude of the mean of stage 2 residuals appears dependent on the value of λ used in stage 1 λ values close to zero λ 0 0 2 result in residuals with close to zero mean whereas λ 1 result in residuals with a clearly non zero mean fig 5b largely mirrors the key results of fig 5a the slopes β of standardised stage 1 residuals hatched boxes tend to be quite mild for all baseline nse schemes nse nse log nse bc02 and nse bc05 with iqrs of 0 11 to 0 05 indicating the lack of strong flow dependency the values of β for all baseline kge schemes kge kge bc02 and kge bc05 tend to be consistently negative but are still relatively mild iqrs of 0 26 to 0 18 an obvious exception is given by the baseline r2 scheme for which the slopes β are much steeper iqr of 0 5 to 0 61 the differences between stage 2 and stage 1 residuals also follow a familiar pattern in all baseline schemes except nse log and kge bc02 stage 2 residuals unhatched boxes have much larger values of β than stage 1 residuals for example the iqr of β is as wide as 0 5 to 0 1 for the nse scheme and as wide as 0 53 to 0 3 for the kge scheme indicating pronounced flow dependencies linear trends in stage 2 residuals in most catchments fig 5 also shows that β is typically negative indicating that trends similar to those seen in fig 4 for the representative catchment also hold in other catchments note that for the nse log scheme the values of β stage 1 and stage 2 residuals remain broadly similar see discussion in section 5 1 the presence of a flow dependent linear trend in the residuals of baseline schemes which use inconsistent objective functions motivates the use of a flow dependent linear mean for the residuals in the enhanced residual error model as outlined in equation 6 the performance of this enhanced residual error model is detailed next 4 2 performance of benchmark baseline and enhanced schemes this section compares the predictive performance of the baseline benchmark and enhanced schemes thus addressing study aim 2 section 4 2 1 considers streamflow time series from the representative catchment followed by sections 4 2 2 4 2 5 which apply the performance metrics described in section 3 5 across all case study catchments 4 2 1 streamflow time series fig 6 shows representative probabilistic predictions obtained in the yackandandah creek catchment fig 6a shows the predicted streamflow time series from the benchmark scheme nse bc02 objective function fig 6b 6d and 6f show predictions from selected baseline schemes namely those that use the nse kge and r2 objective functions fig 6c 6e and 6g show predictions from the corresponding enhanced schemes the predictions from other schemes exhibit similar behaviour and are reported in figure s1 of the supplementary material fig 6a shows that the benchmark scheme produces predictions with narrow probability limits around the observed data achieving a precision metric of 0 35 over the entire time series the probability limits of the baseline schemes are clearly wider less precise than the probability limits of the benchmark scheme the baseline nse kge and r2 schemes have precision metrics of 0 56 fig 6b 0 56 fig 6d and 0 67 fig 6f respectively in contrast the enhanced schemes shown in fig 6 achieve precision metric values that effectively match those of the benchmark scheme despite using the same inconsistent objective functions as the baseline schemes as seen in fig 6b 7d and 7f the precision metric values achieved by the enhanced nse kge and r2 schemes are 0 34 fig 6c 0 35 fig 6e and 0 34 fig 6f respectively 4 2 2 reliability fig 7 a and 7b compares the reliability of all schemes across all 54 case study catchments the benchmark scheme is one of four schemes with the best reliability indicated by a low median reliability metric of 0 05 fig 7a the baseline nse log kge bc02 and kge bc05 schemes achieve a similar reliability in contrast to the benchmark scheme the baseline nse kge nse bias and r2 schemes are far less reliable with far worse median values of the reliability metric 0 16 0 11 0 12 and 0 41 respectively this finding indicates that in general objective function inconsistency has a detrimental impact on the reliability of the probabilistic predictions in contrast to the baseline schemes the enhanced schemes show a large improvement in reliability fig 7b the median reliabilities for the enhanced schemes are similar to the median reliability of the benchmark scheme and range from 0 04 to 0 05 across all objective functions and case study catchments the lower and upper quartiles of the reliability metric distributions of the enhanced schemes demonstrate a tight range from 0 03 lower for the enhanced nse log scheme at best to less than 0 07 upper for the enhanced r2 scheme at worst this finding demonstrates that the enhanced residual error model overcomes the loss of reliability caused by objective function inconsistency and achieves probabilistic predictions with comparable reliability to the consistent benchmark scheme 4 2 3 precision fig 7c and 7d reports the precision of all schemes the benchmark scheme is one of two schemes with the best precision with a median precision metric value of 0 35 fig 7c similar precision is achieved by the baseline nse log scheme followed by the baseline nse bc05 kge bc05 and kge bc02 schemes which have somewhat worse precision median metric values of 0 38 0 4 in contrast to the benchmark scheme the probabilistic predictions from the four baselines schemes shown in fig 7c namely the baseline nse kge nse bias and r2 schemes are much less precise with median metric values ranging from 0 44 up to 0 93 this finding demonstrates the detrimental impact of objective function inconsistency on the precision the enhanced schemes achieve much better precision than the baseline schemes fig 7d shows median precisions that range from 0 34 for the enhanced nse bc02 scheme to 0 36 for the enhanced kge bc02 scheme these values are very close to the median precision of the benchmark scheme the lower and upper quartiles of the precision metric distributions vary less for the enhanced schemes than for most of the baseline schemes this finding shows that the enhanced residual error model applied with inconsistent objective functions can produce probabilistic predictions that have similar precision to the benchmark scheme which uses a consistent objective function 4 2 4 volumetric bias fig 7e and 7f reports the volumetric bias of all schemes the benchmark scheme is once again one of the top performers with a median bias metric of 0 03 fig 7e the baseline schemes perform generally worse with median bias metrics that range from 0 04 nse and kge bc02 schemes to 0 08 kge scheme and up to 0 28 for the r2 schemes an exception is given by the baseline nse bc05 scheme which achieves a median bias metric of 0 02 and thus outperforms the benchmark scheme note also that bias is the only metric for which the baseline nse log scheme performs substantially worse than the benchmark scheme in contrast to the baseline scheme the enhanced schemes fig 7f achieve large improvements in the bias metric and perform similar to the benchmark scheme median bias values range from 0 02 enhanced nse bc05 scheme to 0 03 enhanced r2 scheme the reduction in bias achieved by the enhanced r2 scheme over the baseline r2 scheme is particularly salient 4 2 5 flow duration curve errors fig 8 reports the error profiles in the flow duration curves fdcs generated from the probabilistic predictions of selected baseline and enhanced schemes those using the nse kge and r2 objective functions as well as of the benchmark scheme the fdc errors of other schemes exhibit similar behaviour and are reported in figure s2 of the supplementary material the general finding is that the enhanced schemes produce fdc error patterns that mostly improve on the baseline schemes and are similar to the error patterns of the benchmark scheme the error patterns of the schemes exhibit a clear dependence on the flow range low mid or high flows as described next for most of the low flows 75 95th percentiles the benchmark scheme fig 8a has median relative errors in the range of 0 24 the baseline schemes fig 8b 8d and 8f incur much larger fdc errors than the benchmark scheme e g the baseline nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors as large as 25 51 for the same low flows all enhanced schemes fig 8c 8e and 8g achieve lower fdc errors than the baseline schemes for example the median relative error in the 80th percentile streamflow is reduced from 32 for the baseline nse scheme fig 8b to just 3 for the enhanced nse scheme fig 8c for mid flows 10th 75th percentiles the benchmark scheme has median relative errors in the range of 10 to 0 the baseline schemes fig 8b 8d and 8f incur fdc errors that are slightly higher than those of the benchmark scheme e g the baseline nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors of 9 to 25 the enhanced schemes fig 8c 8e and 8g achieve lower errors than the baseline schemes for all objective functions e g the enhanced nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors of 9 to 1 for the higher flows 3rd 10th percentiles the benchmark scheme fig 8a has median relative errors in the range 0 up to 7 the baseline schemes fig 8b 8d and 8f incur fdc errors that are similar or slightly larger than those of the benchmark scheme e g the baseline nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors of approximately 10 for all high flows while the baseline kge scheme fig 8d has median relative errors of 18 to 15 the enhanced schemes fig 8c 8e and 8g achieve lower errors than the baseline schemes for all objective functions e g the enhanced nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors of 0 to 8 an exception from the performance pattern above is noted for the highest flow percentile 1st percentile which is captured better by the baseline schemes than by the benchmark and enhanced schemes for example the baseline nse scheme has the lowest median relative errors of 9 fig 8b while the benchmark scheme has higher median relative errors of 25 fig 8a and the enhanced nse scheme has the highest median relative errors of 44 fig 8c overall the enhanced schemes achieve tighter interquartile ranges of fdc errors than the baseline schemes this empirical finding indicates more robust performance with less sensitivity to specific catchment conditions for example at the 70th streamflow percentile the interquartile range of errors for the enhanced nse scheme is only 5 to 2 fig 8c which is far narrower than the interquartile range of errors of 3 to 50 for the baseline nse scheme fig 8b 4 3 summary of case study results three key points emerge from the case study results 1 the use of inconsistent objective functions substantially degrades the quality of probabilistic predictions when the reference residual error model zero mean is employed the probabilistic predictions from the baseline schemes are typically much worse than those from the benchmark scheme despite the same nominally robust bc02 residual error model being used 2 the loss in performance arises because the change in streamflow transformation parameters or more generally changes to the definition of residuals from stage 1 to stage 2 introduces a strong linear flow dependency into the stage 2 residuals remarkably this happens even when the stage 1 residuals have a mean close to zero and their flow dependencies are weak or non existent 3 the enhanced schemes achieve predictive performance that matches or nearly matches the performance of the benchmark scheme regardless of the objective function used in other words schemes with inconsistent objective functions can produce high quality predictions when the residual error model has been enhanced with a dependence of the error mean on simulated streamflow these findings are discussed next 5 discussion 5 1 why do the baseline schemes have poor predictive performance most baseline schemes which use inconsistent objective functions provide worse probabilistic predictions than the benchmark scheme which uses a consistent objective function for almost all the metrics used note that the baseline and benchmark schemes use the same bc02 residual error model which was shown to be well performing in previous studies mcinerney et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 indeed residual error diagnostics for the benchmark scheme in fig 3a fig 4 and fig 5 confirm that the bc02 error model provides an adequate description of residual errors when the hydrological model is calibrated using a consistent nse bc02 objective function the sole difference between the baseline and benchmark schemes is the use of inconsistent objective functions in the baseline schemes hence the deterioration in performance must be due to this difference the residual error diagnostics for the baseline scheme shown in fig 4b are once again illuminating the change in streamflow transformation parameters from stage 1 to stage 2 required due to the use of the inconsistent nse objective function to calibrate the hydrological model introduces additional structure a strong linear flow dependence into the model residuals that is not present when the consistent nse bc02 objective function is used as such when the bc02 residual error model is applied to hydrological model predictions obtained using the nse objective function we exchange one problem poor treatment of heteroscedasticity in the residuals for another spurious bias in the mean of the residuals the bc02 residual error model lacks flexibility to handle this additional error structure resulting in notably poor probabilistic predictions for the baseline schemes e g fig 4b empirical results indicate that this behaviour is systematic it occurs across virtually all catchments regardless of the objective function fig 5 to better understand the origins of the non zero mean in the stage 2 residuals of the baseline and enhanced schemes we distinguish the following two types of behaviours most schemes stage 1 residuals have a close to zero mean but stage 2 residuals have a clearly non zero mean this behaviour is exhibited by the majority of baseline schemes namely the baseline nse nse bias and kge schemes the close to zero mean of stage 1 residuals can be explained by these objective functions generally favouring simulations with close to zero biases this characteristic is particularly salient for the kge and nse bias functions as seen from equations 19 and 23 respectively but the nse function also contains an implicit bias penalty term gupta et al 2009 note that achieving close to zero mean residuals also requires the hydrological model to contain parameters with sufficient control over its water balance appendix d gr4j offers a particularly vivid exemplar in addition to parameter θ 1 which affects evapotranspiration it has the groundwater exchange parameter θ 2 which adds removes water directly from the outflow hydrograph the transition from close to zero mean in stage 1 residuals to non zero mean in stage 2 residuals is a consequence of the general principle that an estimator that is unbiased in raw space will generally become biased in a transformed space more generally this holds for any two distinct transformations unless the estimator variance is very small or the transformations are close to linear a more detailed theoretical exposition can be found in appendix d and in the statistical literature e g neyman scott 1960 miller 1984 taylor 1986 note also that in cases where stage 1 residuals have not attained a mean of zero the change in transformation parameters in stage 2 further amplifies the residual error mean e g see fig 5b the magnitude of the spurious non zero mean in stage 2 residuals depends on the values of λ 1 and λ 2 given that λ 2 0 2 is fixed in the bc02 residual error model the departure from zero mean is small when λ 1 0 0 2 and increases as λ 1 approaches 1 for this reason the baseline nse log scheme despite using a nominally inconsistent objective function λ 1 0 still achieves predictions with similar reliability and precision as the benchmark scheme though notably it incurs a larger bias section 4 2 similarly it appears that the kge objective function behaves sufficiently close to the nse objective function when the bc02 transformation is used in these objective functions the predictive performance of the two schemes nse bc02 and kge bc02 is generally comparable baseline r2 scheme stage 1 residuals have a non zero mean and stage 2 residuals also have a non zero mean this behaviour is exhibited only by the baseline r2 scheme it is clear from equation 26 that the r2 objective function has no terms penalising biases in the simulated streamflow hence it is unsurprising that its stage 1 residuals often have mean values far from zero irrespective of its origins the presence of a non zero mean is clearly problematic for the baseline schemes however the systematic rather than random nature of the linear trend suggests that it could be resolved with a corresponding structural enhancement of the residual error model 5 2 why do enhanced schemes achieve predictive performance similar to the benchmark scheme in contrast to the baseline schemes the enhanced schemes achieve a performance comparable to the benchmark scheme the specification of a flow dependent mean in the enhanced residual error model accounts for the flow dependent linear trend observed in the standardised residuals and avoids the loss of predictive performance incurred by the baseline schemes despite the enhanced schemes using the same inconsistent objective functions as the baseline schemes a key finding is that the choice of objective function has little to no impact on the quality of probabilistic predictions when the enhanced residual error model is used in contrast the choice of objective function makes a large difference when the reference residual error model is used the improved performance of the enhanced schemes reinforces traditional residual modelling practices which seek residual error models that match the statistical properties of the actual residuals as closely as possible bates campbell 2001 schoups vrugt 2010 evin et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 it is well known that residual error models that provide a good description of the actual errors achieve good quality probabilistic predictions sorooshian dracup 1980 bates campbell 2001 schoups vrugt 2010 evin et al 2013 2014 smith et al 2015 li et al 2016 sun et al 2017 in a post processor implementation the actual errors facing the residual error model are the stage 2 residuals the enhanced residual error model incorporates the flow dependent mean term derived from the corresponding residual error analysis hence while the enhanced residual error model is inconsistent with the objective function used in stage 1 it is consistent with the residuals computed in stage 2 an additional insight is gained by recognising that objective function inconsistency as defined in section 2 3 essentially implies an inconsistency between the objective function assumptions and the properties of the actual residual errors which in turn provides an intuitive reason for why these objective functions suffer poor performance given this perspective an important finding is that the enhanced residual error model despite its relatively simple linear nature offers sufficient flexibility to describe the residuals arising after hydrological model calibration to a wide range of objective functions both consistent and inconsistent the enhanced residual error model represents a form of bias correction here correcting the bias arising from the use of an objective function that is inconsistent with the residual error model for example the r2 objective function yields residuals with a particularly pronounced non zero mean yet the enhanced residual error model removes these biases and yields essentially unbiased predictions bias correction methods offer valuable advantages in predictive applications e g in the 4 stage post processor approach erris li et al 2016 and in the non stationary error model of jiang et al 2019 however a general consequence of using bias correction is that the deterministic hydrological model predictions computed using the parameters estimated in stage 1 may deviate substantially from the mean of probabilistic predictions detailed analysis of this behaviour is deferred to future work it is important to note that the flow dependent mean is introduced in the enhanced residual error model to accommodate the more complex error structure arising from objective function inconsistency as shown in fig 3 this enhancement does not address other challenging features of hydrological residual errors such as seasonality indeed the enhanced residual error model does not provide additional improvements over the reference residual error model when the latter is paired with a consistent objective function fig 7 shows that the enhanced nse bc02 scheme has similar performance to the benchmark scheme the use of the enhanced residual error model outside of post processor approaches is also questionable for example its use in a joint estimation approach is liable to result in interactions with hydrological model parameters controlling the water balance in other words the enhanced residual error model overcomes the loss of predictive performance incurred from using an inconsistent objective function in a post processor approach and restores the performance to the level achievable with a consistent objective function 5 3 is the assumption of zero mean errors problematic in its own right it may be tempting to attribute the poor probabilistic performance of the baseline schemes solely to the zero mean assumptions in the objective function and or the residual error model however such hypotheses do not hold on two accounts first if zero mean assumptions were problematic on their own the benchmark scheme which assumes zero mean residuals would have been unable to achieve a good performance yet the benchmark scheme is a top performing scheme in the empirical study second residual error analysis indicates that the zero mean assumption is met reasonably well by stage 1 residuals for 8 of the 9 objective functions considered in this work except the r2 objective function for which non zero mean residuals are unsurprising therefore zero mean assumptions on their own are not the cause of poor performance in our empirical case studies instead as seen in fig 6 and elaborated in sections 5 1 and 5 2 a zero mean residual error model is problematic only when paired with an inconsistent objective function where the inconsistency could be in terms of neglecting the treatment of heteroscedasticity skewness and or neglecting to penalise model simulations with large biases when a consistent objective function is used relaxing the zero mean assumption in the residual error model offers little benefit note that our empirical findings should not be taken as an argument against recognising non stationarity in hydrological processes and uncertainty quantification e g westra et al 2014 ammann et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 mcinerney et al 2020 see also montanari et al 2013 rather this study shows the range of applicability of relatively simple modelling formulations which as discussed next is valuable in many practical applications 5 4 practical benefits 5 4 1 a residual error model for a wide range of objective functions the study findings indicate that a residual error model can be used with a wide range of objective functions with minimal if any loss in predictive performance the enhanced schemes despite using inconsistent objective functions achieve probabilistic predictions with similar quality to the benchmark scheme which uses a consistent objective function this achievement offers substantial practical benefits 1 it is often impractical to change the objective function to one that is consistent for example re calibration of a hydrological model using a different objective function can be time consuming especially for more complex slower models more generally practitioners may favour certain objective functions or even develop their own based on previous experience with their specific hydrological models catchments and or operational objectives while researchers may be interested in specific objective functions as part of their study scope 2 it is often impossible to replace the residual error model with one that is consistent with the objective function the statistical assumptions underlying an objective function can be opaque and or unknown especially for composite objective functions that combine several other objective functions e g nse bias creating and testing customised residual error models for such objective functions can be challenging and using an untested residual error model risks producing low quality probabilistic predictions 3 it is often undesirable to replace the residual error model with one that is consistent with the objective function even when the statistical assumptions underlying an objective function are known these assumptions often do not match key properties of hydrological residual errors and therefore lead to low quality probabilistic predictions for example the nse objective function applied without a streamflow transformation corresponds to the simplistic constant variance gaussian residual error model which does not represent the heteroscedasticity and skewness of residual errors and is known to produce low quality probabilistic predictions sorooshian dracup 1980 kuczera 1983a schoups vrugt 2010 cheng et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 the empirical results indicate that the enhanced residual error model is robust it achieves high quality predictions across a wide range of catchments 54 and objective functions 9 it is noteworthy that the enhanced residual error model provides improvements even when the hydrological model is calibrated using the nse objective function without any transformation which as noted above does not account for the heteroscedasticity and skewness of residual errors the improvements achieved by the enhanced residual error model for the untransformed nse objective function will also hold for related untransformed least squares objective functions including the root mean squared error rmse and sum of squared errors sse objective functions all three of these objective functions correspond to the constant variance gaussian error model and yield the same calibrated parameter values kavetski 2018 mcinerney et al 2018 untransformed least squares objective functions are widely used in contemporary hydrological and broader environmental modelling the ability of the enhanced residual error model to achieve high quality probabilistic predictions in combination with these objective functions can hence bring particularly broad ranging benefits 5 4 2 simplicity the enhanced residual error model proposed in this study is relatively simple to implement and use 1 it is based on the post processor strategy for residual error modelling which is generally more flexible than joint strategies where the parameters of both the hydrological model and residual error model are estimated simultaneously in particular post processor strategies can be applied with a wide range of objective functions this work shows that residual errors can be modelled using a post processor strategy without the need to change the objective function or to re calibrate the hydrological model post processor strategies also enable a wider range of parameter estimation methods for residual error modelling the method of moments is used here but maximum likelihood and full bayesian methods can also be used evin et al 2014 li et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 2 the method of moments estimation method is simple yet can provide parameter estimates and hence predictive quality similar to more complex statistical inference methods mcinerney et al 2018 the method of moments does not require a likelihood function or optimisation and therefore requires less specialised statistical knowledge and fewer computational tools 5 5 future work the following research questions are noted for further investigation 1 generality of findings across broader applications the conclusions of this study are derived empirically from the catchments hydrological model and objective functions tested while the current analysis with 54 catchments and 9 objective functions produces clearly encouraging results it is possible that different enhancements might be needed for catchments with markedly different characteristics e g ephemeral and snow affected catchments similarly different hydrological models including those operating at hourly and monthly time steps may have different residual error characteristics e g depending on their flexibility in matching the catchment water balance or in reproducing the full range of streamflow from low to high at the relevant time scale finally if the objective function is exceedingly poorly chosen and yields a very poor fit of the hydrological model to observed data the residual errors may have a much more complex structure and may not be well described even by the enhanced residual error model 2 reducing flow duration curve errors across range of flow regimes the empirical results in fig 8 show that the magnitude of errors in the flow duration curve varies across the flow regimes for all schemes examined while the benchmark and enhanced schemes show low errors for many flow regimes some flows e g the highest 1 flows are better described by some of the baseline schemes more research is required to develop an enhanced residual error model that produces better quality predictions across the entire flow range 3 further development of residual error models and or objective functions the applicability of the flow dependent mean enhancement to more complex residual error models and or objective functions such as those that account for seasonality wang robertson 2011 li et al 2013 liu et al 2020 warrants investigation a related research question is the interpretability of the hydrological model parameters and corresponding deterministic model predictions when using residual error models with bias correction which can substantially shift the mean of the predictions 6 summary and conclusions high quality probabilistic predictions of streamflow are needed for a range of practical and research applications however many objective functions commonly used to calibrate hydrological models make implicit assumptions that are inconsistent with the assumptions made in common residual error models to describe the well known heteroscedasticity and skewness of residual errors in addition some objective functions may not penalise model biases this study establishes the detrimental impact of such objective function inconsistencies on the quality of daily probabilistic predictions obtained using a residual error post processor approach where stage 1 calibrates hydrological parameters using a user specified objective function and stage 2 calibrates a residual error model to describe predictive uncertainty an enhanced though still simple residual error model is then introduced to restore predictive quality without requiring changes to the hydrological model or objective function a total of 18 modelling schemes are examined which use 9 common objective functions and 2 residual error models reference and enhanced that employ the box cox streamflow transformation the benchmark scheme uses the reference residual error model which assumes a fixed error mean of zero and a consistent objective function the empirical case study applies the daily step hydrological model gr4j in 54 perennial australian catchments with range of diverse climate conditions the quality of time varying probabilistic predictions is quantified using reliability and precision the ability of probabilistic predictions to reproduce the overall marginal distribution of observed streamflow is quantified using volumetric bias and scrutinised in more detail using flow duration curves the key findings are as follows 1 the use of inconsistent objective functions in combination with the reference residual error model results in a substantial loss of predictive performance analyses of stage 2 residuals reveals a more complex residual error structure than when a consistent objective function is used benchmark scheme more specifically residual error diagnostics indicate spurious artefacts a clear departure from a zero mean and a pronounced linear trend in the relationship between standardised residuals and transformed simulated streamflow these artefacts can arise for at least two distinct reasons i if there is a substantial change in transformation parameters between stages 1 and 2 and or ii if the objective function structure does not substantially penalise model biases the reference residual error model which assumes a fixed mean of zero cannot reproduce such trends and consequently yields poor probabilistic predictions 2 the enhanced residual error model overcomes the loss of performance incurred from using inconsistent objective functions and restores probabilistic predictive performance to the level achievable with a consistent objective function the enhanced residual error model parameterises the residual error mean as a linear function of the transformed simulated streamflow and can match the linear trend in model residuals reported above 3 the enhanced residual error model is sufficiently flexible and robust to achieve high quality predictions over a wide range of catchments and common objective functions the improvements achieved by the enhanced scheme are evident for objective functions based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge pearson correlation as well as for a composite objective function that combines nse with an additional bias penalty term for the nse and kge objective functions we also confirmed the findings using several values of the power parameter in the box cox streamflow transformation the enhanced residual error model can be used by hydrological modellers to achieve high quality daily probabilistic predictions from hydrological models already calibrated to a range of objective functions that is without requiring model re calibration this simplicity of application is expected to facilitate the uptake of probabilistic predictions by practitioners further investigation of the enhanced error model is recommended using other hydrological models as well as more catchments and objective functions 7 data availability the algorithms developed in this paper are available at https github com jasenter probabilistic app these algorithms

study appendix a method of moments estimation of standard deviation and autoregressive coefficient the probabilistic model and residual diagnostics used in this study require estimates of the standard deviation and autoregressive coefficient of residuals conditional on an a priori estimate of their mean these estimates are obtained using the method of moments mom let η η t t 1 t denote the time series of computed residuals and let μ μ t t 1 t denote its estimated mean the mean may be fixed to zero reference error model or allowed to vary in time enhanced error model the de meaned residuals are computed as 34 η t η t μ t the standard deviation is then computed as 35 σ η t 1 t η t 2 t and the autoregressive coefficient as 36 ϕ η t 2 t η t η t 1 t 1 σ η 2 the estimated conditional variance σ y 2 is computed from the estimated marginal variance σ η 2 as 37 σ y 2 σ η 2 1 ϕ η 2 this procedure is applied to estimate the stage 2 residual error model parameters as part of calibration see section 2 2 2 as well as to estimate the standard deviations of stage 1 and stage 2 residuals as part of the residual error diagnostics see section 3 6 appendix b standardised residuals from stages 1 and 2 this appendix details the definitions of stage 1 and stage 2 standardised residual errors which are used as part of the residual error analysis to diagnose and understand the deficiencies of the reference residual error model see analysis steps described in section 3 6 stage 1 standardised residuals are defined as 38 ν t 1 η t 1 σ η 1 ψ t 1 ψ t 1 σ η 1 39 ψ t 1 z q t θ z 1 40 ψ t 1 z q t θ h θ z 1 and stage 2 standardised residuals are defined as 41 ν t 2 η t 2 σ η 2 ψ t 2 ψ t 2 σ η 2 42 ψ t 2 z q t θ z 2 43 ψ t 2 z q t θ h θ z 2 where the normalised residuals η t 1 and η t 2 are defined as per equations 8 and 9 respectively and their standard deviations are estimated as per appendix a these quantities are calculated only for the baseline and benchmark schemes which use the reference error model appendix c scaling of streamflow and residual error slopes this appendix defines the scaling used in the residual error analysis to facilitate a quantitative summary across multiple schemes and catchments section 3 6 for a given scheme in a given catchment standardised streamflow is defined as 44 ψ ψ sdev ψ the scaling by sdev ψ accounts for differences in the range of streamflow across multiple catchments and schemes it is similar to the common practice of scaling values by their standard deviation when standardising gaussian random variables similarly the residual error slope slope of η with respect to ψ is scaled as 45 β β sdev ψ σ η the additional scaling by σ η accounts for differences in the range of normalised residuals across multiple catchments note that the scaled slope β is equivalent to the slope of standardised residuals ν with respect to standardised streamflow ψ as per section 3 6 the scaling is applied to β 1 and ψ 1 as well as to β 2 and ψ 2 i e both to stage 1 and stage 2 residual error characteristics appendix d mean of residuals after model calibration this appendix outlines the theoretical analysis of the case where the mean of stage 1 residuals is close to zero yet the mean of stage 2 residuals is clearly non zero see discussion in section 4 1 2 note that this analysis is intended to help understand the behaviour of residuals in stages 1 and 2 the enhanced residual error scheme introduced in this study does not require the residual error mean to be zero in either stages 1 or 2 indeed its key advantage is the ability to represent residual errors with highly non zero means and or pronounced linear dependencies on the transformed streamflow d 1 close to zero mean residuals after model calibration a simple but instructive analysis the general propensity of model calibration to produce residuals with close to zero means follows from two key considerations i most objective functions generally favour simulations with close to zero biases and ii most hydrological models contain parameters controlling the internal water balance consider a deterministic model h with model parameters θ a b where b is an offset parameter 46 q t h t θ x g t a x b the simplest non trivial instance of such model is the linear model q t a x t b though in general the function g can be arbitrarily nonlinear in hydrology parameters with behaviour notably similar to b include the gr4j groundwater exchange parameter θ 2 le moine et al 2008 and precipitation multipliers used to correct input errors e g clark et al 2008 renard et al 2011 henn et al 2016 and others suppose the deterministic model h is calibrated by minimising a least squares objective function e g sse nse rmse yielding optimal parameters θ a b for simplicity assume no response transformation is used i e 47 φ sse θ t 1 t η t 2 θ t 1 t q t h t θ x 2 t 1 t q t g t a b 2 applying the first order optimality condition for parameter b yields 48 φ sse θ b b b 0 2 t 1 t q t g t a b 2 t 1 t η t 0 from equation 48 the following identities hold at the parameter optimum 49 2 t 1 t η t 0 t 1 t η t 0 1 t t 1 t η t mean η 0 which indicate that the calibration achieves residuals with a zero mean the analysis can be readily verified for any model of the form given in equation 46 the calibrated parameter b will ensure residuals have exactly a zero mean if the calibration is carried out in transformed response space the residuals will have a zero mean in transformed space as such while achieving zero errors is impossible except in trivial cases achieving zero mean errors is much easier non sse objective functions and general models are harder to analyse mathematically and will generally not achieve such exact results however as long as the objective function penalises biased simulations and the hydrological model has control over its water balance the residual error mean is unlikely to depart substantially from zero as seen for the kge and nse bias objective functions tested in this study notable and obvious exceptions include the r2 objective function which does not penalise biased simulations and mass conservative hydrological models calibrated to data with large systematic errors e g a gross under estimation of rainfall d 2 transition from close to zero to non zero residuals after changes in transformation the transition from close to zero mean in stage 1 residuals to non zero mean in stage 2 residuals is a consequence of the general principle that an estimator that is unbiased in raw space will generally become biased in a nonlinear transformed space more generally this principle holds for any two distinct transformations as long as the estimator variance is not too small and or at least one of the transformations is not too close to linearity for example suppose the stage 1 residuals of the baseline nse scheme have a zero mean mean η t 1 0 this implies that q t θ h is an unbiased estimator of q t however once we move to stage 2 z q t 0 2 q t 0 2 cannot also be an unbiased estimator of z q t 0 2 q t 0 2 hence mean η t 2 0 a more detailed theoretical expositions of this behaviour can be found

environmental and mining engineering university of adelaide adelaide 5005 sa australia corresponding author probabilistic predictions of streamflow are important in many environmental modelling applications these predictions are often constructed using hydrological models combined with residual error models to describe predictive uncertainty however many objective functions commonly used to calibrate hydrological models make implicit assumptions that do not match the well known heteroscedasticity and skewness of residual errors using a daily scale hydrological model we demonstrate that the use of such inconsistent objective functions in combination with a commonly used residual error model introduces spurious flow dependencies in the mean of residual errors which in turn leads to poor quality probabilistic predictions we then use residual error diagnostics to develop a simple enhanced error model where the error mean depends linearly on the transformed simulated streamflow the enhanced error model is compared with a commonly used reference error model that assumes a zero error mean the empirical case study employs 54 perennial australian catchments the hydrological model gr4j 9 common objective functions and 4 performance metrics reliability precision volumetric bias and errors in the flow duration curve the enhanced error model overcomes the loss of performance caused by inconsistent objective functions and achieves probabilistic predictions comparable to those obtained using consistent objective functions these findings hold for all objective functions used in the case study the enhanced residual error model is expected to facilitate the adoption of probabilistic predictions in the hydrological modelling community in particular it can be used to achieve high quality probabilistic predictions from hydrological models calibrated with a wide range of common objective functions keywords hydrological modelling probabilistic prediction daily streamflow prediction objective function residual error model objective function consistency 1 introduction streamflow predictions produced by hydrological models are widely used in practical environmental and water resource applications including flood and drought risk estimation water resource management water quality assessment and forecasting beck 1985 cloke pappenberger 2009 schewe et al 2014 badham et al 2019 streamflow predictions obtained using hydrological models are inherently uncertain due to often substantial simplifications made when describing natural systems beven 1989 oreskes et al 1994 increasingly hydrological studies and operational services are expected to report the uncertainty in the streamflow predictions along with the predictions themselves welsh et al 2013 ball et al 2016 however the majority of existing conceptual and physical hydrological models e g gr4j hymod hydrogeosphere and others moore 1985 perrin et al 2003 brunner simmons 2012 are deterministic and provide only point predictions probabilistic predictions offer the potential to describe predictive uncertainty e g by providing more information on the likely range of streamflow and can thereby avoid the false sense of security associated with point streamflow predictions biondi et al 2010 farmer vogel 2016 despite the attractiveness of probabilistic methods for describing uncertainty there are several current barriers to the routine inclusion of probabilistic predictions in practical environmental modelling and decision making these barriers include a perceived complexity in generating probabilistic predictions and difficulties in their interpretation pappenberger beven 2006 one such barrier investigated in this study is the impact of the objective function used to calibrate the hydrological model on the ability to achieve high quality e g reliable and precise probabilistic predictions the analyses focus on daily scale predictions which are common in contemporary practice a common approach for probabilistic uncertainty quantification is the residual error model approach in this approach a probabilistic error model the residual error model is added to the deterministic predictions of a hydrological model to represent the combined contribution of multiple sources of errors such as data and model structure errors sorooshian et al 1983 schoups vrugt 2010 evin et al 2014 practical implementations of the residual error model approach typically follow the post processor strategy where the hydrological model parameters are estimated first using an objective function followed by a separate estimation of residual error model parameters engeland et al 2010 evin et al 2014 li et al 2016 mcinerney et al 2018 the more classical joint approach attempts to estimate all parameters simultaneously using a single likelihood function bates campbell 2001 evin et al 2013 smith et al 2015 the post processor approach is particularly attractive for practical applications because at least in principle it enables probabilistic predictions to be generated using hydrological models calibrated with user specified objective functions substantial previous research has identified robust residual error models that produce high quality probabilistic predictions kuczera 1983b smith marshall 2010 wang et al 2012 del giudice et al 2013 cheng et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 to achieve high quality probabilistic predictions the residual error model should provide a realistic description of the statistical properties of the errors in the deterministic predictions common statistical properties of residual errors include but are not limited to their mean heteroscedasticity i e larger errors in larger flows asymmetry skewness and temporal persistence i e multiple consecutive errors with the same sign and similar magnitude sorooshian dracup 1980 bates campbell 2001 evin et al 2013 smith et al 2015 sun et al 2017 residual error models found to perform well at the daily scale include those that transform streamflow using the box cox transformation mcinerney et al 2017 note that the resulting probabilistic predictions should capture not only the time varying properties of observed streamflow but also its overall marginal distribution properties such as the flow duration curve farmer vogel 2016 the considerations behind the choice of an objective function to calibrate the hydrological model is typically quite different from the considerations behind the choice of a residual error model to describe predictive uncertainty the objective function used to calibrate the hydrological model quantifies the goodness of fit between the model and the observed data most hydrological objective functions are selected according to the modelling objectives and the properties of residual errors are seldom considered for example the ubiquitous nash sutcliffe efficiency or nse nash sutcliffe 1970 is used when the interest is primarily in high flows square root and log transformations are often applied to streamflow within the nse objective function to give more weight to low flows dawdy lichty 1968 chapman 1970 pushpalatha et al 2012 the kling gupta efficiency or kge gupta et al 2009 is a more recent objective function based on an explicitly weighted combination of relative variability correlation and bias and is rapidly growing in popularity fowler et al 2016 garcia et al 2017 mizukami et al 2019 some applications use composite objectives functions to balance multiple objectives for example objective functions that combine an nse term and a bias term have been proposed to focus on high flow predictions while constraining mean water balance errors viney et al 2009 vaze et al 2010 in the post processor approach the quality of probabilistic predictions can be expected to depend on both the residual error model and the objective function from a statistical perspective all objective functions make explicit or implicit assumptions about the properties of residual errors for example using the nse goodness of fit metric as an objective function tacitly assumes that errors have a zero mean are homoscedastic and symmetric gaussian with no temporal persistence charnes et al 1976 kavetski 2018 mcinerney et al 2018 these assumptions are inconsistent with known properties of hydrological model residuals and of robust residual error models which typically include heteroscedasticity skewness and persistence this study uses the term objective function inconsistency specifically to describe the modelling scenario in which the assumptions about the mean heteroscedasticity and skewness made by the objective function are different from the assumptions about the mean heteroscedasticity and skewness made by the residual error model and hence do not capture key characteristics of the actual residual errors a typical example of objective function inconsistency relevant to our study and broader practice arises if the hydrological model parameters are calibrated using an objective function without streamflow transformations but predictive uncertainty is estimated using a residual error model that applies a box cox transformation which assumes that the errors are heteroscedastic and skewed these considerations lead to the first question do differences inconsistencies between the assumptions of the objective function and the assumptions of the residual error model impact on the quality of the probabilistic predictions this question is by no means trivial for example evin et al 2014 reported more robust practical performance when the persistence of residual errors was reflected in the residual error model but ignored in the hydrological objective function mcinerney et al 2018 proposed a simple post processor approach that combined least squares and method of moments calibration but limited its analysis to consistent objective functions to our knowledge no studies have evaluated the impact of inconsistent assumptions in the hydrological objective function and the residual error model on probabilistic predictions this is the first key research gap addressed in this study previous studies provide insights into modifications to the residual error model that can assist with predictive quality in scenarios of objective function inconsistency for example the error reduction and representation in stages erris approach developed by li et al 2016 used a four stage calibration approach that included a flow dependent bias correction to the residual error model note that erris is developed for day ahead forecasts and is therefore more complex than typical non forecasting applications erris was trialled with an inconsistent in the terminology of this study hydrological objective function nse and its correction term is of interest here the results of the erris study showed promise however evaluation was limited to a single hydrological objective function and a small number of catchments in another study jiang et al 2019 explored time varying representations of the mean variance and distributional form of residual errors that study was also limited by scale to a single hydrological model objective function and catchment these two studies demonstrate that modifications to the mean parameter of the residual error model warrant investigation however neither study examined if their respective approaches were robust for a wide range of hydrological objective functions and a wide range of catchments this leads to the second research question how robust are modifications or enhancements to the residual error model across a wide range of catchments and a wide range of hydrological model objective functions the study has the following aims 1 understand and evaluate the impact of objective function inconsistency on the quality of probabilistic predictions 2 introduce a simple enhancement to residual error modelling that produces high quality probabilistic predictions when the hydrological objective function is inconsistent for a wide range of catchments and hydrological objective functions a broader objective of this work is to facilitate the uptake of probabilistic predictions by researchers and practitioners in hydrology and water resources hence there is an emphasis on simple and practical modelling approaches that can be incorporated with relatively minor effort into existing and future applications the paper is organised as follows section 2 outlines the theory of probabilistic models used in this work section 3 describes the case study data and methods including the selection of catchments hydrological model objective functions performance metrics and residual error diagnostics section 4 reports the case study results section 5 discusses the findings and provides recommendations for current applications and future research and section 6 summarises the key conclusions of the study 2 theory 2 1 general model setup first let q t θ h denote streamflow predictions at time t obtained using a deterministic hydrological model h with hydrological parameters θ h and inputs x 1 t up to time t 1 q t θ h h θ h x 1 t second define a probabilistic model of streamflow at time t denoted as q t θ x 1 t which is formulated to represent predictive uncertainty due to errors in the data and model structure note that its parameters θ comprise parameters of the deterministic model h as well as any additional parameters of the residual error model the relationship between the deterministic streamflow predictions q t θ h and the probabilistic model of streamflow q t is specified by the residual error model here we formulate the residual error model as additive in transformed space 2 z q t θ z z q t θ h θ z η t where η t is a random error term residual error at time t and z is a transformation function with parameters θ z in this study we use the box cox transformation 3 z q θ z q a λ 1 λ if λ 0 log q a if λ 0 with parameters θ z λ a where λ is a power parameter and a is a shift or offset parameter box cox 1964 the transformation parameters are fixed a priori at λ 0 2 and a 0 in accordance with recommendations made in earlier work to achieve a robust residual error model and high quality probabilistic predictions mcinerney et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 the resulting residual error model is hereafter referred to as the bc02 residual error model the residuals are assumed to be autocorrelated in time which is represented using a first order autoregressive ar1 model sorooshian 1981 bates campbell 2001 evin et al 2014 4 η t μ t ϕ η η t 1 μ t 1 y t where ϕ η is the autoregressive parameter μ t is the mean of residuals at time t and y t is the innovation random component or noise term at time t the innovations are assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation σ y 2 5 y t n 0 σ y 2 the parameters of the residual error model will be denoted collectively as θ η θ μ σ y ϕ η where θ μ denotes parameters of the model for the mean μ t we consider two options for representing the mean μ t which in turn leads to two distinct residual error models model a reference residual error model the reference residual error model makes the common assumption that the mean μ t is constant in time and equal to zero i e μ t 0 kuczera 1983a evin et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 2018 sun et al 2017 model b enhanced residual error model an enhanced residual error model is constructed by assuming that the residual mean μ t is flow dependent and hence varies in time we assume a linear dependence with respect to the transformed streamflow li et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 6 μ t α β z q t θ h θ z where parameters α and β specify the intercept and slope respectively these parameters are grouped as θ μ α β note that the reference residual error model represents a special case of the enhanced residual error model with α 0 and β 0 2 2 model calibration the hydrological model and residual error models are calibrated using the two stage approach outlined in mcinerney et al 2018 in stage 1 the hydrological model parameters θ h are estimated using an objective function and in stage 2 the residual error model parameters θ η are estimated using the method of moments this procedure represents a post processor approach for uncertainty quantification it enables practitioners to undertake uncertainty estimation and probabilistic prediction using hydrological models calibrated with their own objective functions mcinerney et al 2018 in the remainder of the text we use the term scheme that is a modelling scheme to denote a specific combination of objective function stage 1 and residual error model stage 2 2 2 1 stage 1 hydrological model calibration stage 1 calibrates the hydrological model parameters θ h to the observed streamflow q according to an objective function φ 7 θ h argmax θ h φ q q θ h note that transformations such as the box cox transformation in equation 3 may be applied to the observed and deterministic simulated streamflow during stage 1 of the calibration process it is hence convenient to define stage 1 residual errors as 8 η t 1 z q t θ z 1 z q t θ h θ z 1 where θ z 1 are fixed transformation parameters the superscript refers to stage 1 note that these residuals are not used explicitly in calibration or prediction and indeed may or may not even appear directly in the objective function however their properties are pertinent to this study because they allow us to explore the impact of stage 1 assumptions on stage 2 residuals 2 2 2 stage 2 residual error model calibration stage 2 estimates the parameters of the residual error model given the hydrological model parameters θ h estimated in stage 1 and the transformation parameters θ z 2 fixed a priori in stage 2 the stage 2 residual errors η t are computed as 9 η t 2 z q t θ z 2 z q t θ h θ z 2 the transformation parameters θ z 2 used in stage 2 need not take the same values as the transformation parameters θ z 1 used in stage 1 indeed schemes with θ z 1 θ z 2 are of central interest to this study because they represent typical examples of using an inconsistent objective function see section 2 3 parameters θ μ α β are estimated as follows model a reference residual error model the mean is assumed to be equal to zero i e μ t 0 therefore the intercept α and slope β are also both equal to zero model b enhanced residual error model the intercept α and slope β are estimated using linear regression of computed residuals η t on transformed deterministic streamflow z q t θ h θ z 2 the flow dependent mean μ t is then calculated at each time step t using equation 6 the remaining parameters σ y and ϕ η are then estimated using the method of moments as described in appendix a note that stage 2 computations are very fast for both the reference and enhanced residual error models because the hydrological model and its residual errors are both fixed as such stage 2 does not require any new runs of the hydrological model 2 3 objective function consistency and inconsistency in this study a scheme is said to be consistent if the same assumptions regarding the properties of residual errors mean heteroscedasticity and skewness are made by the hydrological objective function in stage 1 and the residual error model in stage 2 this scenario will be referred to as using a consistent objective function in this study our focus is on the consistency of objective functions with respect to common residual error model s established as well performing in previous work an example of a consistent scheme is given as follows stage 1 uses the nse objective function with observed and simulated streamflow transformed using the box cox transformation with parameters λ 0 2 and a 0 and stage 2 uses the bc02 residual error model which also has transformation parameters λ 0 2 and a 0 which was established as well performing in previous studies mcinerney et al 2017 the equivalence of residual error assumptions in stages 1 and 2 of this scheme was shown in previous work e g mcinerney et al 2018 supplementary material s2 in contrast an example of an inconsistent scheme is given by stage 1 using the nse objective function without a streamflow transformation but stage 2 using the bc02 residual error model the difference in transformation parameter values in stages 1 and 2 i e λ 1 1 but λ 2 0 2 corresponds to different assumptions about heteroscedasticity and skewness being made in the two calibration stages inconsistency can also arise from the objective function structure rather than solely from the choice of streamflow transformation for example using the pearson correlation between observed and predicted streamflow as the objective function does not assume that the residuals have a zero mean hence the pearson correlation objective function is inconsistent with a reference residual error model that makes the zero mean assumption even if the same transformation θ z 1 θ z 2 could theoretically be applied in the two calibration stages for some objective functions such as the kling gupta efficiency kge described in gupta et al 2009 the corresponding probabilistic assumptions may still be unknown in which case we consider the objective function to be inconsistent by default the schemes used in this work and their classification as consistent or inconsistent are given in section 3 4 2 4 probabilistic predictions the predictive distribution of streamflow is given by the probabilistic model q t θ x 1 t defined in section 2 1 i e using the combined hydrological model and residual error model with estimated parameters θ and inputs x at time step t assuming the deterministic streamflow prediction q t θ h has already been computed a predictive replicate q t pred r is generated as follows 1 sample innovations from a gaussian distribution 10 y t r n 0 σ y 2 2 calculate residuals using equation 4 11 η t r μ t ϕ η η t 1 r μ t 1 y t r note that for t 1 we sample η 1 r n 0 σ η 2 3 apply the inverse transformation 12 q t pred r z 1 z q t θ h θ z 2 η t r θ z 2 the complete set of all predictive replicates i e the predictive distribution is 13 q pred q t pred r t 1 t r 1 n r where n r is the number of replicates 3 case study material and methods 3 1 catchments and observed data the case study considers 54 australian catchments with a relatively diverse range of hydroclimatology fig 1 shows the locations of these catchments with the köppen hydroclimate zones the majority of catchments are in the temperate and sub tropical zones and there is at least one catchment in every other zone except for the arid central deserts daily rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet and streamflow time series are obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology hydrologic reference stations hrs dataset http www bom gov au water hrs for each catchment 10 years of continuous observed data is selected according to the following criteria i no missing data ii no data flagged as being below release quality and iii no days with zero or low flows with low flows defined as flows below 2 of the mean flow mcinerney et al 2018 ephemeral catchments which do not meet criteria iii are excluded from this study because they require more complex residual error modelling methods smith et al 2010 mcinerney et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the selected time periods vary between catchments with the earliest starting in 1970 and the latest ending in 2012 table s1 in the supplementary material lists the data periods used for each catchment representative results streamflow predictions and residual error diagnostics are illustrated using the yackandandah creek catchment near osborne s flat in victoria gauge 402204 3 2 hydrological model the deterministic hydrological model used in this study is gr4j a daily conceptual rainfall runoff model with two storages and four parameters perrin et al 2003 gr4j has been tested under a range of hydroclimatic conditions and is used in the streamflow forecasting services of france and australia oudin et al 2006 ficchì et al 2016 woldemeskel et al 2018 lerat et al 2020 the gr4j parameters are θ h θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 θ 4 where θ 1 is the capacity of the production soil storage mm θ 2 is the water exchange coefficient mm day θ 3 is the capacity of the routing storage mm and θ 4 is time parameter of the unit hydrograph day the water balance of gr4j is controlled by parameter θ 1 which affects evapotranspiration and by parameter θ 2 which specifies groundwater import export the latter parameter has a particularly direct impact on the gr4j water balance and hence on the mean of the gr4j streamflow predictions and the mean of its residual errors the gr4j parameters are estimated in stage 1 by optimising the objective functions listed in section 3 3 below the optimisation algorithm in the r package airgr is employed coron et al 2017 lerat et al 2020 3 3 objective functions nine hydrological objective functions are considered and are listed in table 1 the objective functions represent distinct goodness of fit metrics for the purposes of calibration but can be grouped into the general categories below 3 3 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency four objective functions are obtained from the nash sutcliffe efficiency or nse nash sutcliffe 1970 by applying the box cox transformation to the observed and simulated streamflow the basic form of the nash sutcliffe efficiency function for general modelled and observed time series y and y respectively is 14 nse y y 1 t 1 t y t y t 2 t 1 t y t mean y 2 where t is the total number of time steps and mean y denotes the mean value of vector y we consider four values of the box cox transformation parameter λ 1 0 5 0 2 and 0 the value λ 1 which corresponds to the case of no transformation is particularly common in hydrological practice the values λ 0 0 2 and 0 5 are also relatively common and have been shown to yield high quality predictions in previous work oudin et al 2006 pushpalatha et al 2012 mcinerney et al 2017 the box cox shift parameter is fixed as a 0 the resulting nse based objective functions are 15 φ nse q q nse q q 16 φ nse bc05 q q nse z q 0 5 0 z q 0 5 0 nse q q 17 φ nse bc02 q q nse z q 0 2 0 z q 0 2 0 nse q 0 2 q 0 2 18 φ nse log q q nse z q 0 0 z q 0 0 nse log q log q in equations 16 18 it is understood that the transformations are applied elementwise the four distinct values of the box cox transformation parameter λ used in the objective functions in equations 15 18 yield distinctly different statistical estimates of model errors and in turn lead to distinctly different optimal parameter values these differences can be used to guide model calibration with the value of λ controlling which flow regime is given greater emphasis during calibration more specifically λ 1 corresponds to the common usage of nse with untransformed streamflow which typically favours the fitting of high flows λ 0 5 corresponds to the nse applied to square root transformed streamflow which is often used to balance the fitting of high and low flows and λ 0 corresponds to the nse applied to log transformed streamflow which is often used to favour the fitting of low flows oudin et al 2006 kaleris langousis 2017 the value λ 0 2 matches the transformation parameter of the residual error model used in this work section 2 1 i e it yields a consistent objective function as per the definition in section 2 3 the correspondence between objective functions and residual error models is summarised in table 2 as noted earlier from a probabilistic modelling perspective using the nash sutcliffe efficiency as an objective function corresponds to making the assumption that the errors in y t follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and constant variance charnes et al 1976 kavetski 2018 mcinerney et al 2018 the use of the box cox transformation can hence also be interpreted as incorporating a representation of error heteroscedasticity and skewness into the objective function 3 3 2 kling gupta efficiency the kling gupta efficiency or kge was derived from a decomposition of the nse into three distinct components namely correlation bias and variability gupta et al 2009 these components can be weighted according to their perceived relevance to the modelling objectives we use the most common basic form of the kge with all component weights set to 1 fowler et al 2016 garcia et al 2017 mizukami et al 2019 mathevet et al 2020 19 kge y y r y y 1 2 mean y mean y 1 2 sdev y sdev y 1 2 where r y y is the pearson correlation coefficient of the modelled and observed quantities y and y and sdev y sdev y are the respective standard deviations the basic kge function can be combined with the box cox transformation in this study we define the following three kge based objective functions 20 φ kge q q kge q q 21 φ kge bc02 q q kge z q 0 2 0 z q 0 2 0 kge q 0 2 q 0 2 22 φ kge bc05 q q kge z q 0 5 0 z q 0 5 0 kge q q which correspond respectively to the standard kge no transformation the kge of bc02 transformed streamflow and the kge of square root transformed streamflow we do not use the log transformation in the kge because this combination was found problematic by santos et al 2018 although the kge bc02 objective function uses the same value of λ as the residual error model it is considered inconsistent by our definition in section 2 3 unlike the nse the implicit assumptions of using the kge as an objective function in probabilistic estimation are not yet clearly established 3 3 3 composite nse bias objective function the nse bias objective function is a composite objective function which combines the standard nse function with an additional bias penalty term to further reduce the error in the total volume of simulated streamflow viney et al 2009 vaze et al 2010 liu et al 2015 gibbs et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the nse bias objective function is defined as follows 23 φ nse bias q q nse q q bias q q where the bias is quantified as 24 bias q q 5 log 1 b q q 2 5 25 b q q mean q mean q mean q the bias term in equation 24 penalises the nse objective function according to a scaled difference between the mean of predictions and the mean of observations see viney et al 2009 for more details the presence of this term is expected to affect the correspondence between the nse objective function and the gaussian assumption about model residuals hence the nse bias function is considered inconsistent with the bc02 residual error model 3 3 4 pearson correlation coefficient the pearson correlation coefficient is a well known measure of statistical goodness of fit in hydrology this quantity is more commonly used for a posteriori model assessment rather than to calibrate the model itself krause et al 2005 muleta 2012 kumar et al 2015 it is included here to provide an objective function that is not based on the nse or kge formulations and as an example of an objective function that is expected to produce poor quality predictions because it does not penalise biases at all the resulting residual errors are hence expected to offer a tough challenge for the residual error models outside of such analyses we do not recommend using the correlation coefficient as an objective function to calibrate hydrological models the r2 objective function is defined as follows 26 φ r2 q q r 2 q q where 27 r y y t 1 t y t mean y y t mean y t 1 t y t mean y 2 t 1 t y t mean y 2 the correlation coefficient is a relatively uncommon objective function in hydrology and hence we do not investigate its use with streamflow transformations as the r2 objective function does not assume a zero mean in the residual errors and does not apply the box cox transformation it is considered inconsistent with the bc02 residual error model 3 4 modelling schemes all modelling schemes in this study use the bc02 residual error model in stage 2 and hence differ in two respects i the objective function used in stage 1 and ii whether the reference or enhanced residual error model is used in stage 2 the schemes examined in this study are summarised in fig 2 and can be classified into the following three groups the benchmark scheme is defined as the scheme that 1 uses the nse bc02 objective function and 2 uses the reference residual error model with assumed zero mean by virtue of criterion 2 in combination with the bc02 residual error model the benchmark scheme uses a consistent objective function according to the definition in section 2 3 the baseline schemes 1 use any of the objective functions listed in section 3 3 except the nse bc02 objective function and 2 use the reference residual error model with assumed zero mean the baseline schemes use inconsistent objective functions the enhanced schemes 1 use any objective function described in section 3 3 and 2 use the enhanced residual error model with flow dependent mean parameter as described in equation 6 all enhanced schemes are considered to use inconsistent objective functions for example the nse objective function in an enhanced scheme is inconsistent for the same reasons as in a baseline scheme the nse bc02 objective function is considered inconsistent in an enhanced scheme because it does not allow for a linear trend in the residuals whereas the enhanced residual error model does hereafter the schemes will be referred to by the objective function and residual error model they use e g the baseline nse scheme uses the nse objective function and the reference residual error model the enhanced kge bc02 scheme uses the kge bc02 objective function and the enhanced residual error model and so forth 3 5 performance evaluation and metrics the probabilistic predictions are evaluated using two measures of predictive performance in the time domain reliability and precision and two measures of goodness of fit to the observed marginal distribution of streamflow volumetric bias and errors in the flow duration curve this performance evaluation is applied in cross validation see section 3 5 5 for more details 3 5 1 reliability reliability refers to the statistical consistency of a predictive distribution see section 2 4 and the observed data it is a key performance attribute in the meteorological and hydrological literature murphy 1973 atger 1999 renard et al 2010 and others the numerical reliability metric used in this study is based on the predictive quantile quantile pqq plot gneiting et al 2007 laio tamea 2007 thyer et al 2009 also referred to as the probability integral transformation pit plot the metric is defined as 28 reliability q pred q 2 t t 1 t f u f q pred t q t f ω f q pred t q t 29 ω f q pred t q t t 1 2 t where f q pred t is the empirical cdf of the predictive distribution at time t f u is the cdf of the uniform distribution u 0 1 and f ω is the empirical cdf of the set ω defined as the set of cdf values of the observed data within the predictive distribution a reliability metric of 0 denotes perfect reliability a reliability metric of 1 represents the worst reliability hence the factor of 2 in equation 28 the reliability metric in equation 28 quantifies the area between the empirical cdf of the set ω and the 1 1 line corresponding to the cdf of the uniform distribution the latter cdf is included explicitly in equation 28 for clarity note that standard statistical goodness of fit tests such as the kolmogorov smirnov test are not suitable for estimating the statistical significance of such departures due to a typically strong auto correlation in the elements of ω mcinerney et al 2017 the metric in equation 28 is used frequently in the hydrological modelling literature to assess the reliability of time varying predictive distributions e g renard et al 2010 evin et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 ammann et al 2019 david et al 2019 and others 3 5 2 precision precision refers to the spread width of uncertainty within the predictive distribution it is quantified using the following precision metric e g mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 ammann et al 2019 david et al 2019 and others 30 precision q pred q 1 n t t 1 n t sdev q t pred 1 n t t 1 n t q t where sdev q t pred sdev q t pred r r 1 n r is the standard deviation i e spread of the predictive replicates q t pred at a given time step t equation 30 represents a measure of the average standard deviation across all time steps scaled by the mean observed streamflow to facilitate comparison across multiple catchments lower values of the precision metric correspond to more precise tighter predictions and are hence preferred note that any improvements in precision need to be evaluated in conjunction with changes in reliability because narrow but unreliable predictions are often highly undesirable in practical applications 3 5 3 volumetric bias the volumetric bias is a measure of how well the predictions represent the long term water balance the corresponding metric is formulated as the absolute relative error between the observed streamflow and the expected value of the probabilistic predictions e g mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 ammann et al 2019 david et al 2019 and others 31 volbias q pred q t 1 n t q t t 1 n t q t pred t 1 n t q t where q t pred is the expected value of the predictive replicates at time step t in statistical terms the bias metric in equation 31 represents an evaluation of the mean of the marginal time invariant predictive distribution in contrast to the reliability and precision metrics which evaluate the quality of the time varying predictive distribution 3 5 4 streamflow variability flow duration curve errors streamflow variability refers to the range of variation and more generally the overall distribution of streamflow over many time steps in this study the ability of the probabilistic predictions to reproduce the overall variability of observed streamflow is quantified using a performance metric based on the flow duration curve fdc in statistical terms this metric represents an evaluation of the complete marginal predictive distribution a measure of relative error in streamflow at the ith percentile of the fdc is defined as 32 ε i fdc q pred q p i q median p i q pred r r 1 n r p i q 100 where p i q is the ith percentile of the observed streamflow p i q pred r is the ith percentile of the rth replicate of probabilistic predictions q pred r and median denotes the median of a set equation 32 is applied at each percentile i 0 1 100 to yield the relative error profile between the fdc curve constructed from the median of the probabilistic predictions and the fdc of observed streamflow note that unlike the preceding metrics which are expressed by a single scalar value the fdc error metric is expressed as a set of values single value per flow percentile 3 5 5 cross validation procedure we implement a leave one year out cross validation procedure over a 10 year period with a 1 year warmup period and 1 year period omitted on either side of the evaluation window to reduce storage memory effects mcinerney et al 2017 see also li et al 2015 for example when generating predictions for the year 2009 the calibration period comprises all years except 2008 2010 once the predictions for all years in the time series are generated in this manner they are concatenated together into a single probabilistic time series and evaluated using the performance metrics listed in section 3 5 3 6 residual error analysis and diagnostics this section describes the residual error analysis used to scrutinise the residual error model and elucidate the impact of using an inconsistent objective function the reference residual error model section 2 2 2 assumes that the normalised residuals η follow a gaussian distribution with a zero mean and constant variance this assumption can be tested using standardised residuals ν defined as 33 ν η σ η if the residual error model assumptions are satisfied ν should follow a standard gaussian distribution i e ν n 0 1 the residual error analysis focuses on the characterisation of the mean of residual errors three related tasks are undertaken task 1 diagnose the limitations of the reference bc02 residual error model when it is combined with inconsistent objective functions this task is undertaken via analysis of stage 2 residuals specifically we are interested in a how well they satisfy the assumption of zero mean and b whether there is any evidence of trends with respect to streamflow task 2 gain insights into how and why the inconsistency in the objective function affects the properties of residual errors this task is undertaken via comparison of stage 1 and stage 2 residuals to determine whether they exhibit fundamental differences task 3 guide the design of remedies for the limitations i e justify the enhanced residual error model this task is undertaken by considering the nature of limitations identified in task 1 above for a given scheme in a given catchment we compute two sets of standardised residuals ν 1 for stage 1 and ν 2 for stage 2 we also compute the corresponding standardised streamflow ψ 1 and ψ 2 scaled to facilitate comparison across multiple schemes and catchments appendices b and c provide definitions of these quantities the key difference between ν 1 and ν 2 and likewise between ψ 1 and ψ 2 is the value of transformation parameter s applied to the deterministic streamflow time series in stage 1 and stage 2 note that for the benchmark scheme which uses a consistent objective function we have ν ν 1 ν 2 and ψ ψ 1 ψ 2 the following analyses are then carried out 1 analysis of residual error characteristics in a representative catchment a for the benchmark scheme nse bc02 plot ν vs ψ calculate the marginal mean mean ν draw the line of best fit and report the estimated slope β of the linear trend scaled to allow for general comparison across all schemes and catchments see appendix c and r 2 of the fit b for a selected baseline scheme nse plot ν 1 vs ψ 1 and ν 2 vs ψ 2 calculate the respective marginal means mean ν 1 and mean ν 2 draw the lines of best fit and report the slopes β 1 and β 2 as well as the respective values of r 2 note that for the nse scheme the stage 1 residuals are untransformed they correspond to λ 1 for a given scheme strongly non zero values of mean ν and or mean ν 2 especially in conjunction with clear trends in the relationships ν vs ψ and or ν 2 vs ψ 2 strongly non zero values of slope β and high values of r 2 would represent evidence to reject the assumption of zero mean residual errors task 1 the relationship ν 1 vs ψ 1 is insightful to understand the impact of a change in streamflow transformation parameters between stages 1 and 2 task 2 the degree of linearity between ν 2 vs ψ 2 informs the suitability of the enhanced residual error model task 3 2 summary analysis of residual error characteristics across multiple catchments in order to ascertain the generality of findings established in the representative catchment a compute the marginal means of standardised residuals in stage 1 mean ν 1 and compare them to zero task 1 and to the marginal means in stage 2 mean ν 2 task 2 b compute the scaled slopes β 1 from stage 1 and compare them to zero tasks 1 and 3 and to β 2 from stage 2 task 2 note that close to zero values mean ν 0 and or β 0 could also occur in the presence of more complex nonlinear dependence between ν vs ψ but would be detected as part of visual analysis section 4 1 2 the detailed residual error analysis is carried out after a single calibration to the entire available time period and does not make use of cross validation this choice avoids potentially confounding artefacts from concatenating residual error time series computed using different estimates of hydrological and residual error model parameters 4 results 4 1 impact of objective function inconsistency this section compares the performance of the benchmark scheme with the baseline schemes in order to determine the extent to which the use of inconsistent objective functions in the baseline schemes impact on the quality of probabilistic predictions thus addressing study aim 1 we then apply residual error diagnostics to compare the stage 1 and stage 2 residuals and appraise them in context of the assumptions made in the residual error model 4 1 1 representative example single catchment fig 3 shows representative streamflow time series reliability pqq plots and distributions of empirical standardised residuals obtained in the yackandandah creek catchment gauge 402204 using cross validation the benchmark scheme top uses the consistent nse bc02 objective function which matches the assumptions of the bc02 residual error model and achieves the following performance metrics reliability 0 035 precision 0 35 and bias 0 016 the baseline nse scheme bottom which uses the inconsistent nse objective function has much worse reliability metric value 0 33 precision metric value 0 56 and bias metric value 0 021 the streamflow probability limits are wider for the baseline nse scheme fig 3d than for the benchmark scheme fig 3a which manifests as a degradation in the precision metric from 0 35 to 0 56 when calculated over the entire evaluation period the pqq plot for the benchmark scheme fig 3b matches the 1 1 line closely indicating that the probabilistic predictions are reliable in contrast the pqq plot for the baseline nse scheme deviates substantially from the 1 1 line indicating poor reliability manifesting as an underestimation of most of the observed data fig 3e finally the empirical distribution of standardised residuals of the benchmark scheme appears in good agreement with the assumed gaussian distribution fig 3c in contrast the empirical residual error distribution of the baseline nse scheme fig 3f is shifted to the right indicating an underestimation bias and has multiple peaks these results clearly illustrate that the change from a consistent objective function benchmark scheme to an inconsistent objective function baseline schemes has a detrimental impact on performance as quantified using the reliability precision and bias metrics notably the residual diagnostics suggest that the reference residual error model zero mean no longer matches the assumed distribution 4 1 2 scrutiny of the assumption of zero mean residuals we now scrutinise the assumption of zero mean residuals using the methods described in section 3 6 fig 4 evaluates the assumption that the mean of standardised residuals is approximately zero and independent of the streamflow magnitude in the representative catchment it shows a plot of standardised stage 1 and stage 2 residuals against standardised streamflow predictions for the benchmark scheme nse bc02 and a selected baseline scheme nse the line of best fit is also shown fig 4a shows that the benchmark scheme consistent objective function has standardised residuals with little to no evidence of a non zero mean or of any trends with respect to streamflow close to zero mean of 0 03 and a mild slope of β 0 1 with negligible r 2 0 01 note that for the benchmark scheme stage 1 and stage 2 standardised residuals coincide see section 3 6 similarly fig 4b shows that the baseline nse scheme has stage 1 residuals that also meet the zero mean assumption these residuals have a mean of 0 12 and a slope β 0 08 with negligible r 2 0 01 the fanning out of residuals with respect to the streamflow magnitude is also noted it represents a classic symptom of heteroscedasticity but has little to no impact on the assumption of zero mean residuals in contrast fig 4c shows that the stage 2 residuals of the baseline nse scheme exhibit clear departures from the zero mean assumption the residuals have a mean of 0 56 and display a distinct linear trend with slope β 0 55 and r 2 0 44 this finding indicates that the change in streamflow transformation parameters from stage 1 to stage 2 has introduced or at least substantially exacerbated a non zero mean and a strong flow dependent linear trend in the standardised residuals fig 5 summarises the results of applying a similar analysis across all schemes and all case study catchments fig 5a compares the mean of standardised residuals from stage 1 and stage 2 fig 5b compares the corresponding values for the scaled slope β of the relationship between standardised residuals and standardised streamflow a value of β far from zero indicates a strong flow dependent linear trend in the residuals fig 5a reveals two key results both consistent with the results seen in fig 4 first stage 1 residuals hatched boxes have a mean close to zero for all objective functions except the r2 objective function for example the interquartile range iqr of the stage 1 residual error mean across the case study catchments is 0 01 to 0 12 for the baseline nse scheme and as tight as 0 02 to 0 003 for the baseline nse bc02 and kge bc02 schemes a clearly different behaviour is seen for the r2 scheme which yields stage 1 residuals with a mean in the range of 0 21 to 0 4 see section 5 1 for discussion second stage 2 residuals unhatched boxes have a clearly larger magnitude mean than stage 1 residuals when most inconsistent objective function are used the iqr of stage 2 residual error means is much wider 0 06 to 0 46 for the baseline nse scheme and 0 08 to 0 37 for the baseline kge scheme these ranges clearly contradict the zero mean assumption especially when contrasted to ranges as tight as 0 02 to 0 001 for the benchmark scheme which uses the consistent nse bc02 objective function a notable exception is seen for the baseline kge bc02 scheme which has stage 2 residual error means with an iqr of 0 002 to 0 003 i e very similar to the benchmark scheme in general the magnitude of the mean of stage 2 residuals appears dependent on the value of λ used in stage 1 λ values close to zero λ 0 0 2 result in residuals with close to zero mean whereas λ 1 result in residuals with a clearly non zero mean fig 5b largely mirrors the key results of fig 5a the slopes β of standardised stage 1 residuals hatched boxes tend to be quite mild for all baseline nse schemes nse nse log nse bc02 and nse bc05 with iqrs of 0 11 to 0 05 indicating the lack of strong flow dependency the values of β for all baseline kge schemes kge kge bc02 and kge bc05 tend to be consistently negative but are still relatively mild iqrs of 0 26 to 0 18 an obvious exception is given by the baseline r2 scheme for which the slopes β are much steeper iqr of 0 5 to 0 61 the differences between stage 2 and stage 1 residuals also follow a familiar pattern in all baseline schemes except nse log and kge bc02 stage 2 residuals unhatched boxes have much larger values of β than stage 1 residuals for example the iqr of β is as wide as 0 5 to 0 1 for the nse scheme and as wide as 0 53 to 0 3 for the kge scheme indicating pronounced flow dependencies linear trends in stage 2 residuals in most catchments fig 5 also shows that β is typically negative indicating that trends similar to those seen in fig 4 for the representative catchment also hold in other catchments note that for the nse log scheme the values of β stage 1 and stage 2 residuals remain broadly similar see discussion in section 5 1 the presence of a flow dependent linear trend in the residuals of baseline schemes which use inconsistent objective functions motivates the use of a flow dependent linear mean for the residuals in the enhanced residual error model as outlined in equation 6 the performance of this enhanced residual error model is detailed next 4 2 performance of benchmark baseline and enhanced schemes this section compares the predictive performance of the baseline benchmark and enhanced schemes thus addressing study aim 2 section 4 2 1 considers streamflow time series from the representative catchment followed by sections 4 2 2 4 2 5 which apply the performance metrics described in section 3 5 across all case study catchments 4 2 1 streamflow time series fig 6 shows representative probabilistic predictions obtained in the yackandandah creek catchment fig 6a shows the predicted streamflow time series from the benchmark scheme nse bc02 objective function fig 6b 6d and 6f show predictions from selected baseline schemes namely those that use the nse kge and r2 objective functions fig 6c 6e and 6g show predictions from the corresponding enhanced schemes the predictions from other schemes exhibit similar behaviour and are reported in figure s1 of the supplementary material fig 6a shows that the benchmark scheme produces predictions with narrow probability limits around the observed data achieving a precision metric of 0 35 over the entire time series the probability limits of the baseline schemes are clearly wider less precise than the probability limits of the benchmark scheme the baseline nse kge and r2 schemes have precision metrics of 0 56 fig 6b 0 56 fig 6d and 0 67 fig 6f respectively in contrast the enhanced schemes shown in fig 6 achieve precision metric values that effectively match those of the benchmark scheme despite using the same inconsistent objective functions as the baseline schemes as seen in fig 6b 7d and 7f the precision metric values achieved by the enhanced nse kge and r2 schemes are 0 34 fig 6c 0 35 fig 6e and 0 34 fig 6f respectively 4 2 2 reliability fig 7 a and 7b compares the reliability of all schemes across all 54 case study catchments the benchmark scheme is one of four schemes with the best reliability indicated by a low median reliability metric of 0 05 fig 7a the baseline nse log kge bc02 and kge bc05 schemes achieve a similar reliability in contrast to the benchmark scheme the baseline nse kge nse bias and r2 schemes are far less reliable with far worse median values of the reliability metric 0 16 0 11 0 12 and 0 41 respectively this finding indicates that in general objective function inconsistency has a detrimental impact on the reliability of the probabilistic predictions in contrast to the baseline schemes the enhanced schemes show a large improvement in reliability fig 7b the median reliabilities for the enhanced schemes are similar to the median reliability of the benchmark scheme and range from 0 04 to 0 05 across all objective functions and case study catchments the lower and upper quartiles of the reliability metric distributions of the enhanced schemes demonstrate a tight range from 0 03 lower for the enhanced nse log scheme at best to less than 0 07 upper for the enhanced r2 scheme at worst this finding demonstrates that the enhanced residual error model overcomes the loss of reliability caused by objective function inconsistency and achieves probabilistic predictions with comparable reliability to the consistent benchmark scheme 4 2 3 precision fig 7c and 7d reports the precision of all schemes the benchmark scheme is one of two schemes with the best precision with a median precision metric value of 0 35 fig 7c similar precision is achieved by the baseline nse log scheme followed by the baseline nse bc05 kge bc05 and kge bc02 schemes which have somewhat worse precision median metric values of 0 38 0 4 in contrast to the benchmark scheme the probabilistic predictions from the four baselines schemes shown in fig 7c namely the baseline nse kge nse bias and r2 schemes are much less precise with median metric values ranging from 0 44 up to 0 93 this finding demonstrates the detrimental impact of objective function inconsistency on the precision the enhanced schemes achieve much better precision than the baseline schemes fig 7d shows median precisions that range from 0 34 for the enhanced nse bc02 scheme to 0 36 for the enhanced kge bc02 scheme these values are very close to the median precision of the benchmark scheme the lower and upper quartiles of the precision metric distributions vary less for the enhanced schemes than for most of the baseline schemes this finding shows that the enhanced residual error model applied with inconsistent objective functions can produce probabilistic predictions that have similar precision to the benchmark scheme which uses a consistent objective function 4 2 4 volumetric bias fig 7e and 7f reports the volumetric bias of all schemes the benchmark scheme is once again one of the top performers with a median bias metric of 0 03 fig 7e the baseline schemes perform generally worse with median bias metrics that range from 0 04 nse and kge bc02 schemes to 0 08 kge scheme and up to 0 28 for the r2 schemes an exception is given by the baseline nse bc05 scheme which achieves a median bias metric of 0 02 and thus outperforms the benchmark scheme note also that bias is the only metric for which the baseline nse log scheme performs substantially worse than the benchmark scheme in contrast to the baseline scheme the enhanced schemes fig 7f achieve large improvements in the bias metric and perform similar to the benchmark scheme median bias values range from 0 02 enhanced nse bc05 scheme to 0 03 enhanced r2 scheme the reduction in bias achieved by the enhanced r2 scheme over the baseline r2 scheme is particularly salient 4 2 5 flow duration curve errors fig 8 reports the error profiles in the flow duration curves fdcs generated from the probabilistic predictions of selected baseline and enhanced schemes those using the nse kge and r2 objective functions as well as of the benchmark scheme the fdc errors of other schemes exhibit similar behaviour and are reported in figure s2 of the supplementary material the general finding is that the enhanced schemes produce fdc error patterns that mostly improve on the baseline schemes and are similar to the error patterns of the benchmark scheme the error patterns of the schemes exhibit a clear dependence on the flow range low mid or high flows as described next for most of the low flows 75 95th percentiles the benchmark scheme fig 8a has median relative errors in the range of 0 24 the baseline schemes fig 8b 8d and 8f incur much larger fdc errors than the benchmark scheme e g the baseline nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors as large as 25 51 for the same low flows all enhanced schemes fig 8c 8e and 8g achieve lower fdc errors than the baseline schemes for example the median relative error in the 80th percentile streamflow is reduced from 32 for the baseline nse scheme fig 8b to just 3 for the enhanced nse scheme fig 8c for mid flows 10th 75th percentiles the benchmark scheme has median relative errors in the range of 10 to 0 the baseline schemes fig 8b 8d and 8f incur fdc errors that are slightly higher than those of the benchmark scheme e g the baseline nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors of 9 to 25 the enhanced schemes fig 8c 8e and 8g achieve lower errors than the baseline schemes for all objective functions e g the enhanced nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors of 9 to 1 for the higher flows 3rd 10th percentiles the benchmark scheme fig 8a has median relative errors in the range 0 up to 7 the baseline schemes fig 8b 8d and 8f incur fdc errors that are similar or slightly larger than those of the benchmark scheme e g the baseline nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors of approximately 10 for all high flows while the baseline kge scheme fig 8d has median relative errors of 18 to 15 the enhanced schemes fig 8c 8e and 8g achieve lower errors than the baseline schemes for all objective functions e g the enhanced nse scheme fig 8b has median relative errors of 0 to 8 an exception from the performance pattern above is noted for the highest flow percentile 1st percentile which is captured better by the baseline schemes than by the benchmark and enhanced schemes for example the baseline nse scheme has the lowest median relative errors of 9 fig 8b while the benchmark scheme has higher median relative errors of 25 fig 8a and the enhanced nse scheme has the highest median relative errors of 44 fig 8c overall the enhanced schemes achieve tighter interquartile ranges of fdc errors than the baseline schemes this empirical finding indicates more robust performance with less sensitivity to specific catchment conditions for example at the 70th streamflow percentile the interquartile range of errors for the enhanced nse scheme is only 5 to 2 fig 8c which is far narrower than the interquartile range of errors of 3 to 50 for the baseline nse scheme fig 8b 4 3 summary of case study results three key points emerge from the case study results 1 the use of inconsistent objective functions substantially degrades the quality of probabilistic predictions when the reference residual error model zero mean is employed the probabilistic predictions from the baseline schemes are typically much worse than those from the benchmark scheme despite the same nominally robust bc02 residual error model being used 2 the loss in performance arises because the change in streamflow transformation parameters or more generally changes to the definition of residuals from stage 1 to stage 2 introduces a strong linear flow dependency into the stage 2 residuals remarkably this happens even when the stage 1 residuals have a mean close to zero and their flow dependencies are weak or non existent 3 the enhanced schemes achieve predictive performance that matches or nearly matches the performance of the benchmark scheme regardless of the objective function used in other words schemes with inconsistent objective functions can produce high quality predictions when the residual error model has been enhanced with a dependence of the error mean on simulated streamflow these findings are discussed next 5 discussion 5 1 why do the baseline schemes have poor predictive performance most baseline schemes which use inconsistent objective functions provide worse probabilistic predictions than the benchmark scheme which uses a consistent objective function for almost all the metrics used note that the baseline and benchmark schemes use the same bc02 residual error model which was shown to be well performing in previous studies mcinerney et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 indeed residual error diagnostics for the benchmark scheme in fig 3a fig 4 and fig 5 confirm that the bc02 error model provides an adequate description of residual errors when the hydrological model is calibrated using a consistent nse bc02 objective function the sole difference between the baseline and benchmark schemes is the use of inconsistent objective functions in the baseline schemes hence the deterioration in performance must be due to this difference the residual error diagnostics for the baseline scheme shown in fig 4b are once again illuminating the change in streamflow transformation parameters from stage 1 to stage 2 required due to the use of the inconsistent nse objective function to calibrate the hydrological model introduces additional structure a strong linear flow dependence into the model residuals that is not present when the consistent nse bc02 objective function is used as such when the bc02 residual error model is applied to hydrological model predictions obtained using the nse objective function we exchange one problem poor treatment of heteroscedasticity in the residuals for another spurious bias in the mean of the residuals the bc02 residual error model lacks flexibility to handle this additional error structure resulting in notably poor probabilistic predictions for the baseline schemes e g fig 4b empirical results indicate that this behaviour is systematic it occurs across virtually all catchments regardless of the objective function fig 5 to better understand the origins of the non zero mean in the stage 2 residuals of the baseline and enhanced schemes we distinguish the following two types of behaviours most schemes stage 1 residuals have a close to zero mean but stage 2 residuals have a clearly non zero mean this behaviour is exhibited by the majority of baseline schemes namely the baseline nse nse bias and kge schemes the close to zero mean of stage 1 residuals can be explained by these objective functions generally favouring simulations with close to zero biases this characteristic is particularly salient for the kge and nse bias functions as seen from equations 19 and 23 respectively but the nse function also contains an implicit bias penalty term gupta et al 2009 note that achieving close to zero mean residuals also requires the hydrological model to contain parameters with sufficient control over its water balance appendix d gr4j offers a particularly vivid exemplar in addition to parameter θ 1 which affects evapotranspiration it has the groundwater exchange parameter θ 2 which adds removes water directly from the outflow hydrograph the transition from close to zero mean in stage 1 residuals to non zero mean in stage 2 residuals is a consequence of the general principle that an estimator that is unbiased in raw space will generally become biased in a transformed space more generally this holds for any two distinct transformations unless the estimator variance is very small or the transformations are close to linear a more detailed theoretical exposition can be found in appendix d and in the statistical literature e g neyman scott 1960 miller 1984 taylor 1986 note also that in cases where stage 1 residuals have not attained a mean of zero the change in transformation parameters in stage 2 further amplifies the residual error mean e g see fig 5b the magnitude of the spurious non zero mean in stage 2 residuals depends on the values of λ 1 and λ 2 given that λ 2 0 2 is fixed in the bc02 residual error model the departure from zero mean is small when λ 1 0 0 2 and increases as λ 1 approaches 1 for this reason the baseline nse log scheme despite using a nominally inconsistent objective function λ 1 0 still achieves predictions with similar reliability and precision as the benchmark scheme though notably it incurs a larger bias section 4 2 similarly it appears that the kge objective function behaves sufficiently close to the nse objective function when the bc02 transformation is used in these objective functions the predictive performance of the two schemes nse bc02 and kge bc02 is generally comparable baseline r2 scheme stage 1 residuals have a non zero mean and stage 2 residuals also have a non zero mean this behaviour is exhibited only by the baseline r2 scheme it is clear from equation 26 that the r2 objective function has no terms penalising biases in the simulated streamflow hence it is unsurprising that its stage 1 residuals often have mean values far from zero irrespective of its origins the presence of a non zero mean is clearly problematic for the baseline schemes however the systematic rather than random nature of the linear trend suggests that it could be resolved with a corresponding structural enhancement of the residual error model 5 2 why do enhanced schemes achieve predictive performance similar to the benchmark scheme in contrast to the baseline schemes the enhanced schemes achieve a performance comparable to the benchmark scheme the specification of a flow dependent mean in the enhanced residual error model accounts for the flow dependent linear trend observed in the standardised residuals and avoids the loss of predictive performance incurred by the baseline schemes despite the enhanced schemes using the same inconsistent objective functions as the baseline schemes a key finding is that the choice of objective function has little to no impact on the quality of probabilistic predictions when the enhanced residual error model is used in contrast the choice of objective function makes a large difference when the reference residual error model is used the improved performance of the enhanced schemes reinforces traditional residual modelling practices which seek residual error models that match the statistical properties of the actual residuals as closely as possible bates campbell 2001 schoups vrugt 2010 evin et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 it is well known that residual error models that provide a good description of the actual errors achieve good quality probabilistic predictions sorooshian dracup 1980 bates campbell 2001 schoups vrugt 2010 evin et al 2013 2014 smith et al 2015 li et al 2016 sun et al 2017 in a post processor implementation the actual errors facing the residual error model are the stage 2 residuals the enhanced residual error model incorporates the flow dependent mean term derived from the corresponding residual error analysis hence while the enhanced residual error model is inconsistent with the objective function used in stage 1 it is consistent with the residuals computed in stage 2 an additional insight is gained by recognising that objective function inconsistency as defined in section 2 3 essentially implies an inconsistency between the objective function assumptions and the properties of the actual residual errors which in turn provides an intuitive reason for why these objective functions suffer poor performance given this perspective an important finding is that the enhanced residual error model despite its relatively simple linear nature offers sufficient flexibility to describe the residuals arising after hydrological model calibration to a wide range of objective functions both consistent and inconsistent the enhanced residual error model represents a form of bias correction here correcting the bias arising from the use of an objective function that is inconsistent with the residual error model for example the r2 objective function yields residuals with a particularly pronounced non zero mean yet the enhanced residual error model removes these biases and yields essentially unbiased predictions bias correction methods offer valuable advantages in predictive applications e g in the 4 stage post processor approach erris li et al 2016 and in the non stationary error model of jiang et al 2019 however a general consequence of using bias correction is that the deterministic hydrological model predictions computed using the parameters estimated in stage 1 may deviate substantially from the mean of probabilistic predictions detailed analysis of this behaviour is deferred to future work it is important to note that the flow dependent mean is introduced in the enhanced residual error model to accommodate the more complex error structure arising from objective function inconsistency as shown in fig 3 this enhancement does not address other challenging features of hydrological residual errors such as seasonality indeed the enhanced residual error model does not provide additional improvements over the reference residual error model when the latter is paired with a consistent objective function fig 7 shows that the enhanced nse bc02 scheme has similar performance to the benchmark scheme the use of the enhanced residual error model outside of post processor approaches is also questionable for example its use in a joint estimation approach is liable to result in interactions with hydrological model parameters controlling the water balance in other words the enhanced residual error model overcomes the loss of predictive performance incurred from using an inconsistent objective function in a post processor approach and restores the performance to the level achievable with a consistent objective function 5 3 is the assumption of zero mean errors problematic in its own right it may be tempting to attribute the poor probabilistic performance of the baseline schemes solely to the zero mean assumptions in the objective function and or the residual error model however such hypotheses do not hold on two accounts first if zero mean assumptions were problematic on their own the benchmark scheme which assumes zero mean residuals would have been unable to achieve a good performance yet the benchmark scheme is a top performing scheme in the empirical study second residual error analysis indicates that the zero mean assumption is met reasonably well by stage 1 residuals for 8 of the 9 objective functions considered in this work except the r2 objective function for which non zero mean residuals are unsurprising therefore zero mean assumptions on their own are not the cause of poor performance in our empirical case studies instead as seen in fig 6 and elaborated in sections 5 1 and 5 2 a zero mean residual error model is problematic only when paired with an inconsistent objective function where the inconsistency could be in terms of neglecting the treatment of heteroscedasticity skewness and or neglecting to penalise model simulations with large biases when a consistent objective function is used relaxing the zero mean assumption in the residual error model offers little benefit note that our empirical findings should not be taken as an argument against recognising non stationarity in hydrological processes and uncertainty quantification e g westra et al 2014 ammann et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 mcinerney et al 2020 see also montanari et al 2013 rather this study shows the range of applicability of relatively simple modelling formulations which as discussed next is valuable in many practical applications 5 4 practical benefits 5 4 1 a residual error model for a wide range of objective functions the study findings indicate that a residual error model can be used with a wide range of objective functions with minimal if any loss in predictive performance the enhanced schemes despite using inconsistent objective functions achieve probabilistic predictions with similar quality to the benchmark scheme which uses a consistent objective function this achievement offers substantial practical benefits 1 it is often impractical to change the objective function to one that is consistent for example re calibration of a hydrological model using a different objective function can be time consuming especially for more complex slower models more generally practitioners may favour certain objective functions or even develop their own based on previous experience with their specific hydrological models catchments and or operational objectives while researchers may be interested in specific objective functions as part of their study scope 2 it is often impossible to replace the residual error model with one that is consistent with the objective function the statistical assumptions underlying an objective function can be opaque and or unknown especially for composite objective functions that combine several other objective functions e g nse bias creating and testing customised residual error models for such objective functions can be challenging and using an untested residual error model risks producing low quality probabilistic predictions 3 it is often undesirable to replace the residual error model with one that is consistent with the objective function even when the statistical assumptions underlying an objective function are known these assumptions often do not match key properties of hydrological residual errors and therefore lead to low quality probabilistic predictions for example the nse objective function applied without a streamflow transformation corresponds to the simplistic constant variance gaussian residual error model which does not represent the heteroscedasticity and skewness of residual errors and is known to produce low quality probabilistic predictions sorooshian dracup 1980 kuczera 1983a schoups vrugt 2010 cheng et al 2014 mcinerney et al 2017 the empirical results indicate that the enhanced residual error model is robust it achieves high quality predictions across a wide range of catchments 54 and objective functions 9 it is noteworthy that the enhanced residual error model provides improvements even when the hydrological model is calibrated using the nse objective function without any transformation which as noted above does not account for the heteroscedasticity and skewness of residual errors the improvements achieved by the enhanced residual error model for the untransformed nse objective function will also hold for related untransformed least squares objective functions including the root mean squared error rmse and sum of squared errors sse objective functions all three of these objective functions correspond to the constant variance gaussian error model and yield the same calibrated parameter values kavetski 2018 mcinerney et al 2018 untransformed least squares objective functions are widely used in contemporary hydrological and broader environmental modelling the ability of the enhanced residual error model to achieve high quality probabilistic predictions in combination with these objective functions can hence bring particularly broad ranging benefits 5 4 2 simplicity the enhanced residual error model proposed in this study is relatively simple to implement and use 1 it is based on the post processor strategy for residual error modelling which is generally more flexible than joint strategies where the parameters of both the hydrological model and residual error model are estimated simultaneously in particular post processor strategies can be applied with a wide range of objective functions this work shows that residual errors can be modelled using a post processor strategy without the need to change the objective function or to re calibrate the hydrological model post processor strategies also enable a wider range of parameter estimation methods for residual error modelling the method of moments is used here but maximum likelihood and full bayesian methods can also be used evin et al 2014 li et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 2 the method of moments estimation method is simple yet can provide parameter estimates and hence predictive quality similar to more complex statistical inference methods mcinerney et al 2018 the method of moments does not require a likelihood function or optimisation and therefore requires less specialised statistical knowledge and fewer computational tools 5 5 future work the following research questions are noted for further investigation 1 generality of findings across broader applications the conclusions of this study are derived empirically from the catchments hydrological model and objective functions tested while the current analysis with 54 catchments and 9 objective functions produces clearly encouraging results it is possible that different enhancements might be needed for catchments with markedly different characteristics e g ephemeral and snow affected catchments similarly different hydrological models including those operating at hourly and monthly time steps may have different residual error characteristics e g depending on their flexibility in matching the catchment water balance or in reproducing the full range of streamflow from low to high at the relevant time scale finally if the objective function is exceedingly poorly chosen and yields a very poor fit of the hydrological model to observed data the residual errors may have a much more complex structure and may not be well described even by the enhanced residual error model 2 reducing flow duration curve errors across range of flow regimes the empirical results in fig 8 show that the magnitude of errors in the flow duration curve varies across the flow regimes for all schemes examined while the benchmark and enhanced schemes show low errors for many flow regimes some flows e g the highest 1 flows are better described by some of the baseline schemes more research is required to develop an enhanced residual error model that produces better quality predictions across the entire flow range 3 further development of residual error models and or objective functions the applicability of the flow dependent mean enhancement to more complex residual error models and or objective functions such as those that account for seasonality wang robertson 2011 li et al 2013 liu et al 2020 warrants investigation a related research question is the interpretability of the hydrological model parameters and corresponding deterministic model predictions when using residual error models with bias correction which can substantially shift the mean of the predictions 6 summary and conclusions high quality probabilistic predictions of streamflow are needed for a range of practical and research applications however many objective functions commonly used to calibrate hydrological models make implicit assumptions that are inconsistent with the assumptions made in common residual error models to describe the well known heteroscedasticity and skewness of residual errors in addition some objective functions may not penalise model biases this study establishes the detrimental impact of such objective function inconsistencies on the quality of daily probabilistic predictions obtained using a residual error post processor approach where stage 1 calibrates hydrological parameters using a user specified objective function and stage 2 calibrates a residual error model to describe predictive uncertainty an enhanced though still simple residual error model is then introduced to restore predictive quality without requiring changes to the hydrological model or objective function a total of 18 modelling schemes are examined which use 9 common objective functions and 2 residual error models reference and enhanced that employ the box cox streamflow transformation the benchmark scheme uses the reference residual error model which assumes a fixed error mean of zero and a consistent objective function the empirical case study applies the daily step hydrological model gr4j in 54 perennial australian catchments with range of diverse climate conditions the quality of time varying probabilistic predictions is quantified using reliability and precision the ability of probabilistic predictions to reproduce the overall marginal distribution of observed streamflow is quantified using volumetric bias and scrutinised in more detail using flow duration curves the key findings are as follows 1 the use of inconsistent objective functions in combination with the reference residual error model results in a substantial loss of predictive performance analyses of stage 2 residuals reveals a more complex residual error structure than when a consistent objective function is used benchmark scheme more specifically residual error diagnostics indicate spurious artefacts a clear departure from a zero mean and a pronounced linear trend in the relationship between standardised residuals and transformed simulated streamflow these artefacts can arise for at least two distinct reasons i if there is a substantial change in transformation parameters between stages 1 and 2 and or ii if the objective function structure does not substantially penalise model biases the reference residual error model which assumes a fixed mean of zero cannot reproduce such trends and consequently yields poor probabilistic predictions 2 the enhanced residual error model overcomes the loss of performance incurred from using inconsistent objective functions and restores probabilistic predictive performance to the level achievable with a consistent objective function the enhanced residual error model parameterises the residual error mean as a linear function of the transformed simulated streamflow and can match the linear trend in model residuals reported above 3 the enhanced residual error model is sufficiently flexible and robust to achieve high quality predictions over a wide range of catchments and common objective functions the improvements achieved by the enhanced scheme are evident for objective functions based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse kling gupta efficiency kge pearson correlation as well as for a composite objective function that combines nse with an additional bias penalty term for the nse and kge objective functions we also confirmed the findings using several values of the power parameter in the box cox streamflow transformation the enhanced residual error model can be used by hydrological modellers to achieve high quality daily probabilistic predictions from hydrological models already calibrated to a range of objective functions that is without requiring model re calibration this simplicity of application is expected to facilitate the uptake of probabilistic predictions by practitioners further investigation of the enhanced error model is recommended using other hydrological models as well as more catchments and objective functions 7 data availability the algorithms developed in this paper are available at https github com jasenter probabilistic app these algorithms

study appendix a method of moments estimation of standard deviation and autoregressive coefficient the probabilistic model and residual diagnostics used in this study require estimates of the standard deviation and autoregressive coefficient of residuals conditional on an a priori estimate of their mean these estimates are obtained using the method of moments mom let η η t t 1 t denote the time series of computed residuals and let μ μ t t 1 t denote its estimated mean the mean may be fixed to zero reference error model or allowed to vary in time enhanced error model the de meaned residuals are computed as 34 η t η t μ t the standard deviation is then computed as 35 σ η t 1 t η t 2 t and the autoregressive coefficient as 36 ϕ η t 2 t η t η t 1 t 1 σ η 2 the estimated conditional variance σ y 2 is computed from the estimated marginal variance σ η 2 as 37 σ y 2 σ η 2 1 ϕ η 2 this procedure is applied to estimate the stage 2 residual error model parameters as part of calibration see section 2 2 2 as well as to estimate the standard deviations of stage 1 and stage 2 residuals as part of the residual error diagnostics see section 3 6 appendix b standardised residuals from stages 1 and 2 this appendix details the definitions of stage 1 and stage 2 standardised residual errors which are used as part of the residual error analysis to diagnose and understand the deficiencies of the reference residual error model see analysis steps described in section 3 6 stage 1 standardised residuals are defined as 38 ν t 1 η t 1 σ η 1 ψ t 1 ψ t 1 σ η 1 39 ψ t 1 z q t θ z 1 40 ψ t 1 z q t θ h θ z 1 and stage 2 standardised residuals are defined as 41 ν t 2 η t 2 σ η 2 ψ t 2 ψ t 2 σ η 2 42 ψ t 2 z q t θ z 2 43 ψ t 2 z q t θ h θ z 2 where the normalised residuals η t 1 and η t 2 are defined as per equations 8 and 9 respectively and their standard deviations are estimated as per appendix a these quantities are calculated only for the baseline and benchmark schemes which use the reference error model appendix c scaling of streamflow and residual error slopes this appendix defines the scaling used in the residual error analysis to facilitate a quantitative summary across multiple schemes and catchments section 3 6 for a given scheme in a given catchment standardised streamflow is defined as 44 ψ ψ sdev ψ the scaling by sdev ψ accounts for differences in the range of streamflow across multiple catchments and schemes it is similar to the common practice of scaling values by their standard deviation when standardising gaussian random variables similarly the residual error slope slope of η with respect to ψ is scaled as 45 β β sdev ψ σ η the additional scaling by σ η accounts for differences in the range of normalised residuals across multiple catchments note that the scaled slope β is equivalent to the slope of standardised residuals ν with respect to standardised streamflow ψ as per section 3 6 the scaling is applied to β 1 and ψ 1 as well as to β 2 and ψ 2 i e both to stage 1 and stage 2 residual error characteristics appendix d mean of residuals after model calibration this appendix outlines the theoretical analysis of the case where the mean of stage 1 residuals is close to zero yet the mean of stage 2 residuals is clearly non zero see discussion in section 4 1 2 note that this analysis is intended to help understand the behaviour of residuals in stages 1 and 2 the enhanced residual error scheme introduced in this study does not require the residual error mean to be zero in either stages 1 or 2 indeed its key advantage is the ability to represent residual errors with highly non zero means and or pronounced linear dependencies on the transformed streamflow d 1 close to zero mean residuals after model calibration a simple but instructive analysis the general propensity of model calibration to produce residuals with close to zero means follows from two key considerations i most objective functions generally favour simulations with close to zero biases and ii most hydrological models contain parameters controlling the internal water balance consider a deterministic model h with model parameters θ a b where b is an offset parameter 46 q t h t θ x g t a x b the simplest non trivial instance of such model is the linear model q t a x t b though in general the function g can be arbitrarily nonlinear in hydrology parameters with behaviour notably similar to b include the gr4j groundwater exchange parameter θ 2 le moine et al 2008 and precipitation multipliers used to correct input errors e g clark et al 2008 renard et al 2011 henn et al 2016 and others suppose the deterministic model h is calibrated by minimising a least squares objective function e g sse nse rmse yielding optimal parameters θ a b for simplicity assume no response transformation is used i e 47 φ sse θ t 1 t η t 2 θ t 1 t q t h t θ x 2 t 1 t q t g t a b 2 applying the first order optimality condition for parameter b yields 48 φ sse θ b b b 0 2 t 1 t q t g t a b 2 t 1 t η t 0 from equation 48 the following identities hold at the parameter optimum 49 2 t 1 t η t 0 t 1 t η t 0 1 t t 1 t η t mean η 0 which indicate that the calibration achieves residuals with a zero mean the analysis can be readily verified for any model of the form given in equation 46 the calibrated parameter b will ensure residuals have exactly a zero mean if the calibration is carried out in transformed response space the residuals will have a zero mean in transformed space as such while achieving zero errors is impossible except in trivial cases achieving zero mean errors is much easier non sse objective functions and general models are harder to analyse mathematically and will generally not achieve such exact results however as long as the objective function penalises biased simulations and the hydrological model has control over its water balance the residual error mean is unlikely to depart substantially from zero as seen for the kge and nse bias objective functions tested in this study notable and obvious exceptions include the r2 objective function which does not penalise biased simulations and mass conservative hydrological models calibrated to data with large systematic errors e g a gross under estimation of rainfall d 2 transition from close to zero to non zero residuals after changes in transformation the transition from close to zero mean in stage 1 residuals to non zero mean in stage 2 residuals is a consequence of the general principle that an estimator that is unbiased in raw space will generally become biased in a nonlinear transformed space more generally this principle holds for any two distinct transformations as long as the estimator variance is not too small and or at least one of the transformations is not too close to linearity for example suppose the stage 1 residuals of the baseline nse scheme have a zero mean mean η t 1 0 this implies that q t θ h is an unbiased estimator of q t however once we move to stage 2 z q t 0 2 q t 0 2 cannot also be an unbiased estimator of z q t 0 2 q t 0 2 hence mean η t 2 0 a more detailed theoretical expositions of this behaviour can be found

4147,millions of cubic meters of water are lost every year from water utilities with detrimental consequences on the environment and on society however this large amount of water is not necessarily lost although leaking water utilities have the potential to recharge urban aquifers very little is known about the fate of leaked water and its interaction with subsurface anthropogenic features such as the high permeability trenches surrounding utility pipelines as these features are deemed to create preferential pathways it is crucial to understand if these can reduce urban aquifers recharge by interception and diversion of water leaked through a series of transient 3d numerical simulations under a variety of conditions i e different native soil properties slopes of the utility trench depths of the groundwater table and leak rates this study provides evidence that utility trenches can potentially alter the migration pathway of water leaked from utility pipelines located above the groundwater table therefore the urban karst effect has the potential to occur directly at the utility trench indeed from roughly 55 up to 73 of the water leaked is retained within the utility trench and does not reach the underlying aquifer in one third of the scenarios modeled this occurs because of the combined effect of soil retention properties initial effective water saturation relative permeability and intrinsic permeability although this analysis is still preliminary these results potentially challenge the traditional concept of leaking pipes recharging groundwater keywords pipe leakage urban karst groundwater recharge utility trench unsaturated zone numerical modeling 1 introduction the continuous and relentless increase of anthropogenic activities leads to the consumption of a tremendous amount of water as world population grows urban development follows and this comes at a cost usually paid by natural ecosystems indeed the environmental footprint of human activities is very often far from being sustainable as a result the availability of freshwater resources is put under serious pressure worldwide fao 2011 fao 2012 eea 2019 in most urban environments water is usually delivered and collected through dense networks of buried pipes either for freshwater supply water distribution systems or for wastewater and stormwater removal urban drainage systems although essential for urban life and development this infrastructure is often very inefficient due to the combination of several factors affecting its structural integrity like pipes aging poor initial laying and construction land movements external loads from traffic or adjacent construction sites and the presence of tree roots to name a few as a result managing authorities of water utilities are constantly facing the challenge of reducing excessive water leakage which becomes even more urgent in areas affected by prolonged droughts and severe water scarcity the depletion of natural freshwater resources is a direct consequence of this excessive loss as more water needs to be extracted often offsite and delivered to end users to face their demands this also leads to increased energy demands for water extraction e g electricity for pumping stations and treatment which still largely rely on fossil fuels thus contributing to greenhouse gases emissions stokes et al 2014 this in turn has detrimental consequences on the environment agriculture industry and society as a whole to give some figures accounting just for real losses from water distribution systems i e physical water losses due to leaks or bursts from mains and service connections and overflows from service reservoirs munich germany lost about 11 55 mm3 in 2011 bordeaux france about 7 55 mm3 in 2012 and lisbon portugal about 5 71 mm3 in 2013 lambert et al 2015a it is worth noting that these numbers come from relatively healthy infrastructures where measures like pressure management active leakage control pipes rehabilitation and repair are undertaken by water companies and managing authorities to tackle the water leakage excess lambert et al 2015b urban drainage systems leak as well potentially leading to soil and groundwater contamination wakida and lerner 2005 vázquez suñé et al 2005 burri et al 2019 it is indeed difficult to provide a proper estimate of these leaks as performance targets of the water industry lead water companies and managing authorities to focus more on freshwater supply again to give some figures indirect estimates of sewers leaks for central and south east london uk gave values up to 0 4 and 0 9 mm3 yr chisala and lerner 2008 however this large amount of water leaked from utility pipes is not necessarily lost indeed since the pioneering work of lerner 1986 it is now generally accepted that leaking water utilities have the potential to recharge urban aquifers price and reed 1989 lerner 1990 foster 2001 lerner 2002 hibbs and sharp 2012 bhaskar et al 2016 han et al 2017 for example leaks from utility pipes were considered among the main causes for increased groundwater recharge in several cities like lima peru lerner 1986 nottingham uk yang et al 1999 seoul south korea kim et al 2001 barcelona spain vázquez suñé et al 2010 la plata argentina kruse et al 2013 and shenzen china lancia et al 2019 lancia et al 2020 conversely their contribution was deemed variable over the years and even minor if compared to other factors as increased precipitation in the city of copenhagen denmark jeppesen et al 2011 or reduced evapotranspiration due to surface sealing for the city of dübendorf switzerland minnig et al 2018 therefore whether leaking pipes can actually increase water availability within urban environments is still not straightforward to identify and it is strictly case dependent moreover even though this water would eventually recharge urban aquifers its quality would still be a concern as urban soils are generally polluted by a variety of sources including leaking sewers tubau et al 2017 the subsurface beneath urban areas is characterized by a high spatial variability either because of the heterogeneity of native soils or as a result of shallow and deep anthropogenic alterations e g paved surfaces buildings basements and foundations excavations tunnels underground constructions utility pipelines etc moreover often very little historical information is available regarding urban aquifers and the alterations induced by urban development as water companies and managing authorities usually prefer to redirect elsewhere their efforts due to the several practical difficulties that would arise from the exploitation of this resource for water supply therefore predicting the fate of water leaked from utility pipes and its effects on urban aquifers is rather complex although essential for a possible reuse of a resource that would be lost otherwise or that could negatively affect other infrastructures e g flooding of underground spaces like basements and tunnels excessive hydrostatic stress foundations corrosion and structures uplift among others vázquez suñé et al 2005 attard et al 2016 kaushal and belt 2012 identified the concept of urban karst as the dense network of utility pipes influencing urban groundwater flow through their structural defects i e faulty joints cracks fractures unsealed connections as well as through their surrounding high permeability sand gravel trenches these are deemed to create preferential pathways for infiltrated stormwater contaminants and groundwater hibbs and sharp 2012 bonneau et al 2017 bonneau et al 2018a bonneau et al 2018b indeed this can be true when utility trenches and the surrounding soil are water saturated i e the groundwater table lies rises above the bottom of the trench and there is a sharp difference in intrinsic permeability between the two soils sharp et al 2003 shepley et al 2020 however very little is known when the groundwater table lies below these high permeability trenches and the effects of the unsaturated zone are taken into account in this case water leaked from water utilities is conventionally expected to reach urban aquifers regardless of a potential urban karst effect indeed urban aquifers recharge from water utilities is usually inferred from water balance calculations at the urban catchment scale often but not always supported by piezometry and chemical signature analysis however the complexity of urban environments and the scarcity of data make it difficult to discriminate the effects of leaking pipes among the numerous potential sources of recharge that might exist in urban areas e g stormwater infiltration facilities irrigation of gardens and parks infiltration from paved surfaces septic tanks etc hence these analyses can be affected by a high degree of uncertainty and there is a risk that the amount of water leaked from water utilities simply becomes a calibration parameter to find a closure for water balance calculations understanding if the urban karst affects the migration of water leaked from water utilities when these lie above the groundwater table would support practitioners and researchers in the challenge of identifying and quantifying urban aquifers recharge therefore more knowledge at a smaller scale is needed for the first time a systematic analysis of the effects of high permeability trenches on the migration pathway in the unsaturated zone of water leaked from utility pipes is here presented to this aim transient 3d numerical simulations under variably water saturated conditions were performed over different time scales up to 16 and 365 days accounting for a wide range of native soil properties and slopes of the utility trench as well as different leak rates and depths of the groundwater table 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual model and outline of the simulations the conceptual model consists of a leaking pipe laid in a utility trench surrounded by native soil whereas a paved surface lies at the top fig 1 the pipe was chosen to resemble a distribution main for pressurized water supply as more information is available on real losses from water distribution systems however the conceptual model is still fairly general as water flow within the pipe is not modeled therefore pipe dimensions are just indicative and its material is not specified the pipe leaks for the entire length of one of its joints with leak rates chosen to simulate background real losses characterized by low leak rates of long duration as these leaks run continuously and go undetected they are generally responsible for the majority of the water lost in water distribution systems where active leakage control and timely repairs of reported leaks are a standard practice lambert et al 1999 lambert and mckenzie 2002 lambert 2009 a minimum background loss of 0 48 l m d was considered as representative of a well managed infrastructure in good conditions lambert et al 1999 to simulate a wider range of leak rates of real water distribution systems lambert et al 2015a lambert et al 2015b this value was then increased by a factor of 2 and 5 therefore assuming a single pipe length of 6 m this results in leak rates of 2 88 l d 5 76 l d and 14 4 l d the utility trench is made of an embedment where the pipe is laid and a backfill on top of it as no universal rule exists the configuration of the utility trench was chosen based on the combination of the guidelines of different countries howard 1996 milano 1996 yorkshire water 2018 however this is likely a good representation of a typical utility trench for most urban environments suitable for both rigid and flexible pipes used for water supply all size specifications i e pipe outer diameter layers thickness trench dimensions etc are reported in fig 1 three slopes were considered for the bottom of the utility trench along the pipe namely 0 1 and 10 with respect to the horizontal to examine the effects of the groundwater table depth on the migration pathway of water leaked from the pipe a horizontal groundwater table was considered at 1 m and 3 m from the bottom of the trench measured with respect to the 0 slope scenario generally cohesionless free draining soils such as sands or gravels are preferred for the embedment whereas most native soils can be used for the backfill howard 1996 milano 1996 yorkshire water 2018 therefore according to the soil conservation service scs textural classification usda scs 1987 a sand was chosen for the embedment the native soil was used as backfill and three scs major textural groups sandy clay loam clay loam silty clay were chosen to have a sufficiently wide range of soil properties in contrast with those of the embedment soil properties are listed in table 1 a total of 54 scenarios comprising 3 backfill native soil properties sandy clay loam clay loam silty clay 3 slopes of the utility trench 0 1 10 3 leak rates 2 88 l d 5 76 l d 14 4 l d and 2 groundwater table depths from the bottom of the utility trench 1 m 3 m were modeled simulations were run for 365 days to mimic a persistent leak although those having a silty clay as backfill native soil were stopped at 16 days due to the impossibility to ensure a proper outflow condition for the lateral boundaries in the unsaturated zone i e water leaked from the pipe reached the lateral boundary in the unsaturated zone all scenarios are listed in table 2 2 2 numerical modeling the richards equation interface of the subsurface flow module of comsol multiphysics version 5 6 0 341 comsol 2020 was used for the numerical simulations by default this interface solves the pressure based formulation of the richards equation bear 1972 by the finite element method however the high nonlinearity of the problem required the use of the more robust mixed formulation celia et al 1990 celia and binning 1992 d aniello et al 2019a d aniello et al 2019b the van genuchten mualem retention model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 was chosen to describe soil constitutive relationships i e capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation depicted in fig 2 and reported in the appendix as it is the most widely used in literature furthermore most commonly used soil datasets like the one of carsel and parrish 1988 rely on it for the estimation of the retention properties of a wide range of unsaturated soils in addition to the soil properties listed in table 1 the remaining physical parameters were set as follows specific storage equal to 0 001 m 1 domenico and mifflin 1965 whereas water density and dynamic viscosity equal to 999 1 kg m3 and 0 001139 pa s at atmospheric pressure and 15 c venard and street 1975 the model domain is symmetric with respect to the plane passing through the vertical centerline of the pipe fig 1 at its maximum the domain is 14 m long whereas its cross sectional dimensions are 7 325 m and 5 170 m the leaky joint is at the middle of the pipeline these dimensions were chosen to avoid any interference with the lateral boundary conditions and to allow the water leaked to migrate through the utility trench for a sufficient distance to reach another joint of the pipeline at 6 m from the modeled leaky joint when considering different slopes of the utility trench other than 0 the domain was simply tilted with respect to the bottom of the leaky joint to keep model dimensions unaltered to ensure a horizontal groundwater table at 1 m and 3 m from the bottom of the utility trench a fixed hydraulic head of 3 m and 1 m being the bottom of the domain of the 0 slope scenario the reference plane was chosen for both bottom and lateral boundaries except for the surface of the pipeline and for the lateral face of the domain belonging to the plane of symmetry where a no flux boundary condition was enforced a no flux boundary condition was chosen for the top of the domain as well as the paved surface is practically considered impermeable indeed this is a simplistic approximation as paved surfaces may degrade over time allowing water infiltration and evaporation however this assumption was needed to reduce model complexity and uncertainty thus allowing to isolate the effects of the high permeability trench on the migration pathway in the unsaturated zone of water leaked from the utility pipe at the beginning of the simulations i e prior to the leak water is assumed in equilibrium with the prescribed groundwater table hence the same hydraulic head of the boundary conditions 3 m 1 m was set as initial condition everywhere finally a constant flux boundary condition was set for the leaky joint to mimic the leak rates of 2 88 l d 5 76 l d and 14 4 l d as the model domain is symmetric these rates were halved for the simulations the model domain was discretized on average with roughly 200 000 irregular tetrahedra the number of elements slightly changes among the three slope scenarios the mesh fig 1 was suitably refined at the leak and inside the utility trench as well as along the symmetry face thus resulting in element sizes ranging from 2 5 to 61 5 cm within the entire domain several meshes were tested and this proved to be the best compromise between numerical accuracy and computational burden supplementary online resource 1 the solution was advanced over time with a time step dictated by convergence history with a minimum of 0 01 s convergence of the solution was ensured by a relative tolerance of the nonlinear solver of 0 001 simulations were performed with an intel core i9 8950hk cpu running at 2 9 ghz with 16 gb ram and each scenario took from roughly one hour to few days of computations for a total runtime of about 16 days the most time consuming simulations were those with the highest leak rate and with silty clay as backfill native soil 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of leaked water and utility trench retention capacity in two out of the three native soil scenarios sandy clay loam and clay loam water leaked from the pipe preferentially migrates downward within the native soil rather than within the utility trench the predicted final distributions of the effective water saturation fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 clearly show how in both sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios only a small volume of the embedment in proximity to the leak is affected by water flow and storage this occurs regardless of the initial depth of the groundwater table the slope of the utility trench and the leak rate considered of course as the leak rate increases the effective water saturation increases as well in proximity to the leak in both embedment and backfill and within the native soil however a fully water saturated effective water saturation equal to unity wetting front never develops fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 the resulting wetting fronts are practically symmetric and only slightly affected by the slope of the utility trench in these scenarios and a small deformation of their shape is evident just in the embedment of clay loam scenarios when the slope and the leak rate reach their maximum values 10 and 14 4 l d as expected the effective water saturation overall decreases as the initial depth of the groundwater table varies from 1 m to 3 m fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 whereas the time for wetting fronts to practically reach a steady state configuration increases however whether it takes from days to months also depending on the leak rate as expected the lower the leak rate the more the time required in both sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios a steady state configuration is always reached well before the end of the simulations 365 days the fate of leaked water is sharply different in the silty clay scenarios indeed here water preferentially migrates within the embedment of the utility trench in all cases fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 the wetting front originating from the leak is now clearly influenced by the initial depth of the groundwater table and by the slope of the utility trench as the slope increases wetting fronts become visibly less symmetric and preferentially develop downward along the slope of the trench regarding the location of the groundwater table the closer it is to the trench the farther wetting fronts develop as the leak rate increases the effective water saturation increases within the embedment and wetting fronts move farther indeed water leaked almost reaches the side of the domain 7 m from the leak at 16 days when the slope and the leak rate reach their maximum values 10 and 14 4 l d and the groundwater table is 1 m deep silty clay l5 d1 s10 scenario fig 3 an urban karst effect is therefore occurring in the silty clay scenarios indeed most of the water leaked is retained within the embedment of the utility trench from a minimum of 55 2 silty clay l5 d3 s0 and l5 d3 s1 scenarios up to a maximum of 72 6 silty clay l5 d1 s10 scenario of the volume leaked in 16 days fig 4 practically no leaked water is retained within the backfill no significant changes in the percentages of leaked water retained can be observed as the slope of the utility trench varies from 0 s0 to 1 s1 and l2 scenarios i e leak rate of 5 76 l d are those witnessing the highest values 69 7 0 slope and 69 9 1 slope followed by l1 and l5 scenarios i e leak rates of 2 88 l d and 14 4 l d respectively as the slope gets to 10 s10 l5 scenarios experience the highest percentages of leaked water retained followed by l2 and l1 scenarios the actual volume of leaked water retained within the embedment overall increases as the leak rate increases as the groundwater table deepens the percentage of leaked water retained reduces in all silty clay scenarios although the general trend remains the same in both s0 and s1 scenarios as the leak rate increases this reduction roughly goes from 13 to 8 with respect to the 1 m deep groundwater table scenario d1 whereas from 14 to 12 in s10 scenarios in the sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios the utility trench embedment backfill is able to retain only from 0 5 to 1 6 and from 0 7 to 2 4 of the volume leaked in 365 days fig 4 respectively in particular these percentages increase as the leak rate decreases and the groundwater table deepens whereas remain practically unaltered as the slope of the utility trench varies overall given the really small percentages of leaked water retained by the utility trench and its migration pathway it can be easily concluded that no urban karst effect occurred in both sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios 3 2 drivers of the urban karst effect induced by the utility trench the sharp difference in intrinsic permeability between the embedment and the native soil table 1 might initially suggest a preferential migration of water within the utility trench once the leak occurs indeed the intrinsic permeability of the sand of the embedment is roughly 1 4 2 1 and 3 2 orders of magnitude higher than the sandy clay loam the clay loam and the silty clay chosen as native soil however the water leaked preferentially migrates within the embedment only in the silty clay scenarios fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 to find a consistent explanation to this it is necessary to look at the retention properties of these soils table 1 fig 2 prior to the leak water in the unsaturated zone is in equilibrium with the horizontal groundwater table and the distribution of the effective water saturation along the vertical follows the van genuchten retention curve fig 2 appendix therefore the deeper the groundwater table the higher the capillary pressure head and the lower the effective water saturation will be at a certain point within the unsaturated zone at the lower interface between the embedment and the native soil i e the bottom of the utility trench a sharp discontinuity in the effective water saturation exists as the pressure field is continuous this is the result of the difference in retention properties of the two soils this comes with a sharp difference in relative permeability which will dictate the migration pathway of the water leaked as the n parameter is the highest in the sand of the embedment table 1 the relative permeability of the sand would be the highest with the same effective water saturation fig 2 however this also makes the sand capillary pressure saturation curve the flattest fig 2 among the soil textural groups considered moreover the α parameter is the highest as well in the sand table 1 and its capillary pressure saturation curve is also the lowest fig 2 therefore being the two parameters α and n the highest the effective water saturation within the sand would be the lowest with the same capillary pressure head indeed prior to the leak the effective water saturation of the embedment at the bottom of the trench below the leaky joint is definitely low varying from 1 77 10 3 to 1 12 10 2 as the depth of the groundwater table from the bottom of the trench varies from 3 m to 1 m thus leading to a relative permeability of 2 73 10 11 and 2 47 10 8 on the other hand the silty clay exhibits the highest relative permeability 1 55 10 3 and 7 95 10 3 despite its n parameter being the lowest followed by the clay loam 3 92 10 4 and 5 74 10 3 and the sandy clay loam 1 05 10 5 and 3 24 10 4 this completely twists the initial guess based solely on the intrinsic permeability as the resulting hydraulic conductivity i e given by the product of the relative permeability for the saturated hydraulic conductivity appendix of the sandy clay loam is about 4 2 and 2 8 orders of magnitude higher than the sand of the embedment as the depth of the groundwater table from the bottom of the trench varies from 3 m to 1 m whereas about 5 1 and 3 3 for the clay loam and 4 6 and 2 3 for the silty clay however this does not explain yet why the water leaked preferentially migrates within the embedment when the silty clay is chosen as native soil and why the urban karst effect occurs to this regard the inspection of the distributions of the hydraulic conductivity at the end of each simulation along the vertical passing through the bottom of the leak z axis cut line along the line parallel to the pipe longitudinal axis pipe cut line in the middle of the embedment below the pipe and along the normal to the plane of symmetry at the bottom of the leak y axis cut line might be clarifying figs 5 7 furthermore the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity also gives information on the distribution of the effective water saturation given the hydraulic conductivity dependency on it and therefore on wetting fronts migration pathway in both sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios at the end of the simulations the hydraulic conductivity in the embedment is higher than the native soil just in proximity to the leak figs 5 7 indeed in the surrounding sand the effective water saturation is so low that the resulting relative permeability and hydraulic conductivity make water flow less likely despite the effective water saturation increases both in the embedment and the native soil as the leak progresses over time the relative permeability within the native soil increases to the point that the resulting hydraulic conductivity makes water flow more favorable here rather than in the rest of the embedment surrounding the wetting front as a result water leaked preferentially migrates downward in the native soil supported by gravity because it meets less resistance to its flow here in these scenarios water flow significantly occurs also through the lateral side of the trench parallel to the plane of symmetry extending wetting fronts up to 2 3 m from the trench in this direction figs 5 7 y axis cut line however the preferred migration pathway of this water is always directed downward driven by gravity in the silty clay scenarios water flow occurs preferentially within the embedment despite the initial relative permeability being the highest in the native soil beneath the leak fig 2 and the initial hydraulic conductivity being several orders of magnitude higher than the sand of the embedment this occurs for two main reasons i the intrinsic permeability of the sand is considerably higher than the silty clay about 3 2 orders of magnitude table 1 ii the native soil beneath the leak is near to complete saturation effective water saturation higher than 0 93 and 0 97 as the depth of the groundwater table varies from 3 m to 1 m from the bottom of the trench indeed although the effective water saturation increases over time both in the embedment and the native soil in proximity to the leak the relative permeability increase in the silty clay is limited as it is already close to saturation fig 2 conversely given the structure of the relative permeability function and being the initial effective water saturation close to zero in the embedment fig 2 its increase is higher and faster in the sand therefore even though the native soil saturates beneath the leak and its hydraulic conductivity reaches its highest value 5 56 10 8 m s or 7 26 in log10 scale in figs 5 and 6 scenarios l5 d1 s0 l5 d3 s0 l5 d1 s1 and l5 d3 s1 a modest increase of the sand effective water saturation up to about 0 18 is able to increase the sand relative permeability up to 7 39 and 4 44 orders of magnitude than its initial values d3 and d1 scenarios thus making the hydraulic conductivity of the sand of the embedment equal to that of the silty clay at full saturation as the leak progresses the effective water saturation and the relative permeability within the embedment continue to increase and the sand hydraulic conductivity becomes orders of magnitude higher than the silty clay figs 5 7 therefore water encounters more favorable conditions to its flow within the embedment rather than within the native soil although water flow still occurs through the bottom of the utility trench and to a lesser extent through its lateral side parallel to the plane of symmetry figs 5 7 y axis cut line as the slope of the utility trench increases water migrates faster and farther within the embedment thanks to gravity and to the progressive increase of the effective water saturation hence of the hydraulic conductivity figs 5 7 downward along the slope of the trench as previously shown as the groundwater table gets closer to the bottom of the utility trench effective water saturation and relative permeability increase within the embedment finally as the leak rate increases water flow within the embedment increases as well because of the higher pressure gradients and of the higher and faster increase of effective water saturation and relative permeability which allow water to travel farther in less time 3 3 perspectives limitations and implications for future research the numerical analysis previously discussed showed that there is potential for the urban karst effect to occur if leaking pipes are laid in utility trenches located above the groundwater table however specific circumstances must be encountered for this to happen leaked water preferentially migrates within the material hosting the pipe only if the permeability contrast with the native soil makes water flow more favorable within the utility trench this strictly depends on the intrinsic permeability and on the retention properties of both indeed as water flow occurs in a partially water saturated medium i e the unsaturated zone initial effective water saturation and relative permeability play a key role in absence of field data a series of assumptions were formulated in the controlled numerical environment here presented indeed the subsurface surrounding a utility trench beneath urban environments is more complex than the schematic representation adopted here for example the heterogeneity of native soils and other anthropogenic features would influence the migration pathway of leaked water thus potentially impacting urban aquifers recharge although further research surely needs to be performed in this direction the aim of this study was to clearly identify the main driving factors of the urban karst effect at the pipe scale and to do so with a reasonable computational effort and in absence of specific on site information a simple conceptual model was deemed preferable however the main limiting assumption of this study likely lies somewhere else namely in the equilibrium of water in the unsaturated zone with the groundwater table because of this prior to the leak the initial effective water saturation within the sand of the embedment is extremely low from 1 77 10 3 to 1 12 10 2 despite the groundwater table being relatively close to the bottom of the utility trench from 3 m to 1 m therefore its initial relative permeability is so low from 2 73 10 11 to 2 47 10 8 to make water flow more favorable within the native soil except for the silty clay scenarios however water saturation within the utility trench is likely far from its residual value for several reasons in real scenarios leaks from other structural defects of the pipe or from other pipes as well either laid in the same utility trench or in proximity to the one considered could indeed increase water saturation stormwater infiltration either from green spaces or from degraded paved surfaces is likely to occur in urban environments thus further potentially increasing water saturation within the trench nearby stormwater infiltration facilities might also be a potential source of increased water availability in the shallow subsurface and this water could be partially intercepted by the utility trench as well bonneau et al 2018b as a result the effective water saturation within the trench could be considerably higher in real scenarios thus reducing the sharp relative permeability contrast that made the urban karst effect irrelevant in two out of the three native soil scenarios modeled i e sandy clay loam and clay loam therefore the urban karst effect could potentially occur even with native soil properties closer to those of the material used within the utility trench new physical evidence at a relatively small urban scale e g at the street level is therefore needed this evidence should be supported by comprehensive datasets including information on i the status of the pipes structural integrity and leak rates and of their utility trenches configuration materials and water saturation ii the properties and the spatial variability i e heterogeneity of the surrounding native soil iii groundwater levels iv the nearby anthropogenic features i e other utility trenches buildings basements and foundations excavations tunnels underground constructions etc which could either divert or intercept water leaked for example other utility trenches could either act as capillary barriers or as sinks depending on their effective water saturation and on the relative and intrinsic permeability contrast with the surrounding soil v the additional sources of water in the shallow subsurface i e other leaking pipes stormwater infiltration facilities infiltration from green areas and paved surfaces septic tanks etc vi the presence of tree roots which could further divert water flow paths in the subsurface bonneau et al 2018a and more generally of vegetation which could reduce water availability in the subsurface through evapotranspiration bonneau et al 2018b this information would help understanding if the urban karst is actually able to intercept and divert water leaked from utility pipelines and if it is a common phenomenon or just confined to specific circumstances as a result new impetus and strength would be given to further modeling efforts allowing for example the definition of tailored leakage functions peche et al 2017 that could be used to upscale this information at the urban catchment scale with less computational burden peche et al 2019 a better identification and quantification of water flow in the subsurface of urban environments under a variety of potential on site conditions including different hydrogeological settings anthropogenic features and vegetation types to examine and quantify the influence of the urban karst on the connection between surface water and groundwater brunner et al 2009 thus also encouraging improvements in the coupling between surface and subsurface flow models peche et al 2017 this knowledge would help researchers and practitioners to better understand the fate of leaked water in the subsurface of urban environments thus improving water balance calculations and the management of the available groundwater resource this would also allow a more refined localization and quantification of groundwater alterations and of their potential effects on buildings and other infrastructures so as to support local authorities to act with proper preventive measures soil and groundwater contamination from leaking sewers could be better detected and assessed as well thus helping to mitigate their detrimental effects and improving urban groundwater quality for its potential reuse 4 conclusions a series of transient 3d numerical simulations were performed to systematically analyze the effects in the unsaturated zone of high permeability trenches on the migration pathway of water leaked from utility pipes under a variety of conditions i e different native soil properties slopes of the utility trench depths of the groundwater table and leak rates although the sharp difference in intrinsic permeability between the embedment i e the layer where the pipe is laid and the native soil might initially suggest a preferential migration of water within the utility trench the numerical analysis showed otherwise indeed leaked water preferentially migrates within the trench in the silty clay scenarios only whereas in the remaining two sandy clay loam and clay loam water flow mostly occurs downward in the native soil this is the result of the combined effect of soil retention properties initial effective water saturation relative permeability and intrinsic permeability however the silty clay scenarios showed that there is potential for the urban karst effect to occur directly at the utility trench indeed from roughly 55 up to 73 of the water leaked is retained within the embedment in these scenarios therefore in this case most of the water leaked would not directly reach the underlying urban aquifer because of the assumption of equilibrium of water in the unsaturated zone with the groundwater table prior to the leak the initial effective water saturation within the sand of the embedment is so low that the respective relative permeability makes water flow more favorable within the native soil in most cases however this might introduce a bias leading to a potential underestimation of the effects of the urban karst indeed in real scenarios water saturation within the utility trench is likely higher than its residual value for a variety of reasons including the presence of leaks from other structural defects of the pipe or from other pipes as well the infiltration of stormwater from degraded paved surfaces or green spaces and the presence of nearby stormwater infiltration facilities that might interact with the utility trench to name a few as a result the relative permeability contrast between the embedment and the native soil would be considerably lower and the urban karst effect could become relevant even when native soil properties are closer to those of the material of the utility trench more physical evidence at the small urban scale e g at the street level is required to understand if the urban karst can actually reduce urban aquifers recharge by interception and diversion of water leaked from utility pipelines this knowledge is essential to truly identify the fate of leaked water in the subsurface thus leading to a more conscious and sustainable management of the groundwater resource beneath complex urban environments indeed the analysis here presented is still preliminary and far from being exhaustive however its results showed that the urban karst could potentially alter the migration pathway of water leaked from utility pipelines directly at the utility trench this potentially challenges the traditional concept of leaking pipes recharging groundwater laying the foundations for future research funding the work of the first author andrea d

4147,millions of cubic meters of water are lost every year from water utilities with detrimental consequences on the environment and on society however this large amount of water is not necessarily lost although leaking water utilities have the potential to recharge urban aquifers very little is known about the fate of leaked water and its interaction with subsurface anthropogenic features such as the high permeability trenches surrounding utility pipelines as these features are deemed to create preferential pathways it is crucial to understand if these can reduce urban aquifers recharge by interception and diversion of water leaked through a series of transient 3d numerical simulations under a variety of conditions i e different native soil properties slopes of the utility trench depths of the groundwater table and leak rates this study provides evidence that utility trenches can potentially alter the migration pathway of water leaked from utility pipelines located above the groundwater table therefore the urban karst effect has the potential to occur directly at the utility trench indeed from roughly 55 up to 73 of the water leaked is retained within the utility trench and does not reach the underlying aquifer in one third of the scenarios modeled this occurs because of the combined effect of soil retention properties initial effective water saturation relative permeability and intrinsic permeability although this analysis is still preliminary these results potentially challenge the traditional concept of leaking pipes recharging groundwater keywords pipe leakage urban karst groundwater recharge utility trench unsaturated zone numerical modeling 1 introduction the continuous and relentless increase of anthropogenic activities leads to the consumption of a tremendous amount of water as world population grows urban development follows and this comes at a cost usually paid by natural ecosystems indeed the environmental footprint of human activities is very often far from being sustainable as a result the availability of freshwater resources is put under serious pressure worldwide fao 2011 fao 2012 eea 2019 in most urban environments water is usually delivered and collected through dense networks of buried pipes either for freshwater supply water distribution systems or for wastewater and stormwater removal urban drainage systems although essential for urban life and development this infrastructure is often very inefficient due to the combination of several factors affecting its structural integrity like pipes aging poor initial laying and construction land movements external loads from traffic or adjacent construction sites and the presence of tree roots to name a few as a result managing authorities of water utilities are constantly facing the challenge of reducing excessive water leakage which becomes even more urgent in areas affected by prolonged droughts and severe water scarcity the depletion of natural freshwater resources is a direct consequence of this excessive loss as more water needs to be extracted often offsite and delivered to end users to face their demands this also leads to increased energy demands for water extraction e g electricity for pumping stations and treatment which still largely rely on fossil fuels thus contributing to greenhouse gases emissions stokes et al 2014 this in turn has detrimental consequences on the environment agriculture industry and society as a whole to give some figures accounting just for real losses from water distribution systems i e physical water losses due to leaks or bursts from mains and service connections and overflows from service reservoirs munich germany lost about 11 55 mm3 in 2011 bordeaux france about 7 55 mm3 in 2012 and lisbon portugal about 5 71 mm3 in 2013 lambert et al 2015a it is worth noting that these numbers come from relatively healthy infrastructures where measures like pressure management active leakage control pipes rehabilitation and repair are undertaken by water companies and managing authorities to tackle the water leakage excess lambert et al 2015b urban drainage systems leak as well potentially leading to soil and groundwater contamination wakida and lerner 2005 vázquez suñé et al 2005 burri et al 2019 it is indeed difficult to provide a proper estimate of these leaks as performance targets of the water industry lead water companies and managing authorities to focus more on freshwater supply again to give some figures indirect estimates of sewers leaks for central and south east london uk gave values up to 0 4 and 0 9 mm3 yr chisala and lerner 2008 however this large amount of water leaked from utility pipes is not necessarily lost indeed since the pioneering work of lerner 1986 it is now generally accepted that leaking water utilities have the potential to recharge urban aquifers price and reed 1989 lerner 1990 foster 2001 lerner 2002 hibbs and sharp 2012 bhaskar et al 2016 han et al 2017 for example leaks from utility pipes were considered among the main causes for increased groundwater recharge in several cities like lima peru lerner 1986 nottingham uk yang et al 1999 seoul south korea kim et al 2001 barcelona spain vázquez suñé et al 2010 la plata argentina kruse et al 2013 and shenzen china lancia et al 2019 lancia et al 2020 conversely their contribution was deemed variable over the years and even minor if compared to other factors as increased precipitation in the city of copenhagen denmark jeppesen et al 2011 or reduced evapotranspiration due to surface sealing for the city of dübendorf switzerland minnig et al 2018 therefore whether leaking pipes can actually increase water availability within urban environments is still not straightforward to identify and it is strictly case dependent moreover even though this water would eventually recharge urban aquifers its quality would still be a concern as urban soils are generally polluted by a variety of sources including leaking sewers tubau et al 2017 the subsurface beneath urban areas is characterized by a high spatial variability either because of the heterogeneity of native soils or as a result of shallow and deep anthropogenic alterations e g paved surfaces buildings basements and foundations excavations tunnels underground constructions utility pipelines etc moreover often very little historical information is available regarding urban aquifers and the alterations induced by urban development as water companies and managing authorities usually prefer to redirect elsewhere their efforts due to the several practical difficulties that would arise from the exploitation of this resource for water supply therefore predicting the fate of water leaked from utility pipes and its effects on urban aquifers is rather complex although essential for a possible reuse of a resource that would be lost otherwise or that could negatively affect other infrastructures e g flooding of underground spaces like basements and tunnels excessive hydrostatic stress foundations corrosion and structures uplift among others vázquez suñé et al 2005 attard et al 2016 kaushal and belt 2012 identified the concept of urban karst as the dense network of utility pipes influencing urban groundwater flow through their structural defects i e faulty joints cracks fractures unsealed connections as well as through their surrounding high permeability sand gravel trenches these are deemed to create preferential pathways for infiltrated stormwater contaminants and groundwater hibbs and sharp 2012 bonneau et al 2017 bonneau et al 2018a bonneau et al 2018b indeed this can be true when utility trenches and the surrounding soil are water saturated i e the groundwater table lies rises above the bottom of the trench and there is a sharp difference in intrinsic permeability between the two soils sharp et al 2003 shepley et al 2020 however very little is known when the groundwater table lies below these high permeability trenches and the effects of the unsaturated zone are taken into account in this case water leaked from water utilities is conventionally expected to reach urban aquifers regardless of a potential urban karst effect indeed urban aquifers recharge from water utilities is usually inferred from water balance calculations at the urban catchment scale often but not always supported by piezometry and chemical signature analysis however the complexity of urban environments and the scarcity of data make it difficult to discriminate the effects of leaking pipes among the numerous potential sources of recharge that might exist in urban areas e g stormwater infiltration facilities irrigation of gardens and parks infiltration from paved surfaces septic tanks etc hence these analyses can be affected by a high degree of uncertainty and there is a risk that the amount of water leaked from water utilities simply becomes a calibration parameter to find a closure for water balance calculations understanding if the urban karst affects the migration of water leaked from water utilities when these lie above the groundwater table would support practitioners and researchers in the challenge of identifying and quantifying urban aquifers recharge therefore more knowledge at a smaller scale is needed for the first time a systematic analysis of the effects of high permeability trenches on the migration pathway in the unsaturated zone of water leaked from utility pipes is here presented to this aim transient 3d numerical simulations under variably water saturated conditions were performed over different time scales up to 16 and 365 days accounting for a wide range of native soil properties and slopes of the utility trench as well as different leak rates and depths of the groundwater table 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual model and outline of the simulations the conceptual model consists of a leaking pipe laid in a utility trench surrounded by native soil whereas a paved surface lies at the top fig 1 the pipe was chosen to resemble a distribution main for pressurized water supply as more information is available on real losses from water distribution systems however the conceptual model is still fairly general as water flow within the pipe is not modeled therefore pipe dimensions are just indicative and its material is not specified the pipe leaks for the entire length of one of its joints with leak rates chosen to simulate background real losses characterized by low leak rates of long duration as these leaks run continuously and go undetected they are generally responsible for the majority of the water lost in water distribution systems where active leakage control and timely repairs of reported leaks are a standard practice lambert et al 1999 lambert and mckenzie 2002 lambert 2009 a minimum background loss of 0 48 l m d was considered as representative of a well managed infrastructure in good conditions lambert et al 1999 to simulate a wider range of leak rates of real water distribution systems lambert et al 2015a lambert et al 2015b this value was then increased by a factor of 2 and 5 therefore assuming a single pipe length of 6 m this results in leak rates of 2 88 l d 5 76 l d and 14 4 l d the utility trench is made of an embedment where the pipe is laid and a backfill on top of it as no universal rule exists the configuration of the utility trench was chosen based on the combination of the guidelines of different countries howard 1996 milano 1996 yorkshire water 2018 however this is likely a good representation of a typical utility trench for most urban environments suitable for both rigid and flexible pipes used for water supply all size specifications i e pipe outer diameter layers thickness trench dimensions etc are reported in fig 1 three slopes were considered for the bottom of the utility trench along the pipe namely 0 1 and 10 with respect to the horizontal to examine the effects of the groundwater table depth on the migration pathway of water leaked from the pipe a horizontal groundwater table was considered at 1 m and 3 m from the bottom of the trench measured with respect to the 0 slope scenario generally cohesionless free draining soils such as sands or gravels are preferred for the embedment whereas most native soils can be used for the backfill howard 1996 milano 1996 yorkshire water 2018 therefore according to the soil conservation service scs textural classification usda scs 1987 a sand was chosen for the embedment the native soil was used as backfill and three scs major textural groups sandy clay loam clay loam silty clay were chosen to have a sufficiently wide range of soil properties in contrast with those of the embedment soil properties are listed in table 1 a total of 54 scenarios comprising 3 backfill native soil properties sandy clay loam clay loam silty clay 3 slopes of the utility trench 0 1 10 3 leak rates 2 88 l d 5 76 l d 14 4 l d and 2 groundwater table depths from the bottom of the utility trench 1 m 3 m were modeled simulations were run for 365 days to mimic a persistent leak although those having a silty clay as backfill native soil were stopped at 16 days due to the impossibility to ensure a proper outflow condition for the lateral boundaries in the unsaturated zone i e water leaked from the pipe reached the lateral boundary in the unsaturated zone all scenarios are listed in table 2 2 2 numerical modeling the richards equation interface of the subsurface flow module of comsol multiphysics version 5 6 0 341 comsol 2020 was used for the numerical simulations by default this interface solves the pressure based formulation of the richards equation bear 1972 by the finite element method however the high nonlinearity of the problem required the use of the more robust mixed formulation celia et al 1990 celia and binning 1992 d aniello et al 2019a d aniello et al 2019b the van genuchten mualem retention model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 was chosen to describe soil constitutive relationships i e capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation depicted in fig 2 and reported in the appendix as it is the most widely used in literature furthermore most commonly used soil datasets like the one of carsel and parrish 1988 rely on it for the estimation of the retention properties of a wide range of unsaturated soils in addition to the soil properties listed in table 1 the remaining physical parameters were set as follows specific storage equal to 0 001 m 1 domenico and mifflin 1965 whereas water density and dynamic viscosity equal to 999 1 kg m3 and 0 001139 pa s at atmospheric pressure and 15 c venard and street 1975 the model domain is symmetric with respect to the plane passing through the vertical centerline of the pipe fig 1 at its maximum the domain is 14 m long whereas its cross sectional dimensions are 7 325 m and 5 170 m the leaky joint is at the middle of the pipeline these dimensions were chosen to avoid any interference with the lateral boundary conditions and to allow the water leaked to migrate through the utility trench for a sufficient distance to reach another joint of the pipeline at 6 m from the modeled leaky joint when considering different slopes of the utility trench other than 0 the domain was simply tilted with respect to the bottom of the leaky joint to keep model dimensions unaltered to ensure a horizontal groundwater table at 1 m and 3 m from the bottom of the utility trench a fixed hydraulic head of 3 m and 1 m being the bottom of the domain of the 0 slope scenario the reference plane was chosen for both bottom and lateral boundaries except for the surface of the pipeline and for the lateral face of the domain belonging to the plane of symmetry where a no flux boundary condition was enforced a no flux boundary condition was chosen for the top of the domain as well as the paved surface is practically considered impermeable indeed this is a simplistic approximation as paved surfaces may degrade over time allowing water infiltration and evaporation however this assumption was needed to reduce model complexity and uncertainty thus allowing to isolate the effects of the high permeability trench on the migration pathway in the unsaturated zone of water leaked from the utility pipe at the beginning of the simulations i e prior to the leak water is assumed in equilibrium with the prescribed groundwater table hence the same hydraulic head of the boundary conditions 3 m 1 m was set as initial condition everywhere finally a constant flux boundary condition was set for the leaky joint to mimic the leak rates of 2 88 l d 5 76 l d and 14 4 l d as the model domain is symmetric these rates were halved for the simulations the model domain was discretized on average with roughly 200 000 irregular tetrahedra the number of elements slightly changes among the three slope scenarios the mesh fig 1 was suitably refined at the leak and inside the utility trench as well as along the symmetry face thus resulting in element sizes ranging from 2 5 to 61 5 cm within the entire domain several meshes were tested and this proved to be the best compromise between numerical accuracy and computational burden supplementary online resource 1 the solution was advanced over time with a time step dictated by convergence history with a minimum of 0 01 s convergence of the solution was ensured by a relative tolerance of the nonlinear solver of 0 001 simulations were performed with an intel core i9 8950hk cpu running at 2 9 ghz with 16 gb ram and each scenario took from roughly one hour to few days of computations for a total runtime of about 16 days the most time consuming simulations were those with the highest leak rate and with silty clay as backfill native soil 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of leaked water and utility trench retention capacity in two out of the three native soil scenarios sandy clay loam and clay loam water leaked from the pipe preferentially migrates downward within the native soil rather than within the utility trench the predicted final distributions of the effective water saturation fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 clearly show how in both sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios only a small volume of the embedment in proximity to the leak is affected by water flow and storage this occurs regardless of the initial depth of the groundwater table the slope of the utility trench and the leak rate considered of course as the leak rate increases the effective water saturation increases as well in proximity to the leak in both embedment and backfill and within the native soil however a fully water saturated effective water saturation equal to unity wetting front never develops fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 the resulting wetting fronts are practically symmetric and only slightly affected by the slope of the utility trench in these scenarios and a small deformation of their shape is evident just in the embedment of clay loam scenarios when the slope and the leak rate reach their maximum values 10 and 14 4 l d as expected the effective water saturation overall decreases as the initial depth of the groundwater table varies from 1 m to 3 m fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 whereas the time for wetting fronts to practically reach a steady state configuration increases however whether it takes from days to months also depending on the leak rate as expected the lower the leak rate the more the time required in both sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios a steady state configuration is always reached well before the end of the simulations 365 days the fate of leaked water is sharply different in the silty clay scenarios indeed here water preferentially migrates within the embedment of the utility trench in all cases fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 the wetting front originating from the leak is now clearly influenced by the initial depth of the groundwater table and by the slope of the utility trench as the slope increases wetting fronts become visibly less symmetric and preferentially develop downward along the slope of the trench regarding the location of the groundwater table the closer it is to the trench the farther wetting fronts develop as the leak rate increases the effective water saturation increases within the embedment and wetting fronts move farther indeed water leaked almost reaches the side of the domain 7 m from the leak at 16 days when the slope and the leak rate reach their maximum values 10 and 14 4 l d and the groundwater table is 1 m deep silty clay l5 d1 s10 scenario fig 3 an urban karst effect is therefore occurring in the silty clay scenarios indeed most of the water leaked is retained within the embedment of the utility trench from a minimum of 55 2 silty clay l5 d3 s0 and l5 d3 s1 scenarios up to a maximum of 72 6 silty clay l5 d1 s10 scenario of the volume leaked in 16 days fig 4 practically no leaked water is retained within the backfill no significant changes in the percentages of leaked water retained can be observed as the slope of the utility trench varies from 0 s0 to 1 s1 and l2 scenarios i e leak rate of 5 76 l d are those witnessing the highest values 69 7 0 slope and 69 9 1 slope followed by l1 and l5 scenarios i e leak rates of 2 88 l d and 14 4 l d respectively as the slope gets to 10 s10 l5 scenarios experience the highest percentages of leaked water retained followed by l2 and l1 scenarios the actual volume of leaked water retained within the embedment overall increases as the leak rate increases as the groundwater table deepens the percentage of leaked water retained reduces in all silty clay scenarios although the general trend remains the same in both s0 and s1 scenarios as the leak rate increases this reduction roughly goes from 13 to 8 with respect to the 1 m deep groundwater table scenario d1 whereas from 14 to 12 in s10 scenarios in the sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios the utility trench embedment backfill is able to retain only from 0 5 to 1 6 and from 0 7 to 2 4 of the volume leaked in 365 days fig 4 respectively in particular these percentages increase as the leak rate decreases and the groundwater table deepens whereas remain practically unaltered as the slope of the utility trench varies overall given the really small percentages of leaked water retained by the utility trench and its migration pathway it can be easily concluded that no urban karst effect occurred in both sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios 3 2 drivers of the urban karst effect induced by the utility trench the sharp difference in intrinsic permeability between the embedment and the native soil table 1 might initially suggest a preferential migration of water within the utility trench once the leak occurs indeed the intrinsic permeability of the sand of the embedment is roughly 1 4 2 1 and 3 2 orders of magnitude higher than the sandy clay loam the clay loam and the silty clay chosen as native soil however the water leaked preferentially migrates within the embedment only in the silty clay scenarios fig 3 supplementary online resource 1 to find a consistent explanation to this it is necessary to look at the retention properties of these soils table 1 fig 2 prior to the leak water in the unsaturated zone is in equilibrium with the horizontal groundwater table and the distribution of the effective water saturation along the vertical follows the van genuchten retention curve fig 2 appendix therefore the deeper the groundwater table the higher the capillary pressure head and the lower the effective water saturation will be at a certain point within the unsaturated zone at the lower interface between the embedment and the native soil i e the bottom of the utility trench a sharp discontinuity in the effective water saturation exists as the pressure field is continuous this is the result of the difference in retention properties of the two soils this comes with a sharp difference in relative permeability which will dictate the migration pathway of the water leaked as the n parameter is the highest in the sand of the embedment table 1 the relative permeability of the sand would be the highest with the same effective water saturation fig 2 however this also makes the sand capillary pressure saturation curve the flattest fig 2 among the soil textural groups considered moreover the α parameter is the highest as well in the sand table 1 and its capillary pressure saturation curve is also the lowest fig 2 therefore being the two parameters α and n the highest the effective water saturation within the sand would be the lowest with the same capillary pressure head indeed prior to the leak the effective water saturation of the embedment at the bottom of the trench below the leaky joint is definitely low varying from 1 77 10 3 to 1 12 10 2 as the depth of the groundwater table from the bottom of the trench varies from 3 m to 1 m thus leading to a relative permeability of 2 73 10 11 and 2 47 10 8 on the other hand the silty clay exhibits the highest relative permeability 1 55 10 3 and 7 95 10 3 despite its n parameter being the lowest followed by the clay loam 3 92 10 4 and 5 74 10 3 and the sandy clay loam 1 05 10 5 and 3 24 10 4 this completely twists the initial guess based solely on the intrinsic permeability as the resulting hydraulic conductivity i e given by the product of the relative permeability for the saturated hydraulic conductivity appendix of the sandy clay loam is about 4 2 and 2 8 orders of magnitude higher than the sand of the embedment as the depth of the groundwater table from the bottom of the trench varies from 3 m to 1 m whereas about 5 1 and 3 3 for the clay loam and 4 6 and 2 3 for the silty clay however this does not explain yet why the water leaked preferentially migrates within the embedment when the silty clay is chosen as native soil and why the urban karst effect occurs to this regard the inspection of the distributions of the hydraulic conductivity at the end of each simulation along the vertical passing through the bottom of the leak z axis cut line along the line parallel to the pipe longitudinal axis pipe cut line in the middle of the embedment below the pipe and along the normal to the plane of symmetry at the bottom of the leak y axis cut line might be clarifying figs 5 7 furthermore the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity also gives information on the distribution of the effective water saturation given the hydraulic conductivity dependency on it and therefore on wetting fronts migration pathway in both sandy clay loam and clay loam scenarios at the end of the simulations the hydraulic conductivity in the embedment is higher than the native soil just in proximity to the leak figs 5 7 indeed in the surrounding sand the effective water saturation is so low that the resulting relative permeability and hydraulic conductivity make water flow less likely despite the effective water saturation increases both in the embedment and the native soil as the leak progresses over time the relative permeability within the native soil increases to the point that the resulting hydraulic conductivity makes water flow more favorable here rather than in the rest of the embedment surrounding the wetting front as a result water leaked preferentially migrates downward in the native soil supported by gravity because it meets less resistance to its flow here in these scenarios water flow significantly occurs also through the lateral side of the trench parallel to the plane of symmetry extending wetting fronts up to 2 3 m from the trench in this direction figs 5 7 y axis cut line however the preferred migration pathway of this water is always directed downward driven by gravity in the silty clay scenarios water flow occurs preferentially within the embedment despite the initial relative permeability being the highest in the native soil beneath the leak fig 2 and the initial hydraulic conductivity being several orders of magnitude higher than the sand of the embedment this occurs for two main reasons i the intrinsic permeability of the sand is considerably higher than the silty clay about 3 2 orders of magnitude table 1 ii the native soil beneath the leak is near to complete saturation effective water saturation higher than 0 93 and 0 97 as the depth of the groundwater table varies from 3 m to 1 m from the bottom of the trench indeed although the effective water saturation increases over time both in the embedment and the native soil in proximity to the leak the relative permeability increase in the silty clay is limited as it is already close to saturation fig 2 conversely given the structure of the relative permeability function and being the initial effective water saturation close to zero in the embedment fig 2 its increase is higher and faster in the sand therefore even though the native soil saturates beneath the leak and its hydraulic conductivity reaches its highest value 5 56 10 8 m s or 7 26 in log10 scale in figs 5 and 6 scenarios l5 d1 s0 l5 d3 s0 l5 d1 s1 and l5 d3 s1 a modest increase of the sand effective water saturation up to about 0 18 is able to increase the sand relative permeability up to 7 39 and 4 44 orders of magnitude than its initial values d3 and d1 scenarios thus making the hydraulic conductivity of the sand of the embedment equal to that of the silty clay at full saturation as the leak progresses the effective water saturation and the relative permeability within the embedment continue to increase and the sand hydraulic conductivity becomes orders of magnitude higher than the silty clay figs 5 7 therefore water encounters more favorable conditions to its flow within the embedment rather than within the native soil although water flow still occurs through the bottom of the utility trench and to a lesser extent through its lateral side parallel to the plane of symmetry figs 5 7 y axis cut line as the slope of the utility trench increases water migrates faster and farther within the embedment thanks to gravity and to the progressive increase of the effective water saturation hence of the hydraulic conductivity figs 5 7 downward along the slope of the trench as previously shown as the groundwater table gets closer to the bottom of the utility trench effective water saturation and relative permeability increase within the embedment finally as the leak rate increases water flow within the embedment increases as well because of the higher pressure gradients and of the higher and faster increase of effective water saturation and relative permeability which allow water to travel farther in less time 3 3 perspectives limitations and implications for future research the numerical analysis previously discussed showed that there is potential for the urban karst effect to occur if leaking pipes are laid in utility trenches located above the groundwater table however specific circumstances must be encountered for this to happen leaked water preferentially migrates within the material hosting the pipe only if the permeability contrast with the native soil makes water flow more favorable within the utility trench this strictly depends on the intrinsic permeability and on the retention properties of both indeed as water flow occurs in a partially water saturated medium i e the unsaturated zone initial effective water saturation and relative permeability play a key role in absence of field data a series of assumptions were formulated in the controlled numerical environment here presented indeed the subsurface surrounding a utility trench beneath urban environments is more complex than the schematic representation adopted here for example the heterogeneity of native soils and other anthropogenic features would influence the migration pathway of leaked water thus potentially impacting urban aquifers recharge although further research surely needs to be performed in this direction the aim of this study was to clearly identify the main driving factors of the urban karst effect at the pipe scale and to do so with a reasonable computational effort and in absence of specific on site information a simple conceptual model was deemed preferable however the main limiting assumption of this study likely lies somewhere else namely in the equilibrium of water in the unsaturated zone with the groundwater table because of this prior to the leak the initial effective water saturation within the sand of the embedment is extremely low from 1 77 10 3 to 1 12 10 2 despite the groundwater table being relatively close to the bottom of the utility trench from 3 m to 1 m therefore its initial relative permeability is so low from 2 73 10 11 to 2 47 10 8 to make water flow more favorable within the native soil except for the silty clay scenarios however water saturation within the utility trench is likely far from its residual value for several reasons in real scenarios leaks from other structural defects of the pipe or from other pipes as well either laid in the same utility trench or in proximity to the one considered could indeed increase water saturation stormwater infiltration either from green spaces or from degraded paved surfaces is likely to occur in urban environments thus further potentially increasing water saturation within the trench nearby stormwater infiltration facilities might also be a potential source of increased water availability in the shallow subsurface and this water could be partially intercepted by the utility trench as well bonneau et al 2018b as a result the effective water saturation within the trench could be considerably higher in real scenarios thus reducing the sharp relative permeability contrast that made the urban karst effect irrelevant in two out of the three native soil scenarios modeled i e sandy clay loam and clay loam therefore the urban karst effect could potentially occur even with native soil properties closer to those of the material used within the utility trench new physical evidence at a relatively small urban scale e g at the street level is therefore needed this evidence should be supported by comprehensive datasets including information on i the status of the pipes structural integrity and leak rates and of their utility trenches configuration materials and water saturation ii the properties and the spatial variability i e heterogeneity of the surrounding native soil iii groundwater levels iv the nearby anthropogenic features i e other utility trenches buildings basements and foundations excavations tunnels underground constructions etc which could either divert or intercept water leaked for example other utility trenches could either act as capillary barriers or as sinks depending on their effective water saturation and on the relative and intrinsic permeability contrast with the surrounding soil v the additional sources of water in the shallow subsurface i e other leaking pipes stormwater infiltration facilities infiltration from green areas and paved surfaces septic tanks etc vi the presence of tree roots which could further divert water flow paths in the subsurface bonneau et al 2018a and more generally of vegetation which could reduce water availability in the subsurface through evapotranspiration bonneau et al 2018b this information would help understanding if the urban karst is actually able to intercept and divert water leaked from utility pipelines and if it is a common phenomenon or just confined to specific circumstances as a result new impetus and strength would be given to further modeling efforts allowing for example the definition of tailored leakage functions peche et al 2017 that could be used to upscale this information at the urban catchment scale with less computational burden peche et al 2019 a better identification and quantification of water flow in the subsurface of urban environments under a variety of potential on site conditions including different hydrogeological settings anthropogenic features and vegetation types to examine and quantify the influence of the urban karst on the connection between surface water and groundwater brunner et al 2009 thus also encouraging improvements in the coupling between surface and subsurface flow models peche et al 2017 this knowledge would help researchers and practitioners to better understand the fate of leaked water in the subsurface of urban environments thus improving water balance calculations and the management of the available groundwater resource this would also allow a more refined localization and quantification of groundwater alterations and of their potential effects on buildings and other infrastructures so as to support local authorities to act with proper preventive measures soil and groundwater contamination from leaking sewers could be better detected and assessed as well thus helping to mitigate their detrimental effects and improving urban groundwater quality for its potential reuse 4 conclusions a series of transient 3d numerical simulations were performed to systematically analyze the effects in the unsaturated zone of high permeability trenches on the migration pathway of water leaked from utility pipes under a variety of conditions i e different native soil properties slopes of the utility trench depths of the groundwater table and leak rates although the sharp difference in intrinsic permeability between the embedment i e the layer where the pipe is laid and the native soil might initially suggest a preferential migration of water within the utility trench the numerical analysis showed otherwise indeed leaked water preferentially migrates within the trench in the silty clay scenarios only whereas in the remaining two sandy clay loam and clay loam water flow mostly occurs downward in the native soil this is the result of the combined effect of soil retention properties initial effective water saturation relative permeability and intrinsic permeability however the silty clay scenarios showed that there is potential for the urban karst effect to occur directly at the utility trench indeed from roughly 55 up to 73 of the water leaked is retained within the embedment in these scenarios therefore in this case most of the water leaked would not directly reach the underlying urban aquifer because of the assumption of equilibrium of water in the unsaturated zone with the groundwater table prior to the leak the initial effective water saturation within the sand of the embedment is so low that the respective relative permeability makes water flow more favorable within the native soil in most cases however this might introduce a bias leading to a potential underestimation of the effects of the urban karst indeed in real scenarios water saturation within the utility trench is likely higher than its residual value for a variety of reasons including the presence of leaks from other structural defects of the pipe or from other pipes as well the infiltration of stormwater from degraded paved surfaces or green spaces and the presence of nearby stormwater infiltration facilities that might interact with the utility trench to name a few as a result the relative permeability contrast between the embedment and the native soil would be considerably lower and the urban karst effect could become relevant even when native soil properties are closer to those of the material of the utility trench more physical evidence at the small urban scale e g at the street level is required to understand if the urban karst can actually reduce urban aquifers recharge by interception and diversion of water leaked from utility pipelines this knowledge is essential to truly identify the fate of leaked water in the subsurface thus leading to a more conscious and sustainable management of the groundwater resource beneath complex urban environments indeed the analysis here presented is still preliminary and far from being exhaustive however its results showed that the urban karst could potentially alter the migration pathway of water leaked from utility pipelines directly at the utility trench this potentially challenges the traditional concept of leaking pipes recharging groundwater laying the foundations for future research funding the work of the first author andrea d

was calibrated and employed prior to calibration sensitivity analysis of swmm hydrologic hydraulic and permeable surfaces input parameters was conducted using a global sensitivity analysis method two novel indices the index for reliability of urban drainage adaptation iruda and the climate variability adaptation index cvai were also introduced iruda assesses the total reliability of an urban drainage network in hydraulic temporal and volumetric terms sizing of flood mitigation measures was undertaken employing construction cost along with iruda cvai was used for alternative selection among different flood mitigation scenarios cvai assesses the total adaptive capacity of the drainage network based on hydrological hydraulic and economic aspects of the proposed adaptation plan a forward uncertainty propagation scheme was employed on the selected alternative in order to examine input data and parametric uncertainty with respect to the peak discharge at the outlet of the basin finally monetization of ecosystem services offered by green measures is presented the simulation results for the study area illustrated that under the non stationarity assumption future rainfall intensities and urban flooding risk will increase and therefore further flood mitigation measures will be required furthermore the majority of the adaptation strategies examined were found to improve the capacity and reliability of the drainage network moreover the results revealed that permeable pavements perform better for storm events with return period of up to five years overall it can be concluded that design criteria need to be reviewed and also green measures such as permeable surfaces can be introduced in the design procedure keywords future idf curves climate variability

of rainfall extremes due to climate change projections is expected to influence urban pluvial and flash flooding phenomena bayazit 2015 chandrakar et al 2017 chattopadhyay et al 2017 dahal et al 2016 dubey and sharma 2018 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 ouhamdouch and bahir 2017 moreover land use land cover changes projected population growth and urban sprawl are expected to augment the pressure on the natural environment and on infrastructure especially in urban areas bayazit 2015 rani and sreekesh 2019 shrestha et al 2014 singh et al 2020 all the aforementioned factors pose risk of increased flooding to the urban community as urban drainage networks may need to operate with a different failure probability than the one they were originally designed for however this fact poses a unique opportunity to shift the design procedure towards a more sustainable approach by incorporating green flood mitigation measures e g green roofs permeable surfaces in the design kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 impacts of climate change on precipitation extremes and urban drainage networks are based on the projections of climate models however spatial and temporal resolution and biases of general circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms make them unreliable for studying climate change impacts on urban flooding willems et al 2012a willems et al 2012b different approaches and frameworks have been presented in the literature for modeling the impacts of climate change on short duration extremes e g nguyen et al 2007 nikolic and simonovic 2015 schardong et al 2020 the main questions regarding urban drainage adaptation to climate change the research community is trying to answer are i whether to use rainfall projections from gcm gcm rcm ensembles or to use the new generation of climate models i e the convection permitting models cpm for studying the impacts of climate change on rainfall extremes ii which methods of spatial downscaling and bias correction are more appropriate for urban drainage impact studies iii how to remove stationarity i e use a moving reference period which hinders both climate models and statistical downscaling techniques kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 in some regions of the world sub daily extreme rainfall is intensifying more rapidly than daily extreme precipitation barbero et al 2019 with possible consequences including the increased occurrence of pluvial and flash floods forestieri et al 2018a forestieri et al 2018b pumo et al 2017 though this pattern is not observed everywhere barbero et al 2019 raw data from climate model simulations tend to overestimate design rainfalls however bias correction and temporal disaggregation must be practiced with caution kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 for example rodríguez et al 2014 studied the effects of climate change on extreme precipitation for the city of barcelona spain concluding that the calculated change factors using temporally disaggregated rainfall i e 1 h are higher than the ones obtained by using the daily rainfall furthermore the results demonstrated an increase i e at least 4 in daily rainfall with return periods greater than 20 years however they argued that the results tend to be sensitive to the climate model and the observational data used rodríguez et al 2014 impact of climate change on rainfall extremes has been found to differ based on the return period and the duration examined ganguli and coulibaly 2017 updated the intensity duration frequency idf curves for southern ontario canada they concluded that future idf curves are projected to increase by about 7 for return periods of up to ten years however for less frequent rainfalls the projected increase of the idf curves ranged from 2 to 44 based on the return period and the duration studied ganguli and coulibaly 2017 impact of climate change on future rainfall intensities has been found to decrease increase based on the study area the climate model used and the future horizon forestieri et al 2018a shrestha et al 2017 vu et al 2017 for example shrestha et al 2017 studied the effects of climate change in the city of bangkok thailand and concluded that the percent change in future rainfall intensity ranges between 18 and 50 based on the return period the duration the climate model and the scenario examined vu et al 2017 reported an increase of future one hour rainfall intensity in hanoi vietnam ranging between 34 and 48 for the return periods studied forestieri et al 2018a studied the impacts of climate change on the idf curves for palermo and catania in sicily italy their results suggested an increase in the future rainfall depth compared to the observations ranging from about 17 to 86 in addition they reported that variability of future idf curves increases as the horizon and return period examined increases chandra et al 2015 argued that parametric uncertainty is larger than climate model uncertainty and that the uncertainty associated with long durations is smaller than the uncertainty associated with short durations overall it can be concluded that there is still great uncertainty associated with the modeling and the effects of climate change on short rainfall extremes especially for urban areas kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 the research community has also been focusing on the impacts of urbanization urban sprawl climate change and land use land cover changes on urban drainage networks and have concluded that drainage systems will need to be redesigned in the future huong and pathirana 2013 semadeni davies et al 2008a 2008b zhou et al 2012 the majority of studies undertaken to date are qualitative in nature nonetheless a small number of studies have conducted detailed analysis of city scale impacts across sectors notably london new york and boston kirshen et al 2008 gangrade et al 2019 argued that the probable maximum flood will increase under projections of climate change for the etowah basin in georgia usa panos et al 2021 assessed the adaptive capacity of the drainage network on a small urban basin in colorado usa they concluded that the urban drainage network may be able to cope with the separate effects of land use land cover changes or climate change egger and maurer 2015 argued that uncertainty of multi model climate ensembles mainly stems from sampling uncertainty rather than uncertainty of climate model projections dong et al 2017 applied the storm water management model swmm in an urban area in kumming china in assessing and comparing resilience and cost of green and grey measures however environmental cost was not included in the assessment löwe et al 2017 proposed a novel model for investigating pluvial flood risk under the effects of urban sprawl and climate change using an 1d 2d hydrodynamic model le et al 2021 investigated flood hazard in the city of ha tinh vietnam they argued that extreme rainfall events will increase in the future ranging from 5 to 20 and as a result flood extent or severity will also increase ranging from 20 to 40 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 reviewed relevant aspects of urban drainage adaptation to climate change concluding that grey structural measures and green flood mitigation measures are the main flood mitigation measures examined in the scientific literature green flood mitigation measures are widely applied and studied by scientists around the world e g kourtis et al 2020 2018 leimgruber et al 2018 recent studies are focusing among others on modeling green measures palla and gnecco 2015 the effect of green measures on urban flooding and combined sewer overflows joshi et al 2021 kourtis et al 2018 qin et al 2013 the cost effectiveness of green measures chui et al 2016 and on the uncertainty in the model input parameters and how it affects the output leimgruber et al 2018 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 argued that uncertainties associated with hydrologic hydraulic modeling and flood mitigation alternatives along with the monetization of the ecosystem services provided by green solutions are subjects that need to be further studied in the present work a novel decision support framework for climate change adaptation of urban drainage networks is introduced which incorporates three components and is fully described in section 2 in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework regarding the holistic assessment of grey green flood mitigation measures the framework is applied in a small urbanized basin five widely used bias correction methods are compared for their efficiency to remove biases from rcm simulations a methodology for upgrading idf curves in urban areas incorporating uncertainty is demonstrated and employed to analyze the effect of non stationary climate projections at hourly scale swmm is used for hydrologic hydraulic calculation while ciria benefits evaluation of suds tool b st horton et al 2019 is used for monetization of the benefits ecosystem services offered

and volumetric terms can be assessed through the iruda index however in the present work iruda and construction cost are used for dimensioning of the proposed flood mitigation alternatives cvai assesses the total adaptive capacity of a drainage network and is used for selecting the best alternative for urban drainage adaptation to climate change the aim of this paper is to introduce a novel framework for systematic analysis of urban drainage adaptation strategies considering climate variability to assess the main impacts of climate change on short rainfall extremes idf curves and urban drainage networks to introduce an index for assessing overall reliability of an urban drainage system in terms of hydraulic temporal and volumetric reliability to introduce an index for assessing total adaptive capacity of an urban drainage network to incorporate in the design procedure benefits offered by ecosystem services in economic terms to assess total uncertainty and to demonstrate the

specifically the gcm rcm rcp the spatial and temporal resolutions of the final product and the time period are shown 2 3 bias correction in total five bias correction methods were used and compared with each other and with the raw data bias correction was undertaken by utilizing the observed hourly rainfall data from noa s station at thissio the five methods used were fig 1 part i i delta change dc approach ii linear scaling ls method iii local intensity scaling loci iv power transformation pt and v quantile mapping qm in order to assess the performance of the five bias corrections methods the rcm bias corrected time series were compared based on the following six statistical measures a mean μ b standard deviation σ c coefficient of variation cοv σ μ d 90th percentile x90 e probability of wet days pwet and f mean absolute error mae these measures are the same as those used by teutschbein and seibert 2012 to compare the same five bias correction methods it must be stated that the assessment was undertaken only for the calibration period i e 1999 2019 21 years of observed hourly precipitation the dc method was not assessed as by definition the control run period 1991 2019 is the same as the observation period 2 3 1 delta change dc the dc method is based on the idea to use rcm anomalies for perturbating observed data teutschbein and seibert 2012 the main advantages of the dc method are i the method is relatively easy to apply and ii the preservation of the observed pattern of temporal and spatial variability on the other hand the main disadvantages of the dc method are i possible changes in the distribution of the variables of interest are ignored and ii possible changes in the dry and wet spells are not accounted for regarding climate change scenarios the anomalies of the rcm simulations between the base line scenario and the future scenarios are superimposed upon the observational series on a monthly basis based on the following equations teutschbein and seibert 2012 1 p cont d p obs d p scen d p obs d μ m p scen d μ m p cont d where p cont is bias corrected precipitation data for the base line period p scen is the final bias corrected precipitation

precipitation depth for wet days initially a precipitation threshold pth contr is calibrated and applied in order to correct the number of wet days in both control and scenario run the threshold is calculated so that the number of rainy days of the raw rcm data matches the number of rainy days of the observed data eqs 3 and 4 then a correction factor is calculated based on the long term monthly

corrected so that their distribution function f agrees with the distribution function of the observations teutschbein and seibert 2012 a statistical relationship is developed between the observed and the simulated values this is accomplished as the simulated values are replaced by the observed ones at the same cumulative density function the gamma distribution can be used for analysis of

parameter 2 4 temporal downscaling in order to acquire future idf curves the future bias corrected daily rainfall projections need to be disaggregated into a finer scale using the fine scale e g hourly observed data fig 1 part i a wide variety of methods both stochastic e g molnar and burlando 2005 and deterministic e g ormsbee 1989 have been proposed in the literature for temporal disaggregation of rainfall the most widely used approach for temporal disaggregation of rainfall are cascade models chandrakar et al 2017 in the present work we employed a cascade model based on invariance theory and more specifically the algorithm proposed by willems et al 2012b which is a micro canonical approach with beta distributed generator model in general the process of temporal cascade involves the successive branching of rainfall to finer time resolution the procedure starts from a coarse time resolution and is repeated until a finer time scale in reached in a micro canonical approach rainfall redistribution is described by weights assigned to first and second half of the period respectively the probability distribution of weights is assumed to follow a theoretical distribution cascade generator along with the beta distribution for more information the reader is referred to willems et al 2012b in the present work the coarse time resolution was the daily rainfall from the bias corrected climate projection and the target scale was the 1 h 2 5 intensity duration frequency curves idf curves constitute a statistical method for estimating the extreme precipitation over a region in order to estimate the idf curves fig 1 part i the annual maximum series of precipitation has to be calculated for durations ranging from 1 min up to 48 h since the original temporal resolution of our measured data was 1 h and temporal resolution of the climate change simulations after temporal disaggregation was also 1 h annual maximum series were computed for 60 120 180 360 720 1440 and 2880 min annual maximum precipitation was computed according to the hydrological year the idf curves were created using a code written in the matlab computing environment using gumbel statistical distribution functions the standard procedure for idf curves was followed herein mimikou et al 2016 the following steps were followed in order to derive future idf curves incorporating total uncertainty i bias correction of climate projection for the period 2021 2100 ii temporal disaggregation of the daily rainfall to 1 h rainfall iii aggregation of hourly rainfall to seven durations 1 2 3 6 12 24 and 48 h iv acquisition of annual maximum series of rainfall for every duration v use of the gumbel distribution to calculate precipitation depths for different return periods 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years vi repetition of steps iv and v for every duration and vii repetition of steps i to vi for every bias correction method finally the percentile bootstrap method with 10 000 samples was used to construct confidence intervals 95 for future idf curves flowers cano et al 2018 rainfall distribution for rainfall duration of 1 h was undertaken employing the alternating block method kourtis et al 2020 2 6 adaptation measures in the present work twelve climate change adaptation scenarios were assessed for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed framework fig 1 part ii the measures examined were sewer enlargement grey permeable surfaces green and a combination of the above grey green all flood mitigation measures were designed so that the combined drainage network meets the greek technical specifications kourtis et al 2020 for storm sewer design presidential decree 696 74 1974 briefly the diameter of the sewers must be at least 0 4 m the filling ratio for the design storm 1 h rainfall with 10 years return period must be up to 0 8 the maximum velocity in the sewers of the drainage network must not exceed 6 m s and the minimum velocity must be greater than 0 6 m s all measures examined herein were dimensioned based on a multi objective optimization algorithm written in matlab computing environment overall twelve scenarios for climate change adaptation were developed scenarios 1 to 4 comprised sewer enlargement scenarios 5 to 8 comprised permeable surfaces construction and scenarios 9 to 12 comprised a combination of the two table 2 presents the scenarios examined along with a short description of each scenario and the total number of simulations 2 7 hydrologic hydraulic modeling sensitivity analysis and calibration all simulations were undertaken utilizing the software of the united states environmental protection agency epa swmm version 5 1 swmm is a fully dynamic rainfall runoff model widely employed for quantity rossman and huber 2016 bellos et al 2017 kourtis et al 2017a 2020 and quality simulations e g tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 either for single storm event or for continuous simulations in this study the curve number method was used and hydraulic calculations were undertaken using the dynamic wave model with a time step fixed at 0 1 s the curve number was estimated for each subcatchment based on the land uses the soil characteristics and the corresponding soil groups of the study area global sensitivity analysis of swmm hydrologic hydraulic and permeable surface input parameters was performed using the morris method fig 1 part ii the morris method or elementary effect test morris 1991 was used to screen influential model input parameters and identify possible interactions for both swmm hydrologic hydraulic and permeable surface input parameters the safe toolbox developed by pianosi et al 2015 was used for this the elementary effect test was performed for ten hydrologic hydraulic input parameters of swmm and eight parameters for the permeable surfaces table 3 presents the range of the parameter values used in sensitivity analysis a drain was not considered for the permeable surfaces the total number of model runs required for the sensitivity analysis were 5500 and 9900 for the swmm hydrologic hydraulic and permeable surfaces input parameters respectively the time of each simulation was about 10 s the sensitivity of swmm hydrologic hydraulic input parameters was assessed for the effect on peak discharge in the sewer outlet m3 s total surface runoff mm and the nash sutcliffe coefficient in one sewer sensitivity of permeable surface parameters was assessed with respect to peak discharge at the sewer outlet m3 s total surface runoff mm and total infiltration loss mm the most influential parameters were used for calibration purposes based on the maximization of the nash sutcliffe coefficient objective function swmm automation and calibration was performed using the matlab computing environment and a metaheuristic optimization algorithm goldberg 1989 kourtis et al 2017b besides the nash sutcliffe coefficient results were further assessed based on the root mean squared error rmse the coefficient of determination r2 the index of agreement d and the mean absolute error mae kourtis et al 2017b 2 8 reliability and climate variability adaptation indices a novel reliability index fig 1 part iii is proposed called index of reliability for urban drainage adaptation iruda iruda is an index assessing the overall reliability of an urban drainage system in terms of hydraulic temporal and volumetric reliability it is easy to be implemented and modified the index can be calculated with the following equation 16 iruda 1 c c 1 c 1 t i 1 nc t i 1 c c 1 c 1 t j 1 nc v j 1 tv k 1 nf f v k where c is the count for conduits t is the duration of the operation period nc is the total number of conduits of the drainage system i is the count for the number of times the filling ratio is greater than 0 8 ti is the number of times filling ratio is greater than 0 8 j is the count for the number of times velocity is greater than 6 m s or less than 0 6 m s vj is the number of times velocity is greater than 6 m s or less than 0 6 m s nf is the total number of system failures k is the counter for system failures fvk is the volume of water surcharged from the drainage system during failure mode k and tv is the total volume of storm water runoff generated by the given rainfall iruda represents i the percent of time during which the pipes of the drainage network are able to convey the produced runoff operating based on a predefined level i e filling ratio 0 8 and ii the ratio of water volume conveyed safely through the drainage system to the total runoff volume generated from precipitation the iruda index along with the construction costs of sewer enlargement and permeable surfaces were used as objective functions in the multi objective optimization employed for the dimensioning of the flood mitigation measures moreover a new index called climate variability adaptation index cvai is introduced fig 1 part iii the novelty in the proposed cvai is that it takes into account all hydrological and hydraulic aspects of a drainage network rather than only the flooded volume of the nodes of the drainage system the cvai index represents the total adaptive capacity of the drainage network and can be expressed mathematically as follows 17 cvai i 1 8 i 1 8 e i w i x i x σ x where cvai is the climate variability adaptation index i is the count for the examined variables i e flood peak at the sewer outlet fp total surface runoff sr total flooded volume tfv number of nodes flooded nn mean flooding depth fd mean conveyance

given return period is the mean results value and σx is standard deviation of the results for the given variable e indicates the effect i e positive or negative of the variable on the results evaluated and assigned values as 1 or 1 in the present work all effects were considered as positive conveyance can be mathematically described by manning equation tsakiris and bellos 2014 18 k q s 1 2 1 n a r 2 3 where k is the conveyance of the combined sewer m3 s q is the flow rate m3 s s is the slope of the hydraulic grade line n is manning coefficient for sewers s m1 3 a is flow area m2 and r is the hydraulic radius m 2 9 economic assessment all the costs associated with the flood mitigation measures examined herein were estimated based on the detailed costs previously reported by kourtis et al 2020 life cycle cost lcc for all the scenarios was calculated based on a lifespan of 30 years assuming no salvage values at the end of the projects lifetime present values of all future costs were calculated using a discount rate r of 6 based on the following equation 19 pv fv 1 r lt where pv is the present value of cost fv is the future value of cost r is the discount rate and lt is project lifetime in order to accurately estimate damages due to flooding a 2d hydrodynamic model along with depth damage curves must be employed bellos et al 2020 pistrika et al 2014 however in the present work a simplified approach was applied for damage estimation in order to calculate expected annual damage ead kourtis et al 2020 monetization of the ecosystem services kourtis and tsihrintzis

improve groundwater recharge improve air quality reduce energy demand of buildings improve amenity improve biodiversity and ecology support education purposes reduce flood risk and improve health the monetized values were then actualized based on the consumer price index and converted from pounds to euros using a rate of 1 15 1 pound 1 15 euro 25 04 2021 2 10 calculation of weights in order to assign weights to the variables a pairwise comparison matrix judgment matrix was created eq 20 values in eq 20 were assigned by the authors based on experience in similar applications kourtis et al 2020 and engineering judgment and are shown in the following comparison matrix using the scale proposed by saaty 1987 20 w v ij fp sr tfv nn fd mc total l c c annual d a m a g e fp 1 2 0 17 0 14 0 14

priority of the ith variable in the jth column of the pairwise comparison matrix eq 20 in order to verify the consistency of the weights the consistency ratio cr was calculated saaty 1987 22 cr μ n var n var 1 ri where μ is the average vector of consistency nvar is the number of variables assessed i e in this case 8 ri is a random index depending on the number of variables examined as proposed by saaty 1987 the value of the ri index is 1 41 for a pairwise comparison matrix 8 8 eq 21 the cr for the specific decision matrix was equal to 0 09 which is less than 0 1 and as a result the matrix can be considered as reasonable 2 11 forward uncertainty propagation analysis a monte carlo based forward uncertainty propagation analysis was undertaken employing a frequently used approach e g bellos et al 2017 moreno rodenas et al 2018 the most sensitive parameters i e percent imperviousness width slope manning coefficient for the impervious area for each subcatchment and manning roughness coefficient for conduits with respect to peak discharge were investigated along with the uncertainty of rainfall depth and rainfall time to peak generating 10 000 stochastic rainfall events with a duration of 1 h based on the proposed scenario for flood mitigation i e scenario 11 in total 63 parameters were investigated the values of swmm parameters 12 catchments 5 parameters plus one unified value for the manning coefficient of the conduits were drawn using a uniform distribution 20 around the calibrated value of each parameter the total rainfall depth was drawn assuming uniform distribution as well in the pre specified range from 40 to 82 mm which corresponds to the climate change lower and upper scenario for the ten year return period respectively regarding the rainfall distribution the huff methodology was used huff 1967 employing the regression equations recently proposed by lee et al 2018 in this methodology four types of rainfall exist for the monte carlo analysis random integer numbers from 1 to 4 were generated drawn by uniform distribution and each number corresponded to the huff rainfall type finally it must be noted that the sampling for the uniform distribution was performed using the latin hypercube sampling technique 3 results and discussion 3 1 bias correction the correction factor cf eq 5 used in loci and pt methods was calculated above 1 0 for the majority of the months indicating that the rcm raw data underestimated the precipitation however the correction factor was below 1 0 in some cases especially for the summer months indicating that the raw precipitation depth was overestimated during summer months the comparison of the four methods i e ls loci pt and qm is presented in fig 3 according to the results the vast majority of the statistical downscaling bias corrections methods employed herein were able to improve the results compared to the raw rcm simulations fig 3 all methods were able to remove bias from the mean of daily precipitation fig 3 top left however differences can be observed for the standard deviation coefficient of variation the 90th percentiles and the probability of wet days ls and loci are the two methods that presented greater variability nevertheless bias magnitude was lower compared to the raw rcm data probability of wet days fig 3 bottom left presents the greater discrepancy among the bias correction methods examined herein loci and qm were the only two methods able to adjust the biases regarding the probability of wet days ls and pt were able to slightly decrease variability but not able to completely remove biases all bias correction methods examined were able to remove biases and correct monthly mean monthly standard deviation coefficient of variation and 90th percentile the qm performed best followed by the pt ls and loci methods the results presented herein are in accordance with the results reported by teutschbein and seibert 2012 3 2 climate change impact on idf curves a decreasing trend in rainfall has been reported by some studies for the mediterranean region e g ipcc 2014 however many researchers report an increase in extreme rainfall events for the same area e g forestieri et al 2018b rodríguez et al 2014 fig 4 presents the comparison of the future idf curves i e non stationary idf curves with the idf curves calculated based on the observed data and the idf curve of mimikou et al 2002 the comparison with idf curves of mimikou et al 2002 was undertaken as this idf curve was widely used for designing purposes of water related infrastructure in the attica region greece the present results indicate that by the end of the century the 1 h rainfall with a return period of 10 years is projected to increase by 42 under the mean scenario while for a return period of 2 years the average increase is projected to be 29 moreover our results indicate that the increase in extreme rainfall is greater as the duration increases which is in accordance with the results reported by forestieri et al 2018a overall precipitation extremes are found to increase by the end of the century with the percent change ranging from 2 to 201 based on the duration and the return period examined the idf curves developed for major athens using observed data and the bias corrected climate change data are presented in eqs 23 27 23 idf mimikou 15 39

the climate change factors have been calculated for each return period and for the different durations considered table 4 presents the calculated change factors under the mean the upper and the lower climate change scenarios for rainfall duration of 1 h and the different return periods 3 3 sensitivity analysis and calibration fig 5 presents the sensitivity analysis results of the ten parameters with respect to peak discharge fig 5 top left total surface runoff fig 5 middle left and nash sutcliffe coefficient fig 5 bottom left the analysis indicated that the most sensitive parameters of swmm are the width w slope s percent impervious area of the subcatchment imp manning coefficients of the impervious and the pervious area of the subcatchment n imp and n perv depression storage on the impervious area of the subcatchment and the manning coefficient for sewers the results are in accordance with the results reported by other researchers ballinas gonzález et al 2020 tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 with respect to total surface runoff cn was found to be the fourth most sensitive parameter fig 5 this is in accordance with the results also reported in previous works tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 sensitivity analysis of swmm permeable surfaces input parameters was conducted in order to identify the non influential parameters parameter fixing along with the main parameters that mostly affect the output reporting sensitive and insensitive parameters is valuable both for the modeling and for the design of green infrastructure using swmm software fig 5 presents the sensitivity of the eight parameters with respect to peak discharge fig 5 top right total surface runoff fig 5 middle right and total infiltration fig 5 bottom right the analysis revealed that surface roughness sr surface slope ss and pavement permeability pp are the most influential parameters with respect to peak discharge and total runoff volume on the other hand with respect to total infiltration the most influential parameters are storage seepage rate ssr pavement permeability pp and surface roughness sr all other parameters present low values of mean and standard deviation of elementary effects and as a result they can be considered as non influential in general it can be concluded that only a few parameters of permeable surfaces modeled using swmm are influential the results reported in the present study seem to differ from those reported in previous studies e g randall et al 2020 for example randall et al 2020 used a one at a time percent change 50 for studying the sensitivity of swmm permeable pavements input parameters with respect to total surface runoff and peak discharge they concluded that the most influential parameters were cpet wilting point field capacity storage layer void ratio and underdrain offset however randall et al 2020 used a local sensitivity analysis method and a different setting for permeable pavements than the one reported herein moreover it must be stated that sensitivity of permeable pavement input parameters is a subject not fully addressed in the recent literature in comparison with other swmm low impact development modules e g green roofs the observed storm event is 170 min with total rainfall depth of 11 6 mm fig 6 presents the calibration results in two sewers of the drainage network for sewer 1 the observed hydrograph has a peak at about 0 46 m3 s at 6 10 fig 6 top it can be observed that the simulated hydrograph predicts well both the rising and falling limbs of the observed hydrograph and also the peak and time to the peak for the second sewer fig 6 bottom the peak of the observed hydrograph is about 0 48 m3 s while the time to peak is at 06 10 it can be observed that in the simulated hydrograph volume is slightly over predicted while the peak is slightly under predicted along with the time to the peak 3 4 climate change impact on urban drainage iruda can be used to assess an existing urban drainage network and for dimensioning different flood mitigation alternatives including green measures therefore it can be valuable into gaining insight on the overall reliability of the system iruda was used in the present work as the objective function along with construction cost for sizing flood mitigation measures according to its definition its final value was zero iruda was tested for different flood mitigation options i e sewer enlargement and permeable surfaces and for different synthetic storm events and as a result it was found to be very flexible for different modeling scenarios fig 7 presents the results regarding the impact of climate change on the urban drainage network of the study area for rainfall duration of 1 h for all scenarios and all return periods assessed fig 7a presents the change in the flood peak at the outlet of the drainage system it can be observed that under scenarios 1 to 4 and 9 to 12 the drainage capacity of the combined network was upgraded from 14 to 140 m3 s while under scenarios 5 to 6 the drainage capacity of the networks remained unchanged fig 7b presents the change in total surface runoff for the drainage network as it is obvious total surface runoff only changes under the scenarios where green measures are employed i e scenarios 5 to 12 moreover fig 7c and d present the change in total flooded volume and total number of flooded nodes respectively total flooded volume is significantly reduced as a result of the flood mitigation measures total flooded nodes are also reduced as a result of the flood mitigation measures the increased number of flooded nodes presented in fig 7d is because the rainfall with return period of 100 years is taken into account finally fig 7e presents the ead in euros for the baseline scenario and after the implementation of the flood mitigation measures it can be observed that ead is significantly reduced under all examined scenarios based on ead the best alternative is scenario 11 i e sewer enlargement and permeable surfaces followed by scenario 3 sewer enlargement the ranking based on ead of the flood mitigation scenarios is as follows 1 scenario 11 2 scenario 3 3 scenario 10 4 scenario 2 5 scenario 6 6 scenario 7 7 scenario 1 8 scenario 4 9 scenario 9 10 scenario 5 11 scenario 8 12 scenario 12 and 13 baseline it can be observed that green measures are ranked in relative low positions i e position 5 6 10 and 11 this is due to the fact that only the monetized ecosystem services offered by those solutions are taken into account as criteria it can be concluded that for an unbiased evaluation of different flood mitigation strategies other criteria such as flood peak reduction reduction in total surface runoff depth etc must be taken into account 3 5 scenario selection the weights of the eight variables based on the comparison matrix eq 20 were calculated as follows i flood peak 0 06 4 2 ii surface runoff 0 05 2 3 iii flooded volume 0 18 10 7 iv number of flooded nodes 0 25 9 3 v flooding depth 0 20 9 5 vi mean conveyance 0 05 2 6 vii total lcc 0 01 0 7 viii annual damage 0 20 7 8 the main direct benefits obtained from permeable surfaces and monetized in the present work table 5 were amenity biodiversity education flood risk health and reduction of the urban heat island effect amenity refers to the positive effect of green measures on the desirability and attractiveness of the area biodiversity refers to the ecological value added to the area after the construction and installation of the green measures education refers to the positive impact along with the opportunities offered for schools flood risk refers to benefits offered after the installation of green measures other than mitigating flood risk these benefits can be for example water quality issues reduced anxiety and stress etc health benefits refer to mental physical and emotional health offered by green measures finally reduction of the urban heat island effect refers to the reduction of outdoor temperature alves et al 2019 calculated ecosystem services offered by different types of green infrastructure based on the modeled area and the associated benefits they reported a 12 energy reduction for permeable surfaces and as a result a yearly benefit of 2 87 m2 the net present value of permeable pavements for a lifespan of 30 years was reported at about 441 000 ha in the present work ecosystem services valuation took place using ciria b st tool horton et al 2019 and the value of ecosystem services benefits table 5 offered by permeable surfaces implementation were calculated at 137 509 ha 164 313 ha 145 837 ha 137 509 ha 186 178 ha 186 178 ha 186 178 ha and 186 178 ha for scenarios 5 to 12 respectively the estimation of ecosystem services is based on local prices and literature values horton et al 2019 and so cost estimates for other locations must be practiced with caution cvai was used for scenario selection table 6 presents the results for the cvai index for all return periods examined and for all scenarios the results revealed that cvai can be a useful tool when planning urban flood mitigation strategies they also revealed the importance of taking into account green measures for flood mitigation in urban basins for return periods of 2 and 5 years the best scenario was scenario 6 i e permeable surfaces construction only however under the rest of the scenarios examined scenario 11 sewer enlargement and permeable surface construction was the best choice based on cvai as a result scenario 11 was chosen as the best alternative for urban drainage adaptation to climate change for the study area cvai index can be used both for measuring the adaptive capacity of a drainage network and for scenario selection the results revealed that cvai can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of different flood mitigation strategies thus helping in the decision making process overall cvai was found to be easy to implement informative and very flexible as different flood mitigations scenarios were examined along with various synthetic storm events table 6 forward uncertainty propagation analysis was undertaken in order to assess the uncertainty in model output as a result of external forcing uncertainty and parametric uncertainty fig 8 a presents the predicted hydrographs at the sewer outlet for the median the 95 90 and 75 uncertainty band for the proposed scenario for adaptation to climate change i e scenario 11 it can be observed that the uncertainty of the predicted hydrograph is significant for example the 95 uncertainty interval ranges from about 3 m3 s to 13 m3 s moreover it can be observed that rainfall time to peak affects the peak discharge at the sewer outlet fig 8a the results also suggested that the uncertainty associated with the calibrated swmm input parameters i e percent imperviousness width slope manning coefficient for the impervious area for each subcatchment and manning roughness coefficient for conduits have little effect on model output with respect to external forcing uncertainty i e rainfall besides a theoretical distribution was fitted to the maximum peaks at the outlet four different distributions i e gamma generalized extreme value weibull and nakagami were fitted fig 8 b presents the fitting of these theoretical distributions on the predicted flood peaks it can be observed that empirical data are skewed to the left fig 8b all examined distributions seem to fit the predicted values of peak flow at the sewer outlet however based on the akaike information criterion aic the investigated theoretical distributions are ranked as follows fig 8b nakagami gamma generalized extreme value weibull for the nakagami distribution the shape parameter was calculated equal to 2 36 while the scale parameter was equal to 80 77 for the gamma distribution the shape parameter was calculated equal to 8 51 while the scale parameter was equal to 1 00 for the generalized extreme value distribution the shape parameter was calculated equal to 0 1951 the scale parameter was equal to 2 65 and the location parameter was calculated equal to 7 40 finally for the weibull distribution the shape parameter was calculated equal to 3 28 while the scale parameter was equal to 9 52 overall it can be concluded that uncertainty quantification of a calibrated model is vital in order to inform decision makers and help them during the decision process 4 summary and conclusions the main aims of the present work were i to compare different bias correction methods ii to develop idf curves based on future climate projections non stanionarity and to compare them with the observed ones stationarity iii to assess the impact of climate change on urban drainage iv to provide a holistic framework for the assessment of different flood mitigation scenarios both grey and green for climate change adaptation assessment v and to provide two new indices one for optimization of green grey flood mitigation scenarios and one for the assessment of different flood mitigation scenarios the results revealed that all bias correction methods were able to remove biases from the raw climate data however the quantile mapping method performed better moreover the results illustrated that under the non stanionarity projections of climate the percent change in future rainfall intensity can range from 2 to 42 for rainfall duration of 1 h and return periods up to 10 years furthermore the percent change in future rainfall intensity increases as the return period and the duration examined increase finally it was evident from the results that it is practical and possible with current computing resources to perform systematic assessment of flood mitigation scenarios using an automated procedure applying climate change projections bias correction methods temporal downscaling multicriteria decision making and hydraulic models with high level of detail on the other hand data requirements and computational effort are significant but can be addressed by the use of high performance computing platforms it was found that the performance of climate change adaptation strategies strongly depends on the considered climate scenario moreover as the climate variability adaptation index demonstrated that the implementation of permeable pavements for flood mitigation is viable only for storm events of high probability of occurrence return periods 10 years the two indices iruda and cvai introduced in the present work can be valuable tools for supporting planning of flood risk mitigation measures and the decision making process however the methodology presented must also be tested in other areas finally the forward uncertainty propagation analysis revealed that input uncertainty especially rainfall depth and time to peak has significant impact on peak discharge at the sewer outlet overall it is essential to try to maintain flexibility of the flood mitigation scenarios by introducing in the design procedure green measures but also accept and understand the non stationarity of the climate to this end it is proposed to revise design standards and also to try to incorporate in the design procedure total uncertainty i e uncertainty stemming from climate change projections statistical downscaling hydrologic hydraulic modeling rainfall uncertainty etc credit

4148,a novel methodological framework for urban drainage adaptation to climate change is introduced and tested in a small urban basin the impact of climate change on intensity duration frequency curves and on urban drainage is reported the flood mitigation measures comprised both green and grey alternatives i e permeable surfaces and sewer enlargement the storm water management model swmm5 was calibrated and employed prior to calibration sensitivity analysis of swmm hydrologic hydraulic and permeable surfaces input parameters was conducted using a global sensitivity analysis method two novel indices the index for reliability of urban drainage adaptation iruda and the climate variability adaptation index cvai were also introduced iruda assesses the total reliability of an urban drainage network in hydraulic temporal and volumetric terms sizing of flood mitigation measures was undertaken employing construction cost along with iruda cvai was used for alternative selection among different flood mitigation scenarios cvai assesses the total adaptive capacity of the drainage network based on hydrological hydraulic and economic aspects of the proposed adaptation plan a forward uncertainty propagation scheme was employed on the selected alternative in order to examine input data and parametric uncertainty with respect to the peak discharge at the outlet of the basin finally monetization of ecosystem services offered by green measures is presented the simulation results for the study area illustrated that under the non stationarity assumption future rainfall intensities and urban flooding risk will increase and therefore further flood mitigation measures will be required furthermore the majority of the adaptation strategies examined were found to improve the capacity and reliability of the drainage network moreover the results revealed that permeable pavements perform better for storm events with return period of up to five years overall it can be

of rainfall extremes due to climate change projections is expected to influence urban pluvial and flash flooding phenomena bayazit 2015 chandrakar et al 2017 chattopadhyay et al 2017 dahal et al 2016 dubey and sharma 2018 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 ouhamdouch and bahir 2017 moreover land use land cover changes projected population growth and urban sprawl are expected to augment the pressure on the natural environment and on infrastructure especially in urban areas bayazit 2015 rani and sreekesh 2019 shrestha et al 2014 singh et al 2020 all the aforementioned factors pose risk of increased flooding to the urban community as urban drainage networks may need to operate with a different failure probability than the one they were originally designed for however this fact poses a unique opportunity to shift the design procedure towards a more sustainable approach by incorporating green flood mitigation measures e g green roofs permeable surfaces in the design kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 impacts of climate change on precipitation extremes and urban drainage networks are based on the projections of climate models however spatial and temporal resolution and biases of general circulation models gcms and regional climate models rcms make them unreliable for studying climate change impacts on urban flooding willems et al 2012a willems et al 2012b different approaches and frameworks have been presented in the literature for modeling the impacts of climate change on short duration extremes e g nguyen et al 2007 nikolic and simonovic 2015 schardong et al 2020 the main questions regarding urban drainage adaptation to climate change the research community is trying to answer are i whether to use rainfall projections from gcm gcm rcm ensembles or to use the new generation of climate models i e the convection permitting models cpm for studying the impacts of climate change on rainfall extremes ii which methods of spatial downscaling and bias correction are more appropriate for urban drainage impact studies iii how to remove stationarity i e use a moving reference period which hinders both climate models and statistical downscaling techniques kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 in some regions of the world sub daily extreme rainfall is intensifying more rapidly than daily extreme precipitation barbero et al 2019 with possible consequences including the increased occurrence of pluvial and flash floods forestieri et al 2018a forestieri et al 2018b pumo et al 2017 though this pattern is not observed everywhere barbero et al 2019 raw data from climate model simulations tend to overestimate design rainfalls however bias correction and temporal disaggregation must be practiced with caution kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 for example rodríguez et al 2014 studied the effects of climate change on extreme precipitation for the city of barcelona spain concluding that the calculated change factors using temporally disaggregated rainfall i e 1 h are higher than the ones obtained by using the daily rainfall furthermore the results demonstrated an increase i e at least 4 in daily rainfall with return periods greater than 20 years however they argued that the results tend to be sensitive to the climate model and the observational data used rodríguez et al 2014 impact of climate change on rainfall extremes has been found to differ based on the return period and the duration examined ganguli and coulibaly 2017 updated the intensity duration frequency idf curves for southern ontario canada they concluded that future idf curves are projected to increase by about 7 for return periods of up to ten years however for less frequent rainfalls the projected increase of the idf curves ranged from 2 to 44 based on the return period and the duration studied ganguli and coulibaly 2017 impact of climate change on future rainfall intensities has been found to decrease increase based on the study area the climate model used and the future horizon forestieri et al 2018a shrestha et al 2017 vu et al 2017 for example shrestha et al 2017 studied the effects of climate change in the city of bangkok thailand and concluded that the percent change in future rainfall intensity ranges between 18 and 50 based on the return period the duration the climate model and the scenario examined vu et al 2017 reported an increase of future one hour rainfall intensity in hanoi vietnam ranging between 34 and 48 for the return periods studied forestieri et al 2018a studied the impacts of climate change on the idf curves for palermo and catania in sicily italy their results suggested an increase in the future rainfall depth compared to the observations ranging from about 17 to 86 in addition they reported that variability of future idf curves increases as the horizon and return period examined increases chandra et al 2015 argued that parametric uncertainty is larger than climate model uncertainty and that the uncertainty associated with long durations is smaller than the uncertainty associated with short durations overall it can be concluded that there is still great uncertainty associated with the modeling and the effects of climate change on short rainfall extremes especially for urban areas kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 the research community has also been focusing on the impacts of urbanization urban sprawl climate change and land use land cover changes on urban drainage networks and have concluded that drainage systems will need to be redesigned in the future huong and pathirana 2013 semadeni davies et al 2008a 2008b zhou et al 2012 the majority of studies undertaken to date are qualitative in nature nonetheless a small number of studies have conducted detailed analysis of city scale impacts across sectors notably london new york and boston kirshen et al 2008 gangrade et al 2019 argued that the probable maximum flood will increase under projections of climate change for the etowah basin in georgia usa panos et al 2021 assessed the adaptive capacity of the drainage network on a small urban basin in colorado usa they concluded that the urban drainage network may be able to cope with the separate effects of land use land cover changes or climate change egger and maurer 2015 argued that uncertainty of multi model climate ensembles mainly stems from sampling uncertainty rather than uncertainty of climate model projections dong et al 2017 applied the storm water management model swmm in an urban area in kumming china in assessing and comparing resilience and cost of green and grey measures however environmental cost was not included in the assessment löwe et al 2017 proposed a novel model for investigating pluvial flood risk under the effects of urban sprawl and climate change using an 1d 2d hydrodynamic model le et al 2021 investigated flood hazard in the city of ha tinh vietnam they argued that extreme rainfall events will increase in the future ranging from 5 to 20 and as a result flood extent or severity will also increase ranging from 20 to 40 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 reviewed relevant aspects of urban drainage adaptation to climate change concluding that grey structural measures and green flood mitigation measures are the main flood mitigation measures examined in the scientific literature green flood mitigation measures are widely applied and studied by scientists around the world e g kourtis et al 2020 2018 leimgruber et al 2018 recent studies are focusing among others on modeling green measures palla and gnecco 2015 the effect of green measures on urban flooding and combined sewer overflows joshi et al 2021 kourtis et al 2018 qin et al 2013 the cost effectiveness of green measures chui et al 2016 and on the uncertainty in the model input parameters and how it affects the output leimgruber et al 2018 kourtis and tsihrintzis 2021 argued that uncertainties associated with hydrologic hydraulic modeling and flood mitigation alternatives along with the monetization of the ecosystem services provided by green solutions are subjects that need to be further studied in the present work a novel decision support framework for climate change adaptation of urban drainage networks is introduced which incorporates three components and is fully described in section 2 in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework regarding the holistic assessment of grey green flood mitigation measures the framework is applied in a small urbanized basin five widely used bias correction methods are compared for their efficiency to remove biases from rcm simulations a methodology for upgrading idf curves in urban areas incorporating uncertainty is demonstrated and employed to analyze the effect of non stationary climate projections at hourly scale swmm is used for hydrologic hydraulic calculation while ciria benefits evaluation of suds tool b st horton et al 2019 is used for monetization of the benefits ecosystem services offered by green measures the impact of climate change projections on urban drainage is thus evaluated besides two new indices for multi objective optimization index of reliability for urban drainage adaptation iruda and assessment of different flood mitigation scenarios climate variability adaptation index cvai are proposed the total adaptive capacity of a drainage network in hydraulic temporal and volumetric terms can be assessed through the iruda index however in the present work iruda and construction cost are used for dimensioning of the proposed flood mitigation alternatives cvai assesses the total adaptive capacity of a drainage network and is used for selecting the best alternative for urban drainage adaptation to climate change the aim of this paper is to introduce a novel framework for systematic analysis of urban drainage adaptation strategies considering climate variability to assess the main impacts of climate change on short rainfall extremes idf curves and urban drainage networks to introduce an index for assessing overall reliability of an urban drainage system in terms of hydraulic temporal and volumetric reliability to introduce an index for assessing total adaptive capacity of an urban drainage network to incorporate in the design procedure benefits offered by ecosystem services in economic terms to assess total uncertainty and to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework section 2 describes the data and presents the methodology applied in section 3 the results of the analysis are presented and discussed followed by summary and concluding remarks in section 4 2 materials and methods fig 1 presents the methodological framework used in the present work the proposed framework is composed of three parts i observed data acquisition ensemble projections of climate change bias correction temporal disaggregation and development of stationary and non stationary idf curves ii hydrologic hydraulic modeling sensitivity analysis calibration and flood mitigation scenarios development and iii selection of best alternative for climate change adaptation of urban drainage and forward uncertainty propagation analysis 2 1 study area the proposed framework for urban drainage adaptation to climate change is applied in a small urban basin in athens greece fig 2 fig 2 presents the subcatchments the nodes the combined sewers the flow gauges two the rain gauge measurement station and the land uses of the study area according to copernicus european urban atlas 2018 the basin has a drainage area of approximately 66 5 ha and is highly urbanized except for its northern part the population density of the basin is approximately 17 042 inhabitants km2 the combined drainage network consists of 46 nodes and 45 sewers sewers are either circular or egg shaped the diameter of all circular sewers is 0 4 m while the height of egg shaped sewers ranges from 0 9 m to 1 65 m with the width ranging from 0 6 m to 1 1 m the cross section area of the sewers ranges from 0 13 to 1 39 m2 the total length of the combined drainage network is approximately 2189 m 2 2 observed and future climate data local observed hourly rainfall data from the meteorological station of the national observatory of athens noa located at thissio area near the historical center of athens incorporating a digital rain gauge with resolution of 0 2 mm tip were considered for the control period 1991 2019 baseline future climate data were downloaded from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex research program http www euro cordex net 060378 index php en provided by the dear clima data extraction application for regional climate platform spatial resolution of the data is 0 11 degrees and covers the period 1950 to 2005 historical period control period and 2006 to 2100 future period under two representative concentration pathways rcps table 1 presents the climate change projections used in the present work more specifically the gcm rcm rcp the spatial and temporal resolutions of the final product and the time period are shown 2 3 bias correction in total five bias correction methods were used and compared with each other and with the raw data bias correction was undertaken by utilizing the observed hourly rainfall data from noa s station at thissio the five methods used were fig 1 part i i delta change dc approach ii linear scaling ls method iii local intensity scaling loci iv power transformation pt and v quantile mapping qm in order to assess the performance of the five bias corrections methods the rcm bias corrected time series were compared based on the following six statistical measures a mean μ b standard deviation σ c coefficient of variation cοv σ μ d 90th percentile x90 e probability of wet days pwet and f mean absolute error mae these measures are the same as those used by teutschbein and seibert 2012 to compare the same five bias correction methods it must be stated that the assessment was undertaken only for the calibration period i e 1999 2019 21 years of observed hourly precipitation the dc method was not assessed as by definition the control run period 1991 2019 is the same as the observation period 2 3 1 delta change dc the dc method is based on the idea to use rcm anomalies for perturbating observed data teutschbein and seibert 2012 the main advantages of the dc method are i the method is relatively easy to apply and ii the preservation of the observed pattern of temporal and spatial variability on the other hand the main disadvantages of the dc method are i possible changes in the distribution of the variables of interest are ignored and ii possible changes in the dry and wet spells are not accounted for regarding climate change scenarios the anomalies of the rcm simulations between the base line scenario and the future scenarios are superimposed upon the observational series on a monthly basis based on the following equations teutschbein and seibert 2012 1 p cont d p obs d p scen d p obs d μ m p scen d μ m p cont d where p cont is bias corrected precipitation data for the base line period p scen is the final bias corrected precipitation data mm pobs d is the daily precipitation data mm pscen d is the raw gcm rcm precipitation data mm and μm pscen d and μm pcont d are the monthly mean location parameter of gaussian distribution of the raw gcm rcm and observed precipitation data 2 3 2 linear scaling ls the ls of precipitation is based on the differences between the present raw gcm rcm data and the observed data in this particular method bias corrected gcm rcm data will perfectly agree with the monthly mean values of the observed data according to teutschbein and seibert 2012 the correction factor of precipitation is based on the ratio of long term monthly mean observed and base line future data 2 p cont d p cont d μ m p obs d μ m p cont d p scen d p s c e n d μ m p obs d μ m p cont d where p cont is bias corrected

distribution of the raw gcm rcm and observed precipitation data respectively 2 3 3 local intensity scaling loci the local intensity scaling loci is a method able to adjust both frequency and precipitation depth for wet days initially a precipitation threshold pth contr is calibrated and applied in order to correct the number of wet days in both control and scenario run the threshold is calculated so that the number of rainy days of the raw rcm data matches the number of rainy days of the observed data eqs 3 and 4 then a correction factor is calculated based on the long term monthly mean using eq 5 finally rcm raw precipitation data are corrected using eq 7 3 p cont 1 d 0 i f p contr d p th c o n t r p cont d o t h e r w i s e 4 p scen 1 d 0 i f p scen d p th c o n t r p scen d o

statistics teutschbein and seibert 2012 first parameter b is calibrated on a monthly basis using a three month window calibration takes place by matching the coefficient of variation cov of the observed data with the cov of the rcm data for each month in order to calculate b a root finding method and more specifically the bisect method is used 8 f b m 0 c o v m p obs d c o v m p cont b m d σ

precipitation data for the control period and p scen 1 d is the intermediary precipitation gcm rcm simulated data then the correction factor eq 5 is calculated based on the long term monthly mean of the observed and the intermediary data and applied 11 p cont p cont 1 d c f 12 p scen p scen 1 d c f where p cont is bias corrected precipitation data mm for the base line period and p scen is bias corrected precipitation gcm rcm simulated data mm 2 3 5 quantile mapping qm the final bias correction method used in the present work was the quantile mapping qm approach the gcm rcm simulations are corrected so that their distribution function f agrees with the distribution function of the observations teutschbein and seibert 2012 a statistical relationship is developed between the observed and the simulated values this is accomplished as the simulated values are replaced by the observed ones at the same cumulative density function the gamma distribution can be used for analysis of precipitation data teutschbein and seibert 2012 the probability density function pdf of the gamma distribution with shape parameter α and scale parameter β is given by 13 f x α β β a x a 1 e β x γ a f o r x 0 a β 0 where γ is the gamma function the qm method is based on fitting daily precipitation data for each month on gamma distribution the mathematical expression of the qm bias correction

parameter 2 4 temporal downscaling in order to acquire future idf curves the future bias corrected daily rainfall projections need to be disaggregated into a finer scale using the fine scale e g hourly observed data fig 1 part i a wide variety of methods both stochastic e g molnar and burlando 2005 and deterministic e g ormsbee 1989 have been proposed in the literature for temporal disaggregation of rainfall the most widely used approach for temporal disaggregation of rainfall are cascade models chandrakar et al 2017 in the present work we employed a cascade model based on invariance theory and more specifically the algorithm proposed by willems et al 2012b which is a micro canonical approach with beta distributed generator model in general the process of temporal cascade involves the successive branching of rainfall to finer time resolution the procedure starts from a coarse time resolution and is repeated until a finer time scale in reached in a micro canonical approach rainfall redistribution is described by weights assigned to first and second half of the period respectively the probability distribution of weights is assumed to follow a theoretical distribution cascade generator along with the beta distribution for more information the reader is referred to willems et al 2012b in the present work the coarse time resolution was the daily rainfall from the bias corrected climate projection and the target scale was the 1 h 2 5 intensity duration frequency curves idf curves constitute a statistical method for estimating the extreme precipitation over a region in order to estimate the idf curves fig 1 part i the annual maximum series of precipitation has to be calculated for durations ranging from 1 min up to 48 h since the original temporal resolution of our measured data was 1 h and temporal resolution of the climate change simulations after temporal disaggregation was also 1 h annual maximum series were computed for 60 120 180 360 720 1440 and 2880 min annual maximum precipitation was computed according to the hydrological year the idf curves were created using a code written in the matlab computing environment using gumbel statistical distribution functions the standard procedure for idf curves was followed herein mimikou et al 2016 the following steps were followed in order to derive future idf curves incorporating total uncertainty i bias correction of climate projection for the period 2021 2100 ii temporal disaggregation of the daily rainfall to 1 h rainfall iii aggregation of hourly rainfall to seven durations 1 2 3 6 12 24 and 48 h iv acquisition of annual maximum series of rainfall for every duration v use of the gumbel distribution to calculate precipitation depths for different return periods 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years vi repetition of steps iv and v for every duration and vii repetition of steps i to vi for every bias correction method finally the percentile bootstrap method with 10 000 samples was used to construct confidence intervals 95 for future idf curves flowers cano et al 2018 rainfall distribution for rainfall duration of 1 h was undertaken employing the alternating block method kourtis et al 2020 2 6 adaptation measures in the present work twelve climate change adaptation scenarios were assessed for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed framework fig 1 part ii the measures examined were sewer enlargement grey permeable surfaces green and a combination of the above grey green all flood mitigation measures were designed so that the combined drainage network meets the greek technical specifications kourtis et al 2020 for storm sewer design presidential decree 696 74 1974 briefly the diameter of the sewers must be at least 0 4 m the filling ratio for the design storm 1 h rainfall with 10 years return period must be up to 0 8 the maximum velocity in the sewers of the drainage network must not exceed 6 m s and the minimum velocity must be greater than 0 6 m s all measures examined herein were dimensioned based on a multi objective optimization algorithm written in matlab computing environment overall twelve scenarios for climate change adaptation were developed scenarios 1 to 4 comprised sewer enlargement scenarios 5 to 8 comprised permeable surfaces construction and scenarios 9 to 12 comprised a combination of the two table 2 presents the scenarios examined along with a short description of each scenario and the total number of simulations 2 7 hydrologic hydraulic modeling sensitivity analysis and calibration all simulations were undertaken utilizing the software of the united states environmental protection agency epa swmm version 5 1 swmm is a fully dynamic rainfall runoff model widely employed for quantity rossman and huber 2016 bellos et al 2017 kourtis et al 2017a 2020 and quality simulations e g tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 either for single storm event or for continuous simulations in this study the curve number method was used and hydraulic calculations were undertaken using the dynamic wave model with a time step fixed at 0 1 s the curve number was estimated for each subcatchment based on the land uses the soil characteristics and the corresponding soil groups of the study area global sensitivity analysis of swmm hydrologic hydraulic and permeable surface input parameters was performed using the morris method fig 1 part ii the morris method or elementary effect test morris 1991 was used to screen influential model input parameters and identify possible interactions for both swmm hydrologic hydraulic and permeable surface input parameters the safe toolbox developed by pianosi et al 2015 was used for this the elementary effect test was performed for ten hydrologic hydraulic input parameters of swmm and eight parameters for the permeable surfaces table 3 presents the range of the parameter values used in sensitivity analysis a drain was not considered for the permeable surfaces the total number of model runs required for the sensitivity analysis were 5500 and 9900 for the swmm hydrologic hydraulic and permeable surfaces input parameters respectively the time of each simulation was about 10 s the sensitivity of swmm hydrologic hydraulic input parameters was assessed for the effect on peak discharge in the sewer outlet m3 s total surface runoff mm and the nash sutcliffe coefficient in one sewer sensitivity of permeable surface parameters was assessed with respect to peak discharge at the sewer outlet m3 s total surface runoff mm and total infiltration loss mm the most influential parameters were used for calibration purposes based on the maximization of the nash sutcliffe coefficient objective function swmm automation and calibration was performed using the matlab computing environment and a metaheuristic optimization algorithm goldberg 1989 kourtis et al 2017b besides the nash sutcliffe coefficient results were further assessed based on the root mean squared error rmse the coefficient of determination r2 the index of agreement d and the mean absolute error mae kourtis et al 2017b 2 8 reliability and climate variability adaptation indices a novel reliability index fig 1 part iii is proposed called index of reliability for urban drainage adaptation iruda iruda is an index assessing the overall reliability of an urban drainage system in terms of hydraulic temporal and volumetric reliability it is easy to be implemented and modified the index can be calculated with the following equation 16 iruda 1 c c 1 c 1 t i 1 nc t i 1 c c 1 c 1 t j 1 nc v j 1 tv k 1 nf f v k where c is the count for conduits t is the duration of the operation period nc is the total number of conduits of the drainage system i is the count for the number of

the number of times velocity is greater than 6 m s or less than 0 6 m s nf is the total number of system failures k is the counter for system failures fvk is the volume of water surcharged from the drainage system during failure mode k and tv is the total volume of storm water runoff generated by the given rainfall iruda represents i the percent of time during which the pipes of the drainage network are able to convey the produced runoff operating based on a predefined level i e filling ratio 0 8 and ii the ratio of water volume conveyed safely through the drainage system to the total runoff volume generated from precipitation the iruda index along with the construction costs of sewer enlargement and permeable surfaces were used as objective functions in the multi objective optimization employed for the dimensioning of the flood mitigation measures moreover a new index called climate variability adaptation index cvai is introduced fig 1 part iii the novelty in the proposed cvai is that it takes into account all hydrological and hydraulic aspects of a drainage network rather than only the flooded volume of the nodes of the drainage system the cvai index represents the total adaptive capacity of the drainage network and can be expressed mathematically as follows 17 cvai i 1 8 i 1 8 e i w i x i x σ x where cvai is the climate variability adaptation index i is the count for the examined variables i e flood peak at the sewer outlet fp total surface runoff sr total flooded volume tfv number of nodes flooded nn mean flooding depth fd mean conveyance

evaluated and assigned values as 1 or 1 in the present work all effects were considered as positive conveyance can be mathematically described by manning equation tsakiris and bellos 2014 18 k q s 1 2 1 n a r 2 3 where k is the conveyance of the combined sewer m3 s q is the flow rate m3 s s is the slope of the hydraulic grade line n is manning coefficient for sewers s m1 3 a is flow area m2 and r is the hydraulic radius m 2 9 economic assessment all the costs associated with the flood mitigation measures examined herein were estimated based on the detailed costs previously reported by kourtis et al 2020 life cycle cost lcc for all the scenarios was calculated based on a lifespan of 30 years assuming no salvage values at the end of the projects lifetime present values of all future costs were calculated using a discount rate r of 6 based on the following equation 19 pv fv 1 r lt where pv is the present value of cost fv is the future value of cost r is the discount rate and lt is project lifetime in order to accurately estimate damages due to flooding a 2d hydrodynamic model along with depth damage curves must be employed bellos et al 2020 pistrika et al 2014 however in the present work a simplified approach was applied for damage estimation in order to calculate expected annual damage ead kourtis et al 2020 monetization of the ecosystem services kourtis and tsihrintzis 2017 offered from green measure implementation was made using ciria benefits evaluation of suds tool b st horton et al 2019 permeable surfaces in an urban basin can alves et al 2019 horton et al 2019 improve groundwater recharge improve air quality reduce energy demand of buildings improve amenity improve biodiversity and ecology support education purposes reduce flood risk and improve health the monetized values were then actualized based on the consumer price index and converted from pounds to euros using a rate of 1 15 1 pound 1 15 euro 25 04 2021 2 10 calculation of weights in order to assign weights to the variables a pairwise comparison matrix judgment matrix was created eq 20 values in eq 20 were assigned by the authors based on experience in similar applications kourtis et al 2020 and engineering judgment and are shown in the following comparison matrix using the scale proposed by saaty 1987 20 w v ij fp sr tfv nn fd mc total l c c annual d a m a g e fp 1 2 0 17 0 14 0 14

priority of the ith variable in the jth column of the pairwise comparison matrix eq 20 in order to verify the consistency of the weights the consistency ratio cr was calculated saaty 1987 22 cr μ n var n var 1 ri where μ is the average vector of consistency nvar is the number of variables assessed i e in this case 8 ri is a random index depending on the number of variables examined as proposed by saaty 1987 the value of the ri index is 1 41 for a pairwise comparison matrix 8 8 eq 21 the cr for the specific decision matrix was equal to 0 09 which is less than 0 1 and as a result the matrix can be considered as reasonable 2 11 forward uncertainty propagation analysis a monte carlo based forward uncertainty propagation analysis was undertaken employing a frequently used approach e g bellos et al 2017 moreno rodenas et al 2018 the most sensitive parameters i e percent imperviousness width slope manning coefficient for the impervious area for each subcatchment and manning roughness coefficient for conduits with respect to peak discharge were investigated along with the uncertainty of rainfall depth and rainfall time to peak generating 10 000 stochastic rainfall events with a duration of 1 h based on the proposed scenario for flood mitigation i e scenario 11 in total 63 parameters were investigated the values of swmm parameters 12 catchments 5 parameters plus one unified value for the manning coefficient of the conduits were drawn using a uniform distribution 20 around the calibrated value of each parameter the total rainfall depth was drawn assuming uniform distribution as well in the pre specified range from 40 to 82 mm which corresponds to the climate change lower and upper scenario for the ten year return period respectively regarding the rainfall distribution the huff methodology was used huff 1967 employing the regression equations recently proposed by lee et al 2018 in this methodology four types of rainfall exist for the monte carlo analysis random integer numbers from 1 to 4 were generated drawn by uniform distribution and each number corresponded to the huff rainfall type finally it must be noted that the sampling for the uniform distribution was performed using the latin hypercube sampling technique 3 results and discussion 3 1 bias correction the correction factor cf eq 5 used in loci and pt methods was calculated above 1 0 for the majority of the months indicating that the rcm raw data underestimated the precipitation however the correction factor was below 1 0 in some cases especially for the summer months indicating that the raw precipitation depth was overestimated during summer months the comparison of the four methods i e ls loci pt and qm is presented in fig 3 according to the results the vast majority of the statistical downscaling bias corrections methods employed herein were able to improve the results compared to the raw rcm simulations fig 3 all methods were able to remove bias from the mean of daily precipitation fig 3 top left however differences can be observed for the standard deviation coefficient of variation the 90th percentiles and the probability of wet days ls and loci are the two methods that presented greater variability nevertheless bias magnitude was lower compared to the raw rcm data probability of wet days fig 3 bottom left presents the greater discrepancy among the bias correction methods examined herein loci and qm were the only two methods able to adjust the biases regarding the probability of wet days ls and pt were able to slightly decrease variability but not able to completely remove biases all bias correction methods examined were able to remove biases and correct monthly mean monthly standard deviation coefficient of variation and 90th percentile the qm performed best followed by the pt ls and loci methods the results presented herein are in accordance with the results reported by teutschbein and seibert 2012 3 2 climate change impact on idf curves a decreasing trend in rainfall has been reported by some studies for the mediterranean region e g ipcc 2014 however many researchers report an increase in extreme rainfall events for the same area e g forestieri et al 2018b rodríguez et al 2014 fig 4 presents the comparison of the future idf curves i e non stationary idf curves with the idf curves calculated based on the observed data and the idf curve of mimikou et al 2002 the comparison with idf curves of mimikou et al 2002 was undertaken as this idf curve was widely used for designing purposes of water related infrastructure in the attica region greece the present results indicate that by the end of the century the 1 h rainfall with a return period of 10 years is projected to increase by 42 under the mean scenario while for a return period of 2 years the average increase is projected to be 29 moreover our results indicate that the increase in extreme rainfall is greater as the duration increases which is in accordance with the results reported by forestieri et al 2018a overall precipitation extremes are found to increase by the end of the century with the percent change ranging from 2 to 201 based on the duration and the return period examined the idf curves developed for major athens using observed data and the bias corrected climate change data are presented in eqs 23 27 23 idf mimikou 15 39

return period years and t is the duration of the rainfall h from the bias corrected and temporally disaggregated simulated rainfall series future climate and those corresponding to the observed data the climate change factors have been calculated for each return period and for the different durations considered table 4 presents the calculated change factors under the mean the upper and the lower climate change scenarios for rainfall duration of 1 h and the different return periods 3 3 sensitivity analysis and calibration fig 5 presents the sensitivity analysis results of the ten parameters with respect to peak discharge fig 5 top left total surface runoff fig 5 middle left and nash sutcliffe coefficient fig 5 bottom left the analysis indicated that the most sensitive parameters of swmm are the width w slope s percent impervious area of the subcatchment imp manning coefficients of the impervious and the pervious area of the subcatchment n imp and n perv depression storage on the impervious area of the subcatchment and the manning coefficient for sewers the results are in accordance with the results reported by other researchers ballinas gonzález et al 2020 tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 with respect to total surface runoff cn was found to be the fourth most sensitive parameter fig 5 this is in accordance with the results also reported in previous works tsihrintzis and hamid 1998 sensitivity analysis of swmm permeable surfaces input parameters was conducted in order to identify the non influential parameters parameter fixing along with the main parameters that mostly affect the output reporting sensitive and insensitive parameters is valuable both for the modeling and for the design of green infrastructure using swmm software fig 5 presents the sensitivity of the eight parameters with respect to peak discharge fig 5 top right total surface runoff fig 5 middle right and total infiltration fig 5 bottom right the analysis revealed that surface roughness sr surface slope ss and pavement permeability pp are the most influential parameters with respect to peak discharge and total runoff volume on the other hand with respect to total infiltration the most influential parameters are storage seepage rate ssr pavement permeability pp and surface roughness sr all other parameters present low values of mean and standard deviation of elementary effects and as a result they can be considered as non influential in general it can be concluded that only a few parameters of permeable surfaces modeled using swmm are influential the results reported in the present study seem to differ from those reported in previous studies e g randall et al 2020 for example randall et al 2020 used a one at a time percent change 50 for studying the sensitivity of swmm permeable pavements input parameters with respect to total surface runoff and peak discharge they concluded that the most influential parameters were cpet wilting point field capacity storage layer void ratio and underdrain offset however randall et al 2020 used a local sensitivity analysis method and a different setting for permeable pavements than the one reported herein moreover it must be stated that sensitivity of permeable pavement input parameters is a subject not fully addressed in the recent literature in comparison with other swmm low impact development modules e g green roofs the observed storm event is 170 min with total rainfall depth of 11 6 mm fig 6 presents the calibration results in two sewers of the drainage network for sewer 1 the observed hydrograph has a peak at about 0 46 m3 s at 6 10 fig 6 top it can be observed that the simulated hydrograph predicts well both the rising and falling limbs of the observed hydrograph and also the peak and time to the peak for the second sewer fig 6 bottom the peak of the observed hydrograph is about 0 48 m3 s while the time to peak is at 06 10 it can be observed that in the simulated hydrograph volume is slightly over predicted while the peak is slightly under predicted along with the time to the peak 3 4 climate change impact on urban drainage iruda can be used to assess an existing urban drainage network and for dimensioning different flood mitigation alternatives including green measures therefore it can be valuable into gaining insight on the overall reliability of the system iruda was used in the present work as the objective function along with construction cost for sizing flood mitigation measures according to its definition its final value was zero iruda was tested for different flood mitigation options i e sewer enlargement and permeable surfaces and for different synthetic storm events and as a result it was found to be very flexible for different modeling scenarios fig 7 presents the results regarding the impact of climate change on the urban drainage network of the study area for rainfall duration of 1 h for all scenarios and all return periods assessed fig 7a presents the change in the flood peak at the outlet of the drainage system it can be observed that under scenarios 1 to 4 and 9 to 12 the drainage capacity of the combined network was upgraded from 14 to 140 m3 s while under scenarios 5 to 6 the drainage capacity of the networks remained unchanged fig 7b presents the change in total surface runoff for the drainage network as it is obvious total surface runoff only changes under the scenarios where green measures are employed i e scenarios 5 to 12 moreover fig 7c and d present the change in total flooded volume and total number of flooded nodes respectively total flooded volume is significantly reduced as a result of the flood mitigation measures total flooded nodes are also reduced as a result of the flood mitigation measures the increased number of flooded nodes presented in fig 7d is because the rainfall with return period of 100 years is taken into account finally fig 7e presents the ead in euros for the baseline scenario and after the implementation of the flood mitigation measures it can be observed that ead is significantly reduced under all examined scenarios based on ead the best alternative is scenario 11 i e sewer enlargement and permeable surfaces followed by scenario 3 sewer enlargement the ranking based on ead of the flood mitigation scenarios is as follows 1 scenario 11 2 scenario 3 3 scenario 10 4 scenario 2 5 scenario 6 6 scenario 7 7 scenario 1 8 scenario 4 9 scenario 9 10 scenario 5 11 scenario 8 12 scenario 12 and 13 baseline it can be observed that green measures are ranked in relative low positions i e position 5 6 10 and 11 this is due to the fact that only the monetized ecosystem services offered by those solutions are taken into account as criteria it can be concluded that for an unbiased evaluation of different flood mitigation strategies other criteria such as flood peak reduction reduction in total surface runoff depth etc must be taken into account 3 5 scenario selection the weights of the eight variables based on the comparison matrix eq 20 were calculated as follows i flood peak 0 06 4 2 ii surface runoff 0 05 2 3 iii flooded volume 0 18 10 7 iv number of flooded nodes 0 25 9 3 v flooding depth 0 20 9 5 vi mean conveyance 0 05 2 6 vii total lcc 0 01 0 7 viii annual damage 0 20 7 8 the main direct benefits obtained from permeable surfaces and monetized in the present work table 5 were amenity biodiversity education flood risk health and reduction of the urban heat island effect amenity refers to the positive effect of green measures on the desirability and attractiveness of the area biodiversity refers to the ecological value added to the area after the construction and installation of the green measures education refers to the positive impact along with the opportunities offered for schools flood risk refers to benefits offered after the installation of green measures other than mitigating flood risk these benefits can be for example water quality issues reduced anxiety and stress etc health benefits refer to mental physical and emotional health offered by green measures finally reduction of the urban heat island effect refers to the reduction of outdoor temperature alves et al 2019 calculated ecosystem services offered by different types of green infrastructure based on the modeled area and the associated benefits they reported a 12 energy reduction for permeable surfaces and as a result a yearly benefit of 2 87 m2 the net present value of permeable pavements for a lifespan of 30 years was reported at about 441 000 ha in the present work ecosystem services valuation took place using ciria b st tool horton et al 2019 and the value of ecosystem services benefits table 5 offered by permeable surfaces implementation were calculated at 137 509 ha 164 313 ha 145 837 ha 137 509 ha 186 178 ha 186 178 ha 186 178 ha and 186 178 ha for scenarios 5 to 12 respectively the estimation of ecosystem services is based on local prices and literature values horton et al 2019 and so cost estimates for other locations must be practiced with caution cvai was used for scenario selection table 6 presents the results for the cvai index for all return periods examined and for all scenarios the results revealed that cvai can be a useful tool when planning urban flood mitigation strategies they also revealed the importance of taking into account green measures for flood mitigation in urban basins for return periods of 2 and 5 years the best scenario was scenario 6 i e permeable surfaces construction only however under the rest of the scenarios examined scenario 11 sewer enlargement and permeable surface construction was the best choice based on cvai as a result scenario 11 was chosen as the best alternative for urban drainage adaptation to climate change for the study area cvai index can be used both for measuring the adaptive capacity of a drainage network and for scenario selection the results revealed that cvai can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of different flood mitigation strategies thus helping in the decision making process overall cvai was found to be easy to implement informative and very flexible as different flood mitigations scenarios were examined along with various synthetic storm events table 6 forward uncertainty propagation analysis was undertaken in order to assess the uncertainty in model output as a result of external forcing uncertainty and parametric uncertainty fig 8 a presents the predicted hydrographs at the sewer outlet for the median the 95 90 and 75 uncertainty band for the proposed scenario for adaptation to climate change i e scenario 11 it can be observed that the uncertainty of the predicted hydrograph is significant for example the 95 uncertainty interval ranges from about 3 m3 s to 13 m3 s moreover it can be observed that rainfall time to peak affects the peak discharge at the sewer outlet fig 8a the results also suggested that the uncertainty associated with the calibrated swmm input parameters i e percent imperviousness width slope manning coefficient for the impervious area for each subcatchment and manning roughness coefficient for conduits have little effect on model output with respect to external forcing uncertainty i e rainfall besides a theoretical distribution was fitted to the maximum peaks at the outlet four different distributions i e gamma generalized extreme value weibull and nakagami were fitted fig 8 b presents the fitting of these theoretical distributions on the predicted flood peaks it can be observed that empirical data are skewed to the left fig 8b all examined distributions seem to fit the predicted values of peak flow at the sewer outlet however based on the akaike information criterion aic the investigated theoretical distributions are ranked as follows fig 8b nakagami gamma generalized extreme value weibull for the nakagami distribution the shape parameter was calculated equal to 2 36 while the scale parameter was equal to 80 77 for the gamma distribution the shape parameter was calculated equal to 8 51 while the scale parameter was equal to 1 00 for the generalized extreme value distribution the shape parameter was calculated equal to 0 1951 the scale parameter was equal to 2 65 and the location parameter was calculated equal to 7 40 finally for the weibull distribution the shape parameter was calculated equal to 3 28 while the scale parameter was equal to 9 52 overall it can be concluded that uncertainty quantification of a calibrated model is vital in order to inform decision makers and help them during the decision process 4 summary and conclusions the main aims of the present work were i to compare different bias correction methods ii to develop idf curves based on future climate projections non stanionarity and to compare them with the observed ones stationarity iii to assess the impact of climate change on urban drainage iv to provide a holistic framework for the assessment of different flood mitigation scenarios both grey and green for climate change adaptation assessment v and to provide two new indices one for optimization of green grey flood mitigation scenarios and one for the assessment of different flood mitigation scenarios the results revealed that all bias correction methods were able to remove biases from the raw climate data however the quantile mapping method performed better moreover the results illustrated that under the non stanionarity projections of climate the percent change in future rainfall intensity can range from 2 to 42 for rainfall duration of 1 h and return periods up to 10 years furthermore the percent change in future rainfall intensity increases as the return period and the duration examined increase finally it was evident from the results that it is practical and possible with current computing resources to perform systematic assessment of flood mitigation scenarios using an automated procedure applying climate change projections bias correction methods temporal downscaling multicriteria decision making and hydraulic models with high level of detail on the other hand data requirements and computational effort are significant but can be addressed by the use of high performance computing platforms it was found that the performance of climate change adaptation strategies strongly depends on the considered climate scenario moreover as the climate variability adaptation index demonstrated that the implementation of permeable pavements for flood mitigation is viable only for storm events of high probability of occurrence return periods 10 years the two indices iruda and cvai introduced in the present work can be valuable tools for supporting planning of flood risk mitigation measures and the decision making process however the methodology presented must also be tested in other areas finally the forward uncertainty propagation analysis revealed that input uncertainty especially rainfall depth and time to peak has significant impact on peak discharge at the sewer outlet overall it is essential to try to maintain flexibility of the flood mitigation scenarios by introducing in the design procedure green measures but also accept and understand the non stationarity of the climate to this end it is proposed to revise design standards and also to try to incorporate in the design procedure total uncertainty i e uncertainty stemming from climate change projections statistical downscaling hydrologic hydraulic modeling rainfall uncertainty etc credit

4149,tropical peat swamp forests psfs play a significant role in the exchange of water between land and the atmosphere however fire and drainage have been expanding in psfs in recent decades although there is concern on the influence of fire and drainage on water circulation their influence on evapotranspiration et is insufficiently understood furthermore repeated fire occurrences and their corresponding influence on the et by recurrent burning and smoldering is unexplored to elucidate these influences we examined long term variation of et in a degraded peat swamp forest in central kalimantan indonesia that was affected by drainage and repeated fire the continuous observation of energy fluxes was conducted for approximately 13 years between 2004 and 2016 by using the eddy covariance technique the site burned in 2009 and 2014 and was drained in 2014 monthly et and net radiation rn fluctuated in synchrony and thus they decreased considerably under fire induced dense haze during the el niño drought troughs of et groundwater level gwl and rn and crests of vapor pressure deficit vpd coincided in their time series variations in the case of et precipitation p et decreased when the gwl was deeper than 0 5 m half hourly et had a strong positive correlation with rn r 0 89 p 0 01 and partial positive relationship with vpd when vpd 20 hpa and with gwl when gwl 0 5 m et had no correlation with the enhanced vegetation index evi which represents above ground biomass for the entire observation period alternately the results of path analysis showed that some environmental factors controlled et differently depending on environmental conditions generally vpd negatively affected et due to stomatal regulation functions under dry atmospheric conditions however the effect was negligible during the water logged periods this is because atmospheric dryness facilitated evaporation from exposed water on the ground surface which canceled out the negative effect of transpiration due to stomatal closure after drainage by canal excavation fluctuation of gwl did not significantly influence et although et decreased this may be due to the hydrophobic dried peat soil which prevents rainwater infiltration disconnection of capillary force or disabled root water uptake as gwl excessively deepened fire potentially decreased et due to decreased transpiration by burning of vegetation however the decreasing effect was cancelled by increased evaporation from the waterlogged ground surface during the subsequent la niña event drainage undoubtedly deepened the gwl and et severely decreased in cases with extremely deep gwl keywords groundwater level eddy covariance technique net radiation precipitation vapor pressure deficit 1 introduction tropical peat swamp forests psfs are widely distributed in southeast asia especially indonesia malaysia brunei and thailand page et al 2011 however in the recent decades land conversion of forests mainly for agricultural use has been expanding deforestation and drainage accompanied by land use change result in peat aridification which increase the risk of fire within 15 7 mha of peatland in peninsular malaysia sumatra and borneo psf decreased from 11 9 mha in 1990 to 4 6 mha in 2015 whereas managed land cover area industrial plantations and small holder areas increased from 1 7 mha in 1990 to 7 8 mha in 2015 miettinen et al 2016 nonetheless large fires occurred repeatedly in this region in 2015 the worst fire of the last two decades spread over indonesia as a result smoke induced haze engulfed insular southeast asia for a few months huijnen et al 2016 ismanto et al 2019 evapotranspiration et plays a significant role in energy exchange and the water cycle between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere especially in tropical forests et has a significant impact on regional and global climate since et is high enough to mitigate global warming by evaporative cooling effect bonan 2008 there are several studies examine how environmental disturbances such as fire drainage and deforestation affect et for example in the tropical amazon forest deforestation decreased et due to reduced transpiration and rainfall interception and subsequent evaporation baker and spracklen 2019 in the other study from the amazon forest et in logged or burned forest was generally smaller than that in the intact forest because of lower leaf index whereas the difference became smaller under extremely dry conditions longo et al 2020 in boreal peatland where feather moss dominated et increased or decreased depending on peat burn severity kettridge et al 2017 kettridge et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2020 they explained that evaporation from peat soil surface increased as the capping layer of feather moss disappeared by a severe fire whereas et decreased by light burning which made soil surface became water repellent and restrict the supply of water to the peat surface other than peatland site some studies observed reduction of et after a fire and cited loss of transpiration due to leaf burning as the reason i e beringer et al 2003 clark et al 2012 montes helu et al 2009 whelan et al 2015 a decline in net radiation rn is also cited as the reason for decreased et for example liu et al 2005 explained that forest canopies cleared by fire increased ground temperature and upward longwave radiation resulting in a decrease in rn montes helu et al 2009 explained that the exposure of the soil surface and the increase in bright colored coarse woody debris cwd increased the albedo after a fire on the other hand drainage significantly and directly impacts the water budget by increasing the underground outflow mezbahuddin et al 2015 reported that drainage reduced et due to drawdown of groundwater level gwl and soil drying using a process based model that relied on field data from tropical psfs they explained that the reduced water uptake of shallow roots due to aridification cannot be compensated by the water uptake of deep roots alternately moore et al 2013 found that et was lowest at the driest site among three adjacent peatland sites especially in peatlands desiccation of soils due to lowering of gwl create aerobic conditions and accelerate the decomposition of peat then increase the release of co2 into the atmosphere although previous studies revealed the influence of such disturbances on et hirano et al 2015 is the only one of its kind with continuous field observation in tropical psfs they had been conducted observations for 4 6 years until 2009 in three tropical psfs with different degrees of disturbances in central kalimantan indonesia they revealed that almost intact forest had high annual et comparing with those in other upland tropical forests a significant difference in annual et was not found between in almost intact and drained forests although minimum monthly mean gwl had a positive linear relationship with the et the result suggested that tree species in drained forest acclimatized to a low gwl environment after more than 5 years after drainage in burnt ex forest et was decreased due to vegetation loss nonetheless the response of et to change in environmental factors e g rn vpd gwl in the vegetation regenerating process immediately after the fire is still unknown since the observation had started several years after the fire and drainage and the response to precipitation p which is the only water supplying element to the system was not cleared under excessively gwl lowered conditions we continued the observation in the ex psf site in hirano et al 2015 through 2016 with a brief suspension by fire in 2009 during the continued observation period the study site experienced fires and drainage in particular the fire burned cwd mostly in 2009 then succeeding vegetation regenerated immediately in subsequent la niña years ohkubo et al 2021b thus the site turned to be co2 sink from co2 source these two disturbances are expected to have a lingering effect and to manifest at different time scales in other words vegetation regeneration is long term while gwl fluctuations occur on a shorter time scale therefore we need continuous and long term observation for examining the effect of the disturbances moreover the continuous long term observation with a variety of environmental conditions enables us to reveal et variation through fire and drainage disturbances and to examine characteristics of et response to environmental changes with accumulated data here we have an unprecedented long term dataset through fire and drainage events from 2004 to 2016 in this study we estimated et considering the contribution to energy and water balance and explored the significant controlling factors of et through the fire and drainage disturbances then the data was also used to answer the following specific questions i how changes in et were influenced by meteorological factors in the process of vegetation recovery from fire and ii how do the sensitivity of et to p and gwl change after canal excavation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site 2 34 s 114 04 e is located in tropical peatlands near palangkaraya city central kalimantan indonesia fig 1 the site was called db a drained burned degraded psf in our previous study hirano et al 2015 the site was a tropical degraded psf until the fire in 1997 since then the site had been burned at least three times in 2002 2009 and 2014 the mean annual temperature and p measured at 1 5 m height from 2005 to 2016 were 26 4 0 3 c and 2640 473 mm mean 1 standard deviation respectively the site experienced the dry season monthly p 100 mm usually from july to october during the observation period from april 2004 to december 2016 the study site experienced fires and canal excavation in 2009 the study site experienced moderate fire and some aboveground herbaceous plants were burned in 2014 a less severe fire burned the study site again in 2015 the surrounding area experienced fire although the study site was not affected more detailed information is described in ohkubo et al 2021b in may june 2014 a canal was constructed in the vicinity of the site to analyze the influence of the disturbances and environmental changes we divided the observation into three periods period i may 2004 september 2009 period ii december 2009 june 2014 and period iii july 2014 october 2016 table 1 during period i cwd was present on the ground and vegetation was slowly regenerating since the fire in 2002 initially april 2004 fern stenochlaena blechnum and lygodium spp and sedge cyperus scleria and eleocharis spp plants were sparsely distributed in june 2005 peat soil was mostly covered with 0 5 m high fern and sedge plants a few young trees comprised predominantly of combretocarpus rotundatus reached a height of 0 8 0 9 m before the fire in 2009 in september 2009 some of the trees died and a part of the above ground herbaceous plants were burned by fire of moderate severity a large amount of cwd was also burned out during period ii ferns and sedges covered the ground surface immediately after the fire of 2009 sparsely distributed young trees predominantly combretocarpus rotundatus grew up to 2 m high until 2013 woody plants dominated the latter phase of period ii a water logged condition lasted a long time following abundant p during la niña years 2010 2011 a small canal about 1 5 m deep and 1 5 m wide was excavated approximately 100 m away from the observation tower from may june 2014 in september 2014 the study site was burned again by fire of low severity herbaceous plants and some young trees were burned whereas many trees survived in 2015 fire occurred in the surrounding area but the study site was not affected hence during el niño drought in 2014 and 2015 the site experienced severe haze caused by the fires further information is described in earlier studies hirano et al 2014 hirano et al 2015 itoh et al 2017 and our accompanying papers on albedo ohkubo et al 2021a and co2 flux ohkubo et al 2021b 2 2 measurements observations were conducted from april 2004 to december 2016 air temperature and relative humidity

gwl is the relative groundwater level from the ground surface and negative gwl means that water surface is below the ground surface reference ground surface level was corrected since significant subsidence was observed after fire in 2009 the soil heat flux g was not measured and vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from acquired air temperature and relative humidity data eddy fluxes of sensible h and latent heat λe were measured with a sonic anemometer thermometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and an open path co2 h2o analyzer li7500 li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa using the eddy covariance technique the measurement height was raised height of 3 0 m april 2004 to february 2011 3 6 m february 2011 march 2012 7 2 m march 2012 december 2013 and 13 6 m december 2013 december 2016 the two sensors were separated by 0 2 m the monthly δgwl was calculated from the difference between the mean of gwls taken at half hourly intervals of the last days of two adjacent months the observation system was suspended from september 20 to december 4 2009 as the power cables and sensors were severely damaged by fire eddy flux data of h and λe were available up to november 5 and october 27 2016 respectively due to sensor malfunction further information about instruments and data collection is described in hirano et al 2015 and our accompanying paper on co2 flux ohkubo

calculator software ueyama et al 2012 with the following procedures i removal of spikes vickers and mahrt 1997 ii double rotation for tilt correction iii water vapor correction for virtual temperature iv correction for high frequency loss massman 2000 massman 2001 and v correction for air density fluctuations webb et al 1980 data with wind directions within 20 from the north were excluded to avoid flow distortion by the tower data were also removed when precipitation was detected data with h 200 h 500 λe 100 and λe 1000 w m 2 were screened as outliers a stationarity check was performed for each 30 min run foken and wichura 1996 and we calculated the difference between covariance values for the entire 30 min and the average of six 5 min covariance values data were excluded in case the difference was more than 100 to investigate the development of the turbulence integral turbulence characteristics itc was calculated every 30 min foken 2017 then h and λe with itc 250 was excluded after stationarity check after these data quality controls monthly data with high gap fractions e g more than 70 of half hourly data are missing was removed from the analysis however they are used to illustrate monthly variations and estimate annual values gaps in h and λe data were filled using the lookup table method look up tables for each h and λe were created for every three months considering climate conditions as the previous study applied hirano et al 2015 i e february april may july august october november january using half hourly rn and vpd first the data were binned equally into ten classes according to rn second the classified data in each class were binned equally into three classes according to vpd finally values in 30 classes were determined by averaging each binned data look up tables of h and λe from august to october 2016 were substituted for those of november december 2016 respectively due to the lack of eddy flux data the mean half hourly h λe rn was 0 74 0 06 mean 1 standard deviation on an annual basis table s1 to settle the energy imbalance after filling the gaps h λe was forced to balance with rn on a daily basis maintaining a constant ratio of cumulative daily h and λe at this study site twine et al 2000 we used this adjusted λe for calculating et in this study detailed procedures are described by hirano et al 2015 2 5 bulk parameters physiological regulation of vegetation canopy i e integrating stomatal regulation of individual leaf or surface wetness for et could be expressed by surface conductance gs decoupling between vegetation and the atmosphere for et was evaluated by index ω where et is controlled by stomatal regulation when ω 0 and by available energy when ω 1 we used h λe instead of rn g because g was not

path analysis we conducted path analysis to explore the main controlling factors of monthly et using the r package sem version 3 1 11 p r n vpd gwl and evi were selected as explanatory variables each path coefficient i e the direct effect of each explanatory variable was standardized the total effect was determined by the sum of the direct and indirect effects the model structure was adjusted as goodness of fit index gfi improved sun et al 2018 described the criteria that the gfi of an adequate model is greater than 0 9 3 result 3 1 overview of time series variations we compared et with environmental factors and energy fluxes in a time series fig 2 et seemed to be stable regardless of p fluctuation although it decreased with deep gwl conditions gwl 0 5 m fig 2a b the mean annual et was 1457 152 mm mean 1 standard deviation table 2 until the canal excavation from may june 2014 gwl generally deepened in the dry season and increased and reached the ground surface level in the wet season however gwl never recovered to the ground surface level after canal excavation despite much p in 2016 vpd showed seasonal variation with high values in the dry season the monthly average vpd exceeded 10 hpa during the fires in 2004 2009 2014 and 2015 fig 2c λe and rn fluctuated in synchrony and had prominent troughs in 2004 2006 2014 and 2015 fig 2d in contrast h fluctuated slightly the annual bowen ratio β h λe calculated from cumulative h and λe for whole year was 0 31 0 07 mean 1 standard deviation but β occasionally increased with fire fig 2e table 2 maximum β 0 74 was recorded in october 2014 gs decreased with increased vpd in the dry season fig 2f ω had constant high values of approximately 0 8 under water logged conditions 2010 2013 and decreased with increasing vpd fig 2f evi decreased with fire in 2009 2014 and 2015 and subsequently increased gradually after every fire fig 2g negative values of soi were seen in el niño years 2004 2005 2006 2007 2009 2010 and 2014 2016 whereas the positive values were seen in la niña years 2005 2006 2007 2008 2008 2009 2010 2012 and 2016 fig 2h especially soi had been positive for a long period during 2010 2012 and there was much of p during or after fires a decrease in et was observed in 2004 2006 2014 and 2015 with temporarily lowered rn very likely due to fire induced haze immediately after drainage et did not decrease but decreased thereafter when gwl was extremely deep comparing the mean monthly et in the three periods table 3 et was the largest with 136 mm month 1 in period ii followed by 119 mm month 1 in period i and 109 mm month 1 in period iii as for the comparison of meteorological conditions the largest p 253 mm month 1 and r n 407 mj m 2 month 1 and lowest vpd 6 27 hpa were observed in period ii in period iii gwl was deepest 0 50 m although p was similar to that in period i smallest β 0 23 and largest gs 10 76 mm s 1 and ω 0 69 were recorded in period ii 3 2 water and energy balance in terms of water balance p is a unique factor that supplies water to the ombrotrophic peatland we examined the relationship between et and p on a monthly basis fig 3 and a positive correlation r 0 38 p 0 01 was found for the whole observation period however when p was greater than et et fluctuated around 127 17 mm mean 1 standard deviation independently of p therefore annual et p became smaller as p became larger the mean annual et p was 0 56 0 07 table 2 in contrast when p was less than et et decreased in some months when gwl 0 5 m in periods i and iii although decreased et 50 mm month 1 was observed for one month october 2015 even when et p on the contrary there was no condition with gwl 0 5 m in period ii we examined the relationship between monthly changes in gwl δgwl and precipitation surplus p et fig 4 we exclude the data with gwl 0 1 m to exclude the case of surface outflow which could not be evaluated quantitatively in this study significant positive correlations between p et and δgwl were observed for all periods significant difference p 0 01 was not found between the fitted lines in periods i and ii x axis intercepts of the fitted lines were 6 3 1 0 and 117 4 mm in periods i ii and iii respectively the underground outflow specifically increased in period iii additionally the slopes of the fitted lines were 3 60 10 3 2 74 10 3 and 1 30 10 3 m mm 1 in period i ii and iii respectively we examined the relationship between β and rn and β and vpd in case of rn 600 respectively fig 5 as rn increased β became larger and the increasing rate became gentle in all periods in period ii rn filtered rn 600 β had a decreasing trend with vpd contrary to the increasing trend which were seen in period i and iii 3 3 relationship between et and environmental factors half hourly et had a strong positive correlation with rn throughout the observation period r 0 89 p 0 01 fig 6 a vpd also had a positive correlation with et when vpd 20 hpa and et was stable irrespective of vpd when vpd 20 hpa fig 6b quadratic curve of gwl was applied for each period but positive correlation was seen when gwl 0 5 m fig 6c no significant correlation was found between et and evi for each of the three periods as well as for the whole measurement period 0 08 to 0 22 and 0 00 fig 6d et had positive relationship with gs the increasing trend of et to gs became more gradual as gs increased fig 6e in period ii gs fluctuated in the higher gs range as compared with gs in periods i and iii et seems to be stable irrespective of ω when ω 0 5 when ω 0 5 increasing trend of et with ω was seen in period iii whereas et hardly fluctuated in period i 3 4 path analysis to analyze the contribution of each environmental factor we drew a path diagram fig 7 a p had a positive fig 7b and rn had the largest effect 0 73 0 92 in all periods vpd had negative effects in period i 0 64 iii 0 26 and whole period 0 27 whereas the effect was negligible in period ii 0 05 gwl had a positive effect in period i 0 35 and ii 0 34 whereas the effect was negative in period iii 0 09 evi had a significant effect 0 18 only in period iii the goodness of fit index gfi is 0 86 0 96 all path coefficients are listed in table 4 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of et with other studies the mean monthly et 109 136 mm table 3 at the study site was larger than those observed in three boreal peatland sites 12 103 mm petrone et al 2004 sottocornola and kiely 2010 wu et al 2010 in other words even though the mean et decreased after drainage in period iii it was still larger than the maximum et recorded in the growing season at the boreal peatland site in contrast et p 0 56 in the study site table 2 was smaller than those in boreal peatland sites et p 0 90 brust et al 2018 et p 0 79 fraser et al 2001 and et p 1 07 morison et al 2020 on the other hand annual et and et p 1222 1662 mm and 0 44 0 66 table 2 in this study site were generally similar to those in borneo s forest 1210 1545 mm and 0 46 0 72 kumagai et al 2005 kume et al 2011 a small et p would be characterized by a large amount of p in this tropical regions although et was somewhat larger than those in boreal peatland sites compared with λe in other tropical sites reported by fisher et al 2009 λe in our study was generally smaller than λe in rainforests in america ranged 1 72 s 10 42 n and was similar to λe in plantations in congo and vanuatu and pastures in america which ranged 3 01 s 15 44 s similar λe would be because have nearly identical above ground biomass being different from the result of comparison in et λe in this study was smaller than λe in other tropical forest nevertheless the difference of λe will be closer if λe in our study is corrected so that the energy balance rn g h λe is closed wet condition with sufficient p would increase evaporation thus et even when peatlands experienced terrestrial disturbances compared with et p in period i the smaller et p in period ii could be explained by significantly increased p due to a la niña event although et increased somewhat table 3 alternately smaller et p in period iii could be explained by smaller et because p in period iii was similar to that in period i as shown in fig 4 drainage increased underground outflow i e available rainwater for et would be reduced in period iii compared with mean et in undrained 136 mm month 1 2004 2008 and drained 129 mm month 1 2002 2008 psfs in the vicinity of the study site hirano et al 2015 et in period ii was similar to the above values whereas et in other periods was smaller specifically with waterlogged conditions during la niña years et was comparable to those in forest sites under normal meteorological conditions even though some above ground vegetation was burned these results indicated that continuous rainfall which brings waterlogged condition has potential to increase et in tropical peatlands 4 2 low β with recovered vegetation and wet condition after fire mean annual β 0 22 0 39 was smaller than tropical savanna 1 4 7 0 beringer et al 2003 boreal peatland 1 10 1 19 morison et al 2020 upland forest of north america 0 5 1 0 moore et al 2013 and arctic wetlands at several sites 0 56 on average lafleur 2008 and similar to the average in tropical ecosystems which mostly comprise of forests 0 3 fisher et al 2009 this indicates that a large part of rn was distributed to λe irrespective of fire and drainage disturbances at this tropical site although there was some residual energy rn h λe contrary to the results of earlier studies e g beringer et al 2003 morison et al 2020 whelan et al 2015 fire decreased β in period ii earlier studies described that β increased with decrease in et due to loss of vegetation d acuncha et al 2018 reported that fire decreased et from 4 5 to 2 5 mm day 1 by burning species of trees in the study site vegetation recovered immediately in post fire years due to large p with la niña events this could be one reason for the small β with recovered et after fire at this site under conditions where the effect of rn on β was small decreasing β with vpd was found in period ii whereas the increasing trend was found in period i and iii fig 5b as mentioned in the previous subsection waterlogged condition lasted for a long period with prolong rain after fire in period ii fig 2b always wet condition which increases evaporation could be another reason for the small β although decrease in β does not necessarily mean increase in et thus our result showed the case that subsequent meteorological condition somewhat counteracts the effect of fire on β although fire potentially increase β due to loss of transpiration 4 3 strong dependence of et on rn through the fire and drainage rn had a significantly high positive correlation with et r 0 89 p 0 01 fig 6a and the largest effect on et throughout the observation period 0 73 0 92 fig 7b a strong correlation was found in other studies morison et al 2020 wang et al 2020 this indicates that fire and drainage disturbances did not change the characteristics of strong dependence on rn and fire could indirectly decrease et by generating haze which attenuate incoming radiation on the other hand ω became larger ω 0 69 with shorter vegetation of ferns and sedges in period ii and became smaller ω 0 56 with emerging woody plants in period iii table 3 these results explained that stomatal regulation became significant for et via change of transpiration rate as canopy layer became thicker on the other hand atmospheric conditions e g rn vpd control et rather than stomatal behavior in short vegetation since incoming solar radiation is likely to reach the ground surface and evaporation contributes to et more the variation of ω coincide with those of previous studies jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 reported that ω is larger with shorter vegetation and vice versa grassland 0 8 wheat 0 6 and forest 0 2 ω of regenerating forest decreased from that of the bog in central siberia valentini et al 2000 fire would increase the dependence on rn by clearing vegetation 4 4 vegetation succession post fire controls et sensitivity to evi a significant correlation between evi and et was not seen in this study fig 6d whereas previous studies found a positive correlation between vegetation indices and et for example wang et al 2020 reported that et increased with land conversion from bog to pasture they estimated an increase of λe with 54 wm 2 for a unit difference of evi pasture minus bog prater and delucia 2006 reported a positive correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and et on post fire bunchgrass or sagebrush a positive correlation was also found in upland forests that experience fire clark et al 2012 one possible reason for the non correlation observed in this study is the lack of transpiration due to burning of vegetation was sufficiently compensated by evaporation with long lasting precipitation in period ii moreover another reason could be that the influence of other meteorological factors e g rn and vpd on et were not excluded in the correlation between evi and et subsequently the results of path analysis showed that evi had a significant influence on et only in period iii coefficient of path b9 in fig 7 table 4 this may be due to the larger fluctuation of lai in period iii although there was no clear difference in the observed evi range among the three periods fig 6d it was reported that the relationship between evi and lai differs depending on vegetation type e g kang et al 2016 qiao et al 2019 for example using regression equations between evi and lai by qiao et al 2019 they reported that the variations in lai correspond to the variation of evi 0 25 0 50 and were estimated to be 0 87 2 84 0 38 2 63 and 0 62 1 94 in deciduous forest cropland and grassland respectively these estimations would indicate that fluctuation of lai was larger in woody plants than in herbaceous plants for the same variation of evi in period iii woody plants had been dominant whereas it was sparsely distributed in periods i and ii therefore a significant influence of evi on et may be found in period iii because of the large variation in lai for a certain change in et 4 5 low et sensitivity to vpd after fire the results of path analysis fig 7 showed that almost no effect of vpd on et was observed in period ii whereas vpd affected et negatively in periods i and iii this could be explained by the difference in land cover previous studies observed the stomatal regulation of fern by showing that their stomatal conductance decreased corresponding to increased vpd brodribb and mcadam 2011 cardoso et al 2019 hõrak et al 2017 martins et al 2016 in our study site there were fewer herbaceous plants and some ponds were formed due to large p in period ii evaporation from the exposed free water surface increases with an increase in vpd in contrast transpiration decreases with increasing vpd due to stomatal closure e g mcadam et al 2016 these two effects cancel each other out of the vpd change furthermore observed range of gs was high in period ii comparing with those in period i and iii fig 6e table 4 et does not change much at higher range of gs gs 10 mm s 1 this might indicate that the rate of increase of et for gs was gradual for a higher range of gs fig 6 this result implies that stomatal regulation for atmospheric dryness became less significant for et in period ii this could be an additional reason for the negligible vpd effect in period ii with low vpd and high gs 4 6 et becomes easier to be decreased due to drainage decreased et under the conditions p et and gwl 0 5 fig 3 might be related to the disconnection of capillary force that transfers the water upward ishikura et al 2017 described that the discontinuity of capillary pores is likely to occur in cases with deep gwl another possible reason is disabled root water uptake for example in boreal poor weakly minerotrophic forested fen most roots lived above 0 4 m soil depth dimitrov et al 2014 the rooting depth of purple moor grass in dutch peatlands was 0 5 m spieksma et al 1997 from these results it is inferred that the limitation of root water uptake could be another reason for the decline of et with gwl 0 5 m on the other hand et was relatively stable with gwl 0 5 m even if et exceeded p taufik et al 2017 described that gwl fluctuation influences hydrological drying or wetting upper peat layer and the soil moisture is depleted to fulfill the evapotranspiration flux it could be assumed that shortage of rainwater for et is compensated with soil water as long as gwl kept above 0 5 m in fig 4 we can theoretically evaluate underground outflow which is equivalent to the required water to stabilize the gwl from x axis intercept of fitted lines although head water pressure i e gwl should be considered for accurate evaluation we can also evaluate the increasing rate of gwl with unit water supply which is proportional to soil porosity from the slope of the fitted lines similar fitted lines in periods i and ii as shown in fig 4 indicate that the physical properties of soil were not changed by fire in 2009 this may explain the deep soil that was not damaged by fire although some parts of the peat surface and above ground biomass were burned the more gradual slope of the fitted line for period iii indicates that a larger amount of water is required to raise a unit gwl this may be due to the difference in porosity in the range of gwl fluctuation specifically gwl fluctuated in the shallower peat soil layer with lower porosity in periods i and ii and in the deeper peat soil layer with higher porosity in period iii in support of this hypothesis itoh et al 2017 reported higher bulk density corresponding to lower porosity of peat soil in the shallower layer compared with that in the deeper layer at the study site the increase in underground outflow in period iii from period ii was estimated at 116 mm month 1 from the regression lines as in fig 4 although the estimation was not based on direct measurement it is confirmed that the underground outflow was increased after canal excavation and the outflow water was as large as the et at the study site therefore p would become a significant factor to control et through the change of gwl after canal excavation as gwl never reached the ground surface level in contrast p had generally exceeded the required water volume to maintain the shallowest gwl i e waterlogged condition at least in the wet season before canal excavation although our study site experienced fire and the vegetation was damaged water was generally and stably supplied from the peatland to the atmosphere via et irrespective of p however drainage might disable this function because of the available groundwater loss due to deepened gwl resulting from increased underground outflow 4 7 drainage alters et sensitivity to gwl as for the effect of gwl on et a small negative effect was found in period iii whereas the effect was positive in periods i and ii fig 7b this seems contradictory to the gwl et relationship fig 6c which illustrates the positive relation within the observed range in periods iii this could be explained that sole gwl et relationship would include confounding factors whereas path analysis excludes the influence of other factors on et the small negative effect in period iii could be explained by the following reasons first if the gwl is below a certain level where the capillary force is disconnected and root water uptake does not work transpiration would not be further reduced by gwl deepening in other words when the gwl is fluctuating at a deep level changes in gwl have little effect on et in period iii the gwl was deepened extremely second less rainwater may infiltrate the extremely dried peat soil and evaporation from the peat soil surface may increase perdana et al 2018 reported that peat soil becomes more hydrophobic as it becomes drier as a result the duration of the dry period was longer the gwl deepened and the peat surface became drier specifically unchanged transpiration and increased evaporation may negatively effect gwl under drier conditions in period iii both positive and negative relationships between gwl and et would also depend on the range of gwl s in boreal peatland bog and pasture wang et al 2020 they explained this complicated relationship by several factors the impossibility of linear estimation of soil surface moisture by gwl spatial heterogeneity and complexity of peat hydrology additionally in fig 6c the fitting curves estimated that et decreased by 33 69 with gwl drawdown from 0 to 1 m depth simultaneously the same 1 m drawdown decreased et by 15 in phreatophyte shrubs in arid areas nichols 1994 the rate of decrease in et for 1 m drawdown was larger at the study site compared with that in the shrub land cooper et al 2006 reported that shrubs have deeper roots than herbaceous plants these results indicate that et in herbaceous plant dominated sites is susceptible to gwl drawdown because of their shallower root depth 5 conclusions fire would have reduced transpiration by burning some of the above ground vegetation whereas evaporation from open water contributed to et in water logged conditions with subsequent la niña events as a result et did not decrease immediately after fire at that time the effect of reduced transpiration by stomatal closure and increased evaporation from free water surface cancelled each other for atmospheric drying additionally fire induced haze attenuated incoming solar radiation then the decrease in rn reduced et on the other hand drainage could decrease et when gwl is deeper than 0 5 m rainwater shortage was not compensated by soil water for stable et this would be due to disconnected capillary force and disabled root water uptake at that time et was hardly influenced by gwl fluctuation thus we have shown that fire and drainage potentially reduce et however how much transpiration contributes to et is not yet well understood this is very important because transpiration is definitely related to vegetation recovering and which plays a significant role in water cycle or hydrological processes therefore in future research partitioning et into evaporation and transpiration would deepen our understanding in such dynamically changing peatland ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement shinjiro ohkubo conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft

4149,tropical peat swamp forests psfs play a significant role in the exchange of water between land and the atmosphere however fire and drainage have been expanding in psfs in recent decades although there is concern on the influence of fire and drainage on water circulation their influence on evapotranspiration et is insufficiently understood furthermore repeated fire occurrences and their corresponding influence on the et by recurrent burning and smoldering is unexplored to elucidate these influences we examined long term variation of et in a degraded peat swamp forest in central kalimantan indonesia that was affected by drainage and repeated fire the continuous observation of energy fluxes was conducted for approximately 13 years between 2004 and 2016 by using the eddy covariance technique the site burned in 2009 and 2014 and was drained in 2014 monthly et and net radiation rn fluctuated in synchrony and thus they decreased considerably under fire induced dense haze during the el niño drought troughs of et groundwater level gwl and rn and crests of vapor pressure deficit vpd coincided in their time series variations in the case of et precipitation p et decreased when the gwl was deeper than 0 5 m half hourly et had a strong positive correlation with rn r 0 89 p 0 01 and partial positive relationship with vpd when vpd 20 hpa and with gwl when gwl 0 5 m et had no correlation with the enhanced vegetation index evi which represents above ground biomass for the entire observation period alternately the results of path analysis showed that some environmental factors controlled et differently depending on environmental conditions generally vpd negatively affected et due to stomatal regulation functions under dry atmospheric conditions however the effect was negligible during the water logged periods this is because atmospheric dryness facilitated evaporation from exposed water on the ground surface which canceled out the negative effect of transpiration due to stomatal closure after drainage by canal excavation fluctuation of gwl did not significantly influence et although et decreased this may be due to the hydrophobic dried peat soil which prevents rainwater infiltration disconnection of capillary force or disabled root water uptake as gwl excessively deepened fire potentially decreased et due to decreased transpiration by burning of vegetation however the decreasing effect was cancelled by increased evaporation from the waterlogged ground surface during the subsequent la niña event drainage undoubtedly deepened the gwl and et severely decreased in cases with extremely deep gwl keywords groundwater level eddy covariance technique net radiation precipitation vapor pressure deficit 1 introduction tropical peat swamp forests psfs are widely distributed in southeast asia especially indonesia malaysia brunei and thailand page et al 2011 however in the recent decades land conversion of forests mainly for agricultural use has been expanding deforestation and drainage accompanied by land use change result in peat aridification which increase the risk of fire within 15 7 mha of peatland in peninsular malaysia sumatra and borneo psf decreased from 11 9 mha in 1990 to 4 6 mha in 2015 whereas managed land cover area industrial plantations and small holder areas increased from 1 7 mha in 1990 to 7 8 mha in 2015 miettinen et al 2016 nonetheless large fires occurred repeatedly in this region in 2015 the worst fire of the last two decades spread over indonesia as a result smoke induced haze engulfed insular southeast asia for a few months huijnen et al 2016 ismanto et al 2019 evapotranspiration et plays a significant role in energy exchange and the water cycle between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere especially in tropical forests et has a significant impact on regional and global climate since et is high enough to mitigate global warming by evaporative cooling effect bonan 2008 there are several studies examine how environmental disturbances such as fire drainage and deforestation affect et for example in the tropical amazon forest deforestation decreased et due to reduced transpiration and rainfall interception and subsequent evaporation baker and spracklen 2019 in the other study from the amazon forest et in logged or burned forest was generally smaller than that in the intact forest because of lower leaf index whereas the difference became smaller under extremely dry conditions longo et al 2020 in boreal peatland where feather moss dominated et increased or decreased depending on peat burn severity kettridge et al 2017 kettridge et al 2019 wilkinson et al 2020 they explained that evaporation from peat soil surface increased as the capping layer of feather moss disappeared by a severe fire whereas et decreased by light burning which made soil surface became water repellent and restrict the supply of water to the peat surface other than peatland site some studies observed reduction of et after a fire and cited loss of transpiration due to leaf burning as the reason i e beringer et al 2003 clark et al 2012 montes helu et al 2009 whelan et al 2015 a decline in net radiation rn is also cited as the reason for decreased et for example liu et al 2005 explained that forest canopies cleared by fire increased ground temperature and upward longwave radiation resulting in a decrease in rn montes helu et al 2009 explained that the exposure of the soil surface and the increase in bright colored coarse woody debris cwd increased the albedo after a fire on the other hand drainage significantly and directly impacts the water budget by increasing the underground outflow mezbahuddin et al 2015 reported that drainage reduced et due to drawdown of groundwater level gwl and soil drying using a process based model that relied on field data from tropical psfs they explained that the reduced water uptake of shallow roots due to aridification cannot be compensated by the water uptake of deep roots alternately moore et al 2013 found that et was lowest at the driest site among three adjacent peatland sites especially in peatlands desiccation of soils due to lowering of gwl create aerobic conditions and accelerate the decomposition of peat then increase the release of co2 into the atmosphere although previous studies revealed the influence of such disturbances on et hirano et al 2015 is the only one of its kind with continuous field observation in tropical psfs they had been conducted observations for 4 6 years until 2009 in three tropical psfs with different degrees of disturbances in central kalimantan indonesia they revealed that almost intact forest had high annual et comparing with those in other upland tropical forests a significant difference in annual et was not found between in almost intact and drained forests although minimum monthly mean gwl had a positive linear relationship with the et the result suggested that tree species in drained forest acclimatized to a low gwl environment after more than 5 years after drainage in burnt ex forest et was decreased due to vegetation loss nonetheless the response of et to change in environmental factors e g rn vpd gwl in the vegetation regenerating process immediately after the fire is still unknown since the observation had started several years after the fire and drainage and the response to precipitation p which is the only water supplying element to the system was not cleared under excessively gwl lowered conditions we continued the observation in the ex psf site in hirano et al 2015 through 2016 with a brief suspension by fire in 2009 during the continued observation period the study site experienced fires and drainage in particular the fire burned cwd mostly in 2009 then succeeding vegetation regenerated immediately in subsequent la niña years ohkubo et al 2021b thus the site turned to be co2 sink from co2 source these two disturbances are expected to have a lingering effect and to manifest at different time scales in other words vegetation regeneration is long term while gwl fluctuations occur on a shorter time scale therefore we need continuous and long term observation for examining the effect of the disturbances moreover the continuous long term observation with a variety of environmental conditions enables us to reveal et variation through fire and drainage disturbances and to examine characteristics of et response to environmental changes with accumulated data here we have an unprecedented long term dataset through fire and drainage events from 2004 to 2016 in this study we estimated et considering the contribution to energy and water balance and explored the significant controlling factors of et through the fire and drainage disturbances then the data was also used to answer the following specific questions i how changes in et were influenced by meteorological factors in the process of vegetation recovery from fire and ii how do the sensitivity of et to p and gwl change after canal excavation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site 2 34 s 114 04 e is located in tropical peatlands near palangkaraya city central kalimantan indonesia fig 1 the site was called db a drained burned degraded psf in our previous study hirano et al 2015 the site was a tropical degraded psf until the fire in 1997 since then the site had been burned at least three times in 2002 2009 and 2014 the mean annual temperature and p measured at 1 5 m height from 2005 to 2016 were 26 4 0 3 c and 2640 473 mm mean 1 standard deviation respectively the site experienced the dry season monthly p 100 mm usually from july to october during the observation period from april 2004 to december 2016 the study site experienced fires and canal excavation in 2009 the study site experienced moderate fire and some aboveground herbaceous plants were burned in 2014 a less severe fire burned the study site again in 2015 the surrounding area experienced fire although the study site was not affected more detailed information is described in ohkubo et al 2021b in may june 2014 a canal was constructed in the vicinity of the site to analyze the influence of the disturbances and environmental changes we divided the observation into three periods period i may 2004 september 2009 period ii december 2009 june 2014 and period iii july 2014 october 2016 table 1 during period i cwd was present on the ground and vegetation was slowly regenerating since the fire in 2002 initially april 2004 fern stenochlaena blechnum and lygodium spp and sedge cyperus scleria and eleocharis spp plants were sparsely distributed in june 2005 peat soil was mostly covered with 0 5 m high fern and sedge plants a few young trees comprised predominantly of combretocarpus rotundatus reached a height of 0 8 0 9 m before the fire in 2009 in september 2009 some of the trees died and a part of the above ground herbaceous plants were burned by fire of moderate severity a large amount of cwd was also burned out during period ii ferns and sedges covered the ground surface immediately after the fire of 2009 sparsely distributed young trees predominantly combretocarpus rotundatus grew up to 2 m high until 2013 woody plants dominated the latter phase of period ii a water logged condition lasted a long time following abundant p during la niña years 2010 2011 a small canal about 1 5 m deep and 1 5 m wide was excavated approximately 100 m away from the observation tower from may june 2014 in september 2014 the study site was burned again by fire of low severity herbaceous plants and some young trees were burned whereas many trees survived in 2015 fire occurred in the surrounding area but the study site was not affected hence during el niño drought in 2014 and 2015 the site experienced severe haze caused by the fires further information is described in earlier studies hirano et al 2014 hirano et al 2015 itoh et al 2017 and our accompanying papers on albedo ohkubo et al 2021a and co2 flux ohkubo et al 2021b 2 2 measurements observations were conducted from april 2004 to december 2016 air temperature and relative humidity

was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge te525 campbell scientific inc at a height of 1 5 m rn was measured with a radiometer cnr 1 kipp zonen delft the netherlands the measurement height was raised following tree growth height of 3 3 m april 2004 may 2012 6 8 m may 2012 december 2013 and 13 6 m december 2013 december 2016 their 30 min averages were recorded using data loggers cr1000 and cr10x campbell scientific inc gwl was measured with a water level logger dl n sensor technik sirnach ag sirnach switzerland or dcx 22 vg keller ag winterthur switzerland at an interval of every 30 min gwl is the relative groundwater level from the ground surface and negative gwl means that water surface is below the ground surface reference ground surface level was corrected since significant subsidence was observed after fire in 2009 the soil heat flux g was not measured and vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from acquired air temperature and relative humidity data eddy fluxes of sensible h and latent heat λe were measured with a sonic anemometer thermometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa and an open path co2 h2o analyzer li7500 li cor inc lincoln nebraska usa using the eddy covariance technique the measurement height was raised height of 3 0 m april 2004 to february 2011 3 6 m february 2011 march 2012 7 2 m march 2012 december 2013 and 13 6 m december 2013 december 2016 the two sensors were separated by 0 2 m the monthly δgwl was calculated from the difference between the mean of gwls taken at half hourly intervals of the last days of two adjacent months the observation system was suspended from september 20 to december 4 2009 as the power cables and sensors were severely damaged by fire eddy flux data of h and λe were available up to november 5 and october 27 2016 respectively due to sensor malfunction further information about instruments and data collection is described in hirano et al 2015 and our accompanying paper on co2 flux ohkubo et al 2021b 2 3 external data the enhanced vegetation index evi in modis data mod13q1 version was downloaded from the land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov products

https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections enso indicators soi soi which is a standardized index based on the observed sea level pressure differences between tahiti and darwin australia is an indicator of el niño and la niña episodes in general prolonged periods of negative or positive soi values coincide with el niño or la niña episodes 2 4 flux calculation h and λe were calculated using flux calculator software ueyama et al 2012 with the following procedures i removal of spikes vickers and mahrt 1997 ii double rotation for tilt correction iii water vapor correction for virtual temperature iv correction for high frequency loss massman 2000 massman 2001 and v correction for air density fluctuations webb et al 1980 data with wind directions within 20 from the north were excluded to avoid flow distortion by the tower data were also removed when precipitation was detected data with h 200 h 500 λe 100 and λe 1000 w m 2 were screened as outliers a stationarity check was performed for each 30 min run foken and wichura 1996 and we calculated the difference between covariance values for the entire 30 min and the average of six 5 min covariance values data were excluded in case the difference was more than 100 to investigate the development of the turbulence integral turbulence characteristics itc was calculated every 30 min foken 2017 then h and λe with itc 250 was excluded after stationarity check after these data quality controls monthly data with high gap fractions e g more than 70 of half hourly data are missing was removed from the analysis however they are used to illustrate monthly variations and estimate annual values gaps in h and λe data were filled using the lookup table method look up tables for each h and λe were created for every three months considering climate conditions as the previous study applied hirano et al 2015 i e february april may july august october november january using half hourly rn and vpd first the data were binned equally into ten classes according to rn second the classified data in each class were binned equally into three classes according to vpd finally values in 30 classes were determined by averaging each binned data look up tables of h and λe from august to october 2016 were substituted for those of november december 2016 respectively due to the lack of eddy flux data the mean half hourly h λe rn was 0 74 0 06 mean 1 standard deviation on an annual basis table s1 to settle the energy imbalance after filling the gaps h λe was forced to balance with rn on a daily basis maintaining a constant ratio of cumulative daily h and λe at this study site twine et al 2000 we used this adjusted λe for calculating et in this study detailed procedures are described by hirano et al 2015 2 5 bulk parameters physiological regulation of vegetation canopy i e integrating stomatal regulation of individual leaf or surface wetness for et could be expressed by surface conductance gs decoupling between vegetation and the atmosphere for et was evaluated by index ω where et is controlled by stomatal regulation when ω 0 and by available energy when ω 1 we used h λe instead of rn g because g was not measured then the bulk parameters of gs and ω were calculated following the method of hirano et al 2015 as 1 1 g s 1 g a ε h λ e ρ c p g a vpd γ λ e ε 1 2 g a 2 k u dh dv 2 3 u u 2 1 3 ω ε 1 ε 1 g a g

diffusivity of water vapor and u is the wind speed m s 1 to avoid instability and divergence we used midday ecosystem conductance 1000 1400 h without rain data to calculate mean monthly values 2 6 path analysis we conducted path analysis to explore the main controlling factors of monthly et using the r package sem version 3 1 11 p r n vpd gwl and evi were selected as explanatory variables each path coefficient i e the direct effect of each explanatory variable was standardized the total effect was determined by the sum of the direct and indirect effects the model structure was adjusted as goodness of fit index gfi improved sun et al 2018 described the criteria that the gfi of an adequate model is greater than 0 9 3 result 3 1 overview of time series variations we compared et with environmental factors and energy fluxes in a time series fig 2 et seemed to be stable regardless of p fluctuation although it decreased with deep gwl conditions gwl 0 5 m fig 2a b the mean annual et was 1457 152 mm mean 1 standard deviation table 2 until the canal excavation from may june 2014 gwl generally deepened in the dry season and increased and reached the ground surface level in the wet season however gwl never recovered to the ground surface level after canal excavation despite much p in 2016 vpd showed seasonal variation with high values in the dry season the monthly average vpd exceeded 10 hpa during the fires in 2004 2009 2014 and 2015 fig 2c λe and rn fluctuated in synchrony and had prominent troughs in 2004 2006 2014 and 2015 fig 2d in contrast h fluctuated slightly the annual bowen ratio β h λe calculated from cumulative h and λe for whole year was 0 31 0 07 mean 1 standard deviation but β occasionally increased with fire fig 2e table 2 maximum β 0 74 was recorded in october 2014 gs decreased with increased vpd in the dry season fig 2f ω had constant high values of approximately 0 8 under water logged conditions 2010 2013 and decreased with increasing vpd fig 2f evi decreased with fire in 2009 2014 and 2015 and subsequently increased gradually after every fire fig 2g negative values of soi were seen in el niño years 2004 2005 2006 2007 2009 2010 and 2014 2016 whereas the positive values were seen in la niña years 2005 2006 2007 2008 2008 2009 2010 2012 and 2016 fig 2h especially soi had been positive for a long period during 2010 2012 and there was much of p during or after fires a decrease in et was observed in 2004 2006 2014 and 2015 with temporarily lowered rn very likely due to fire induced haze immediately after drainage et did not decrease but decreased thereafter when gwl was extremely deep comparing the mean monthly et in the three periods table 3 et was the largest with 136 mm month 1 in period ii followed by 119 mm month 1 in period i and 109 mm month 1 in period iii as for the comparison of meteorological conditions the largest p 253 mm month 1 and r n 407 mj m 2 month 1 and lowest vpd 6 27 hpa were observed in period ii in period iii gwl was deepest 0 50 m although p was similar to that in period i smallest β 0 23 and largest gs 10 76 mm s 1 and ω 0 69 were recorded in period ii 3 2 water and energy balance in terms of water balance p is a unique factor that supplies water to the ombrotrophic peatland we examined the relationship between et and p on a monthly basis fig 3 and a positive correlation r 0 38 p 0 01 was found for the whole observation period however when p was greater than et et fluctuated around 127 17 mm mean 1 standard deviation independently of p therefore annual et p became smaller as p became larger the mean annual et p was 0 56 0 07 table 2 in contrast when p was less than et et decreased in some months when gwl 0 5 m in periods i and iii although decreased et 50 mm month 1 was observed for one month october 2015 even when et p on the contrary there was no condition with gwl 0 5 m in period ii we examined the relationship between monthly changes in gwl δgwl and precipitation surplus p et fig 4 we exclude the data with gwl 0 1 m to exclude the case of surface outflow which could not be evaluated quantitatively in this study significant positive correlations between p et and δgwl were observed for all periods significant difference p 0 01 was not found between the fitted lines in periods i and ii x axis intercepts of the fitted lines were 6 3 1 0 and 117 4 mm in periods i ii and iii respectively the underground outflow specifically increased in period iii additionally the slopes of the fitted lines were 3 60 10 3 2 74 10 3 and 1 30 10 3 m mm 1 in period i ii and iii respectively we examined the relationship between β and rn and β and vpd in case of rn 600 respectively fig 5 as rn increased β became larger and the increasing rate became gentle in all periods in period ii rn filtered rn 600 β had a decreasing trend with vpd contrary to the increasing trend which were seen in period i and iii 3 3 relationship between et and environmental factors half hourly et had a strong positive correlation with rn throughout the observation period r 0 89 p 0 01 fig 6 a vpd also had a positive correlation with et when vpd 20 hpa and et was stable irrespective of vpd when vpd 20 hpa fig 6b quadratic curve of gwl was applied for each period but positive correlation was seen when gwl 0 5 m fig 6c no significant correlation was found between et and evi for each of the three periods as well as for the whole measurement period 0 08 to 0 22 and 0 00 fig 6d et had positive relationship with gs the increasing trend of et to gs became more gradual as gs increased fig 6e in period ii gs fluctuated in the higher gs range as compared with gs in periods i and iii et seems to be stable irrespective of ω when ω 0 5 when ω 0 5 increasing trend of et with ω was seen in period iii whereas et hardly fluctuated in period i 3 4 path analysis to analyze the contribution of each environmental factor we drew a path diagram fig 7 a p had a positive fig 7b and rn had the largest effect 0 73 0 92 in all periods vpd had negative effects in period i 0 64 iii 0 26 and whole period 0 27 whereas the effect was negligible in period ii 0 05 gwl had a positive effect in period i 0 35 and ii 0 34 whereas the effect was negative in period iii 0 09 evi had a significant effect 0 18 only in period iii the goodness of fit index gfi is 0 86 0 96 all path coefficients are listed in table 4 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of et with other studies the mean monthly et 109 136 mm table 3 at the study site was larger than those observed in three boreal peatland sites 12 103 mm petrone et al 2004 sottocornola and kiely 2010 wu et al 2010 in other words even though the mean et decreased after drainage in period iii it was still larger than the maximum et recorded in the growing season at the boreal peatland site in contrast et p 0 56 in the study site table 2 was smaller than those in boreal peatland sites et p 0 90 brust et al 2018 et p 0 79 fraser et al 2001 and et p 1 07 morison et al 2020 on the other hand annual et and et p 1222 1662 mm and 0 44 0 66 table 2 in this study site were generally similar to those in borneo s forest 1210 1545 mm and 0 46 0 72 kumagai et al 2005 kume et al 2011 a small et p would be characterized by a large amount of p in this tropical regions although et was somewhat larger than those in boreal peatland sites compared with λe in other tropical sites reported by fisher et al 2009 λe in our study was generally smaller than λe in rainforests in america ranged 1 72 s 10 42 n and was similar to λe in plantations in congo and vanuatu and pastures in america which ranged 3 01 s 15 44 s similar λe would be because have nearly identical above ground biomass being different from the result of comparison in et λe in this study was smaller than λe in other tropical forest nevertheless the difference of λe will be closer if λe in our study is corrected so that the energy balance rn g h λe is closed wet condition with sufficient p would increase evaporation thus et even when peatlands experienced terrestrial disturbances compared with et p in period i the smaller et p in period ii could be explained by significantly increased p due to a la niña event although et increased somewhat table 3 alternately smaller et p in period iii could be explained by smaller et because p in period iii was similar to that in period i as shown in fig 4 drainage increased underground outflow i e available rainwater for et would be reduced in period iii compared with mean et in undrained 136 mm month 1 2004 2008 and drained 129 mm month 1 2002 2008 psfs in the vicinity of the study site hirano et al 2015 et in period ii was similar to the above values whereas et in other periods was smaller specifically with waterlogged conditions during la niña years et was comparable to those in forest sites under normal meteorological conditions even though some above ground vegetation was burned these results indicated that continuous rainfall which brings waterlogged condition has potential to increase et in tropical peatlands 4 2 low β with recovered vegetation and wet condition after fire mean annual β 0 22 0 39 was smaller than tropical savanna 1 4 7 0 beringer et al 2003 boreal peatland 1 10 1 19 morison et al 2020 upland forest of north america 0 5 1 0 moore et al 2013 and arctic wetlands at several sites 0 56 on average lafleur 2008 and similar to the average in tropical ecosystems which mostly comprise of forests 0 3 fisher et al 2009 this indicates that a large part of rn was distributed to λe irrespective of fire and drainage disturbances at this tropical site although there was some residual energy rn h λe contrary to the results of earlier studies e g beringer et al 2003 morison et al 2020 whelan et al 2015 fire decreased β in period ii earlier studies described that β increased with decrease in et due to loss of vegetation d acuncha et al 2018 reported that fire decreased et from 4 5 to 2 5 mm day 1 by burning species of trees in the study site vegetation recovered immediately in post fire years due to large p with la niña events this could be one reason for the small β with recovered et after fire at this site under conditions where the effect of rn on β was small decreasing β with vpd was found in period ii whereas the increasing trend was found in period i and iii fig 5b as mentioned in the previous subsection waterlogged condition lasted for a long period with prolong rain after fire in period ii fig 2b always wet condition which increases evaporation could be another reason for the small β although decrease in β does not necessarily mean increase in et thus our result showed the case that subsequent meteorological condition somewhat counteracts the effect of fire on β although fire potentially increase β due to loss of transpiration 4 3 strong dependence of et on rn through the fire and drainage rn had a significantly high positive correlation with et r 0 89 p 0 01 fig 6a and the largest effect on et throughout the observation period 0 73 0 92 fig 7b a strong correlation was found in other studies morison et al 2020 wang et al 2020 this indicates that fire and drainage disturbances did not change the characteristics of strong dependence on rn and fire could indirectly decrease et by generating haze which attenuate incoming radiation on the other hand ω became larger ω 0 69 with shorter vegetation of ferns and sedges in period ii and became smaller ω 0 56 with emerging woody plants in period iii table 3 these results explained that stomatal regulation became significant for et via change of transpiration rate as canopy layer became thicker on the other hand atmospheric conditions e g rn vpd control et rather than stomatal behavior in short vegetation since incoming solar radiation is likely to reach the ground surface and evaporation contributes to et more the variation of ω coincide with those of previous studies jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 reported that ω is larger with shorter vegetation and vice versa grassland 0 8 wheat 0 6 and forest 0 2 ω of regenerating forest decreased from that of the bog in central siberia valentini et al 2000 fire would increase the dependence on rn by clearing vegetation 4 4 vegetation succession post fire controls et sensitivity to evi a significant correlation between evi and et was not seen in this study fig 6d whereas previous studies found a positive correlation between vegetation indices and et for example wang et al 2020 reported that et increased with land conversion from bog to pasture they estimated an increase of λe with 54 wm 2 for a unit difference of evi pasture minus bog prater and delucia 2006 reported a positive correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and et on post fire bunchgrass or sagebrush a positive correlation was also found in upland forests that experience fire clark et al 2012 one possible reason for the non correlation observed in this study is the lack of transpiration due to burning of vegetation was sufficiently compensated by evaporation with long lasting precipitation in period ii moreover another reason could be that the influence of other meteorological factors e g rn and vpd on et were not excluded in the correlation between evi and et subsequently the results of path analysis showed that evi had a significant influence on et only in period iii coefficient of path b9 in fig 7 table 4 this may be due to the larger fluctuation of lai in period iii although there was no clear difference in the observed evi range among the three periods fig 6d it was reported that the relationship between evi and lai differs depending on vegetation type e g kang et al 2016 qiao et al 2019 for example using regression equations between evi and lai by qiao et al 2019 they reported that the variations in lai correspond to the variation of evi 0 25 0 50 and were estimated to be 0 87 2 84 0 38 2 63 and 0 62 1 94 in deciduous forest cropland and grassland respectively these estimations would indicate that fluctuation of lai was larger in woody plants than in herbaceous plants for the same variation of evi in period iii woody plants had been dominant whereas it was sparsely distributed in periods i and ii therefore a significant influence of evi on et may be found in period iii because of the large variation in lai for a certain change in et 4 5 low et sensitivity to vpd after fire the results of path analysis fig 7 showed that almost no effect of vpd on et was observed in period ii whereas vpd affected et negatively in periods i and iii this could be explained by the difference in land cover previous studies observed the stomatal regulation of fern by showing that their stomatal conductance decreased corresponding to increased vpd brodribb and mcadam 2011 cardoso et al 2019 hõrak et al 2017 martins et al 2016 in our study site there were fewer herbaceous plants and some ponds were formed due to large p in period ii evaporation from the exposed free water surface increases with an increase in vpd in contrast transpiration decreases with increasing vpd due to stomatal closure e g mcadam et al 2016 these two effects cancel each other out of the vpd change furthermore observed range of gs was high in period ii comparing with those in period i and iii fig 6e table 4 et does not change much at higher range of gs gs 10 mm s 1 this might indicate that the rate of increase of et for gs was gradual for a higher range of gs fig 6 this result implies that stomatal regulation for atmospheric dryness became less significant for et in period ii this could be an additional reason for the negligible vpd effect in period ii with low vpd and high gs 4 6 et becomes easier to be decreased due to drainage decreased et under the conditions p et and gwl 0 5 fig 3 might be related to the disconnection of capillary force that transfers the water upward ishikura et al 2017 described that the discontinuity of capillary pores is likely to occur in cases with deep gwl another possible reason is disabled root water uptake for example in boreal poor weakly minerotrophic forested fen most roots lived above 0 4 m soil depth dimitrov et al 2014 the rooting depth of purple moor grass in dutch peatlands was 0 5 m spieksma et al 1997 from these results it is inferred that the limitation of root water uptake could be another reason for the decline of et with gwl 0 5 m on the other hand et was relatively stable with gwl 0 5 m even if et exceeded p taufik et al 2017 described that gwl fluctuation influences hydrological drying or wetting upper peat layer and the soil moisture is depleted to fulfill the evapotranspiration flux it could be assumed that shortage of rainwater for et is compensated with soil water as long as gwl kept above 0 5 m in fig 4 we can theoretically evaluate underground outflow which is equivalent to the required water to stabilize the gwl from x axis intercept of fitted lines although head water pressure i e gwl should be considered for accurate evaluation we can also evaluate the increasing rate of gwl with unit water supply which is proportional to soil porosity from the slope of the fitted lines similar fitted lines in periods i and ii as shown in fig 4 indicate that the physical properties of soil were not changed by fire in 2009 this may explain the deep soil that was not damaged by fire although some parts of the peat surface and above ground biomass were burned the more gradual slope of the fitted line for period iii indicates that a larger amount of water is required to raise a unit gwl this may be due to the difference in porosity in the range of gwl fluctuation specifically gwl fluctuated in the shallower peat soil layer with lower porosity in periods i and ii and in the deeper peat soil layer with higher porosity in period iii in support of this hypothesis itoh et al 2017 reported higher bulk density corresponding to lower porosity of peat soil in the shallower layer compared with that in the deeper layer at the study site the increase in underground outflow in period iii from period ii was estimated at 116 mm month 1 from the regression lines as in fig 4 although the estimation was not based on direct measurement it is confirmed that the underground outflow was increased after canal excavation and the outflow water was as large as the et at the study site therefore p would become a significant factor to control et through the change of gwl after canal excavation as gwl never reached the ground surface level in contrast p had generally exceeded the required water volume to maintain the shallowest gwl i e waterlogged condition at least in the wet season before canal excavation although our study site experienced fire and the vegetation was damaged water was generally and stably supplied from the peatland to the atmosphere via et irrespective of p however drainage might disable this function because of the available groundwater loss due to deepened gwl resulting from increased underground outflow 4 7 drainage alters et sensitivity to gwl as for the effect of gwl on et a small negative effect was found in period iii whereas the effect was positive in periods i and ii fig 7b this seems contradictory to the gwl et relationship fig 6c which illustrates the positive relation within the observed range in periods iii this could be explained that sole gwl et relationship would include confounding factors whereas path analysis excludes the influence of other factors on et the small negative effect in period iii could be explained by the following reasons first if the gwl is below a certain level where the capillary force is disconnected and root water uptake does not work transpiration would not be further reduced by gwl deepening in other words when the gwl is fluctuating at a deep level changes in gwl have little effect on et in period iii the gwl was deepened extremely second less rainwater may infiltrate the extremely dried peat soil and evaporation from the peat soil surface may increase perdana et al 2018 reported that peat soil becomes more hydrophobic as it becomes drier as a result the duration of the dry period was longer the gwl deepened and the peat surface became drier specifically unchanged transpiration and increased evaporation may negatively effect gwl under drier conditions in period iii both positive and negative relationships between gwl and et would also depend on the range of gwl s in boreal peatland bog and pasture wang et al 2020 they explained this complicated relationship by several factors the impossibility of linear estimation of soil surface moisture by gwl spatial heterogeneity and complexity of peat hydrology additionally in fig 6c the fitting curves estimated that et decreased by 33 69 with gwl drawdown from 0 to 1 m depth simultaneously the same 1 m drawdown decreased et by 15 in phreatophyte shrubs in arid areas nichols 1994 the rate of decrease in et for 1 m drawdown was larger at the study site compared with that in the shrub land cooper et al 2006 reported that shrubs have deeper roots than herbaceous plants these results indicate that et in herbaceous plant dominated sites is susceptible to gwl drawdown because of their shallower root depth 5 conclusions fire would have reduced transpiration by burning some of the above ground vegetation whereas evaporation from open water contributed to et in water logged conditions with subsequent la niña events as a result et did not decrease immediately after fire at that time the effect of reduced transpiration by stomatal closure and increased evaporation from free water surface cancelled each other for atmospheric drying additionally fire induced haze attenuated incoming solar radiation then the decrease in rn reduced et on the other hand drainage could decrease et when gwl is deeper than 0 5 m rainwater shortage was not compensated by soil water for stable et this would be due to disconnected capillary force and disabled root water uptake at that time et was hardly influenced by gwl fluctuation thus we have shown that fire and drainage potentially reduce et however how much transpiration contributes to et is not yet well understood this is very important because transpiration is definitely related to vegetation recovering and which plays a significant role in water cycle or hydrological processes therefore in future research partitioning et into evaporation and transpiration would deepen our understanding in such dynamically changing peatland ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement shinjiro ohkubo conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft
