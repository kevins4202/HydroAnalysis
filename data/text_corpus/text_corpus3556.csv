17780,hydropower which utilizes energy from fast moving water can help alleviate the energy crisis and promote economic development for safety and ecological purposes dams must discharge periodically this discharge process which occurs with the supersaturation of total dissolved gas tdg affects the fish and other aquatic organisms living in downstream river areas previous studies have shown that the supersaturated tdg dissipation process is closely related to hydraulic properties such as the flow rate water depth and turbulent kinetic energy additionally the presence of solid walls such as vegetation leaves in water can adsorb dissolved gases in water thereby promoting the supersaturated tdg dissipation process and the adsorption effect is closely related to the solid wall material however systematic studies on how solid walls in water can quickly absorb dissolved gases from water and rapidly reduce the tdg saturation of water are lacking herein a series of experiments was conducted to study the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg under the action of solid walls in water and to reveal the adsorption effect of solid wall surface properties on dissolved gas the results showed that the surface roughness and hydrophobicity contact angle are the key factors related to the adsorption effect of solid walls on the tdg in water generally the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg first increased and then decreased with increasing surface roughness the supersaturated tdg dissipation rate increased monotonically with increasing contact angle based on the experimental data the adsorption coefficient which represents the adsorption effect of the solid wall for dissolved gas in water was proposed and a prediction formula between the adsorption coefficient and the contact angle of the solid wall was established these results can provide theoretical support for the utilization of the solid wall adsorption effect to mitigate the adverse effects of supersaturated tdg and protect fish graphical abstract image 1 keywords total dissolved gas supersaturation solid wall surface properties adsorption vegetation 1 introduction floods play a pivotal role in nature mannes et al 2009 wydoski and wick 2011 hajdukiewicz et al 2018 the high energy of fast moving water can be utilized for human social development especially for hydropower sordo ward et al 2013 chaleeraktrakoon and chinsomboon 2015 wang et al 2016 talukdar and pal 2017 which is a type of renewable clean energy to alleviate the global power shortage reservoirs formed by the damming of rivers have also become fish farms for riverside residents varol and sünbül 2019 thus promoting economic development the number of hydropower projects continues to increase annually especially in developing countries such as china and this process is economically and socially important however an adverse effect on the environment occurs simultaneously for security reasons hydropower stations must exclude excessive flood water during the flood season when a high dam discharges a mass of air is entrained in the water and dissolves in the plunge pool at an extremely high pressure leading to the supersaturation of total dissolved gas tdg weitkamp and katz 1980 li et al 2009 it is difficult to quickly release the produced supersaturated tdg into the atmosphere and it could be transported over a long distance along the downstream river feng et al 2014a kamal et al 2016 resulting in gas bubble disease gbd and even the mortality of aquatic organisms especially farmed fish weitkamp et al 2003 wang et al 2017 therefore conducting research on mitigation measures for the negative effect of supersaturated tdg is imperative especially in important regions for fish previous studies have illustrated that measures for mitigating the negative effect of supersaturated tdg can occur via two paths reducing tdg generation in the plunge pool and accelerating tdg dissipation downstream generally the former method can be achieved by engineering measures and operational regulations of hydropower stations orlins and gulliver 2000 found that modifications installed at the spillway and tailrace of wanapum dam helped decrease the tdg concentration concentrating most of the flow in a central spillway bay was suggested to increase the transport depth of the jet politano et al 2012 adopting an interval discharge pattern feng et al 2014b ma et al 2016 witt et al 2017 and using a ski jump energy dissipation structure instead of an underflow or surface flow structure feng et al 2014b could also effectively reduce the tdg generation level according to the field observations and numerical simulation results of feng et al 2014a the tdg level generated downstream of dams with heights over 100 m is generally greater than 120 which surpasses the standard limit of 110 for tdg saturation usepa 1986 therefore conducting research on effective and practical measures to expedite tdg dissipation is essential the proposed measures to accelerate tdg dissipation include reducing the water depth feng et al 2014a enhancing the flow turbulence intensity li et al 2013 and increasing the wind speed above the water surface huang et al 2016 based on the gas adsorption capacity of activated carbon niu et al 2015 proposed that adding activated carbon to supersaturated tdg water is helpful for dissipating tdg based on air water transfer theory ou et al 2016 considered aeration in water which was found to accelerate the tdg dissipation process given that fishes have the ability to detect and avoid supersaturated tdg shen et al 2016 2019 proposed a method to utilize the confluence at which naturally low tdg water joins the dam affected supersaturated tdg water for temporary tdg mitigation and fish refuge the banks of rivers downstream of high dams are often covered with vegetation the additional drag caused by vegetation shan et al 2019 traps sediment okamoto et al 2012 liu and nepf 2016 shi et al 2016 and nutrients balcombe et al 2015 thus attracting fishes to forage in vegetated regions in addition rotting branches and leaves are a substantial source of food for aquatic organisms bolland et al 2015 as a result bank vegetation regions are often viewed as habitats for aquatic organisms therefore it is important to understand the dissipation mechanism of supersaturated tdg in the vegetated regions of riverbanks feng et al 2017 found that the tdg saturation difference between the upstream and downstream areas of a flume significantly increased after supersaturated tdg water flowed through a vegetated area yuan et al 2018a established a three dimensional two phase supersaturated tdg transportation and dissipation model considering the effects of vegetation furthermore previous studies have demonstrated that excess gas in water tends to directly accumulate in nucleation centers or at the intersections of rough solid walls and then stabilizes in the form of nanobubbles at the interface between a wall and water parker et al 1994 this process helps to reduce the concentration of gas in water based on this relationship yuan et al 2018b developed a series of experiments to investigate the effect of vegetation adsorption on supersaturated tdg the results showed that planting vegetation in water could facilitate the dissipation process with a large amount of bubbles adsorbed onto the vegetation surface shown in fig 4 of yuan et al 2018b during the jinsha river flood season in 2019 we observed a phenomenon in which the stems and leaves of plants and the surrounding stones were covered with bubbles shown in fig 1 on the bank of the xiangjiaba reservoir with a tdg saturation level of 113 taking these results together we argue that planning a certain form of a characteristic vegetation region in a suitable area of the downstream channel as a shelter for fishes to avoid supersaturated tdg is possible the adsorption regulation mechanism of supersaturated tdg in regions of vegetation or solid walls has seldom been studied yuan et al 2018b developed an adsorption model of the effect of vegetation on supersaturated tdg however the author did not reveal how the surface properties can influence the effect of adsorption on supersaturated tdg previous studies have indicated that hydrophobicity miller et al 1999 and surface roughness borkent et al 2007 can significantly alter the adsorption effect of solid walls on dissolved gas in water therefore based on the properties of hydrophobicity and surface roughness the effects of the surface properties of a solid wall on the dissipation of supersaturated tdg were studied experimentally the results provide important guidance for selecting plants or other materials downstream of a dam to construct an appropriate fish shelter with a relatively low tdg level 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental device and materials dissipation experiments on supersaturated tdg under the influence of different solid walls with various surface properties were conducted at the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering sklh of sichuan university the experimental device shown in fig 2 is a rectangular plexiglass water tank 100 cm in length 50 cm in width and 40 cm in height two pieces of custom made plastic grille board were suspended 10 cm from the bottom of the tank and the gap between the bars was 1 5 cm the plastic grille board was used to fix the solid sheets a piece of solid wall sheet that was 10 cm long and 10 cm wide was attached to the corner of the device 25 cm from the bottom to record bubble formation during the experimental process six types of sandpaper with different roughness values were used in the experiment 60 100 240 500 1000 and 2500 sandpaper is usually made by gluing various abrasive grains onto raw paper the type of sandpaper is indicated by the granularity of the abrasive grains adhered to the surface generally sandpaper with low granularity has a smooth surface shen et al 2016 proposed that arranging water blocking piles in appropriate waters can mitigate the adverse effects of tdg supersaturation the surface of sandpaper is similar to that of concrete water blocking piles therefore it is representative to choose sandpaper as the experimental material in addition nine kinds of plastic sheets made from different components or subjected to different surface treatments shown in table 1 were adopted one reason for choosing plastic sheets was that in a previous study yuan et al 2018b a similar method was implemented with smooth pvc to maintain continuity with the previous study plastic sheets were used additionally the influence of the surface properties of the solid wall on tdg dissipation is considered in this study with an emphasis on the contact angle and surface roughness the four kinds of smooth plastic smooth pet smooth pp smooth pvc smooth pc have similar surface roughness levels but different contact angles which can be used to compare the differences in the adsorption effects of solid walls on supersaturated tdg levels under the condition of the same roughness but different contact angles the surface roughness and contact angle values of these experimental solid walls were obtained by a jd520 mobile surface rough meter beijing jitaiky testing equipment co ltd beijing china and a dsa100 optical contact angle measuring device a krüss optronic gmbh hamburg germany respectively and are shown in table 2 all of the sandpapers and plastic sheets had a length of 28 cm and a width of 23 cm the sandpapers and plastic sheets were placed in a staggered arrangement in the gaps of the grille board as shown in fig 2 the supersaturated tdg water used in the experiment was produced by the supersaturated tdg generation system developed by sichuan university china li et al 2010 air and water were pumped into the supersaturated water reactor vessel and mixed at high pressure so that supersaturated tdg water conditions were generated the tdg saturation level and water temperature in the tank were recorded with a from point four tgp portable trackers pentair california u s for which the measurement range of tdg is 0 200 with an accuracy of 2 and the measurement range of water temperature is 0 40 c with an accuracy of 0 1 c 2 2 method before the beginning of the experiment supersaturated tdg water was introduced into the tank with a volume of 150 l the tdg probe was submerged under the water surface and then shaken until the readings stabilized the initial tdg saturation and water temperature were measured and recorded then the tdg probe was removed from the water and the tdg saturation level and water temperature were measured again after a certain period this process was repeated until the tdg saturation level dropped to approximately 105 given the material types of the experimental solid walls experimental tests involving a sandpaper test group and a plastic sheet test group were performed and a control test was conducted four cases of different densities for 240 sandpaper and smooth pvc tests were conducted to compare the effects of different numbers of solid walls all test conditions are given in table 3 the water temperature refers to the average water temperature during the experimental process 3 experimental results and analysis 3 1 experimental results of tdg dissipation the dissipation processes of tdg saturation under various experimental conditions are illustrated in fig 3 and fig 4 the dissipation curves show that the tdg saturation level gradually decreased over time a comparison of cases without solid walls and the other cases shows that placing sandpaper sheets and plastic sheets in the water can effectively promote the tdg dissipation process as prior investigations showed this effect is because gas molecules in water tend to gather in the nucleation center of a hydrophobic solid surface and have a steady presence at the interface between the hydrophobic solid surface and water in the form of bubbles then because the gas transfer between bubbles and water is a dynamic process gases dissolved in water can enter the bubbles and gases can simultaneously exit from the bubbles at the beginning of the experiments the concentration of dissolved gas was very high under the pressure differential much more gases enter the bubble than exit from the bubble as a result the size of the bubbles gradually increases until reaching a stable stage moreover the concentration of dissolved gas in water gradually decreases meaning that the saturation of tdg decreases fig 5 shows the distribution of bubbles in the initial stage the intermediate stage and the stabilization stage of case 2 2 sandpaper 100 and case 3 3 coarse pp it is clear that in the stabilization stage the bubbles are full in shape large in size and relatively uniform in size and distribution 3 2 analysis of the dissipation processes in different cases 3 2 1 dissipation results of supersaturated tdg for different numbers of solid wall from fig 3 it is obvious that as the number of solid walls increased the tdg dissipation process became faster the time required for the supersaturated tdg level to dissipate from 147 to 105 in case 1 1 control sample case 2 3 sandpaper 240 a 4 12 m2 case 2 7 sandpaper 240 a 3 09 m2 case 2 8 sandpaper 240 a 2 06 m2 and case 2 9 sandpaper 240 a 1 03 m2 was 38 7 h 22 1 h 24 6 h 28 1 h and 32 5 h respectively for case 3 4 smooth pvc a 4 12 m2 case 3 10 smooth pvc a 3 09 m2 case 3 11 smooth pvc a 2 06 m2 and case 3 12 smooth pvc a 1 03 m2 the durations were 30 4 h 32 1 h 34 1 h and 36 2 h respectively the results were in agreement with those of a previous study yuan et al 2018b 3 2 2 dissipation results of supersaturated tdg for different kinds of solid walls from fig 4 the time required for the supersaturated tdg level to dissipate from 147 to 105 in different cases with the same number of solid walls but walls with different surface properties were different in the sandpaper test group the dissipation times of case 2 1 sandpaper 60 case 2 2 sandpaper 100 case 2 3 sandpaper 250 case 2 4 sandpaper 500 case 2 5 sandpaper 1000 and case 2 6 sandpaper 2500 were 24 8 h 24 3 h 22 1 h 20 5 h 21 3 h and 25 2 h respectively in the plastic sheet test group the dissipation times in case 3 1 smooth pet case 3 2 smooth pp case 3 3 coarse pp case 3 4 smooth pvc case 3 5 fine pvc case 3 6 coarse pvc case 3 7 smooth pc case 3 8 fine pc and case 3 9 coarse pc were 33 8 h 31 0 h 29 7 h 30 4 h 29 6 h 23 9 h 28 2 h 26 0 h and 21 8 h respectively overall the supersaturated tdg in the sandpaper test group dissipated faster than that in the plastic sheet test group the average dissipation time required for the supersaturated tdg level to dissipate from 147 to 105 in the sandpaper test group was 23 0 h which was less than 28 3 h for the plastic sheet test group 3 3 analysis of the relation between tdg dissipation and surface properties different surface roughness and hydrophobicity characteristics of various solid walls result in different adsorption effects on dissolved gas in water previous studies have demonstrated that the surface roughness borkent et al 2007 and hydrophobicity miller et al 1999 of solid walls can affect the pattern of bubbles generated on solid walls generally during the dissipation process an increase in the total volume of bubbles generated on a solid wall results in an increase in the adsorption capacity resulting in an increase in the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg moreover under the action of buoyancy the bubbles generated on the surface of a solid wall may escape and then rise to the water surface and break thus reducing the dissolved gas concentration in the water the escape behavior of a bubble is related to the angle between the bubble and the wall which is dependent on the hydrophobicity and surface roughness fig 6 shows the relations between the dissipation time and surface properties it is clear that the dissipation time decreases with increasing contact angle for both the sandpaper test group and the plastic sheet test group for surface roughness the dissipation time decreases first and then increases with increasing sandpaper surface roughness in the sandpaper test group however the relationship between the dissipation time and the surface roughness of the plastic sheet is weak 3 4 analysis of the formed bubbles the dissipation process of tdg is related to the bubbles that form on the surface of the solid wall during the experiment we observed bubbles generated on different solid wall surfaces fig 7 shows the distribution characteristics of bubbles generated on 1 cm2 of a sandpaper and a plastic sheet in the stabilization stage notably on sandpaper with a high surface roughness ra 20 μm the distribution of bubbles appears to be disorderly the grain size of abrasive grains on the surface of sandpaper with a high surface roughness is large abrasive grains and bubbles are staggered and mixed resulting in this phenomenon due to the surface of plastic sheets being smoother than that of sandpaper the bubbles generated on the plastic sheets are distinct and well arranged which is quite different from the result for the sandpaper test group by combining the dissipation time and distribution characteristics of bubbles we analyzed the influence of surface properties on the tdg dissipation process sandpaper tests and plastic sheet tests were discussed separately considering the large differences in surface features for the sandpaper test group we found that bubbles are distributed most uniformly on the sandpaper with moderate surface roughness and the largest contact angle this relationship is observed in case 2 4 sandpaper 500 ra 11 526 μm θ 103 in which the supersaturated tdg level requires the shortest time to dissipate from 147 to 105 it is believed that more uniformly distributed bubbles on the sandpaper have a larger total volume and higher adsorption capacity than nonuniformly distributed bubbles causing the tdg to be quickly released for the plastic sheet test group because four different plastic materials are used two discussions are presented by comparing bubbles on the surface of plastic sheets with the same composition but different surface properties it can be clearly seen that a smooth surface exhibits a bubble distribution that has the minimum number of bubbles but bubbles with the largest diameter resulting in a smaller total volume of bubbles than that in other cases taking pvc as an example the largest bubble was generated on the smooth pvc with a diameter up to 2 mm moreover the number of bubbles generated on the smooth pvc was the lowest with only 18 complete bubbles on a 1 cm2 surface therefore for plastic sheets with the same composition but different surface roughness values the dissipation time of supersaturated tdg may increase with increasing surface roughness this relation is well verified in the cases of pc cases 2 8 to 2 10 and pvc cases 2 5 to 2 7 by comparing the four cases case 2 2 smooth pet θ 60 0 case 2 3 smooth pp θ 72 6 case 2 5 smooth pvc θ 73 3 case 2 8 smooth pc θ 82 3 with different components but a relatively small surface roughness ra 0 04 μm it was found that surfaces with larger contact angles have a larger total volume of bubbles accordingly for these four cases the time required for the supersaturated tdg level to dissipate from 147 to 105 is 33 8 h 31 0 h 30 4 h and 26 0 h respectively and the value decreases with increasing contact angle in general for all cases in the plastic sheet test group a large total volume of bubbles generated on the surface resulted in a short dissipation time the shortest dissipation time occurred in case 3 9 coarse pc 4 discussion the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg in water consists of three parts bubble liquid mass transfer air water surface mass transfer and wall adsorption previous studies on the tdg dissipation process have mainly concentrated on the total dissipation process and few studies have considered the influence of wall adsorption yuan et al 2018b reported that under the same experimental conditions the dissipation of supersaturated tdg caused only by wall adsorption could be obtained by deducting the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in a control test from the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in a sampling test they also proposed a method of calculating the quantitative influence of vegetation wall adsorption the above analysis demonstrated that the surface properties of a solid wall can affect the tdg dissipation process based on their research we conducted analyses to reveal the quantitative relation between wall adsorption and surface properties 4 1 the analysis of tdg dissipation coefficients the experimental results showed that the effects of the sandpaper and plastic sheets on the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg are dominantly related to the surface properties such as the surface roughness and contact angle usace 2000 proposed that the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg involves a first order kinetic reaction to quantitatively analyze the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg water when adding various sandpapers and plastic sheets a first order kinetic equation was adopted to fit the dissipation process the obtained dissipation coefficient was used to describe the tdg dissipation rate the fitting results fig 8 showed that all the correlation coefficients in the various cases were greater than 0 99 this result indicated that the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg obeyed the first order kinetic equation considering the influence of the sandpapers and plastic sheets the first order kinetic equation was 1 g g 0 e k t where t represents the dissipation time in hours g presents the excess percent gas saturation e g g tdg 100 where tdg percent saturation of total dissolved gas g 0 represents the initial saturation of the tdg and k h 1 represents the dissipation coefficient previous studies have shown that the tdg dissipation coefficient can be influenced by the water temperature shen et al 2014 to eliminate the influence of water temperature the temperature modification model proposed by shen et al 2014 was adopted and transformed to amend all experimental tdg dissipation coefficients to 20 c conditions as shown in eq 2 the modified tdg dissipation coefficient in each case is shown in table 4 2 k 20 k t 1 060 t 20 where k t is the tdg dissipation coefficient at t c h 1 k 20 is the tdg dissipation coefficient at 20 c h 1 and t is the water temperature c as shown in table 4 the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg clearly increased with the number of sandpapers or plastic sheets the maximum tdg dissipation coefficients of the sandpaper test group and plastic sheet test group are 0 2078 h 1 and 0 1850 h 1 respectively as observed in cases 2 4 sandpaper 500 and 3 9 coarse pc overall given the same number of solid walls the tdg dissipation coefficients in the sandpaper test group with an average of 0 1856 h 1 are higher than those in the plastic sheet test group with an average of 0 1464 h 1 for the sandpaper test group the tdg dissipation coefficient shows a trend of increasing first and then decreasing as the granularity of the abrasive grains increases i e as the surface roughness decreases in the plastic sheet test group for cases with the same material composition taking pc as an example the tdg dissipation coefficient increases with increasing surface roughness in addition among cases with nearly the same surface roughness but different contact angles that is case 3 1 smooth pet ra 0 036 μm θ 60 case 3 2 smooth pp ra 0 035 μm θ 72 6 case 3 4 smooth pvc ra 0 037 μm θ 73 3 and case 3 7 smooth pc ra 0 034 μm θ 82 3 the tdg dissipation coefficient increases as the contact angle increases 4 2 calculation of the adsorption coefficient of the solid wall for supersaturated tdg based on a previous study about the vegetation adsorption effect on supersaturated tdg yuan et al 2018b a quantitative description of the tdg adsorption capacity of a solid wall per unit area and unit time and for a given water volume was obtained as shown in the following equations taking the derivative and discreteness of eq 1 the variation of the tdg supersaturation per unit time was expressed as 3 δ g k g δ t where δg represents the variation of the tdg supersaturation during δt for the control test 4 δ g c k c g δ t for the experimental test 5 δ g e k e g δ t where δg c and δg e represent the variations of tdg supersaturation in the control test and experimental test respectively k c h 1 and k e h 1 represent the adsorption coefficients in the control test and experimental test respectively the variation of the tdg supersaturation caused solely by solid wall adsorption δg a can be obtained by subtracting the variation of tdg supersaturation in the control test from that in the experimental test therefore 6 δ g a k e k c g δ t additionally when δt approaches 0 eq 6 becomes 7 d g a d t δ t 0 δ g a δ t k e k c g hence given a certain water volume the tdg adsorption capacity of a solid wall per unit area and per unit time and for a given water volume q a m h 1 can be determined as shown in eq 8 8 q a d g a d t v a k e k c v a g specially c a m h 1 is the adsorption coefficient as expressed in eq 9 9 c a k e k c v a the expression of q a is given in eq 10 10 q a c e g the adsorption coefficients of all cases are displayed in table 5 for cases with the same type but different numbers of solid walls the adsorption coefficients were very similar however cases with different numbers of solid walls in water had various adsorption coefficients this result indicated that the adsorption coefficient was not related to the number of walls but to the properties of the solid walls 4 3 analysis between the adsorption coefficient and surface properties according to the above analysis the surface roughness and contact angle of the solid wall surface are the key factors that influence the dissipation of supersaturated tdg fig 9 shows the relation curves among the adsorption coefficients with the surface roughness and contact angle in general as the surface roughness increases the adsorption coefficient tends to increase first and then decrease the adsorption coefficient reaches the maximum surface roughness of 11 526 μm case 2 4 sandpaper 500 polynomial fitting of the relation between the adsorption coefficient and surface roughness was performed and a poor correlation of 0 7768 was obtained while the adsorption coefficient increased with increasing contact angle and exhibited a good correlation of 0 9749 based on exponential fitting studies have indicated that the contact angle of solid surfaces is mainly determined by the surface chemistry and surface roughness mchale et al 2005 therefore it is reasonable to use the contact angle of the solid surface to quantify the relationship between the surface properties and the adsorption coefficient from fig 9 the resulting expression of the adsorption coefficient and contact angle can be written as 11 c a α e β θ by employing the experimental data from 10 cases case 2 3 to case 2 6 and case 3 1 to case 3 6 the values of α and β were 0 00004 and 0 043 respectively by substituting the values above into eq 11 the formula for the adsorption coefficient can be expressed as follows 12 c a 0 00004 e 0 043 θ eq 12 is used to calculate the adsorption coefficient of the rest of the cases case 2 1 to case 2 2 and case 3 7 to case 3 9 and a comparison of the adsorption coefficient calculated with eq 12 and the adsorption coefficient determined in the experimental research is displayed in fig 10 almost all points fall around the x y line which indicates that the adsorption coefficient calculated with the fitting formula in eq 12 is approximately the same as the adsorption coefficient determined in the experimental research in addition error analysis was performed the mean error η mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and standard deviation std were 0 00004 m h 1 0 5 0 00022 m h 1 and 0 00022 respectively additionally the coefficient of determination r2 of eq 12 between the fitted and experimental values of the adsorption coefficient was 0 83 with good significance these analyses demonstrate that eq 12 can be used to accurately calculate the adsorption coefficient 5 conclusions experiments on the supersaturated tdg dissipation process considering the adsorption effects of fifteen kinds of solid walls with various surface properties were performed in this paper the adsorption mechanism related to the tdg adsorption capacity of a solid wall was investigated the effects of the surface roughness and contact angle on the adsorption coefficient were discussed a formula was proposed for predicting the adsorption coefficient specifically the surface roughness and contact angle were found to be the key factors that influence the adsorption effect of a solid wall on supersaturated tdg dissipation in general the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg first increased and then decreased with increasing surface roughness the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg increased monotonically with increasing contact angle an improved adsorption model was proposed considering the influence of the water volume on the tdg adsorption effect of a solid wall the adsorption coefficient is independent of the solid wall configuration and depends only on the surface properties especially the surface roughness and hydrophobicity contact angle the prediction formula constructed for the adsorption coefficient and contact angle can be expressed as c a 0 00004 e 0 043 θ the results presented in this paper provide theoretical support for the utilization of solid wall adsorption effects to mitigate the adverse effects of supersaturated tdg and protect fish in the next phase of study it is necessary to research the adsorption capacity of solid walls under flowing conditions additionally the adsorption effect of practical materials such as vegetation should be studied to construct an adsorption coefficient database and to complement the adsorption model

17780,hydropower which utilizes energy from fast moving water can help alleviate the energy crisis and promote economic development for safety and ecological purposes dams must discharge periodically this discharge process which occurs with the supersaturation of total dissolved gas tdg affects the fish and other aquatic organisms living in downstream river areas previous studies have shown that the supersaturated tdg dissipation process is closely related to hydraulic properties such as the flow rate water depth and turbulent kinetic energy additionally the presence of solid walls such as

especially in developing countries such as china and this process is economically and socially important however an adverse effect on the environment occurs simultaneously for security reasons hydropower stations must exclude excessive flood water during the flood season when a high dam discharges a mass of air is entrained in the water and dissolves in the plunge pool at an extremely high pressure leading to the supersaturation of total dissolved gas tdg weitkamp and katz 1980 li et al 2009 it is difficult to quickly release the produced supersaturated tdg into the atmosphere and it could be transported over a long distance along the downstream river feng et al 2014a kamal et al 2016 resulting in gas bubble disease gbd and even the mortality of aquatic organisms especially farmed fish weitkamp et al 2003 wang et al 2017 therefore conducting research on mitigation measures for the negative effect of supersaturated tdg is imperative especially in important regions for fish previous studies have illustrated that measures for mitigating the negative effect of supersaturated tdg can occur via two paths reducing tdg generation in the plunge pool and accelerating tdg dissipation downstream generally the former method can be achieved by engineering measures and operational regulations of hydropower stations orlins and gulliver 2000 found that modifications installed at the spillway and tailrace of wanapum dam helped decrease the tdg concentration concentrating most of the flow in a central spillway bay was suggested to increase the transport depth of

flow structure feng et al 2014b could also effectively reduce the tdg generation level according to the field observations and numerical simulation results of feng et al 2014a the tdg level generated downstream of dams with heights over 100 m is generally greater than 120 which surpasses the standard limit of 110 for tdg saturation usepa 1986 therefore conducting research on effective and practical measures to expedite tdg dissipation is essential the proposed measures to accelerate tdg dissipation include reducing the water depth feng et al 2014a enhancing the flow turbulence intensity li et al 2013 and increasing the wind speed above the water surface huang et al 2016 based on the gas adsorption capacity of activated carbon niu et al 2015 proposed that adding activated carbon to supersaturated tdg water is helpful for dissipating tdg based on air water transfer theory ou et al 2016 considered aeration in water which was found to accelerate the tdg dissipation process given that fishes have the ability to detect and avoid supersaturated tdg shen et al 2016 2019 proposed a method to utilize the confluence at which naturally low tdg water joins the dam affected supersaturated tdg water for temporary tdg mitigation and fish refuge the banks of rivers downstream of high dams are often covered with vegetation the additional drag caused by vegetation shan et al 2019 traps sediment okamoto et al 2012 liu and nepf 2016 shi et al 2016 and nutrients balcombe et al 2015 thus attracting fishes to forage in vegetated regions in addition rotting branches and leaves are a substantial source of food for aquatic organisms bolland et al 2015 as a result bank vegetation regions are often viewed as habitats for aquatic organisms therefore it is important to understand the dissipation mechanism of supersaturated tdg in the vegetated regions of riverbanks feng et al 2017 found that the tdg saturation difference between the upstream and downstream areas of a flume significantly increased after supersaturated tdg water flowed through a vegetated area yuan et al 2018a established a three dimensional two phase supersaturated tdg transportation and dissipation model considering the effects of vegetation furthermore previous studies have demonstrated that excess gas in water tends to directly accumulate in nucleation centers or at the intersections of rough solid walls and then stabilizes in the form of nanobubbles at the interface between a wall and water parker et al 1994 this process helps to reduce the concentration of gas in water based on this relationship yuan et al 2018b developed a series of experiments to investigate the effect of vegetation adsorption on supersaturated tdg the results showed that planting vegetation in water could facilitate the dissipation process with a large amount of bubbles adsorbed onto the vegetation surface shown in fig 4 of yuan et al 2018b during the jinsha river flood season in 2019 we observed a phenomenon in which the stems and leaves of plants and the surrounding stones were covered with bubbles shown in fig 1 on the bank of the xiangjiaba reservoir with a tdg saturation level of 113 taking these results together we argue that planning a certain form of a characteristic vegetation region in a suitable area of the downstream channel as a shelter for fishes to avoid supersaturated tdg is possible the adsorption regulation mechanism of supersaturated tdg in regions of vegetation or solid walls has seldom been studied yuan et al 2018b developed an adsorption model of the effect of vegetation on supersaturated tdg however the author did not reveal how the surface properties can influence the effect of adsorption on supersaturated tdg previous studies have indicated that hydrophobicity miller et al 1999 and surface roughness borkent et al 2007 can significantly alter the adsorption effect of solid walls on dissolved gas in water therefore based on the properties of hydrophobicity and surface roughness the effects of the surface properties of a solid wall on the dissipation of supersaturated tdg were studied experimentally the results provide important guidance for selecting plants or other materials downstream of a dam to construct an appropriate fish shelter with a relatively low tdg level 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental device and materials dissipation experiments on supersaturated tdg under the influence of different solid walls with various surface properties were conducted at the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering sklh of sichuan university the experimental device shown in fig 2 is a rectangular plexiglass water tank 100 cm in length 50 cm in width and 40 cm in height two pieces of custom made plastic grille board were suspended 10 cm from the bottom of the tank and the gap between the bars was 1 5 cm the plastic grille board was used to fix the solid sheets a piece of solid wall sheet that was 10 cm long and 10 cm wide was attached to the corner of the device 25 cm from the bottom to record bubble formation during the experimental process six types of sandpaper with different roughness values were used in the experiment 60 100 240 500 1000 and 2500 sandpaper is usually made by gluing various abrasive grains onto raw paper the type of sandpaper is indicated by the granularity of the abrasive grains adhered to the surface generally sandpaper with low granularity has a smooth surface shen et al 2016 proposed that arranging water blocking piles in appropriate waters can mitigate the adverse effects of tdg supersaturation the surface of sandpaper is similar to that of concrete water blocking piles therefore it is representative to choose sandpaper as the experimental material in addition nine kinds of plastic sheets made from different components or subjected to different surface treatments shown in table 1 were adopted one reason for choosing plastic sheets was that in a previous study yuan et al 2018b a similar method was implemented with smooth pvc to maintain continuity with the previous study plastic sheets were used additionally the influence of the surface properties of the solid wall on tdg dissipation is considered in this study with an emphasis on the contact angle and surface roughness the four kinds of smooth plastic smooth pet smooth pp smooth pvc smooth pc have similar surface roughness levels but different contact angles which can be used to compare the differences in the adsorption effects of solid walls on supersaturated tdg levels under the condition of the same roughness but different contact angles the surface roughness and contact angle values of these experimental solid walls were obtained by a jd520 mobile surface rough meter beijing jitaiky testing equipment co ltd beijing china and a dsa100 optical contact angle measuring device a krüss optronic gmbh hamburg germany respectively and are shown in table 2 all of the sandpapers and plastic sheets had a length of 28 cm and a width of 23 cm the sandpapers and plastic sheets were placed in a staggered arrangement in the gaps of the grille board as shown in fig 2 the supersaturated tdg water used in the experiment was produced by the supersaturated tdg generation system developed by sichuan university china li et al 2010 air and water were pumped into the supersaturated water reactor vessel and mixed at high pressure so that supersaturated tdg water conditions were generated the tdg saturation level and water temperature in the tank were recorded with a from point four tgp portable trackers pentair california u s for which the measurement range of tdg is 0 200 with an accuracy of 2 and the measurement range of water temperature is 0 40 c with an accuracy of 0 1 c 2 2 method before the beginning of the experiment supersaturated tdg water was introduced into the tank with a volume of 150 l the tdg probe was submerged under the water surface and then shaken until the readings stabilized the initial tdg saturation and water temperature were measured and recorded then the tdg probe was removed from the water and the tdg saturation level and water temperature were measured again after a certain period this process was repeated until the tdg saturation level dropped to approximately 105 given the material types of the experimental solid walls experimental tests involving a sandpaper test group and a plastic sheet test group were performed and a control test was conducted four cases of different densities for 240 sandpaper and smooth pvc tests were conducted to compare the effects of different numbers of solid walls all test conditions are given in table 3 the water temperature refers to the average water temperature during the experimental process 3 experimental results and analysis 3 1 experimental results of tdg dissipation the dissipation processes of tdg saturation under various experimental conditions are illustrated in fig 3 and fig 4 the dissipation curves show that the tdg saturation level gradually decreased over time a comparison of cases without solid walls and the other cases shows that placing sandpaper sheets and plastic sheets in the water can effectively promote the tdg dissipation process as prior investigations showed this effect is because gas molecules in water tend to gather in the nucleation center of a hydrophobic solid surface and have a steady presence at the interface between the hydrophobic solid surface and water in the form of bubbles then because the gas transfer between bubbles and water is a dynamic process gases dissolved in water can enter the bubbles and gases can simultaneously exit from the bubbles at the beginning of the experiments the concentration of dissolved gas was very high under the pressure differential much more gases enter the bubble than exit from the bubble as a result the size of the bubbles gradually increases until reaching a stable stage moreover the concentration of dissolved gas in water gradually decreases meaning that the saturation of tdg decreases fig 5 shows the distribution of bubbles in the initial stage the intermediate stage and the stabilization stage of case 2 2 sandpaper 100 and case 3 3 coarse pp it is clear that in the stabilization stage the bubbles are full in shape large in size and relatively uniform in size and distribution 3 2 analysis of the dissipation processes in different cases 3 2 1 dissipation results of supersaturated tdg for different numbers of solid wall from fig 3 it is obvious that as the number of solid walls increased the tdg dissipation process became faster the time required for the supersaturated tdg level to dissipate from 147 to 105 in case 1 1 control sample case 2 3 sandpaper 240 a 4 12 m2 case 2 7 sandpaper 240 a 3 09 m2 case 2 8 sandpaper 240 a 2 06 m2 and case 2 9 sandpaper 240 a 1 03 m2 was 38 7 h 22 1 h 24 6 h 28 1 h and 32 5 h respectively for case 3 4 smooth pvc a 4 12 m2 case 3 10 smooth pvc a 3 09 m2 case 3 11 smooth pvc a 2 06 m2 and case 3 12 smooth pvc a 1 03 m2 the durations were 30 4 h 32 1 h 34 1 h and 36 2 h respectively the results were in agreement with those of a previous study yuan et al 2018b 3 2 2 dissipation results of supersaturated tdg for different kinds of solid walls from fig 4 the time required for the supersaturated tdg level to dissipate from 147 to 105 in different cases with the same number of solid walls but walls with different surface properties were different in the sandpaper test group the dissipation times of case 2 1 sandpaper 60 case 2 2 sandpaper 100 case 2 3 sandpaper 250 case 2 4 sandpaper 500 case 2 5 sandpaper 1000 and case 2 6 sandpaper 2500 were 24 8 h 24 3 h 22 1 h 20 5 h 21 3 h and 25 2 h respectively in the plastic sheet test group the dissipation times in case 3 1 smooth pet case 3 2 smooth pp case 3 3 coarse pp case 3 4 smooth pvc case 3 5 fine pvc case 3 6 coarse pvc case 3 7 smooth pc case 3 8 fine pc and case 3 9 coarse pc were 33 8 h 31 0 h 29 7 h 30 4 h 29 6 h 23 9 h 28 2 h 26 0 h and 21 8 h respectively overall the supersaturated tdg in the sandpaper test group dissipated faster than that in the plastic sheet test group the average dissipation time required for the supersaturated tdg level to dissipate from 147 to 105 in the sandpaper test group was 23 0 h which was less than 28 3 h for the plastic sheet test group 3 3 analysis of the relation between tdg dissipation and surface properties different surface roughness and hydrophobicity characteristics of various solid walls result in different adsorption effects on dissolved gas in water previous studies have demonstrated that the surface roughness borkent et al 2007 and hydrophobicity miller et al 1999 of solid walls can affect the pattern of bubbles generated on solid walls generally during the dissipation process an increase in the total volume of bubbles generated on a solid wall results in an increase in the adsorption capacity resulting in an increase in the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg moreover under the action of buoyancy the bubbles generated on the surface of a solid wall may escape and then rise to the water surface and break thus reducing the dissolved gas concentration in the water the escape behavior of a bubble is related to the angle between the bubble and the wall which is dependent on the hydrophobicity and surface roughness fig 6 shows the relations between the dissipation time and surface properties it is clear that the dissipation time decreases with increasing contact angle for both the sandpaper test group and the plastic sheet test group for surface roughness the dissipation time decreases first and then increases with increasing sandpaper surface roughness in the sandpaper test group however the relationship between the dissipation time and the surface roughness of the plastic sheet is weak 3 4 analysis of the formed bubbles the dissipation process of tdg is related to the bubbles that form on the surface of the solid wall during the experiment we observed bubbles generated on different solid wall surfaces fig 7 shows the distribution characteristics of bubbles generated on 1 cm2 of a sandpaper and a plastic sheet in the stabilization stage notably on sandpaper with a high surface roughness ra 20 μm the distribution of bubbles appears to be disorderly the grain size of abrasive grains on the surface of sandpaper with a high surface roughness is large abrasive grains and bubbles are staggered and mixed resulting in this phenomenon due to the surface of plastic sheets being smoother than that of sandpaper the bubbles generated on the plastic sheets are distinct and well arranged which is quite different from the result for the sandpaper test group by combining the dissipation time and distribution characteristics of bubbles we analyzed the influence of surface properties on the tdg dissipation process sandpaper tests and plastic sheet tests were discussed separately considering the large differences in surface features for the sandpaper test group we found that bubbles are distributed most uniformly on the sandpaper with moderate surface roughness and the largest contact angle this relationship is observed in case 2 4 sandpaper 500 ra 11 526 μm θ 103 in which the supersaturated tdg level requires the shortest time to dissipate from 147 to 105 it is believed that more uniformly distributed bubbles on the sandpaper have a larger total volume and higher adsorption capacity than nonuniformly distributed bubbles causing the tdg to be quickly released for the plastic sheet test group because four different plastic materials are used two discussions are presented by comparing bubbles on the surface of plastic sheets with the same composition but different surface properties it can be clearly seen that a smooth surface exhibits a bubble distribution that has the minimum number of bubbles but bubbles with the largest diameter resulting in a smaller total volume of bubbles than that in other cases taking pvc as an example the largest bubble was generated on the smooth pvc with a diameter up to 2 mm moreover the number of bubbles generated on the smooth pvc was the lowest with only 18 complete bubbles on a 1 cm2 surface therefore for plastic sheets with the same composition but different surface roughness values the dissipation time of supersaturated tdg may increase with increasing surface roughness this relation is well verified in the cases of pc cases 2 8 to 2 10 and pvc cases 2 5 to 2 7 by comparing the four cases case 2 2 smooth pet θ 60 0 case 2 3 smooth pp θ 72 6 case 2 5 smooth pvc θ 73 3 case 2 8 smooth pc θ 82 3 with different components but a relatively small surface roughness ra 0 04 μm it was found that surfaces with larger contact angles have a larger total volume of bubbles accordingly for these four cases the time required for the supersaturated tdg level to dissipate from 147 to 105 is 33 8 h 31 0 h 30 4 h and 26 0 h respectively and the value decreases with increasing contact angle in general for all cases in the plastic sheet test group a large total volume of bubbles generated on the surface resulted in a short dissipation time the shortest dissipation time occurred in case 3 9 coarse pc 4 discussion the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg in water consists of three parts bubble liquid mass transfer air water surface mass transfer and wall adsorption previous studies on the tdg dissipation process have mainly concentrated on the total dissipation process and few studies have considered the influence of wall adsorption yuan et al 2018b reported that under the same experimental conditions the dissipation of supersaturated tdg caused only by wall adsorption could be obtained by deducting the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in a control test from the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in a sampling test they also proposed a method of calculating the quantitative influence of vegetation wall adsorption the above analysis demonstrated that the surface properties of a solid wall can affect the tdg dissipation process based on their research we conducted analyses to reveal the quantitative relation between wall adsorption and surface properties 4 1 the analysis of tdg dissipation coefficients the experimental results showed that the effects of the sandpaper and plastic sheets on the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg are dominantly related to the surface properties such as the surface roughness and contact angle usace 2000 proposed that the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg involves a first order kinetic reaction to quantitatively analyze the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg water when adding various sandpapers and plastic sheets a first order kinetic equation was adopted to fit the dissipation process the obtained dissipation coefficient was used to describe the tdg dissipation rate the fitting results fig 8 showed that all the correlation coefficients in the various cases were greater than 0 99 this result indicated that the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg obeyed the first order kinetic equation considering the influence of the sandpapers and plastic sheets the first order kinetic equation was 1 g g 0 e k t where t represents the dissipation time in hours g presents the excess percent gas saturation e g g tdg 100 where tdg percent saturation of total dissolved gas g 0 represents the initial saturation of the tdg and k h 1 represents the dissipation coefficient previous studies have shown that the tdg dissipation coefficient can be influenced by the water temperature shen et al 2014 to eliminate the influence of water temperature the temperature modification model proposed by shen et al 2014 was adopted and transformed to amend all experimental tdg dissipation coefficients to 20 c conditions as shown in eq 2 the modified tdg dissipation coefficient in each case is shown in table 4 2 k 20 k t 1 060 t 20 where k t is the tdg dissipation coefficient at t c h 1 k 20 is the tdg dissipation coefficient at 20 c h 1 and t is the water temperature c as shown in table 4 the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg clearly increased with the number of sandpapers or plastic sheets the maximum tdg dissipation coefficients of the sandpaper test group and plastic sheet test group are 0 2078 h 1 and 0 1850 h 1 respectively as observed in cases 2 4 sandpaper 500 and 3 9 coarse pc overall given the same number of solid walls the tdg dissipation coefficients in the sandpaper test group with an average of 0 1856 h 1 are higher than those in the plastic sheet test group with an average of 0 1464 h 1 for the sandpaper test group the tdg dissipation coefficient shows a trend of increasing first and then decreasing as the granularity of the abrasive grains increases i e as the surface roughness decreases in the plastic sheet test group for cases with the same material composition taking pc as an example the tdg dissipation coefficient increases with increasing surface roughness in addition among cases with nearly the same surface roughness but different contact angles that is case 3 1 smooth pet ra 0 036 μm θ 60 case 3 2 smooth pp ra 0 035 μm θ 72 6 case 3 4 smooth pvc ra 0 037 μm θ 73 3 and case 3 7 smooth pc ra 0 034 μm θ 82 3 the tdg dissipation coefficient increases as the contact angle increases 4 2 calculation of the adsorption coefficient of the solid wall for supersaturated tdg based on a previous study about the vegetation adsorption effect on supersaturated tdg yuan et al 2018b a quantitative description of the tdg adsorption capacity of a solid wall per unit area and unit time and for a given water volume was obtained as shown in the following equations taking the derivative and discreteness of eq 1 the variation of the tdg supersaturation per unit time was expressed as 3 δ g k g δ t where δg represents the variation of the tdg supersaturation during δt for the control test 4 δ g c k c g δ t for the experimental test 5 δ g e k e g δ t where δg c and δg e represent the variations of tdg supersaturation in the control test and experimental test respectively k c h 1 and k e h 1 represent the adsorption coefficients in the control test and experimental test respectively the variation of the tdg supersaturation caused solely by solid wall adsorption δg a can be obtained by subtracting the variation of tdg supersaturation in the control test from that in the experimental test therefore 6 δ g a k e k c g δ t additionally when δt approaches 0 eq 6 becomes 7 d g a d t δ t 0 δ g a δ t k e k c g hence given a certain water volume the tdg adsorption capacity of a solid wall per unit area and per unit time and for a given water volume q a m h 1 can be determined as shown in eq 8 8 q a d g a d t v a k e k c v a g specially c a m h 1 is the adsorption coefficient as expressed in eq 9 9 c a k e k c v a the expression of q a is given in eq 10 10 q a c e g the adsorption coefficients of all cases are displayed in table 5 for cases with the same type but different numbers of solid walls the adsorption coefficients were very similar however cases with different numbers of solid walls in water had various adsorption coefficients this result indicated that the adsorption coefficient was not related to the number of walls but to the properties of the solid walls 4 3 analysis between the adsorption coefficient and surface properties according to the above analysis the surface roughness and contact angle of the solid wall surface are the key factors that influence the dissipation of supersaturated tdg fig 9 shows the relation curves among the adsorption coefficients with the surface roughness and contact angle in general as the surface roughness increases the adsorption coefficient tends to increase first and then decrease the adsorption coefficient reaches the maximum surface roughness of 11 526 μm case 2 4 sandpaper 500 polynomial fitting of the relation between the adsorption coefficient and surface roughness was performed and a poor correlation of 0 7768 was obtained while the adsorption coefficient increased with increasing contact angle and exhibited a good correlation of 0 9749 based on exponential fitting studies have indicated that the contact angle of solid surfaces is mainly determined by the surface chemistry and surface roughness mchale et al 2005 therefore it is reasonable to use the contact angle of the solid surface to quantify the relationship between the surface properties and the adsorption coefficient from fig 9 the resulting expression of the adsorption coefficient and contact angle can be written as 11 c a α e β θ by employing the experimental data from 10 cases case 2 3 to case 2 6 and case 3 1 to case 3 6 the values of α and β were 0 00004 and 0 043 respectively by substituting the values above into eq 11 the formula for the adsorption coefficient can be expressed as follows 12 c a 0 00004 e 0 043 θ eq 12 is used to calculate the adsorption coefficient of the rest of the cases case 2 1 to case 2 2 and case 3 7 to case 3 9 and a comparison of the adsorption coefficient calculated with eq 12 and the adsorption coefficient determined in the experimental research is displayed in fig 10 almost all points fall around the x y line which indicates that the adsorption coefficient calculated with the fitting formula in eq 12 is approximately the same as the adsorption coefficient determined in the experimental research in addition error analysis was performed the mean error η mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and standard deviation std were 0 00004 m h 1 0 5 0 00022 m h 1 and 0 00022 respectively additionally the coefficient of determination r2 of eq 12 between the fitted and experimental values of the adsorption coefficient was 0 83 with good significance these analyses demonstrate that eq 12 can be used to accurately calculate the adsorption coefficient 5 conclusions experiments on the supersaturated tdg dissipation process considering the adsorption effects of fifteen kinds of solid walls with various surface properties were performed in this paper the adsorption mechanism related to the tdg adsorption capacity of a solid wall was investigated the effects of the surface roughness and contact angle on the adsorption coefficient were discussed a formula was proposed for predicting the adsorption coefficient specifically the surface roughness and contact angle were found to be the key factors that influence the adsorption effect of a solid wall on supersaturated tdg dissipation in general the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg first increased and then decreased with increasing surface roughness the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg increased monotonically with increasing contact angle an improved adsorption model was proposed considering the influence of the water volume on the tdg adsorption effect of a solid wall the adsorption coefficient is independent of the solid wall configuration and depends only on the surface properties especially the surface roughness and hydrophobicity contact angle the prediction formula constructed for the adsorption coefficient and contact angle can be expressed as c a 0 00004 e 0 043 θ the results presented in this paper provide theoretical support for the utilization of solid wall adsorption effects to mitigate the adverse effects of supersaturated tdg and protect fish in the next phase of study it is necessary to research the adsorption capacity of solid walls under flowing conditions additionally the adsorption effect of practical materials such as vegetation should be studied to construct an adsorption coefficient database and to complement the adsorption model

17781,the ultraviolet chlorine uv cl2 process is an emerging advanced oxidation technology for micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment however the application of the conventional uv cl2 process in decentralized systems is limited by the transport and management of liquid chlorine to overcome this limitation this study evaluated an electrochemically driven uv cl2 e uv cl2 process for micropollutant abatement under conditions simulating decentralized water treatment the e uv cl2 process combines uv irradiation with in situ electrochemical cl2 production from anodic oxidation of chloride cl in source waters the results show that with typical cl concentrations present in water sources for decentralized systems 30 300 mg l cl sufficient amounts of chlorine could be quickly electrochemically produced at the anode to enable e uv cl2 process for water treatment due to its multiple mechanisms for micropollutant abatement direct photolysis direct electrolysis cl2 mediated oxidation as well as hydroxyl radical and reactive chlorine species oxidation the e uv cl2 process effectively eliminated all micropollutants trimethoprim ciprofloxacin metoprolol and carbamazepine spiked in a surface water in 5 min in contrast at least one micropollutant with 20 80 residual concentrations could still be detected in the water treated by 10 min of uv irradiation chlorination electrolysis and the conventional uv cl2 process under similar experimental conditions the electrical energy per order eeo for micropollutant abatement ranged from 0 15 to 1 8 kwh m3 for the e uv cl2 process which is generally comparable to that for the conventional uv cl2 process 0 14 2 7 kwh m3 these results suggest that by in situ generating cl2 from anodic oxidation of cl the e uv cl2 process can overcome the barrier of the conventional uv cl2 process and thus provide a promising technology for micropollutant abatement in decentralized water treatment systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process decentralized water treatment pharmaceutical uv chlorine 1 introduction over the past decades the growing gap between water demand and conventional water supply has led to a rethinking of the current centralized water infrastructure in many regions hodges et al 2018 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 one emerging solution to supplement the insufficient conventional water supply involves decentralized water treatment systems that can exploit alternative water sources such as grey water and municipal wastewater effluent however these alternative water sources are often contaminated with various trace organic pollutants micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals consumer products and pesticides to minimize their potential risks to human health micropollutants have to be sufficiently removed from the water sources prior to potable non potable reuse barazesh et al 2015 von gunten 2018 in this regard advanced oxidation processes aops have been considered potential treatment options for micropollutant removal in decentralized water treatment hodges et al 2018 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 von gunten 2018 while conventional aops e g o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 have been successfully applied in full scale centralized water systems for decades they do not fit well in decentralized systems due to the need of chemical transport and storage barazesh et al 2015 von gunten 2018 in contrast electricity driven processes such as uv irradiation and electrochemical production of oxidants e g oh cl2 and h2o2 can avoid chemical management and therefore are particularly suitable for decentralized systems chaplin 2019 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 von gunten 2018 meanwhile the flexibility robustness and modular design of electricity driven processes also make them attractive for decentralized water treatment barazesh et al 2015 chaplin 2019 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 therefore it has been expected that electricity based processes may bear a huge potential in future decentralized water treatment systems hodges et al 2018 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 von gunten 2018 recently the uv chlorine uv cl2 process has emerged as a promising aop option for micropollutant removal in water and wastewater treatment guo et al 2018 jin et al 2011 remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2016 the uv photolysis of free chlorine hocl ocl can lead to the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh and a suite of reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 which can in turn oxidize uv and or chlorine resistant micropollutants therefore the uv cl2 process can considerably enhance micropollutant abatement compared to individual uv photolysis and chlorination guo et al 2018 pan et al 2017 remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2019 xiang et al 2016 nevertheless the need of transporting and managing liquid chlorine limits the application of the conventional uv cl2 process in decentralized systems to overcome this limitation we proposed in situ chlorine production from anodic chloride cl oxidation for the application of the uv cl2 technology in decentralized water systems in this study cl is a ubiquitous halide ion in almost all water matrices including the alterative water sources proposed for decentralized systems therefore this approach may offer a simple way to circumvent the barrier of the uv cl2 technology for decentralized water treatment in previous studies electrochemical production of cl2 followed by uv irradiation has been investigated for phenol and 1 4 dioxane removal from their synthetic solutions and for ammonia removal from landfill leachate hurwitz et al 2014 kishimoto et al 2018 xiao et al 2009 ye et al 2016 the high cl concentrations in the synthetic solutions and leachate 890 3000 mg l facilitate electrochemical chlorine production which then enhances substantially the removal of target pollutants during uv irradiation however cl is typically present at considerably lower

2017 sanchez et al 2010 yao et al 2016 yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 moreover the previous studies focused on the removal of high concentrations of model compounds in their synthetic solutions e g 88 mg l of 1 4 dioxane in sodium chloride electrolytes the feasibility of electrochemical chlorine generation at cl concentrations relevant to decentralized water treatment and its effect on micropollutant removal in real water matrix have yet to be investigated the objective of this study was to evaluate an electrochemically driven uv cl2 refer to as e uv cl2 hereafter process that combines uv irradiation with in situ electrochemical production of cl2 for micropollutant removal under conditions simulating decentralized water treatment a surface water was spiked with several micropollutants that have varying uv and chlorine reactivities then treated by uv irradiation electrolysis e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 process the performance of the different processes was compared in terms of micropollutant abatement efficiency energy consumption and chlorinated by product formation the mechanisms of micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process were assessed using a chemical kinetic approach the effects of important process and water parameters electrodes current densities and cl concentrations of the e uv cl2 were then evaluated systematically 2

electrolysis alone and the e uv cl2 process for 10 min see fig 1 for the experimental setup for uv irradiation experiments a low pressure uv lamp gph265t5l 4 heraeus emitting primarily 254 nm uv light was installed in the center of the reactor the average uv fluence rate was measured to be 0 87 mw cm 2 using the iodide iodate chemical actinometry frangos et al 2016 rahn 1997 for electrolysis experiments a pair of electrodes with an inter electrode gap of 1 cm were installed vertically in the reactor the anode was a ruthenium and iridium oxide coated titanium ruo2 iro2 ti plate 4 cm 12 cm and the cathode was a stainless steel ss plate 4 cm 12 cm electrolysis treatments were conducted under galvanostatic conditions with varying currents of 200 800 ma corresponding to current densities of 4 2 16 7 ma cm2 eq 1 1 j i s where j is the applied current density ma cm2 i is the applied current ma and s is the area of electrode cm2 for the e uv cl2 treatments both the uv lamp and electrodes

sodium sulfite the test micropollutants were then analyzed with an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry api 3200 lc ms ms system applied biosystems see supporting information si text s1 and table s1 for analytical details guo et al 2017 trihalomethanes thms including trichloro bromodichloro dibromochloro and tribromomethanes tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm were extracted

using an ion chromatograph ics 1100 thermo dionex with a conductivity detector 3 results and discussion 3 1 electro generation of chlorine fig 2 shows that during electrolysis and the e uv cl2 process the concentrations of free chlorine hocl ocl increased continuously in the surface water added with 30 300 mg l cl these observations indicate that cl is stably oxidized at the ruo2 iro2 ti anode surface to form cl2 which then quickly hydrolyzes to yield free chlorine eqs 2 and 3 martinez huitle et al 2015 k c l 2 h 2 o 28 6 s 1 wang and margerum 1994 in the water with increasing the initial concentration of cl from 30 to 300 mg l 3 9 29 3 mg l free chlorine accumulated in the surface water after 10 min of electrolysis alone fig 2 this observation indicates that the rate of anodic oxidation of cl to cl2 is mass transfer limited under the test conditions and thus increases with increasing cl concentrations for a given initial cl concentration the concentrations of free chlorine accumulated during the e uv cl2 process were generally 30 lower than those during electrolysis alone these differences suggest that 30 of the electrochemically generated free chlorine is then photolyzed by uv irradiation during the e uv cl2 process as shown in si fig s1 chlorine decomposition by uv photolysis followed pseudo first order kinetics therefore with more chlorine being electrochemically produced at higher cl concentrations the rate of ensuing photolysis of free chlorine to oh and rcs also increases guo et al 2018 xiang et al 2016 2 2 c l 2 e c l 2 3 c l 2 h 2 o h c l h o c l fig 2 evolution of free chlorine concentrations during electrolysis and the e uv cl2 treatment of the selected surface water reaction conditions volume 700 ml current 400 ma uv power 10 w uv fluence rate 0 87 mw cm 2 the results shown in fig 2 suggest that anodic oxidation of cl can possibly offer a feasible way to produce cl2 on site for applying the uv cl2 technology in decentralized water treatment systems for instance the conventional uv cl2 process typically involves adding 1 6 mg l of free chlorine in the water followed by 5 20 min uv irradiation guo et al 2018 remucal and manley 2016 yang et al 2016 in comparison fig 2 shows that 2 0 14 6 mg l of free chlorine could be quickly produced in 5 min during electrolysis of the water containing 30 300 mg l cl these data confirm that sufficient amounts of chlorine can be quickly electrochemically produced at typical cl concentrations present in water sources for decentralized systems sanchez et al 2010 yu et al 2013 therefore the electrochemical cl2 generation can avoid the transport and storage of chlorine stocks thus enabling the e uv cl2 process for decentralized water treatment 3 2 comparison of uv chlorination electrolysis e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 3 2 1 micropollutant abatement to evaluate the effectiveness of the e uv cl2 process for micropollutant abatement four model compounds that have differing uv chlorine and electrochemical reactivity were spiked in the surface water cl 100 mg l followed by the e uv cl2 treatment for comparison the water was also treated by uv irradiation chlorination electrolysis and conventional uv cl2 process under similar reaction conditions see fig 3 in general all spiked micropollutants were eliminated to below their detection limits within 5 min of the e uv cl2 process fig 3d in contrast at least one micropollutant could be still detected in the water after 10 min of the other four processes fig 3a c and e this finding highlights that the e uv cl2 process may provide an effective way to abate micropollutants with different properties see discussion below among the four test compounds carbamazepine metoprolol and trimethoprim are resistant to uv photolysis due to their low uv absorbance and or quantum yield whereas ciprofloxacin is uv reactive see table 1 therefore only ciprofloxacin was effectively abated with 10 min of uv irradiation treatment while the other three compounds were abated by generally 20 fig 3a as reported in table 1 ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim are highly and moderately reactive with free chlorine whereas carbamazepine and metoprolol are inactive with free chlorine consequently ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were quickly eliminated in 1 and 5 min during chlorination fig 3b in contrast only 20 abatement efficiencies were obtained for carbamazepine and metoprolol after 10 min of chlorination during electrolysis pollutants can be abated by direct electron transfer to the anode i e direct electrolysis and or mediated oxidation by electrochemically generated oxidizing species such as oh and chlorine i e indirect electrolysis panizza and cerisola 2009 the ruo2 iro2 ti anode used in this study has a high activity for chlorine evolution but low activity for oh production from water discharge chaplin 2014 panizza and cerisola 2009 therefore it is expected that pollutants are mainly abated by direct electrolysis and or oxidation with free chlorine cl2 mediated oxidation during electrolysis with the ruo2 iro2 ti anode barazesh et al 2016 jasper et al 2016 fig 3c shows that ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were quickly eliminated in 2 and 3 min during chlorination and electrolysis cl 0 100 mg l where as carbamazepine and metoprolol required much longer electrolysis time to eliminate 10 min note that while carbamazepine and metoprolol have the similar chlorine reactivity table 1 carbamazepine was eliminated considerably faster than metoprolol during electrolysis this difference suggests that carbamazepine is more electrochemically reactive than metoprolol and can thus be more quickly abated by direct electron transfer at the anode during the electrolysis process besides the aforementioned abatement mechanisms uv photolysis of electrochemically generated free chlorine can produce a variety of radicals including oh cl clo and cl2 in the e uv cl2 system kishimoto et al 2018 remucal and manley 2016 oh is a non selective oxidant and can oxidize almost all organics at nearly diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 on the other hand cl and other rcs are selective oxidants and react preferentially with organics that have electron rich moieties remucal and manley 2016 rationally oh and rcs can also participate in the oxidation of micropollutants during the e uv cl2 process thus resulting in different extent of enhancement for the abatement of the four test compounds compared to uv irradiation and electrolysis see fig 3a c d the most significant enhancement is observed for metoprolol which was quickly eliminated in 4 min during the e uv cl2 process but only gradually abated during uv irradiation chlorination and electrolysis in comparison the enhancement is less significant for ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim since they could already be quickly abated by electrolysis alone for carbamazepine which was abated at a moderate rate during electrolysis eliminated in 10 min moderate enhancement was obtained for its abatement during the e uv cl2 process eliminated in 5 min these observations suggest that the e uv cl2 process is most beneficial for enhancing the removal of micropollutants that have low uv electrochemical and chlorine reactivities and thus resistant to uv irradiation chlorination and electrolysis treatment e g metoprolol fig 3d shows that the e uv cl2 process completely abated all four test compounds within 5 min according to fig 1 6 mg l free chlorine could be electrochemically generated from the anodic oxidation of cl during 5 min of electrolysis of the surface water therefore 6 mg l free chlorine was added in the surface water followed by 10 min of uv irradiation for the conventional uv cl2 treatment due to photolysis free chlorine concentrations decreased logarithmically during the conventional uv cl2 process which is in contrast to the gradual increase of free chlorine concentrations during the e uv cl2 process see fig 4 a because of the higher initial concentration of free chlorine higher chlorine exposures ct were obtained in the first 5 min of the conventional uv cl2 process compared with the e uv cl2 process fig 4b corresponding to the high initial ct ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were quickly eliminated in 1 min during the conventional uv cl2 process fig 3d and e in addition metoprolol was also effectively eliminated in 4 min however carbamazepine was abated at a considerably slower rate during the uv cl2 process consequently 18 residual concentrations of carbamazepine could still be detected in the water after 10 min of the uv cl2 treatment these observations are consistent with the previous findings that carbamazepine is usually less efficiently removed by the conventional uv cl2 process compared to the other three test compounds guo et al 2018 yang et al 2016 3 2 2 mechanisms of micropollutant abatement during electrolysis uv cl2 and e uv cl2 according to the mechanisms of micropollutant abatement during the electrolysis uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes the kinetics of micropollutant abatement during the three processes can be described using eqs 4 6 respectively 4 d p d t k d e p k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e p 5 d p d t k u v p k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e p k o h o h p k c l c l p k c l 2 c l 2 p k c l o c l o p 6 d p d t

and direct uv photolysis respectively k chlorine k oh k cl k c l 2 and k clo are the second order rate constants for the reaction of micropollutant with chlorine oh cl cl2 and clo respectively 7 l n p p 0 k d e t k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e d t 8 l n p p 0 k u v t k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e d t k o h o h d t k c l c l d t k c l 2 c l 2 d t k c l o c l o d t 9 l n p p 0 k d e t k u v t

chlorine concentrations over a given reaction period during the electrolysis process see fig 4 based on the chlorine exposures and micropollutant abatement efficiencies observed during the electrolysis process the rate constants for micropollutant abatement by direct electrolysis k de can be obtained by fitting the data using eq 7 see si fig s2 thus the relative contribution of direct electrolysis and oxidation with chlorine to micropollutant abatement fe and fchlorine during the electrolysis process can be estimated using eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 f d e k d e t l n p p 0 11 f c h l o r i n e k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e d t l n p p 0 as shown in fig 5 a due to its high chlorine reactivity ciprofloxacin was abated almost exclusively by chlorine oxidation 100 during the electrolysis process in contrast direct electrolysis dominated the mechanisms of trimethoprim carbamazepine and metoprolol abatement during the process theoretically the contribution of photolysis electrolysis oxidation with chlorine oh and each rcs for micropollutant abatement during the uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes can also be estimated using the similar approach for example the contribution of uv photolysis for micropollutant abatement during the uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes can be estimated using eq 12 12 f u v k u v t l n p p 0 where k uv is the pseudo first order rate constant observed for micropollutant abatement during uv photolysis si table s2 however due to the difficulty in following the concentrations of oh and rcs the exposures of these radicals cannot be obtained during the uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes guo et al 2018 kishimoto et al 2018 therefore it is impossible to calculate the respective contribution of each radical to micropollutant abatement for the two processes alternatively the overall contribution of oh and rcs fr to micropollutant abatement during the uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes are collectively estimated as fr using eqs 13 and 14 respectively 13 f r 1 f u v f c h l o r i n e 14 f r 1 f d e f u v f c h l o r i n e fig 5b shows that during the conventional uv cl2 process ciprofloxacin was mainly abated by oxidation with free chlorine in contrast the other three micropollutants trimethoprim metoprolol and carbamazepine were abated primarily by the radicals oh and rcs generated from chlorine photolysis during the uv cl2 process oh and or cl are usually considered the main radicals for pollutant degradation fang et al 2014 remucal and manley 2016 xiang et al 2016 meanwhile other rcs such as cl2 can contribute non negligibly to the abatement of some compounds that have high reactivity with the specific rcs kishimoto et al 2018 remucal and manley 2016 under the test conditions of this study cl 100 mg l the equilibrium concentration of clo2 is estimated to be 116 times that of cl calculated based on the equilibrium constant of reversible reaction eq 15 kishimoto et al 2018 on the other hand the rate constants for the reaction of metoprolol and trimethoprim with clo2 are about 1 34 and 1 11 of those with cl of their k cl respectively see table 1 this information suggests that clo2 may play an even more important role than cl for metoprolol and trimethoprim abatement during the uv cl2 process this also explains the slower abatement of carbamazepine than metoprolol during the uv cl2 process fig 3e while both compounds have generally the similar oh cl and clo rate constants the clo2 rate constant of carbamazepine is significantly lower than that of metoprolol table 1 15 c l c l c l 2 k 1 c l 2 c l c l 5 9 10 4 m 1 compared with the electrolysis and uv cl2 processes the e uv cl2 process considerably accelerated the abatement of metoprolol and carbamazepine respectively fig 3c e as shown in fig 5c metoprolol was mainly abated by oxidation with oh and rcs during the e uv cl2 process this finding suggests that photolysis of electro generated chlorine to the radicals is the main mechanism for the accelerated metoprolol abatement in the e uv cl2 process on the other hand the e uv cl2 process accelerated carbamazepine abatement than the uv cl2 process probably by mainly the direct electrolysis mechanism which contributed 78 of carbamazepine abatement during the e uv cl2 process overall the above comparisons indicate that the e uv cl2 process successfully combines different mechanisms uv photolysis direct electrolysis chlorine mediated oxidation as well as oh and rcs oxidation for micropollutant abatement therefore it considerably enhanced the abatement of test compounds that were less effectively removed by the other processes these results suggest that the e uv cl2 process may provide a promising treatment option to ensure the effective removal of various micropollutants that coexist in water sources 3 2 3 energy consumption the electrical energy demand to abate the concentration of micropollutants by 1 order of magnitude in 1 m3 of water i e electrical energy per order eeo kwh m3 log by the uv electrolysis uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes are calculated using eqs 16 19 bolton et al 2001 and compared in fig 6 the eeo for micropollutant abatement by chlorination was not calculated because with the applied chlorine dose 6 mg l the concentrations of metoprolol and carbamazepine can only be abated by less than 40 the eeo shown in fig 6 consists of two parts i the energy consumption for uv irradiation and electrolysis operation and ii the equivalent energy consumption for chlorine doses which is calculated based on the market price of calcium hypochlorite 1000 t and the average electricity cost 12 cent kwh in the u s guo et al 2018 the cost of nacl was not included in the calculation due to its low price 0 07 usd kg and low dosage added in the water 100 mg l cl as well as the possibility of using background cl in the water sources of decentralized systems e g grey water and municipal wastewater for chlorine production

energy demand for chlorine dose 0 851 kwh mol guo et al 2018 as shown in fig 6 different amounts of energy were required to abate the test compounds by the four processes in general the eeo value for the abatement of a given micropollutant by uv irradiation is significantly higher than that by the other three processes this observation indicates that uv irradiation alone is not an energy efficient way to abate micropollutants especially uv resistant micropollutants barazesh et al 2015 miklos et al 2018 for the other three processes the eeo values varied considerably for the four test compounds due to their different uv and electrochemical reactivity specifically metoprolol required the largest amount of energy to abate by electrolysis whereas carbamazepine required the largest amounts of energy to abate by the e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 processes the results shown in fig 6 indicate that due to their different physicochemical properties different amounts of energy are required to abate the varying micropollutants by a specific process to ensure the effective abatement of various micropollutants that coexist in a water source e g 90 abatement for each micropollutant the energy consumption required for a specific process will be determined by the micropollutants that are the slowest removed during the process e g metoprolol for electrolysis and carbamazepine for the e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 processes see fig 6 overall for the four test compounds the e uv cl2 process required 1 8 kwh m3 energy to abate their concentration by 90 in the surface water this value is 5 33 smaller than that for electrolysis 1 9 kwh m3 the conventional uv cl2 process 2 7 kwh m3 and more than one order of magnitude smaller than that for uv irradiation alone 24 9 kwh m3 these data suggest that the e uv cl2 process can be a competitive technology for micropollutant abatement in term of energy efficiency 3 2 4 formation of halogenated by products the formation of halogenated by products is a major concern associated with the electrochemical processes as well as the uv cl2 process for water treatment and wastewater reuse radjenovic and sedlak 2015 remucal and manley 2016 von gunten 2018 fig 7 a shows the concentration of thms detected in the selected surface water when the concentration of carbamazepine which is the most resistant to e uv cl2 treatment among the tested compounds was removed by 90 during the different treatment processes for the same degree of micropollutant removal 8 5 μg l of thms was detected in the surface water treated by uv irradiation whereas 24 29 μg l of thms were detected for the electrolysis e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 processes these observations indicate that uv irradiation generates insignificant amounts of organic halogenated by products during the treatment in contrast due to the involvement of chlorine and or rcs in the treatment process the electrolysis e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 process will generate certain concentrations of halogenated by products the concentrations of thms increased slightly in the order of e uv cl2 electrolysis and conventional uv cl2 process fig 7a which can be possibly attributed to the different chlorine exposures attained when 90 of carbamazepine abatement was achieved during the three processes 9 6 18 and 20 mm s at 5 6 and 11 min of the e uv cl2 electrolysis and uv cl2 process respectively besides halogenated organics the electrochemical and uv cl2 processes can generate some inorganic halogenated by products such as chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and bromate bro3 during water treatment radjenovic and sedlak 2015 remucal and manley 2016 due to the low concentration of bromide in the selected surface water 24 μg l see table 2 insignificant concentrations of bro3 generally 8 μg l were formed in all processes which are lower than the drinking water standard for bro3 10 μg l in many countries usepa 1998 who 2011 in addition clo2 was not detected in this study because of its short lifetime and analytical sensitivity lin et al 2016 remucal and manley 2016 however 0 26 1 08 mg l clo3 were detected in the water when 90 of carbamazepine was abated during the electrolysis uv cl2 and e uv cl2 process see fig 7b note that although clo3 is currently not a regulated dbp the world health organization recommends a guideline value of 0 7 mg l for drinking water due to its potential adverse health effects who 2011 during the e uv cl2 process clo3 can be formed from both the stepwise electrochemical oxidation of cl at the anode as what occurs during the electrolysis process lin et al 2016 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 and the photolysis of chlorine and ensuing radical reactions involving cl oh and rcs as what occur during the conventional uv cl2 process remucal and manley 2016 nevertheless due to the considerably shorter treatment time required to abate 90 of carbamazepine by the e uv cl2 process 5 min than the conventional uv cl2 process 11 min significantly less clo3 was formed during the e uv cl2 process than the conventional uv cl2 process fig 7b overall the results shown in fig 7 indicate that the concentrations of halogenated by products detected in the e uv cl2 treated water are still considerably lower than the drinking water standard or guideline value e g 80 μg l for thms and 0 7 mg l for clo3 usepa 1998 who 2011 even when a high abatement efficiency 90 has been achieved for the most resistant micropollutant these observations suggest that by carefully controlling treatment conditions e g chlorine concentration and treatment time the formation of halogenated by products may not be a serious concern for the application of the e uv cl2 process in decentralized water treatment systems 3 3 effect of process and water parameters on micropollutant abatement 3 3 1 anode materials the results shown in figs 2 and 3 suggest that uv photolysis of electro generated free chlorine to oh and rcs plays a critical role in enhancing the abatement of micropollutants that are resistant to individual uv and electrolysis treatment e g metoprolol to further evaluate this mechanism we replaced the ruo2 iro2 ti anode with a platinum coated ti pt ti anode and repeated the electrolysis and e uv cl2 treatment of the surface water unlike ruo2 and iro2 pt is ineffective at electrochemically oxidizing cl to cl2 panizza and cerisola 2009 indeed si fig s3 shows that free chlorine concentrations were almost undetectable during electrolysis with the pt ti anode but increased continuously during electrolysis with the reaching 13 3 mg l at 10 min corresponding to this difference insignificant enhancement was observed for micropollutant abatement when uv irradiation was combined with electrolysis using the pt ti anode fig 8 in contrast to what have been observed for the e uv cl2 process using the ruo2 iro2 ti anode fig 3 these observations confirm that the electrochemical production of cl2 is critical for the synergistic effect on micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process therefore anodes with high chlorine evolution activity should be used in the e uv cl2 process 3 3 2 applied currents fig 9 a shows that with increasing applied currents from 200 to 800 ma faster removal of carbamazepine was obtained during the e uv cl2 treatment of the surface water see si fig s4 for the other test compounds due to its low initial concentration 100 μg l the rate of carbamazepine abatement by direct electron transfer to the anode is mass transfer limited under the tested current densities 4 2 16 7 ma cm2 chaplin 2014 therefore the increase of currents will not considerably enhance carbamazepine abatement by direct electrolysis barazesh et al 2016 jasper et al 2016 however the increase of currents increased almost linearly the rate of chlorine evolution resulting in higher concentrations of free chlorine in the surface water see si fig s5 as photolysis of free chlorine follows pseudo first order kinetics see si fig s1 the rates of oh and rcs production increase proportionally with the free chlorine concentrations guo et al 2018 pan et al 2017 thus leading to the accelerated abatement of carbamazepine at higher applied currents fig 9a while increasing applied currents accelerated electrochemical chlorine production it also increased the cell voltage see si table s3 as a result the energy consumption for chlorine production increased from 0 078 to 0 15 kwh g cl2 as applied currents were increased from 200 to 800 ma see si for detailed calculations for carbamazepine and trimethoprim abatement the increase in energy consumption for electrochemical chlorine production was well compensated by the decrease in energy consumption for uv irradiation due to their faster abatement at higher currents see figs 7a and si fig s4a consequently the eeo values for carbamazepine and trimethoprim abatement decreased considerably as applied currents were increased from 200 to 400 800 ma during the e uv cl2 process fig 7b in contrast the eeo value for metoprolol abatement exhibited an inflection point at 400 ma while the eeo value for ciprofloxacin abatement increased monotonically with increasing applied currents because they could already be quickly abated at 200 400 ma overall the results shown in fig 9 suggest that there exists a marginal benefit associated with applying higher currents for chlorine production in the e uv cl2 process therefore applied currents need to be carefully controlled to balance the kinetics and energy efficiency for micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process 3 3 3 chloride concentrations fig 10 a shows that as the initial cl concentration in the surface water was increased from 30 to 300 mg l carbamazepine was more rapidly abated during the e uv cl2 process in addition the abatement of other test compounds was also accelerated to varied extent see si fig s6 accompanied with the faster abatement kinetics the eeo values for test compound abatement decreased considerably at higher cl concentrations fig 10b the results shown in fig 10 indicate that higher cl concentrations are beneficial for enhancing the kinetics and energy efficiency for micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process these enhancements can be mainly attributed to the enhanced electrochemical chlorine production at higher cl concentrations as shown in fig 2 with increasing initial cl concentrations free chlorine accumulated more quickly in the surface water during electrolysis this in turn accelerates the rate of oh and rcs production from chlorine photolysis consequently micropollutants can be more quickly abate by the oxidation with free chlorine oh and rcs during the e uv cl2 process with higher cl concentrations due to the faster abatement kinetics at higher cl concentrations shorter treatment time is required for micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process see fig 10a this reduced the energy consumption of uv irradiation considerably fig 10b in addition the energy consumption for electrochemical chlorine production also decreased considerably with increasing cl concentration e g from 0 43 to 0 024 kwh g cl2 as the initial cl concentration was increased from 30 to 300 mg l see si table s3 consequently the eeo values for test compound abatement were substantially reduced during the e uv cl2 process at higher cl concentrations 3 4 practical implications this study demonstrates that the e uv cl2 process may provide an attractive technology for decentralized water treatment in terms of the effectiveness for micropollutant abatement energy consumption and by product formation with chloride concentrations 30 300 mg l typically found in the alternative water sources for decentralized systems chlorine can be electrochemically produced on site and on demand to enable the e uv cl2 process for micropollutant abatement the electrochemical chlorine production avoids the transport and management of liquid chlorine which enhances the flexibility of the process for decentralized water treatment under the tested conditions the e uv cl2 system could process 200 l water per day 700 ml water at a treatment time of 5 min and effectively eliminated micropollutants that are resistant to conventional uv and electrochemical treatment the energy consumption of the e uv cl2 process for micropollutant removal is generally comparable to the conventional uv cl2 process fig 6 the residual chlorine in the effluent can provide disinfection in the distributed systems in addition the e uv cl2 system has a simple modular configuration and uses durable low cost chlorine evolution electrodes e g ruo2 iro2 ti the treatment process is driven by electricity and can be flexibly controlled by adjusting currents these favorable characteristics of the e uv cl2 system facilitate the scale up maintenance and operation of the e uv cl2 system for decentralized water treatment at a household and community level based on the promising results shown herein additional studies will be carried out to further optimize the e uv cl2 process and evaluate its performance in pilot systems in addition more studies are needed to evaluate the toxicological consequences of water treatment by the e uv cl2 process to assess the overall benefits of the technology 4 conclusions this proof of concept study introduces the electrochemically driven uv cl2 e uv cl2 process as a promising technology for micropollutant abatement in decentralized water treatment systems by electrochemically producing chlorine from the anodic oxidation of chloride present in source waters the e uv cl2 process avoids the use of chlorine stocks and thus overcomes the main barrier of the conventional uv cl2 process for decentralized systems owing to the multiple abatement mechanisms of the e uv cl2 process micropollutants with varied properties could be effectively abated in short treatment time with acceptable energy consumption the concentrations of chlorinated by products could be controlled below the drinking water standards when high abatement efficiencies had been achieved for the test compounds during the e uv cl2 process these results suggest that the e uv cl2 process may provide a competitive technology for micropollutant abatement in decentralized

17781,the ultraviolet chlorine uv cl2 process is an emerging advanced oxidation technology for micropollutant abatement in water and wastewater treatment however the application of the conventional uv cl2 process in decentralized systems is limited by the transport and management of liquid chlorine to overcome this limitation this study evaluated an electrochemically driven uv cl2 e uv cl2 process for micropollutant abatement under conditions simulating decentralized water treatment the e uv cl2 process combines uv irradiation with in situ electrochemical cl2 production from anodic oxidation of chloride cl in source waters the results show that with typical cl concentrations present in water sources for decentralized systems 30 300 mg l cl sufficient amounts of chlorine could be quickly electrochemically produced at the anode to enable e uv cl2 process for water treatment due to its multiple mechanisms for micropollutant abatement direct photolysis direct electrolysis cl2 mediated oxidation as well as hydroxyl radical and reactive chlorine species oxidation the e uv cl2 process effectively eliminated all micropollutants trimethoprim ciprofloxacin metoprolol and carbamazepine spiked in a surface water in 5 min in contrast at least one micropollutant with 20 80 residual concentrations could still be detected in the water treated by 10 min of uv irradiation chlorination electrolysis and the conventional uv cl2 process under similar experimental conditions the electrical energy per order eeo for micropollutant abatement ranged from 0 15 to 1 8 kwh m3 for the e uv cl2 process which is generally comparable to that for the conventional uv cl2 process 0 14 2 7 kwh m3 these results suggest that by in situ generating cl2 from anodic oxidation of cl the e uv cl2 process can overcome the barrier of the conventional uv cl2 process and thus provide a promising technology for micropollutant abatement in decentralized water treatment systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation process decentralized water treatment pharmaceutical uv chlorine 1 introduction over the past decades the growing gap between water demand and conventional water supply has led to a rethinking of the current centralized water infrastructure in many regions hodges et al 2018 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 one emerging solution to supplement the insufficient conventional water supply involves decentralized water treatment systems that can exploit alternative water sources such as grey water and municipal wastewater effluent however these alternative water sources are often contaminated with various trace organic pollutants micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals consumer products and pesticides to minimize their potential risks to human health micropollutants have to be sufficiently removed from the water sources prior to potable non potable reuse barazesh et al 2015 von gunten 2018 in this regard advanced oxidation processes aops have been considered potential treatment options for micropollutant removal in decentralized water treatment hodges et al 2018 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 von gunten 2018 while conventional aops e g o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 have been successfully applied in full scale centralized water systems for decades they do not fit well in decentralized systems due to the need of chemical transport and storage barazesh et al 2015 von gunten 2018 in contrast electricity driven processes such as uv irradiation and electrochemical production of oxidants e g oh cl2 and h2o2 can avoid chemical management and therefore are particularly suitable for decentralized systems chaplin 2019 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 von gunten 2018 meanwhile the flexibility robustness and modular design of electricity driven processes also make them attractive for decentralized water treatment barazesh et al 2015 chaplin 2019 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 therefore it has been expected that electricity based processes may bear a huge potential in future decentralized water treatment systems hodges et al 2018 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 von gunten 2018 recently the uv chlorine uv cl2 process has emerged as a promising aop option for micropollutant removal in water and wastewater treatment guo et al 2018 jin et al 2011 remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2016 the uv photolysis of free chlorine hocl ocl can lead to the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh and a suite of reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 which can in turn oxidize uv and or chlorine resistant micropollutants therefore the uv cl2 process can considerably enhance micropollutant abatement compared to individual uv photolysis and chlorination guo et al 2018 pan et al 2017 remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2019 xiang et al 2016 nevertheless the need of transporting and managing liquid chlorine limits the application of the conventional uv cl2 process in decentralized systems to overcome this limitation we proposed in situ chlorine production from anodic chloride cl oxidation for the application of the uv cl2 technology in decentralized water systems in this study cl is a ubiquitous halide ion in almost all water matrices including the alterative water sources proposed for decentralized systems therefore this approach may offer a simple way to circumvent the barrier of the uv cl2 technology for decentralized water treatment in previous studies electrochemical production of cl2 followed by uv irradiation has been investigated for phenol and 1 4 dioxane removal from their synthetic solutions and for ammonia removal from landfill leachate hurwitz et al 2014 kishimoto et al 2018 xiao et al 2009 ye et al 2016 the high cl concentrations in the synthetic solutions and leachate 890 3000 mg l facilitate electrochemical chlorine production which then enhances substantially the removal of target pollutants during uv irradiation however cl is typically present at considerably lower concentrations in the alternative water sources proposed for decentralized systems e g ranging from several tens to a few hundreds of mg l in grey water and municipal wastewater effluent lian et al 2017 sanchez et al 2010 yao et al 2016 yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 moreover the previous studies focused on the removal of high concentrations of model compounds in their synthetic solutions e g 88 mg l of 1 4 dioxane in sodium chloride electrolytes the feasibility of electrochemical chlorine generation at cl concentrations relevant to decentralized water treatment and its effect on micropollutant removal in real water matrix have yet to be investigated the objective of this study was to evaluate an electrochemically driven uv cl2 refer to as e uv cl2 hereafter process that combines uv irradiation with in situ electrochemical production of cl2 for micropollutant removal under conditions simulating decentralized water treatment a surface water was spiked with several micropollutants that have varying uv and chlorine reactivities then treated by uv irradiation electrolysis e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 process the performance of the different processes was compared in terms of micropollutant abatement efficiency energy consumption and chlorinated by product formation the mechanisms of micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process were assessed using a chemical kinetic approach the effects of important process and water parameters electrodes current densities and cl concentrations of the e uv cl2 were then evaluated systematically 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents carbamazepine metoprolol ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim with purity 98 were purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china and used as the model micropollutants in this study the second order rate constants for the reaction of the model micropollutants with main oxidants in the uv cl2 system hocl oh cl clo and cl2 as well as their uv254 m absorption coefficient ε 254 and quantum yield φ254 are summarized in table 1 all other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade methyl tert butyl ether mtbe was obtained from sigma aldrich usa acetonitrile was shipped from fisher scientific usa sodium chloride nacl was purchased from guangfu technology development co ltd tianjin china sodium hypochlorite solution was obtained from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china stock solutions of micropollutants were prepared with milli q ultrapure water 2 2 water sample a surface water was sampled from a lake in the suburb of beijing china then used within one week for the e uv cl2 experiments main parameters of the selected surface water are shown in table 2 the surface water had very low background concentration of the model micropollutants 1 μg l to facilitate the evaluation of micropollutant removal kinetics during treatment micropollutant stock solutions were spiked in the surface water to obtain an initial concentration of 100 μg l for each model micropollutant in addition small amounts of nacl were added in the surface water to adjust cl concentrations to 30 300 mg l which is within the typical range of cl concentrations in water sources for decentralized systems e g grey water and municipal wastewater guo et al 2018 sanchez et al 2010 yao et al 2016 yu et al 2013 2 3 uv irradiation electrolysis e uv cl2 and uv cl2 treatment of the surface water the selected surface water 700 ml was added in a cylindrical glass reactor 28 cm height and 6 5 cm inner diameter then treated by uv irradiation alone electrolysis alone and the e uv cl2 process for 10 min see fig 1 for the experimental setup for uv irradiation experiments a low pressure uv lamp gph265t5l 4 heraeus emitting primarily 254 nm uv light was installed in the center of the reactor the average uv fluence rate was measured to be 0 87 mw cm 2 using the iodide iodate chemical actinometry frangos et al 2016 rahn 1997 for electrolysis experiments a pair of electrodes with an inter electrode gap of 1 cm were installed vertically in the reactor the anode was a ruthenium and iridium oxide coated titanium ruo2 iro2 ti plate 4 cm 12 cm and the cathode was a stainless steel ss plate 4 cm 12 cm electrolysis treatments were conducted under galvanostatic conditions with varying currents of 200 800 ma corresponding to current densities of 4 2 16 7 ma cm2 eq 1 1 j i s where j is the applied current density ma cm2 i is the applied current ma and s is the area of electrode cm2 for the e uv cl2 treatments both the uv lamp and electrodes were installed in the reactor in the same way as for uv irradiation alone and electrolysis alone during the treatments the solution was vigorously agitated using a magnetic stirring bar all experiments were repeated twice and the standard deviations are shown as error bars in the figures 2 4 analytical methods free chlorine hypochlorous acid hypochlorite hocl ocl was analyzed using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method with a hach chlorine detector pocket colorimeter mao et al 2018 for micropollutant analysis water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane then quenched with sodium sulfite the test micropollutants were then analyzed with an ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry api 3200 lc ms ms system applied biosystems see supporting information si text s1 and table s1 for analytical details guo et al 2017 trihalomethanes thms including trichloro bromodichloro dibromochloro and tribromomethanes tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm were extracted with mtbe and then quantified using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector according to the usepa method 551 1 usepa 1995 chlorate clo3 chlorite clo2 and bromate bro3 ions were measured using an ion chromatograph ics 1100 thermo dionex with a conductivity detector 3 results and discussion 3 1 electro generation of chlorine fig 2 shows that during electrolysis and the e uv cl2 process the concentrations of free chlorine hocl ocl increased continuously in the surface water added with 30 300 mg l cl these observations indicate that cl is stably oxidized at the ruo2 iro2 ti anode surface to form cl2 which then quickly hydrolyzes to yield free chlorine eqs 2 and 3 martinez huitle et al 2015 k c l 2 h 2 o 28 6 s 1 wang and margerum 1994 in the water with increasing the initial concentration of cl from 30 to 300 mg l 3 9 29 3 mg l free chlorine accumulated in the surface water after 10 min of electrolysis alone fig 2 this observation indicates that the rate of anodic oxidation of cl to cl2 is mass transfer limited under the test conditions and thus increases with increasing cl concentrations for a given initial cl concentration the concentrations of free chlorine accumulated during the e uv cl2 process were generally 30 lower than those during electrolysis alone these differences suggest that 30 of the electrochemically generated free chlorine is then photolyzed by uv irradiation during the e uv cl2 process as shown in si fig s1 chlorine decomposition by uv photolysis followed pseudo first order kinetics therefore with more chlorine being electrochemically produced at higher cl concentrations the rate of ensuing photolysis of free chlorine to oh and rcs also increases guo et al 2018 xiang et al 2016 2 2 c l 2 e c l 2 3 c l 2 h 2 o h c l h o c l fig 2 evolution of free chlorine concentrations during electrolysis and the e uv cl2 treatment of the selected surface water reaction conditions volume 700 ml current 400 ma uv power 10 w uv fluence rate 0 87 mw cm 2 the results shown in fig 2 suggest that anodic oxidation of cl can possibly offer a feasible way to produce cl2 on site for applying the uv cl2 technology in decentralized water treatment systems for instance the conventional uv cl2 process typically involves adding 1 6 mg l of free chlorine in the water followed by 5 20 min uv irradiation guo et al 2018 remucal and manley 2016 yang et al 2016 in comparison fig 2 shows that 2 0 14 6 mg l of free chlorine could be quickly produced in 5 min during electrolysis of the water containing 30 300 mg l cl these data confirm that sufficient amounts of chlorine can be quickly electrochemically produced at typical cl concentrations present in water sources for decentralized systems sanchez et al 2010 yu et al 2013 therefore the electrochemical cl2 generation can avoid the transport and storage of chlorine stocks thus enabling the e uv cl2 process for decentralized water treatment 3 2 comparison of uv chlorination electrolysis e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 3 2 1 micropollutant abatement to evaluate the effectiveness of the e uv cl2 process for micropollutant abatement four model compounds that have differing uv chlorine and electrochemical reactivity were spiked in the surface water cl 100 mg l followed by the e uv cl2 treatment for comparison the water was also treated by uv irradiation chlorination electrolysis and conventional uv cl2 process under similar reaction conditions see fig 3 in general all spiked micropollutants were eliminated to below their detection limits within 5 min of the e uv cl2 process fig 3d in contrast at least one micropollutant could be still detected in the water after 10 min of the other four processes fig 3a c and e this finding highlights that the e uv cl2 process may provide an effective way to abate micropollutants with different properties see discussion below among the four test compounds carbamazepine metoprolol and trimethoprim are resistant to uv photolysis due to their low uv absorbance and or quantum yield whereas ciprofloxacin is uv reactive see table 1 therefore only ciprofloxacin was effectively abated with 10 min of uv irradiation treatment while the other three compounds were abated by generally 20 fig 3a as reported in table 1 ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim are highly and moderately reactive with free chlorine whereas carbamazepine and metoprolol are inactive with free chlorine consequently ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were quickly eliminated in 1 and 5 min during chlorination fig 3b in contrast only 20 abatement efficiencies were obtained for carbamazepine and metoprolol after 10 min of chlorination during electrolysis pollutants can be abated by direct electron transfer to the anode i e direct electrolysis and or mediated oxidation by electrochemically generated oxidizing species such as oh and chlorine i e indirect electrolysis panizza and cerisola 2009 the ruo2 iro2 ti anode used in this study has a high activity for chlorine evolution but low activity for oh production from water discharge chaplin 2014 panizza and cerisola 2009 therefore it is expected that pollutants are mainly abated by direct electrolysis and or oxidation with free chlorine cl2 mediated oxidation during electrolysis with the ruo2 iro2 ti anode barazesh et al 2016 jasper et al 2016 fig 3c shows that ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were quickly eliminated in 2 and 3 min during chlorination and electrolysis cl 0 100 mg l where as carbamazepine and metoprolol required much longer electrolysis time to eliminate 10 min note that while carbamazepine and metoprolol have the similar chlorine reactivity table 1 carbamazepine was eliminated considerably faster than metoprolol during electrolysis this difference suggests that carbamazepine is more electrochemically reactive than metoprolol and can thus be more quickly abated by direct electron transfer at the anode during the electrolysis process besides the aforementioned abatement mechanisms uv photolysis of electrochemically generated free chlorine can produce a variety of radicals including oh cl clo and cl2 in the e uv cl2 system kishimoto et al 2018 remucal and manley 2016 oh is a non selective oxidant and can oxidize almost all organics at nearly diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 on the other hand cl and other rcs are selective oxidants and react preferentially with organics that have electron rich moieties remucal and manley 2016 rationally oh and rcs can also participate in the oxidation of micropollutants during the e uv cl2 process thus resulting in different extent of enhancement for the abatement of the four test compounds compared to uv irradiation and electrolysis see fig 3a c d the most significant enhancement is observed for metoprolol which was quickly eliminated in 4 min during the e uv cl2 process but only gradually abated during uv irradiation chlorination and electrolysis in comparison the enhancement is less significant for ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim since they could already be quickly abated by electrolysis alone for carbamazepine which was abated at a moderate rate during electrolysis eliminated in 10 min moderate enhancement was obtained for its abatement during the e uv cl2 process eliminated in 5 min these observations suggest that the e uv cl2 process is most beneficial for enhancing the removal of micropollutants that have low uv electrochemical and chlorine reactivities and thus resistant to uv irradiation chlorination and electrolysis treatment e g metoprolol fig 3d shows that the e uv cl2 process completely abated all four test compounds within 5 min according to fig 1 6 mg l free chlorine could be electrochemically generated from the anodic oxidation of cl during 5 min of electrolysis of the surface water therefore 6 mg l free chlorine was added in the surface water followed by 10 min of uv irradiation for the conventional uv cl2 treatment due to photolysis free chlorine concentrations decreased logarithmically during the conventional uv cl2 process which is in contrast to the gradual increase of free chlorine concentrations during the e uv cl2 process see fig 4 a because of the higher initial concentration of free chlorine higher chlorine exposures ct were obtained in the first 5 min of the conventional uv cl2 process compared with the e uv cl2 process fig 4b corresponding to the high initial ct ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim were quickly eliminated in 1 min during the conventional uv cl2 process fig 3d and e in addition metoprolol was also effectively eliminated in 4 min however carbamazepine was abated at a considerably slower rate during the uv cl2 process consequently 18 residual concentrations of carbamazepine could still be detected in the water after 10 min of the uv cl2 treatment these observations are consistent with the previous findings that carbamazepine is usually less efficiently removed by the conventional uv cl2 process compared to the other three test compounds guo et al 2018 yang et al 2016 3 2 2 mechanisms of micropollutant abatement during electrolysis uv cl2 and e uv cl2 according to the mechanisms of micropollutant abatement during the electrolysis uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes the kinetics of micropollutant abatement during the three processes can be described using eqs 4 6 respectively 4 d p d t k d e p k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e p 5 d p d t k u v p k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e p k o h o h p k c l c l p k c l 2 c l 2 p k c l o c l o p 6 d p d t k d e p k u v p k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e p k o h o h p k c l c l p k c l 2 c l 2 p k c l o c l o p where k de and k uv are the first order rate constant of p abatement by direct electrolysis and direct uv photolysis respectively k chlorine k oh k cl k c l 2 and k clo are the second order rate constants for the reaction of micropollutant with chlorine oh cl cl2 and clo respectively 7 l n p p 0 k d e t k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e d t 8 l n p p 0 k u v t k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e d t k o h o h d t k c l c l d t k c l 2 c l 2 d t k c l o c l o d t 9 l n p p 0 k d e t k u v t

chlorine concentrations over a given reaction period during the electrolysis process see fig 4 based on the chlorine exposures and micropollutant abatement efficiencies observed during the electrolysis process the rate constants for micropollutant abatement by direct electrolysis k de can be obtained by fitting the data using eq 7 see si fig s2 thus the relative contribution of direct electrolysis and oxidation with chlorine to micropollutant abatement fe and fchlorine during the electrolysis process can be estimated using eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 f d e k d e t l n p p 0 11 f c h l o r i n e k c h l o r i n e c h l o r i n e d t l n p p 0 as shown in fig 5 a due to its high chlorine reactivity ciprofloxacin was abated almost exclusively by chlorine oxidation 100 during the electrolysis process in contrast direct electrolysis dominated the mechanisms of trimethoprim carbamazepine and metoprolol abatement during the process theoretically the contribution of photolysis electrolysis oxidation with chlorine oh and each rcs for micropollutant abatement during the uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes can also be estimated using the similar approach for example the contribution of uv photolysis for micropollutant abatement during the uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes can be estimated using eq 12 12 f u v k u v t l n p p 0 where k uv is the pseudo first order rate constant observed for micropollutant abatement during uv photolysis si table s2 however due to the difficulty in following the concentrations of oh and rcs the exposures of these radicals cannot be obtained during the uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes guo et al 2018 kishimoto et al 2018 therefore it is impossible to calculate the respective contribution of each radical to micropollutant abatement for the two processes alternatively the overall contribution of oh and rcs fr to micropollutant abatement during the uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes are collectively estimated as fr using eqs 13 and 14 respectively 13 f r 1 f u v f c h l o r i n e 14 f r 1 f d e f u v f c h l o r i n e fig 5b shows that during the conventional uv cl2 process ciprofloxacin was mainly abated by oxidation with free chlorine in contrast the other three micropollutants trimethoprim metoprolol and carbamazepine were abated primarily by the radicals oh and rcs generated from chlorine photolysis during the uv cl2 process oh and or cl are usually considered the main radicals for pollutant degradation fang et al 2014 remucal and manley 2016 xiang et al 2016 meanwhile other rcs such as cl2 can contribute non negligibly to the abatement of some compounds that have high reactivity with the specific rcs kishimoto et al 2018 remucal and manley 2016 under the test conditions of this study cl 100 mg l the equilibrium concentration of clo2 is estimated to be 116 times that of cl calculated based on the equilibrium constant of reversible reaction eq 15 kishimoto et al 2018 on the other hand the rate constants for the reaction of metoprolol and trimethoprim with clo2 are about 1 34 and 1 11 of those with cl of their k cl respectively see table 1 this information suggests that clo2 may play an even more important role than cl for metoprolol and trimethoprim abatement during the uv cl2 process this also explains the slower abatement of carbamazepine than metoprolol during the uv cl2 process fig 3e while both compounds have generally the similar oh cl and clo rate constants the clo2 rate constant of carbamazepine is significantly lower than that of metoprolol table 1 15 c l c l c l 2 k 1 c l 2 c l c l 5 9 10 4 m 1 compared with the electrolysis and uv cl2 processes the e uv cl2 process considerably accelerated the abatement of metoprolol and carbamazepine respectively fig 3c e as shown in fig 5c metoprolol was mainly abated by oxidation with oh and rcs during the e uv cl2 process this finding suggests that photolysis of electro generated chlorine to the radicals is the main mechanism for the accelerated metoprolol abatement in the e uv cl2 process on the other hand the e uv cl2 process accelerated carbamazepine abatement than the uv cl2 process probably by mainly the direct electrolysis mechanism which contributed 78 of carbamazepine abatement during the e uv cl2 process overall the above comparisons indicate that the e uv cl2 process successfully combines different mechanisms uv photolysis direct electrolysis chlorine mediated oxidation as well as oh and rcs oxidation for micropollutant abatement therefore it considerably enhanced the abatement of test compounds that were less effectively removed by the other processes these results suggest that the e uv cl2 process may provide a promising treatment option to ensure the effective removal of various micropollutants that coexist in water sources 3 2 3 energy consumption the electrical energy demand to abate the concentration of micropollutants by 1 order of magnitude in 1 m3 of water i e electrical energy per order eeo kwh m3 log by the uv electrolysis uv cl2 and e uv cl2 processes are calculated using eqs 16 19 bolton et al 2001 and compared in fig 6 the eeo for micropollutant abatement by chlorination was not calculated because with the applied chlorine dose 6 mg l the concentrations of metoprolol and carbamazepine can only be abated by less than 40 the eeo shown in fig 6 consists of two parts i the energy consumption for uv irradiation and electrolysis operation and ii the equivalent energy consumption for chlorine doses which is calculated based on the market price of calcium hypochlorite 1000 t and the average electricity cost 12 cent kwh in the u s guo et al 2018 the cost of nacl was not included in the calculation due to its low price 0 07 usd kg and low dosage added in the water 100 mg l cl as well as the possibility of using background cl in the water sources of decentralized systems e g grey water and municipal wastewater for chlorine production

energy demand for chlorine dose 0 851 kwh mol guo et al 2018 as shown in fig 6 different amounts of energy were required to abate the test compounds by the four processes in general the eeo value for the abatement of a given micropollutant by uv irradiation is significantly higher than that by the other three processes this observation indicates that uv irradiation alone is not an energy efficient way to abate micropollutants especially uv resistant micropollutants barazesh et al 2015 miklos et al 2018 for the other three processes the eeo values varied considerably for the four test compounds due to their different uv and electrochemical reactivity specifically metoprolol required the largest amount of energy to abate by electrolysis whereas carbamazepine required the largest amounts of energy to abate by the e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 processes the results shown in fig 6 indicate that due to their different physicochemical properties different amounts of energy are required to abate the varying micropollutants by a specific process to ensure the effective abatement of various micropollutants that coexist in a water source e g 90 abatement for each micropollutant the energy consumption required for a specific process will be determined by the micropollutants that are the slowest removed during the process e g metoprolol for electrolysis and carbamazepine for the e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 processes see fig 6 overall for the four test compounds the e uv cl2 process required 1 8 kwh m3 energy to abate their concentration by 90 in the surface water this value is 5 33 smaller than that for electrolysis 1 9 kwh m3 the conventional uv cl2 process 2 7 kwh m3 and more than one order of magnitude smaller than that for uv irradiation alone 24 9 kwh m3 these data suggest that the e uv cl2 process can be a competitive technology for micropollutant abatement in term of energy efficiency 3 2 4 formation of halogenated by products the formation of halogenated by products is a major concern associated with the electrochemical processes as well as the uv cl2 process for water treatment and wastewater reuse radjenovic and sedlak 2015 remucal and manley 2016 von gunten 2018 fig 7 a shows the concentration of thms detected in the selected surface water when the concentration of carbamazepine which is the most resistant to e uv cl2 treatment among the tested compounds was removed by 90 during the different treatment processes for the same degree of micropollutant removal 8 5 μg l of thms was detected in the surface water treated by uv irradiation whereas 24 29 μg l of thms were detected for the electrolysis e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 processes these observations indicate that uv irradiation generates insignificant amounts of organic halogenated by products during the treatment in contrast due to the involvement of chlorine and or rcs in the treatment process the electrolysis e uv cl2 and conventional uv cl2 process will generate certain concentrations of halogenated by products the concentrations of thms increased slightly in the order of e uv cl2 electrolysis and conventional uv cl2 process fig 7a which can be possibly attributed to the different chlorine exposures attained when 90 of carbamazepine abatement was achieved during the three processes 9 6 18 and 20 mm s at 5 6 and 11 min of the e uv cl2 electrolysis and uv cl2 process respectively besides halogenated organics the electrochemical and uv cl2 processes can generate some inorganic halogenated by products such as chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and bromate bro3 during water treatment radjenovic and sedlak 2015 remucal and manley 2016 due to the low concentration of bromide in the selected surface water 24 μg l see table 2 insignificant concentrations of bro3 generally 8 μg l were formed in all processes which are lower than the drinking water standard for bro3 10 μg l in many countries usepa 1998 who 2011 in addition clo2 was not detected in this study because of its short lifetime and analytical sensitivity lin et al 2016 remucal and manley 2016 however 0 26 1 08 mg l clo3 were detected in the water when 90 of carbamazepine was abated during the electrolysis uv cl2 and e uv cl2 process see fig 7b note that although clo3 is currently not a regulated dbp the world health organization recommends a guideline value of 0 7 mg l for drinking water due to its potential adverse health effects who 2011 during the e uv cl2 process clo3 can be formed from both the stepwise electrochemical oxidation of cl at the anode as what occurs during the electrolysis process lin et al 2016 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 and the photolysis of chlorine and ensuing radical reactions involving cl oh and rcs as what occur during the conventional uv cl2 process remucal and manley 2016 nevertheless due to the considerably shorter treatment time required to abate 90 of carbamazepine by the e uv cl2 process 5 min than the conventional uv cl2 process 11 min significantly less clo3 was formed during the e uv cl2 process than the conventional uv cl2 process fig 7b overall the results shown in fig 7 indicate that the concentrations of halogenated by products detected in the e uv cl2 treated water are still considerably lower than the drinking water standard or guideline value e g 80 μg l for thms and 0 7 mg l for clo3 usepa 1998 who 2011 even when a high abatement efficiency 90 has been achieved for the most resistant micropollutant these observations suggest that by carefully controlling treatment conditions e g chlorine concentration and treatment time the formation of halogenated by products may not be a serious concern for the application of the e uv cl2 process in decentralized water treatment systems 3 3 effect of process and water parameters on micropollutant abatement 3 3 1 anode materials the results shown in figs 2 and 3 suggest that uv photolysis of electro generated free chlorine to oh and rcs plays a critical role in enhancing the abatement of micropollutants that are resistant to individual uv and electrolysis treatment e g metoprolol to further evaluate this mechanism we replaced the ruo2 iro2 ti anode with a platinum coated ti pt ti anode and repeated the electrolysis and e uv cl2 treatment of the surface water unlike ruo2 and iro2 pt is ineffective at electrochemically oxidizing cl to cl2 panizza and cerisola 2009 indeed si fig s3 shows that free chlorine concentrations were almost undetectable during electrolysis with the pt ti anode but increased continuously during electrolysis with the reaching 13 3 mg l at 10 min corresponding to this difference insignificant enhancement was observed for micropollutant abatement when uv irradiation was combined with electrolysis using the pt ti anode fig 8 in contrast to what have been observed for the e uv cl2 process using the ruo2 iro2 ti anode fig 3 these observations confirm that the electrochemical production of cl2 is critical for the synergistic effect on micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process therefore anodes with high chlorine evolution activity should be used in the e uv cl2 process 3 3 2 applied currents fig 9 a shows that with increasing applied currents from 200 to 800 ma faster removal of carbamazepine was obtained during the e uv cl2 treatment of the surface water see si fig s4 for the other test compounds due to its low initial concentration 100 μg l the rate of carbamazepine abatement by direct electron transfer to the anode is mass transfer limited under the tested current densities 4 2 16 7 ma cm2 chaplin 2014 therefore the increase of currents will not considerably enhance carbamazepine abatement by direct electrolysis barazesh et al 2016 jasper et al 2016 however the increase of currents increased almost linearly the rate of chlorine evolution resulting in higher concentrations of free chlorine in the surface water see si fig s5 as photolysis of free chlorine follows pseudo first order kinetics see si fig s1 the rates of oh and rcs production increase proportionally with the free chlorine concentrations guo et al 2018 pan et al 2017 thus leading to the accelerated abatement of carbamazepine at higher applied currents fig 9a while increasing applied currents accelerated electrochemical chlorine production it also increased the cell voltage see si table s3 as a result the energy consumption for chlorine production increased from 0 078 to 0 15 kwh g cl2 as applied currents were increased from 200 to 800 ma see si for detailed calculations for carbamazepine and trimethoprim abatement the increase in energy consumption for electrochemical chlorine production was well compensated by the decrease in energy consumption for uv irradiation due to their faster abatement at higher currents see figs 7a and si fig s4a consequently the eeo values for carbamazepine and trimethoprim abatement decreased considerably as applied currents were increased from 200 to 400 800 ma during the e uv cl2 process fig 7b in contrast the eeo value for metoprolol abatement exhibited an inflection point at 400 ma while the eeo value for ciprofloxacin abatement increased monotonically with increasing applied currents because they could already be quickly abated at 200 400 ma overall the results shown in fig 9 suggest that there exists a marginal benefit associated with applying higher currents for chlorine production in the e uv cl2 process therefore applied currents need to be carefully controlled to balance the kinetics and energy efficiency for micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process 3 3 3 chloride concentrations fig 10 a shows that as the initial cl concentration in the surface water was increased from 30 to 300 mg l carbamazepine was more rapidly abated during the e uv cl2 process in addition the abatement of other test compounds was also accelerated to varied extent see si fig s6 accompanied with the faster abatement kinetics the eeo values for test compound abatement decreased considerably at higher cl concentrations fig 10b the results shown in fig 10 indicate that higher cl concentrations are beneficial for enhancing the kinetics and energy efficiency for micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process these enhancements can be mainly attributed to the enhanced electrochemical chlorine production at higher cl concentrations as shown in fig 2 with increasing initial cl concentrations free chlorine accumulated more quickly in the surface water during electrolysis this in turn accelerates the rate of oh and rcs production from chlorine photolysis consequently micropollutants can be more quickly abate by the oxidation with free chlorine oh and rcs during the e uv cl2 process with higher cl concentrations due to the faster abatement kinetics at higher cl concentrations shorter treatment time is required for micropollutant abatement during the e uv cl2 process see fig 10a this reduced the energy consumption of uv irradiation considerably fig 10b in addition the energy consumption for electrochemical chlorine production also decreased considerably with increasing cl concentration e g from 0 43 to 0 024 kwh g cl2 as the initial cl concentration was increased from 30 to 300 mg l see si table s3 consequently the eeo values for test compound abatement were substantially reduced during the e uv cl2 process at higher cl concentrations 3 4 practical implications this study demonstrates that the e uv cl2 process may provide an attractive technology for decentralized water treatment in terms of the effectiveness for micropollutant abatement energy consumption and by product formation with chloride concentrations 30 300 mg l typically found in the alternative water sources for decentralized systems chlorine can be electrochemically produced on site and on demand to enable the e uv cl2 process for micropollutant abatement the electrochemical chlorine production avoids the transport and management of liquid chlorine which enhances the flexibility of the process for decentralized water treatment under the tested conditions the e uv cl2 system could process 200 l water per day 700 ml water at a treatment time of 5 min and effectively eliminated micropollutants that are resistant to conventional uv and electrochemical treatment the energy consumption of the e uv cl2 process for micropollutant removal is generally comparable to the conventional uv cl2 process fig 6 the residual chlorine in the effluent can provide disinfection in the distributed systems in addition the e uv cl2 system has a simple modular configuration and uses durable low cost chlorine evolution electrodes e g ruo2 iro2 ti the treatment process is driven by electricity and can be flexibly controlled by adjusting currents these favorable characteristics of the e uv cl2 system facilitate the scale up maintenance and operation of the e uv cl2 system for decentralized water treatment at a household and community level based on the promising results shown herein additional studies will be carried out to further optimize the e uv cl2 process and evaluate its performance in pilot systems in addition more studies are needed to evaluate the toxicological consequences of water treatment by the e uv cl2 process to assess the overall benefits of the technology 4 conclusions this proof of concept study introduces the electrochemically driven uv cl2 e uv cl2 process as a promising technology for micropollutant abatement in decentralized water treatment systems by electrochemically producing chlorine from the anodic oxidation of chloride present in source waters the e uv cl2 process avoids the use of chlorine stocks and thus overcomes the main barrier of the conventional uv cl2 process for decentralized systems owing to the multiple abatement mechanisms of the e uv cl2 process micropollutants with varied properties could be effectively abated in short treatment time with acceptable energy consumption the concentrations of chlorinated by products could be controlled below the drinking water standards when high abatement efficiencies had been achieved for the test compounds during the e uv cl2 process these results suggest that the e uv cl2 process may provide a competitive technology for micropollutant abatement in decentralized

17782,the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in aquatic environments has recently drawn considerable attention due to their potential threat to the entire ecosystem the colonization of bacterial communities on microplastics is an important ecological linkage for microplastics in aquatic ecosystems which is yet poorly understood in this study microplastic particles were sampled in two urbanized rivers in jiaxing zhejiang china and the differences between bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastics and planktonic bacteria were estimated results from high throughput sequencing showed that the bacterial communities on microplastics were less rich and diverse compared to those from the freshwater samples with a significantly distinct taxonomic composition the predicted functional profiles also indicated significant differences between microplastic and water samples the functions related to biofilm formation and human diseases were relatively higher for the bacterial communities on the microplastics network analyses suggested that microplastic bacterial communities possessed higher average path length clustering coefficient and modularity compared to those in water samples additionally quantitative pcr results showed microplastics selectively enriched antibiotic resistant genes args and a good fit correlation between arg profiles and bacterial community composition was observed the relative abundances of integron integrase gene classes 1 and 2 were greater on microplastics potentially suggesting a higher level of horizontal gene transfer findings of this study suggested microplastics are a novel microbial niche and may serve as hotspots for microbial interaction potentially increasing risks to freshwater ecosystems and human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords freshwater microplastics bacterial assemblages antibiotic resistant genes integron integrase gene 1 introduction due to their unique properties of versatility stability and cost efficiency the global production of plastics has gradually increased from 1 7 million tons in 1950 to 359 million tons in 2018 jambeck et al 2015 kuczenski and geyer et al 2017 plasticseurope 2019 weithmann et al 2018 the growth will certainly lead to large amounts of plastic waste inevitably releasing into the environment dahlbo et al 2018 van velzen et al 2019 subsequently these plastics can be physically disintegrated by biological photo and or mechanical degradation with concomitant formation of smaller particles including microplastics 5 mm andrady 2011 browne et al 2010 moore 2018 due to their durability and refractory microplastics can persist for a long period of time in the environment thus causing adverse ecological effects cole et al 2011 galloway and lewis 2016 lonnstedt and eklov 2016 sussarellu et al 2016 previous studies have documented that microplastics can affect organisms at every level of biological organization e g altering gene expression damaging cells and tissues impairing reproduction and development causing death and altering community structure cole et al 2011 galloway and lewis 2016 as a class of emerging and near permanent contaminants microplastics may represent one of the greatest scientific and policy concerns microplastics have been recognized as a substrate for distinct microbial colonization and biofilm formation which constitute a unique niche called the plastisphere mccormick et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 previous studies have shown that the structure and composition of microbial communities on microplastics are significantly different from those of the surrounding water or other natural media in marine environments de tender et al 2015 dussud et al 2018 li et al 2019 wu et al 2020 additionally the experiments under laboratory conditions suggested microplastics may serve as hotspots of horizontal gene transfer to increase the exchange of genes between different bacteria potentially facilitating the transfer of pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance in the environment eckert et al 2018 imran et al 2019 for instance wu et al 2019 reported that polyvinyl chloride microplastics selectively enriched antibiotic resistance genes args and bacterial pathogens in the plastisphere and li et al 2019 incubated five polymer types of microplastics in the estuarine area and observed that the relative abundance of conditioned pathogenic vibrio was higher compared to that in the surrounding water however most studies focused on the incubation experiments with known polymer types to investigate the distinct microbial assemblages on microplastics only very few studies have examined the microbial community structures on the environmentally collected microplastics from freshwater systems in addition the understanding of the link between microbial community structure and the characteristics of args and mobile genetic elements mges on microplastics is still limited therefore in this study microplastic particles were collected from two urban rivers of jiaxing city in zhejiang province china an economically prosperous region of the yangtze river delta the characteristics of the bacterial community on these microplastics were investigated and the profiles of args and integrase genes a marker associated with mges were also estimated the aims of this study were to ⅰ identify the composition and structure of bacterial communities both in the surrounding water and on the microplastic particles ⅱ explore the differences in functional pathways and inner interactions among taxa and ⅲ compare the abundance of args and integrase genes on microplastics to the surrounding water and illustrate their association with the bacterial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection microplastic particles and water samples were collected from two urban rivers in jiaxing city zhejiang province china during the summer of 2018 six sampling sites were set up along the pinghu creek and eight sites along the huanggu creek the map of sampling sites was given in supporting information si fig s1 briefly microplastic particles were collected from surface water using a manta trawl 335 μm mesh with an opening of 0 3 0 4 m mccormick et al 2014 the trawl was deployed for 30 min with a speed of four nautical miles per hour materials from the trawl were rinsed onto a sterile white tray and all microplastic particles were picked using sterilized forceps bulked to form one composite sample and placed in a 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube to measure water column bacteria 2 l of water was collected with a water sampler at the depth of 30 cm beneath the water surface for each sampling site the water samples were first filtered through a quantitative filter

polymer and additives and polymer laminate films libraries were used to identify the polymer compositions 2 3 dna extraction total genomic dna on microplastics was extracted from 60 pieces of

sequences were analyzed by quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime version 1 9 1 following online instructions caporaso et al 2010 briefly the paired sequencing reads were assembled and demultiplexed any sequences with a quality score less than 20 or with truncated reads shorter than 50 bp were removed from the data set the chimeric sequences were identified and removed for denoising after trimming sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 sequence identification using uparse edgar 2013 the rdp classifier was used to assign the taxonomy of each otu according to the silva ssu123 16s rrna database quast et al 2012 2 5 detection and quantification of args and integrase genes five types of args and two integrase genes inti1 and inti2 were quantified

genes schmittgen and livak 2008 2 6 statistical analysis various statistical analyses were carried out using r software 3 6 2 the alpha diversity indexes were calculated in qiime 1 9 1 including chao1 richness pielou s evenness and shannon diversity principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis and weighted unifrac distance was used to determine the beta diversity of bacterial communities with the vegan and phyloseq packages respectively in addition non parametric multivariate analysis of variance test adonis was used to examine the significance dixon 2003 differently abundant otus were performed using the edger package dimont et al 2015 the analysis of linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to explore the biomarker species with different classification levels segata et al 2011 the co occurrence network analysis was performed to understand the inter associations among microorganisms using the phylogenetic molecular ecology networks based on random matrix theory deng et al 2012 the function of bacterial communities was predicted by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust and the differences between microplastics and water samples were performed with statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp langille et al 2013 one way anova was used to evaluate the significant differences between samples and a p value of 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 the detected microplastic particles the results of μ ftir indicated that most fragments collected from the urban rivers were identified as polyethylene and polypropylene based on the spectra fig s2 for example four characteristic peaks were observed for type a microplastic particles including 2915 cm 1 for asymmetric c h stretch 2848 cm 1 for symmetrical c h stretch 1468 cm 1 for ch2 bend and 718 cm 1 for ch2 rock matching the absorption bands for the polyethylene standard jung et al 2018 for type b microplastics seven peaks matched with the characteristic bands for polypropylene standard were observed the fact that these two types of microplastics were mainly observed may be attributed to their common use in packaging and other single use plastic applications in addition the densities of these two polymers 0 92 0 96 and 0 90 0 91 g cm3 respectively for polyethylene and polypropylene were lower than freshwater consequently allowing them to float and accumulate in the surface water hidalgo ruz et al 2012 3 2 characteristics of bacterial communities on microplastics and in water after assembling and quality filtering high quality sequences ranging from 31 500 to 50 100 per sample were clustered into 4948 operational taxonomic units otus both microplastic and water samples presented rarefaction curves with a stationary phase suggesting the sufficient depth and accuracy of sequencing fig s3 the community complexity of free living and microplastic attached bacteria was evaluated using alpha diversity based on otu level including the otu richness pielou s evenness and the shannon index fig 1 diverse bacterial assemblages were observed on microplastics with a statistically p 0 01 anova lower out richness mean 1230 compared to the planktonic bacteria mean 1860 significantly lower levels p 0 01 anova of evenness and diversity were also observed for bacterial on microplastics for instance the otu evenness and shannon indices of the plastisphere ranged 0 24 0 63 and 1 51 4 78 respectively which were statistically lower than those indices in water samples 0 94 0 72 and 4 37 5 15 respectively several previous studies also showed that the alpha diversity indices were smaller on microplastic particles compared to those in the surrounding water mccormick et al 2014 observed less diverse bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastics within an urbanized river while zettler et al 2013 found that the richness of bacterial assemblages was lower on pe and pp debris than that in seawater recently through field investigation and in situ incubation experiments de tender et al 2015 2017 reported that the richness and diversity of microorganisms on microplastics were significantly lower than those in sediments these results may indicate that the microplastic surface selects for a unique suite of bacteria in comparison surface water was characterized by many more rare taxa which contributed to the richness in these samples the relative abundance of bacterial otus at the phylum level was variable between microplastics and water even they shared the most dominant phyla fig 2 a for example the phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant across all samples accounting for 75 8 and 51 5 for the otus from microplastics and water respectively the relative proportions of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes on microplastics were 4 96 and 2 79 respectively which were significantly lower than the abundances in water samples 30 4 and 8 84 respectively the community abundance at the class level was further compared fig s4 the classes gammaproteobacteria bacilli and anaerolineae were significantly overrepresented on microplastics accounting for 64 9 2 59 and 2 11 respectively to further identify the separation pattern between bacterial communities principal coordinate analysis pcoa at the otu level was performed fig 2 based on a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix a clearly significant separation r 2 0 748 p 0 001 adonis along the primary principal coordinate 75 18 was observed between microplastic and water bacterial communities fig 2b since different facets of diversity may behave quite differently we also examined the pcoa based on the phylogenetically weighted unifrac distance webb et al 2002 similarly all microplastic samples were clustered into one group fig 2c and separated from water samples along the first principal coordinate 72 08 the adonis test further revealed that the bacterial communities were significantly r 2 0 736 p 0 001 different between the microplastic and water samples the results clearly indicated that the bacterial communities were significantly different between microplastics and water both at taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution to better illustrate the differences between microplastic and water microbiota the differential otu abundances i e significantly enriched depleted otus were analyzed by fitting a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution to normalized values for each of the 4948 otus in microplastic and water samples and testing for differential abundance using a likelihood ratio test fig 3 a in comparison with the water samples there were 681 otus that were significantly enriched on the microplastic particles while 757 otus were significantly depleted the shifts in bacterial community were further dissected by arranging otus according to their taxonomy using the manhattan plot fig 3b compared to the water sample the phyla deinococcus thermus firmicutes and nitrospirae were significantly enriched on microplastic particles while parts of actinobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were significantly depleted on microplastics the significant differences in taxonomic composition coupled with the separation pattern between water and microplastic samples clearly revealed the special niches on microplastic particles with selected colonizers the cladogram based on lefse results was performed to identify the biomarkers in different samples further suggesting that microplastics can select for particular microbial community members fig s5 for instance the gammaproteobacterial genus pseudomonas frequently associated with plastic biodegradation was unique to microplastic particles which may suggest that the microplastics can select for bacteria capable of decomposing the plastic compounds balasubramanian et al 2010 tribedi et al 2015 members of nitrospira playing pivotal roles in nitrification as an aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacterium were observed as the biomarker taxa on microplastics daims et al 2015 moreover the family nocardiaceae usually considered as potential opportunistic pathogens of humans were significantly enriched on microplastics potentially indicating that the microplastics can serve as a sink for depositing pathogenic microorganisms goodfellow 1998 our results confirmed that microplastics can act as a new substrate for distinct microbial assemblages with unique metabolic functions 3 3 divergent potential metabolic pathway between bacterial communities the 16s rrna gene profiling data of water and microplastic samples was annotated to the kegg database to evaluate the functional diversity langille et al 2013 for the functional traits of kegg level 1 the functions related to cellular processes environmental information processing and human diseases were significantly greater for the bacterial communities on microplastics whereas the functions related to metabolism genetic information processing and organismal systems were statistically overrepresented for planktonic bacteria in the rivers fig s6 for example the relative abundances of cellular processes environmental information processing and human diseases in the plastisphere were 4 26 16 7 and 1 18 respectively which were significantly p 0 001 welch s t test higher than their abundances in water samples 3 53 15 0 and 0 93 respectively the significant differences in the predicted functions at kegg level 1 were further visualized using pcoa fig 4 a separated clustering in the plot of each trait was observed for microplastic and water samples confirming that the metabolic functions on microplastics were different from those of the surrounding water in addition the adonis tests suggested the differences of each functional trait of kegg level 1 were significant p 0 01 with r 2 ranged 0 266 0 792 a more detailed estimation was pursued for the functional traits based on kegg levels 2 and 3 figs 4 and s7 for the groups of cellular processes and information processing cell motility signal transduction and membrane transport were predicted to be significantly more encoded by microplastics which may be ascribed to the fact that these functions are the essential functions in biofilm formation and maturation bryant et al 2016 didier et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 the pathway related to infectious diseases level 2 was also overrepresented on microplastics specifically the pathways of vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle staphylococcus aureus infection african trypanosomiasis and pertussis level 3 were significantly enriched on microplastics which were consistent with previous observations that the opportunistic pathogens i e nocardiaceae and pseudomonadaceae were observed as the biomarker taxa on microplastics in our study dussud et al 2018 goodfellow 1998 wu et al 2019 although the trait metabolism at level 1 was overrepresented in water samples some metabolic pathways related to xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism including atrazine degradation ethylbenzene degradation and styrene degradation were still enriched on microplastics fig s7 possibly suggesting that the organic contaminants in the surrounding water can be sorbed by microplastics and act as the carbon sources luo et al 2020 roager and sonnenschein 2019 hence our results regarding both taxa composition and functional traits confirmed that microplastics may exert selection pressure on the formation of the plastisphere in the aquatic environment 3 4 networks of bacterial communities to disentangle the potential associations among taxa in the complex communities the phylogenetic molecular ecology networks based on random matrix theory were carried out only the otus detected in all water or microplastic samples were used and the similarity threshold was set at 0 80 nodes represented otus and edges represented the correlation between otus red for positive correlation green for negative correlation fig 5 it seemed that the network of the microplastic bacterial community was less complex than that of planktonic bacteria which may be attributed to the lower richness and diversity of the bacterial community for example the network on microplastics consisted of 49 nodes and 63 edges and the otus belonged to five phyla acidobacteria n 1 actinobacteria n 13 deinococcus thermus n 2 nitrospirae n 2 and proteobacteria n 31 while for the bacterial network in water samples the numbers of nodes and edges were 267 and 1124 respectively which belonged to 15 phyla the topological properties of the networks were further calculated and compared with the corresponding random networks to identify the validity of our networks table 1 significant different properties between empirical and random networks were observed indicating that the networks in these communities showed typical scale free and small world characteristics zhou et al 2010 a higher average degree 8 419 i e the number of edges per node was obtained for the planktonic bacterial network however greater values of path length 4 54 and modularity 0 701 with a lower clustering coefficient 0 287 were observed for the microplastic network the average path length and clustering coefficient are used to describe the communication among different members within a network zhou et al 2010 deng et al 2012 the short path length and high clustering coefficient may allow the environmental perturbations to reach the whole network immediately and the characteristics of modularity may help to minimize the effects of the changes on the other hand the relatively longer path length greater modularity and lower coefficient of the microplastic network indicated the robustness of the bacterial community on microplastics moreover the proportion of positive correlations in the microplastic network 95 2 was higher than that in water samples 86 2 suggesting more cooperative behaviors happened on microplastics consequently the network results revealed that the biofilm formed on microplastics was a whole community with stability see fig 6 in the network nodes with a high degree of connectivity are frequently represented as the keystone species which play a vital role in maintaining the stability of ecosystem structure and function berry and widder 2014 shi et al 2016 based on this criterion 10 otus in each network were identified as the putative keystone genera obviously different keystone otus were obtained for microplastic and water bacterial communities potentially revealing their distinct ecosystem functions table s3 nine otus belonging to proteobacteria and 1 otu belonging to nitrospirae were characterized as keystone genera for the bacterial communities on microplastics however the keystone genera for planktonic bacterial communities belonged to chlorobi 1 actinobacteria 6 saccharibacteria 1 bacteroidetes 1 and proteobacteria 1 most of the putative keystone otus for microplastic bacterial communities were associated with xenobiotics biodegradation for instance the otu5309 otu2067 and otu5929 from the genera sphingomonas pseudomonas and novosphingobium respectively have been shown to degrade complex organic contaminants such as crude oil chloro nitro phenolics and large polymers balkwill et al 1997 kaech et al 2005 kampfer et al 2018 moreover proteobacteria were found to carry many mobile integrons and integrase genes in variant habitats gillings 2014 the results of keystone genera in the microplastic bacterial community may indicate that the plastisphere serves as a microenvironment for horizontal gene transfer 3 5 occurrence of args and integrase genes the relative abundances of the 25 args gene copies of args normalized to the gene copies of 16s rrna were calculated for all water and microplastic samples to minimize the variation caused by the difference in bacterial abundances contrary to several previous observations that args were enriched by microplastics wu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 the arg relative abundances were lower on microplastics than those in water samples for example the relative abundances of the target args ranged from 7 9 10 3 to 5 7 10 2 copies 16s rrna on microplastics which were significantly anova p 0 001 lower than the values in water samples 2 3 6 4 10 2 copies 16s rrna however several subtypes of args showed higher relative abundances on microplastic particles such as tetm tets and tetw to further estimate the differences of arg profiles between microplastic and water samples the detected args were analyzed using pcoa even though the microplastic samples appeared to be a little more scattered they were still separated from the water samples by principal component 1 suggesting distinct arg profiles between these two type samples moreover the adonis results indicated the separation was statistically significant r 2 0 377 p 0 001 microplastics have been presented as a reservoir for args and further a vector leading to a potential worldwide threat to the ecosystem and human health by analyzing the metagenomic data of plastic particles from the north pacific gyre yang et al 2019 first reported that the relative abundance of total args 64 subtypes in microplastics was significantly greater than that for seawater anova p 0 05 wu et al 2019 also observed that the arg abundance 188 subtypes on polyvinyl chloride microplastic pellets was approximately 3 fold higher than that of river water under experimental conditions compared to metagenomic analysis traditional pcr based methods were limited by the availability of primers and by amplification bias thus the results via qpcr in this study may not afford an unbiased and broad spectrum survey of the arg pollution in water and microplastic samples further studies based on high throughput sequencing methods are required to obtain a comprehensive overview on the diversity and phylogenetic distribution of args to investigate whether the arg profiles correlated with the bacterial composition procrustes analysis and mantel test on the basis of bray curtis dissimilarity metrics were performed as shown in fig 7 the procrustes analysis revealed a significant correlation p 0 003 9999 permutations between args profiles and bacterial community composition in water and microplastic samples with the procrustes sum of squares m 2 0 7165 the mantel test further confirmed a significant correlation between args and bacteria p 0 0001 9999 permutations both results suggested that the distinct pattern of antibiotic resistome between water and microplastics may be potentially linked to that of the microbiome additionally the co occurrence pattern between args and bacterial taxa indicated that the water args may be mainly contained in firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria while the microplastic args may be primarily linked to proteobacteria figs s8 and s9 see fig 8 integron integrase genes were important indicators of horizontal gene transfer specifically the class 1 integron integrase gene was represented as a proxy for anthropogenic arg contamination gillings et al 2015 the relative abundances of class 1 and 2 integron integrase genes inti1 and inti2 were investigated in this study and the results indicated higher concentrations on microplastic particles for example the mean normalized abundance of inti1 was approximately 2 5 times higher on the microplastics 6 8 10 4 copies 16s rrna than in the water 2 7 10 4 copies 16s rrna however the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 while for inti2 the relative abundance was 6 4 10 3 copies 16s rrna which was significantly p 0 01 greater than that in water compared with the planktonic bacteria the physical proximity between bacteria on microplastics is closer which may favor the contact between surface attached bacteria and thus trigger the mobilization of integron integrase genes horizontal gene transfer is one of the crucial reasons for the propagation of increased antibiotic resistance potentially suggesting that microplastics can enhance the spread of args moreover some opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas have been shown on the microplastics higher abundances of integron integrase genes on microplastics may facilitate the specific pathogens to acquire args and increase their drug resistance organic aggregates in water were found to provide a favorable microhabitat for bacteria in general and specifically aquatic pathogens lyons et al 2010 similarly microplastics can be considered as a more robust microhabitat due to their polymer compositions and the sorbed organic matters considering their capacity to spread globally previous studies have highlighted the role of microplastics in transporting args yan et al 2020 therefore microplastics in the aquatic environments may emerge as a preferred niche and a vector for disseminating args and pathogens to a new environment enhancing their potential the risks to ecological safety and human health 4 conclusions this study clearly showed that microplastics provided a unique microhabitat for distinct bacterial assemblages in the freshwater environment the bacterial communities on microplastics were significantly different from the planktonic bacteria in the urban rivers as verified by taxa compositions community separation patterns biomarker species and metabolic pathways the network analysis indicated that the biofilm formed on microplastics was a whole robust community and that the keystone species mainly belonged to proteobacteria although the total abundances of the 25 target args were lower on microplastics the arg profiles were still significantly different between microplastics and water samples additionally the relative abundances of inti1 and inti2 on microplastics were higher than those in water potentially indicating greater horizontal gene transfer for args microplastics can be considered as a novel important microhabitat for the colonization and migration of microorganisms especially for the opportunistic pathogens

17782,the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in aquatic environments has recently drawn considerable attention due to their potential threat to the entire ecosystem the colonization of bacterial communities on microplastics is an important ecological linkage for microplastics in aquatic ecosystems which is yet poorly understood in this study microplastic particles were sampled in two urbanized rivers in jiaxing zhejiang china and the differences between bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastics and planktonic bacteria were estimated results from high throughput sequencing showed that the bacterial communities on microplastics were less rich and diverse compared to those from the freshwater samples with a significantly distinct taxonomic composition the predicted functional profiles also indicated significant differences between microplastic and water samples the functions related to biofilm formation and human diseases were relatively higher for the bacterial communities on the microplastics network analyses suggested that microplastic bacterial communities possessed higher average path length clustering coefficient and modularity compared to those in water samples additionally quantitative pcr results showed microplastics selectively enriched antibiotic resistant genes args and a good fit correlation between arg profiles and bacterial community composition was observed the relative abundances of integron integrase gene classes 1 and 2 were greater on microplastics potentially suggesting a higher level of horizontal gene transfer findings of this study suggested microplastics are a novel microbial niche and may serve as hotspots for microbial interaction potentially increasing risks to freshwater ecosystems and human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords freshwater microplastics bacterial assemblages antibiotic resistant genes integron integrase gene 1 introduction due to their unique properties of versatility stability and cost efficiency the global production of plastics has gradually increased from 1 7 million tons in 1950 to 359 million tons in 2018 jambeck et al 2015 kuczenski and geyer et al 2017 plasticseurope 2019 weithmann et al 2018 the growth will certainly lead to large amounts of plastic waste inevitably releasing into the environment dahlbo et al 2018 van velzen et al 2019 subsequently these plastics can be physically disintegrated by biological photo and or mechanical degradation with concomitant formation of smaller particles including microplastics 5 mm andrady 2011 browne et al 2010 moore 2018 due to their durability and refractory microplastics can persist for a long period of time in the environment thus causing adverse ecological effects cole et al 2011 galloway and lewis 2016 lonnstedt and eklov 2016 sussarellu et al 2016 previous studies have documented that microplastics can affect organisms at every level of biological organization e g altering gene expression damaging cells and tissues impairing reproduction and development causing death and altering community structure cole et al 2011 galloway and lewis 2016 as a class of emerging and near permanent contaminants microplastics may represent one of the greatest scientific and policy concerns microplastics have been recognized as a substrate for distinct microbial colonization and biofilm formation which constitute a unique niche called the plastisphere mccormick et al 2014 zettler et al 2013 previous studies have shown that the structure and composition of microbial communities on microplastics are significantly different from those of the surrounding water or other natural media in marine environments de tender et al 2015 dussud et al 2018 li et al 2019 wu et al 2020 additionally the experiments under laboratory conditions suggested microplastics may serve as hotspots of horizontal gene transfer to increase the exchange of genes between different bacteria potentially facilitating the transfer of pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance in the environment eckert et al 2018 imran et al 2019 for instance wu et al 2019 reported that polyvinyl chloride microplastics selectively enriched antibiotic resistance genes args and bacterial pathogens in the plastisphere and li et al 2019 incubated five polymer types of microplastics in the estuarine area and observed that the relative abundance of conditioned pathogenic vibrio was higher compared to that in the surrounding water however most studies focused on the incubation experiments with known polymer types to investigate the distinct microbial assemblages on microplastics only very few studies have examined the microbial community structures on the environmentally collected microplastics from freshwater systems in addition the understanding of the link between microbial community structure and the characteristics of args and mobile genetic elements mges on microplastics is still limited therefore in this study microplastic particles were collected from two urban rivers of jiaxing city in zhejiang province china an economically prosperous region of the yangtze river delta the characteristics of the bacterial community on these microplastics were investigated and the profiles of args and integrase genes a marker associated with mges were also estimated the aims of this study were to ⅰ identify the composition and structure of bacterial communities both in the surrounding water and on the microplastic particles ⅱ explore the differences in functional pathways and inner interactions among taxa and ⅲ compare the abundance of args and integrase genes on microplastics to the surrounding water and illustrate their association with the bacterial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection microplastic particles and water samples were collected from two urban rivers in jiaxing city zhejiang province china during the summer of 2018 six sampling sites were set up along the pinghu creek and eight sites along the huanggu creek the map of sampling sites was given in supporting information si fig s1 briefly microplastic particles were collected from surface water using a manta trawl 335 μm mesh with an opening of 0 3 0 4 m mccormick et al 2014 the trawl was deployed for 30 min with a speed of four nautical miles per hour materials from the trawl were rinsed onto a sterile white tray and all microplastic particles were picked using sterilized forceps bulked to form one composite sample and placed in a 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube to measure water column bacteria 2 l of water was collected with a water sampler at the depth of 30 cm beneath the water surface for each sampling site the water samples were first filtered through a quantitative filter

phosphorus and toc table s1 the type of polymer comprising the microplastics was identified using micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ftir thermo nicolet in10 mx the μ ftir spectrum range

polymer and additives and polymer laminate films libraries were used to identify the polymer compositions 2 3 dna extraction total genomic dna on microplastics was extracted from 60 pieces of collected particles using the mobio powersoil dna isolation kit qiagen shanghai china according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna of planktonic bacteria in the water sample was extracted from the 0 22 μm membrane using the mobio powerwater dna isolation kit qiagen shanghai china dna quality was assessed on the basis of 260 280 nm and 260 230 nm absorbance ratios using a nanodrop nd 2000

actcctacgggaggcagca and reverse primer 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat were used for the amplification huang et al 2019 the pcr was performed in a total volume of 25 μl which contained 2 5 μl of 10 pcr

of denaturation at 95 c 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 55 c 45 s at 72 c and 27 cycles a final extension at 72 c for 10 min the pcr products were further purified using 2 agarose gel and axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa purified amplicons were sequenced in a paired end format using the illumina miseq platform by majorbio biopharm technology co ltd shanghai china raw sequences were analyzed by quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime version 1 9 1 following online instructions caporaso et al 2010 briefly the paired sequencing reads were assembled and demultiplexed any sequences with a quality score less than 20 or with truncated reads shorter than 50 bp were removed from the data set the chimeric sequences were identified and removed for denoising after trimming sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 sequence identification using uparse edgar 2013 the rdp classifier was used to assign the taxonomy of each otu according to the silva ssu123 16s rrna database quast et al 2012 2 5 detection and quantification of args and integrase genes five types of args and two integrase genes inti1 and inti2 were quantified on a steponeplus real time pcr system thermo usa with the sybr green approach target args in this study included aminoglycoside residence genes aada1 and strb macrolide residence genes mefa ermb ermc and erme chloramphenicol residence genes cfr cmla fexa fexb and flor sulfonamide residence genes sul1 sul2 and sul3 and tetracycline residence genes teta tetbp tetg teth tetm teto tetq tets tett tetw and tetx these args were selectively analyzed because of their frequent detection in the mid lower reaches of the yangtze river li et al 2019 lu et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 additionally the selected

zhu et al 2013 the primers for pcr amplification were given in si table s2 the qpcr was performed with a volume of 10 μl consisting of 5 0 μl sybr premix ex taq ii takara dalian china 0 4 μl forward

c for 30 s a threshold cycle c t of 40 was used as the detection limit a comparative c t method 2 δct δc t c t target gene c t 16s was used to calculate the relative abundance of args and integrase genes schmittgen and livak 2008 2 6 statistical analysis various statistical analyses were carried out using r software 3 6 2 the alpha diversity indexes were calculated in qiime 1 9 1 including chao1 richness pielou s evenness and shannon diversity principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis and weighted unifrac distance was used to determine the beta diversity of bacterial communities with the vegan and phyloseq packages respectively in addition non parametric multivariate analysis of variance test adonis was used to examine the significance dixon 2003 differently abundant otus were performed using the edger package dimont et al 2015 the analysis of linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse was used to explore the biomarker species with different classification levels segata et al 2011 the co occurrence network analysis was performed to understand the inter associations among microorganisms using the phylogenetic molecular ecology networks based on random matrix theory deng et al 2012 the function of bacterial communities was predicted by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust and the differences between microplastics and water samples were performed with statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp langille et al 2013 one way anova was used to evaluate the significant differences between samples and a p value of 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 the detected microplastic particles the results of μ ftir indicated that most fragments collected from the urban rivers were identified as polyethylene and polypropylene based on the spectra fig s2 for example four characteristic peaks were observed for type a microplastic particles including 2915 cm 1 for asymmetric c h stretch 2848 cm 1 for symmetrical c h stretch 1468 cm 1 for ch2 bend and 718 cm 1 for ch2 rock matching the absorption bands for the polyethylene standard jung et al 2018 for type b microplastics seven peaks matched with the characteristic bands for polypropylene standard were observed the fact that these two types of microplastics were mainly observed may be attributed to their common use in packaging and other single use plastic applications in addition the densities of these two polymers 0 92 0 96 and 0 90 0 91 g cm3 respectively for polyethylene and polypropylene were lower than freshwater consequently allowing them to float and accumulate in the surface water hidalgo ruz et al 2012 3 2 characteristics of bacterial communities on microplastics and in water after assembling and quality filtering high quality sequences ranging from 31 500 to 50 100 per sample were clustered into 4948 operational taxonomic units otus both microplastic and water samples presented rarefaction curves with a stationary phase suggesting the sufficient depth and accuracy of sequencing fig s3 the community complexity of free living and microplastic attached bacteria was evaluated using alpha diversity based on otu level including the otu richness pielou s evenness and the shannon index fig 1 diverse bacterial assemblages were observed on microplastics with a statistically p 0 01 anova lower out richness mean 1230 compared to the planktonic bacteria mean 1860 significantly lower levels p 0 01 anova of evenness and diversity were also observed for bacterial on microplastics for instance the otu evenness and shannon indices of the plastisphere ranged 0 24 0 63 and 1 51 4 78 respectively which were statistically lower than those indices in water samples 0 94 0 72 and 4 37 5 15 respectively several previous studies also showed that the alpha diversity indices were smaller on microplastic particles compared to those in the surrounding water mccormick et al 2014 observed less diverse bacterial assemblages colonizing microplastics within an urbanized river while zettler et al 2013 found that the richness of bacterial assemblages was lower on pe and pp debris than that in seawater recently through field investigation and in situ incubation experiments de tender et al 2015 2017 reported that the richness and diversity of microorganisms on microplastics were significantly lower than those in sediments these results may indicate that the microplastic surface selects for a unique suite of bacteria in comparison surface water was characterized by many more rare taxa which contributed to the richness in these samples the relative abundance of bacterial otus at the phylum level was variable between microplastics and water even they shared the most dominant phyla fig 2 a for example the phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant across all samples accounting for 75 8 and 51 5 for the otus from microplastics and water respectively the relative proportions of actinobacteria and bacteroidetes on microplastics were 4 96 and 2 79 respectively which were significantly lower than the abundances in water samples 30 4 and 8 84 respectively the community abundance at the class level was further compared fig s4 the classes gammaproteobacteria bacilli and anaerolineae were significantly overrepresented on microplastics accounting for 64 9 2 59 and 2 11 respectively to further identify the separation pattern between bacterial communities principal coordinate analysis pcoa at the otu level was performed fig 2 based on a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix a clearly significant separation r 2 0 748 p 0 001 adonis along the primary principal coordinate 75 18 was observed between microplastic and water bacterial communities fig 2b since different facets of diversity may behave quite differently we also examined the pcoa based on the phylogenetically weighted unifrac distance webb et al 2002 similarly all microplastic samples were clustered into one group fig 2c and separated from water samples along the first principal coordinate 72 08 the adonis test further revealed that the bacterial communities were significantly r 2 0 736 p 0 001 different between the microplastic and water samples the results clearly indicated that the bacterial communities were significantly different between microplastics and water both at taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution to better illustrate the differences between microplastic and water microbiota the differential otu abundances i e significantly enriched depleted otus were analyzed by fitting a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution to normalized values for each of the 4948 otus in microplastic and water samples and testing for differential abundance using a likelihood ratio test fig 3 a in comparison with the water samples there were 681 otus that were significantly enriched on the microplastic particles while 757 otus were significantly depleted the shifts in bacterial community were further dissected by arranging otus according to their taxonomy using the manhattan plot fig 3b compared to the water sample the phyla deinococcus thermus firmicutes and nitrospirae were significantly enriched on microplastic particles while parts of actinobacteria bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were significantly depleted on microplastics the significant differences in taxonomic composition coupled with the separation pattern between water and microplastic samples clearly revealed the special niches on microplastic particles with selected colonizers the cladogram based on lefse results was performed to identify the biomarkers in different samples further suggesting that microplastics can select for particular microbial community members fig s5 for instance the gammaproteobacterial genus pseudomonas frequently associated with plastic biodegradation was unique to microplastic particles which may suggest that the microplastics can select for bacteria capable of decomposing the plastic compounds balasubramanian et al 2010 tribedi et al 2015 members of nitrospira playing pivotal roles in nitrification as an aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacterium were observed as the biomarker taxa on microplastics daims et al 2015 moreover the family nocardiaceae usually considered as potential opportunistic pathogens of humans were significantly enriched on microplastics potentially indicating that the microplastics can serve as a sink for depositing pathogenic microorganisms goodfellow 1998 our results confirmed that microplastics can act as a new substrate for distinct microbial assemblages with unique metabolic functions 3 3 divergent potential metabolic pathway between bacterial communities the 16s rrna gene profiling data of water and microplastic samples was annotated to the kegg database to evaluate the functional diversity langille et al 2013 for the functional traits of kegg level 1 the functions related to cellular processes environmental information processing and human diseases were significantly greater for the bacterial communities on microplastics whereas the functions related to metabolism genetic information processing and organismal systems were statistically overrepresented for planktonic bacteria in the rivers fig s6 for example the relative abundances of cellular processes environmental information processing and human diseases in the plastisphere were 4 26 16 7 and 1 18 respectively which were significantly p 0 001 welch s t test higher than their abundances in water samples 3 53 15 0 and 0 93 respectively the significant differences in the predicted functions at kegg level 1 were further visualized using pcoa fig 4 a separated clustering in the plot of each trait was observed for microplastic and water samples confirming that the metabolic functions on microplastics were different from those of the surrounding water in addition the adonis tests suggested the differences of each functional trait of kegg level 1 were significant p 0 01 with r 2 ranged 0 266 0 792 a more detailed estimation was pursued for the functional traits based on kegg levels 2 and 3 figs 4 and s7 for the groups of cellular processes and information processing cell motility signal transduction and membrane transport were predicted to be significantly more encoded by microplastics which may be ascribed to the fact that these functions are the essential functions in biofilm formation and maturation bryant et al 2016 didier et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 the pathway related to infectious diseases level 2 was also overrepresented on microplastics specifically the pathways of vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle staphylococcus aureus infection african trypanosomiasis and pertussis level 3 were significantly enriched on microplastics which were consistent with previous observations that the opportunistic pathogens i e nocardiaceae and pseudomonadaceae were observed as the biomarker taxa on microplastics in our study dussud et al 2018 goodfellow 1998 wu et al 2019 although the trait metabolism at level 1 was overrepresented in water samples some metabolic pathways related to xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism including atrazine degradation ethylbenzene degradation and styrene degradation were still enriched on microplastics fig s7 possibly suggesting that the organic contaminants in the surrounding water can be sorbed by microplastics and act as the carbon sources luo et al 2020 roager and sonnenschein 2019 hence our results regarding both taxa composition and functional traits confirmed that microplastics may exert selection pressure on the formation of the plastisphere in the aquatic environment 3 4 networks of bacterial communities to disentangle the potential associations among taxa in the complex communities the phylogenetic molecular ecology networks based on random matrix theory were carried out only the otus detected in all water or microplastic samples were used and the similarity threshold was set at 0 80 nodes represented otus and edges represented the correlation between otus red for positive correlation green for negative correlation fig 5 it seemed that the network of the microplastic bacterial community was less complex than that of planktonic bacteria which may be attributed to the lower richness and diversity of the bacterial community for example the network on microplastics consisted of 49 nodes and 63 edges and the otus belonged to five phyla acidobacteria n 1 actinobacteria n 13 deinococcus thermus n 2 nitrospirae n 2 and proteobacteria n 31 while for the bacterial network in water samples the numbers of nodes and edges were 267 and 1124 respectively which belonged to 15 phyla the topological properties of the networks were further calculated and compared with the corresponding random networks to identify the validity of our networks table 1 significant different properties between empirical and random networks were observed indicating that the networks in these communities showed typical scale free and small world characteristics zhou et al 2010 a higher average degree 8 419 i e the number of edges per node was obtained for the planktonic bacterial network however greater values of path length 4 54 and modularity 0 701 with a lower clustering coefficient 0 287 were observed for the microplastic network the average path length and clustering coefficient are used to describe the communication among different members within a network zhou et al 2010 deng et al 2012 the short path length and high clustering coefficient may allow the environmental perturbations to reach the whole network immediately and the characteristics of modularity may help to minimize the effects of the changes on the other hand the relatively longer path length greater modularity and lower coefficient of the microplastic network indicated the robustness of the bacterial community on microplastics moreover the proportion of positive correlations in the microplastic network 95 2 was higher than that in water samples 86 2 suggesting more cooperative behaviors happened on microplastics consequently the network results revealed that the biofilm formed on microplastics was a whole community with stability see fig 6 in the network nodes with a high degree of connectivity are frequently represented as the keystone species which play a vital role in maintaining the stability of ecosystem structure and function berry and widder 2014 shi et al 2016 based on this criterion 10 otus in each network were identified as the putative keystone genera obviously different keystone otus were obtained for microplastic and water bacterial communities potentially revealing their distinct ecosystem functions table s3 nine otus belonging to proteobacteria and 1 otu belonging to nitrospirae were characterized as keystone genera for the bacterial communities on microplastics however the keystone genera for planktonic bacterial communities belonged to chlorobi 1 actinobacteria 6 saccharibacteria 1 bacteroidetes 1 and proteobacteria 1 most of the putative keystone otus for microplastic bacterial communities were associated with xenobiotics biodegradation for instance the otu5309 otu2067 and otu5929 from the genera sphingomonas pseudomonas and novosphingobium respectively have been shown to degrade complex organic contaminants such as crude oil chloro nitro phenolics and large polymers balkwill et al 1997 kaech et al 2005 kampfer et al 2018 moreover proteobacteria were found to carry many mobile integrons and integrase genes in variant habitats gillings 2014 the results of keystone genera in the microplastic bacterial community may indicate that the plastisphere serves as a microenvironment for horizontal gene transfer 3 5 occurrence of args and integrase genes the relative abundances of the 25 args gene copies of args normalized to the gene copies of 16s rrna were calculated for all water and microplastic samples to minimize the variation caused by the difference in bacterial abundances contrary to several previous observations that args were enriched by microplastics wu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 the arg relative abundances were lower on microplastics than those in water samples for example the relative abundances of the target args ranged from 7 9 10 3 to 5 7 10 2 copies 16s rrna on microplastics which were significantly anova p 0 001 lower than the values in water samples 2 3 6 4 10 2 copies 16s rrna however several subtypes of args showed higher relative abundances on microplastic particles such as tetm tets and tetw to further estimate the differences of arg profiles between microplastic and water samples the detected args were analyzed using pcoa even though the microplastic samples appeared to be a little more scattered they were still separated from the water samples by principal component 1 suggesting distinct arg profiles between these two type samples moreover the adonis results indicated the separation was statistically significant r 2 0 377 p 0 001 microplastics have been presented as a reservoir for args and further a vector leading to a potential worldwide threat to the ecosystem and human health by analyzing the metagenomic data of plastic particles from the north pacific gyre yang et al 2019 first reported that the relative abundance of total args 64 subtypes in microplastics was significantly greater than that for seawater anova p 0 05 wu et al 2019 also observed that the arg abundance 188 subtypes on polyvinyl chloride microplastic pellets was approximately 3 fold higher than that of river water under experimental conditions compared to metagenomic analysis traditional pcr based methods were limited by the availability of primers and by amplification bias thus the results via qpcr in this study may not afford an unbiased and broad spectrum survey of the arg pollution in water and microplastic samples further studies based on high throughput sequencing methods are required to obtain a comprehensive overview on the diversity and phylogenetic distribution of args to investigate whether the arg profiles correlated with the bacterial composition procrustes analysis and mantel test on the basis of bray curtis dissimilarity metrics were performed as shown in fig 7 the procrustes analysis revealed a significant correlation p 0 003 9999 permutations between args profiles and bacterial community composition in water and microplastic samples with the procrustes sum of squares m 2 0 7165 the mantel test further confirmed a significant correlation between args and bacteria p 0 0001 9999 permutations both results suggested that the distinct pattern of antibiotic resistome between water and microplastics may be potentially linked to that of the microbiome additionally the co occurrence pattern between args and bacterial taxa indicated that the water args may be mainly contained in firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria while the microplastic args may be primarily linked to proteobacteria figs s8 and s9 see fig 8 integron integrase genes were important indicators of horizontal gene transfer specifically the class 1 integron integrase gene was represented as a proxy for anthropogenic arg contamination gillings et al 2015 the relative abundances of class 1 and 2 integron integrase genes inti1 and inti2 were investigated in this study and the results indicated higher concentrations on microplastic particles for example the mean normalized abundance of inti1 was approximately 2 5 times higher on the microplastics 6 8 10 4 copies 16s rrna than in the water 2 7 10 4 copies 16s rrna however the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 while for inti2 the relative abundance was 6 4 10 3 copies 16s rrna which was significantly p 0 01 greater than that in water compared with the planktonic bacteria the physical proximity between bacteria on microplastics is closer which may favor the contact between surface attached bacteria and thus trigger the mobilization of integron integrase genes horizontal gene transfer is one of the crucial reasons for the propagation of increased antibiotic resistance potentially suggesting that microplastics can enhance the spread of args moreover some opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas have been shown on the microplastics higher abundances of integron integrase genes on microplastics may facilitate the specific pathogens to acquire args and increase their drug resistance organic aggregates in water were found to provide a favorable microhabitat for bacteria in general and specifically aquatic pathogens lyons et al 2010 similarly microplastics can be considered as a more robust microhabitat due to their polymer compositions and the sorbed organic matters considering their capacity to spread globally previous studies have highlighted the role of microplastics in transporting args yan et al 2020 therefore microplastics in the aquatic environments may emerge as a preferred niche and a vector for disseminating args and pathogens to a new environment enhancing their potential the risks to ecological safety and human health 4 conclusions this study clearly showed that microplastics provided a unique microhabitat for distinct bacterial assemblages in the freshwater environment the bacterial communities on microplastics were significantly different from the planktonic bacteria in the urban rivers as verified by taxa compositions community separation patterns biomarker species and metabolic pathways the network analysis indicated that the biofilm formed on microplastics was a whole robust community and that the keystone species mainly belonged to proteobacteria although the total abundances of the 25 target args were lower on microplastics the arg profiles were still significantly different between microplastics and water samples additionally the relative abundances of inti1 and inti2 on microplastics were higher than those in water potentially indicating greater horizontal gene transfer for args microplastics can be considered as a novel important microhabitat for the colonization and migration of microorganisms especially for the opportunistic pathogens which may increase the risks to the ecosystem and human health further studies are needed to investigate the effects of environmental factors and plastic characteristics e g polymer type shape and

17783,fluidized bed reactor fenton fbr fenton process was adopted for reverse osmosis concentrate roc treatment with three types of carriers including sand zeolite and granular activated carbon gac adsorption studies demonstrated that gac achieved the best adsorption performance maximum cod removal of 78 in 15 h among the three carriers and the adsorption of roc organic matters followed a two stage adsorption model fenton oxidations were carried out in three fluidized beds after column saturation and fbr fenton gac process achieved highest cod removal 72 and most bod5 cod ratio enhancement from 0 03 to 0 3 in roc long term operation data demonstrated good performance stability of gac as the carrier in addition gac fluidized bed obtained highest total iron removal rate via iron crystallization process continuous in situ gac regeneration with more than 90 recoveries of surface area pore volume and adsorption capacity were observed along the roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process mechanism studies revealed that better cod removal performance in fbr fenton gac process was attributed to the combining effects of homogenous fenton reaction gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis concentrate fluidized bed reactor fenton granular activated carbon organics removal regeneration 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro has been widely applied in reclamation of secondary effluent in industrial wastewater treatment reverse osmosis concentrate roc comprises 10 20 of the feed water volume and contains almost all the contaminants presented in the original wastewater at levels of 6 7 times higher al rifai et al 2007 mauguin and corsin 2005 treatment of roc from industrial water reuse is especially challenging due to the inhibitory properties of recalcitrant organic pollutants the need to meet stringent discharge standard and variable inorganic compositions in the water matrix a widely recognized efficient treatment alternative of wastewater containing recalcitrant compounds is the use of advanced technologies based on chemical oxidation such as the advanced oxidation processes aops aops typically involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh which are capable of oxidizing most organic compounds without restriction to specific classes or groups of compounds several aop technologies such as uv photocatalysis fenton processes ozonation and electrochemical oxidation processes were reported to be effective for organics removal in roc benner et al 2008 fernandes et al 2017 hurwitz et al 2014

a modified fenton process by conducting fenton reaction in a fluidized bed reactor which could synergistically combine the effectiveness of homogeneous fenton and sludge reduction of heterogeneous fenton boonrattanakij et al 2018 most fluidized materials used in fbr fenton system are inert solids and they are defined as carriers which provide available sites for iron hydroxides crystallization and precipitation and hence reduce the sludge production in fenton reaction different carriers have been adopted in fbr fenton process including sio2 sand al2o3 fe2o3 granular activated carbon gac ceramsite and bricks particle anotai et al 2012 bello et al 2019 boonrattanakij et al 2018 briones et al 2012 chen et al 2015 liu et al 2014 lyu et al 2016 matira et al 2015 su et al 2011 2013 most carrier studies aimed to select the best carrier with highest iron removal efficiency though the reported results did not agree well with each other meanwhile long term performance stability of selected carrier was seldom assessed fenton driven regeneration of spent gac has been reported with effective regeneration efficiency of more than 90 with minimal loss of carbon surface area pore volume and adsorption capacity huling and hwang 2010 huling et al 2005 toledo et al 2003 in an fbr fenton reaction system that gac is utilized as the carrier besides promoting iron crystallization gac carrier could also facilitate organics removal through the adsorption process after fenton reaction are initiated in the fluidized bed reactor in situ gac regeneration and bulk organics decomposition would occur simultaneously as organics oxidation could concurrently take place in the bulk solution carbon pores and gac surfaces this in situ gac regeneration would enhance overall organics removal efficiency by combining gac adsorption and fenton oxidation processes as well as increase the lifetime of gac carrier used in fbr fenton system it is known that activated carbon ac could act as an electron transfer catalyst for h2o2 activation and radicals would be formed on ac surface through the following reactions kimura and miyamoto 1994 1a a c h 2 o 2 a c o h h o 2a a c h 2 o 2 a c h o 2 h radicals generation and effective organics degradation in catalytic ac h2o2 process have been reported in several studies huang et al 2003 reported effective catalytic decomposition of h2o2 in the presence of chemical modified gac the gac h2o2 reaction system achieved higher degradation efficiency of 4 chlorophenol than that in single gac adsorption process georgi et al georgi and kopinke 2005 demonstrated effective oh formation in ac h2o2 process with radical quenching studies more than 90 removal of methyl tert butyl ether was also observed in ac h2o2 suspension system in fbr fenton based treatment system the organics removal could be attributed to four mechanisms 1 homogenous fenton reaction 2 heterogeneous fenton reaction between immobilized irons and h2o2 3 adsorption to the carriers and 4 catalytic reaction between carriers and h2o2 for oh generation in recent years fbr fenton process has been adopted for pharmaceuticals removal thin film transistor liquid crystal displays wastewater textile wastewater and silicon wastewater treatment guo et al 2018 matira et al 2015 chen et al 2015 lyu et al 2016 liu et al 2014 contribution of each individual process to bulk organics removal has not been clearly addressed in the recent studies as well as how the carriers take part in organics removal the present study focused on roc treatment in fbr fenton system with three types of carriers including sand zeolite and gac performances of the three fbr fenton systems were evaluated based on chemical oxygen demand cod removal biodegradability enhancement and iron removal in roc along the roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process gac performance stability in situ gac regeneration as well as the gac adsorption performance for cod removal in roc were evaluated contribution of each above mentioned organics removal mechanism to bulk cod reduction in roc was also assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and roc samples hydrogen peroxide 30 ferrous sulfate heptahydrate 99 sodium hydroxide pellets 98 sulfuric acid 95 98 catalase from bovine liver lyophilized powder 2000 5000 units mg protein and 4 chlorobenzoic acid pcba 99 were procured from

treated by a mf ro system to produce the reclaimed water table 1 summarizes the characteristics of roc samples collected over a 1 year period the collected roc samples were stored at 4 c and brought

with a diameter of 7 cm and a height of 78 cm each fbr column was fixed with a water distributor at the bottom and packed with one type of carriers sand zeolite and gac packing volume of each carrier

and system flow rate was 2l h effluent of each fbr column was collected for subsequent cod analysis 2 3 fbr fenton process after column adsorption studies batch fbr fenton reactions were carried out in sand zeolite and gac fbr columns ph of roc water was firstly adjusted with 5m h2so4 solution specific amount of 30 h2o2 and 2m feso4 7h2o stock solutions were dosed into the three fbr fenton columns to initiate the oxidation process optimum operation condition of fbr fenton process has been determined in a previous study cai et al 2019 with ph of 3 10 mm h2o2 and 1 25 mm fe2 in the reaction system internal circulation rate of each fbr column was maintained at 0 5l min and the bed expansion rate was maintained at 30 total reaction durations of three fbr fenton processes were all 60min 10 ml roc samples were withdrawn at selected intervals collected roc samples were firstly neutralized with 0 5m naoh solution followed by adding 50 μl of 2000 5000 unit ml catalase for h2o2 quenching after 2 h settling supernatants were collected for water quality analysis continuous fbr fenton system consisted of one influent tank one neutralization tank one fbr fenton column one circulation pump one feed pump and one chemical dosing system the total working volume was 5l hydraulic retention time hrt was 1 h and internal circulation rate is 10 times higher than the system flow

subsequent sample preparations were carried out with the same protocols used in batch fbr fenton studies 2 4 carriers characterization surface morphologies of three carriers before and after fenton reaction were characterized with scanning electron microscopy sem images by using zeiss microscope sigma 500 crystal structures of virgin gac and iron coated gac were characterized by the x ray powder diffraction xrd spectroscopy d8 discover bruker axs element composition was analyzed by the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultra kratos surface area and pore structure of gac samples were determined by low temperature n2 adsorption at 196 c using a micromeritics asap 2020apparatus and samples were pretreated by degassing at 100 c for 420min 2 5 analytical methods cod and 5 day bod tests were conducted for roc samples in accordance with apha standard method 5220d 5210b 1998 2 5 times dilution with milliq water was performed for each roc sample to overcome the interference of high chloride concentration a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa was used to determine the cod level in roc total iron content in roc sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 5110 agilent usa gac iodine number measurement was conducted according to the procedures defined by astm international d4607 94 2001 methylene blue number analysis was carried out using gb standard method gb t 12496 10 1999 oh exposures during different roc treatment processes were determined from 400 μg l pcba degradation kinetics using eq 3 elovitz and von gunten

experiments were firstly conducted with the selected carriers only gac and zeolite achieved significant cod removal in roc the equilibrium data obtained from the adsorption experiments were fitted to freundlich model and langmuir model fig 1 depicts the adsorption models of roc organic matters using gac and zeolite the fitted values of parameters in freundlich model and langmuir model for cod removal are summarized in table 2 it was found that gac adsorption data exhibited a two stage linearized expressions fig 1a and b when equilibrium cod level was less than 20 mg l ce 20 mg l gac adsorption data were better fitted to freundlich model with higher correlation coefficient r2 0 9648 comparing to langmuir model r2 0 8834 it was noted that gac exhibited poor adsorption characteristics at the first stage as the amount of cod adsorbed on gac surface increased slowly with higher initial cod level presented in roc low magnitude of the exponent n n 0 4 1 also suggested low favorability of gac adsorption at the second stage where equilibrium cod level was higher than 20 mg l ce 20 mg l gac adsorption data could be well fitted to both freundlich model r2 0 9735 and langmuir model r2 0 9820 in freundlich model high magnitude of the exponent n n 2 13 1 suggested gac to be a good adsorbent for cod removal in roc in langmuir model the predicted maximum adsorption capacity was estimated to be 0 56 mg g in terms of roc organic matters adsorption on zeolite surface fig 1c and d freundlich model better described the equilibrium data due to higher correlation coefficient r2 0 9769 comparing to gac adsorption model zeolite adsorption model obtained lower n value of 1 69 indicating gac was the better adsorbent for organics removal in roc column adsorption experiments were carried out by continuously feeding the roc water into sand gac and zeolite fluidized bed columns the cod removal curves of three carriers are shown in fig 2 sand exhibited negligible adsorption of roc organic matters and gac achieved higher cod removal efficiency than zeolite during the adsorption process with an initial cod level of 92 mg l zeolite and gac fluidized bed could achieve maximum cod removal of 50 and 78 within 15 h respectively lyu et al 2016 reported 65 cod removal in dye wastewater with single gac column adsorption and bello et al 2020 reported 28 cod removal in reactive black 5 solution through gac carrier adsorption both studies indicated that gac carrier adsorption could significantly enhance the overall organics removal efficiency of fbr fenton process column saturation in zeolite fluidized bed occurred at 50 h and in gac fluidized bed the column saturation occurred at 60 h 3 2 fbr fenton process for roc treatment 3 2 1 performances of fbr fenton processes with three carriers after column saturation fenton reagents were dosed into the three fluidized bed columns to initiate the fenton reaction for roc treatment the optimal operation conditions were previously determined as 1 25 mm fe2 10 mm h2o2 and ph of 3 cai et al 2019 fig 3 demonstrates roc treatment performances of fbr fenton processes with three carriers during the 60min reaction fbr fenton gac process obtained highest cod removal efficiency of 72 fbr fenton zeolite and fbr fenton sand process achieved 52 and 40 of cod removal in roc respectively in fbr fenton gac process cod level in roc was reduced from 108 mg l to 30 mg l in addition to organics removal higher biodegradability enhancement in roc was observed in gac fluidized bed column after fbr fenton gac process the average bod5 cod ratio in roc was increased from 0 03 to 0 3 while the increment of bod5 cod ratio during fbr fenton zeolite and fbr fenton sand process was limited with a final value of 0 17 and 0 12 respectively in real practice carriers will be used repeatedly for a certain period of time in the fluidized bed reactor hence it is important to characterize carrier s performance stability in a long term application 50 cycles of fbr fenton gac process were firstly performed to treat same batch of roc water and the results are shown in fig 4 during the long term operation of fbr fenton gac process the overall cod removal efficiency in roc was 72 with an average influent cod of 108 mg l and an average effluent cod of 23 mg l final cod removal efficiencies obtained among the 50 cycles were all above 70 indicating good stability of gac as the carrier continuous flow fbr fenton processes using three carriers were further conducted for roc treatment with same operation conditions table 3 summarizes 2 month performance data of the three fbr fenton processes similar with the results obtained in batch studies fbr fenton gac process consistently achieved higher cod removal efficiency comparing to fbr fenton zeolite and fbr fenton sand processes with an average influent cod of 85 mg l the average effluent cod in gac fluidized bed column was 28 mg l with a total cod removal efficiency of 67 the continuous study results agreed well the batch study results further validating the performance stability of fbr fenton gac process in a long term application as previously mentioned most fbr fenton studies demonstrated carrier materials properties and capabilities for total iron removal while in the present study both batch experiment and long term application results demonstrated that gac carrier could enhance cod removal efficiency this might be attributed to good adsorption capacity of gac with large surface and pore volume previous adsorption studies also demonstrated higher cod removal efficiency in gac adsorption process huling et al huling and hwang 2010 reported effective regeneration of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe spent gac with fenton process in which the immobilized mtbe was oxidized and degraded during the fenton process in another study conducted by an et al 2015 nom saturated gac was successfully regenerated with uv persulfate oxidation process findings of these two studies suggested that in the present roc treatment study gac regeneration might continuously occur along the fbr fenton process promoted cod removal efficiency in fbr fenton gac process might be due to the synergistic effects of three processes gac adsorption fenton oxidation and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction in each operation cycle of roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process one portion of organics was removed by fenton oxidation another portion of organics was adsorbed on gac surface and these immobilized organics were subsequently oxidized by oh generated in fenton and gac h2o2 reactions in fbr fenton gac reaction system bulk organics removal and gac regeneration simultaneously occurred thus free active sites in gac was recovered and gac adsorption capacity was constantly maintained throughout the treatment process gac regeneration during roc treatment process will be further investigated in the following parts 3 2 2 total iron removal and iron crystallization during the roc treatment with fbr fenton process total iron removals in gac zeolite and sand columns were monitored and fig 5 depicts the iron removal efficiencies of three fbr fenton processes in their first operation cycles significant iron removal occurred within the first 10min of fenton reaction in the three columns gac fluidized bed achieved highest total iron removal of 93 4 followed by 60 5 and 36 1 in zeolite and sand fluidized bed respectively in the subsequent operation cycles of 3 6 and 10 gac constantly achieved higher total iron removal efficiency comparing to zeolite and sand in the study conducted by lyu et al 2016 gac was also reported to be the better carrier for iron removal and this could be owning to its higher surface area total iron removal in fbr fenton gac system was monitored till the 35th operation cycle and the results are presented in fig 6 it was found that the iron removal rate significantly dropped in the first 10 operation cycles and tended to slowly decrease along the subsequent operation cycles after 20 operation cycles total iron removal during each fenton reaction was less than 10 mg and it gradually became negligible after 30 operation cycles a fitted correlation between operation cycle number and iron removal was established based on the regression analysis based on this correlation r2 0 996 total iron removal in each operation cycle of fbr fenton gac process could be calculated as well as the accumulated iron on gac surface after each operation cycle notable iron immobilization occurred in the first 10 operation cycles followed by slower iron accumulation on gac surface along the subsequent operation cycles by the end of 35th operation cycle total accumulated iron amount was 1 021g and the iron gac mass ratio was 0 19 mechanisms of iron immobilization on gac surface include ligand complexation ion exchange adsorption and precipitation hegenberger et al 1987 pakuła et al 1998 in the fbr fenton system fe2 would be converted to fe3 over a very short period of time after the fenton reaction has been initiated within the ph range of fenton process most fe3 would be precipitated in the form of amorphous iron hydroxide ferrihydrite cudennec and lecerf 2006 iron hydroxide precipitates would further deposit on foreign particle gac to start the heterogeneous crystallization process therefore precipitation is suggested to be the dominant iron immobilization mechanism in the fbr fenton gac system comparing to zeolite and sand gac has porous structure and larger specific surface area providing good surface properties for iron hydroxide deposition and crystallization thus gac achieved higher total iron removal efficiency in each operation cycle significant drop of iron removal efficiency along the operation cycles could be due to less available foreign surface for heterogeneous nucleation of iron hydroxide surface morphologies of the three carriers before and after fbr fenton process were characterized with sem analysis as shown in fig 7 before fenton oxidation the three carriers all obtained smooth surfaces fig 7a c and 7e after 20 cycle operation there were lots of impurities and particles generated on the surface of sand while zeolite and gac had rough and scaling surfaces these results demonstrated that iron crystallization occurred on the surfaces of three carriers to investigate the crystal structures of iron oxide species coated on gac surface xrd patterns of virgin gac and 20 cycle gac were characterized as shown in fig 8 virgin gac and 20 cycle gac shared similar xrd patterns peak at 2θ 26 3 corresponded to a highly graphitized fraction in activated carbon while the weak and broad peak at 2θ 43 5 indicated that the 100 and 101 peaks merged and yielded a single 10 reflection demonstrating a relatively higher degree of randomness in the carbon materials dandekar et al 1998 jänes et al 2007 no other specific diffraction peaks corresponding to iron oxide species were detected in the xrd patterns this might be due to low level of immobilized irons on gac surface based on the regression analysis presented in fig 6 iron gac mass ratio in 20 cycle gac was as low as 0 162 variations of gac element compositions through fbr fenton and iron crystallization processes were further investigated with xps analysis fig 9 a shows the full xps profiles of virgin gac and 20 cycle gac information on peaks binding energy and area percentage is summarized in table s1 it was found that o and c were the major elements in the two gac samples in high resolution xps spectra of o 1s fig 9b two fitting peaks at the binding energy of 332 0 ev and 333 1 ev corresponded to hydroxyl and carbonyl groups respectively the specific fitting peak at 536 0 ev was ascribed to adsorbed water molecules notably no expected metal oxide peaks were detected in 20 cycle gac which could be due to low iron content on the gac surface in addition the fitted peaks of metal oxide with binding energy between 530 1 ev and 530 6 ev might overlap with the high intensity hydroxyl group peak at 532 0 ev xu et al 2008 zhou et al 2007 while it was noted that after 20 cycle fbr fenton reaction the peak area percentage of hydroxyl group increased from 31 3 to 36 7 which indirectly indicate deposition of ferric hydroxide on the gac surface and generation of hydroxyl groups during the fenton like process according to high resolution xps of c 1s profile fig 9c graphitized c was found to be the dominant c component in virgin gac and 20 cycle gac with same peak area percentage of 59 1 this result agreed well with the xrd analysis result indicating highly graphitized fraction in gac the peaks with binding energy appearing at 286 0ev and 287 3ev corresponded to c in phenolic alcohol groups and c in carbonyl groups respectively these two groups of organics typically represent those intermediates generated during the oxidation of humic substances higher peak area percentages of these two c components observed in 20 cycle gac demonstrated adsorption of organic intermediates generated during humic substances degradation which were the dominant organic species in roc water cai et al 2019 furthermore high resolution xps of fe 2p profile fig 9d suggested that fe was not detected in virgin gac while small peaks with binding energy at around 711 7 ev and 726 5 ev were detected in 20 cycle gac these two peaks corresponded to fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 in iron oxides respectively 4 5 suggesting the crystallization of iron precipitates on gac surface impacts of these immobilized irons on gac regeneration and heterogeneous fenton oxidation for cod removal in roc were further investigated results are presented and discussed in the following parts 3 3 gac regeneration surface area and pore structure are important physical properties related with gac adsorption capacity to assess gac regeneration efficiency brunauer emmett teller bet surface area external surface area and pore volume of gac samples used in different treatment processes were characterized and the results are shown in table 4 after column saturation gac bet surface area and total pore volume was reduced by 46 and 43 respectively due to adsorbed organics on gac surface and pore blocking by the organics in roc after 3 cycles of fbr fenton gac process bet surface area of 3 cycle gac was recovered by 71 and 72 of total pore volume was recovered these results revealed that spent gac was regenerated in oh involved processes along with organics degradation in roc during the long term operation of fbr fenton gac process both bet surface area and total pore volume gradually increased with more operation cycles 10 cycle gac and 20 cycle gac indicating occurrence of continuous gac regeneration in the fenton reaction system in addition external surface area development in regenerated gac samples was found to be insignificant as the external surface area is not associated with micropores retained external surface area suggested that the original micropore surface was well maintained and therefore fenton oxidation did not induce significant loss of carbon microporosity and damage of carbon pore structure these results agreed well with the pore size distribution curve of virgin gac and 20 cycle gac fig s1 comparing to virgin gac 20 cycle gac exhibited certain loss of pore volume in the micropore region 2 nm while no increment of pore volume in the mesopore region 2 50 nm thus there was no conversion of micropores to mesopores during the regeneration process a good micropore volume recovery rate of 94 was observed in 20 cycle gac which could be attributed to the fully fluidized and acidic reaction conditions in fbr fenton system where the fenton reagents and generated hydroxyl radicals could effectively penetrate far into the microporous structure of gac and initiate carbon regeneration process kan and huling 2009 comparing the 20 cycle gac with virgin gac there were only 5 declines in bet surface area and pore volume this suggested that the 20 cycle gac regeneration with fenton oxidation were successfully carried out without significant deterioration of gac s physical structure and adsorption capacity the miner reduction of surface area and pore volume could be due to iron crystallization as ferric precipitates accumulated predominantly on the exterior of gac particle and resulted in gac pore blockage huling and hwang 2010 to further assess the regeneration of gac adsorption capacity in micropore 2 nm mesopore 2 50 nm and macropore regions 50 nm variations of iodine and methylene blue numbers for gac used along roc treatment were monitored and the results are illustrated in fig 10 iodine number defines the micropores of gac and therefore reflects its ability to adsorb small substances raposo et al 2009 as shown in fig 10a virgin gac obtained an iodine number of 778 mg g a drop of 82 in iodine number was observed for saturated gac suggesting loss of micropores at the column saturation stage after 3 cycles of fbr fenton gac process iodine number was increased from 142 to 725 mg g with a micropore adsorption capacity recovery rate of 93 this significant increment demonstrated that the microporosity in virgin gac could be regenerated in fbr fenton gac process fairly constant iodine number recovery was observed in the subsequent operation cycles and the recovered iodine number tended to be stable at 757 mg g after 45 operation cycles based on iodine number calculation 97 of gac micropore adsorption capacity was restored along roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process methylene blue number is related to the meso and macropore adsorption capacity of gac raposo et al 2009 after column saturation there was a 34 reduction in methylene number for saturated gac when compared to virgin gac after 3 cycles of fbr fenton gac process the methylene blue number was enhanced from 3450 to 4560 mg g revealing 87 recovery of meso and macropore adsorption capacity continuous enhancement of methylene blue number occurred from 10th to 40th operation cycle and stable methylene blue number of 5160 mg g was obtained after 45 operation cycles as calculated by methylene blue number 98 of gac meso and macropore adsorption capacity was regenerated during roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process 3 4 organics removal mechanisms to investigate how gac carrier and immobilized irons could facilitate organics removal in fbr fenton process series of control studies were conducted for roc treatment and their 1 h cod removal performances are summarized in fig 11 h2o2 alone process reduced the total cod level by 3 due to limited oxidizing capability of h2o2 for recalcitrant organics decomposition 50 cycle gac adsorption achieved a cod removal efficiency of 23 which was comparable to that of 24 in virgin gac adsorption process these results further confirmed effective in situ regeneration of gac carrier throughout the 50 cycles of fbr fenton gac process as well as minimal adverse effect of immobilized irons on gac adsorption capacity during the 1 h roc treatment gac h2o2 processes exhibited higher cod removal efficiencies than gac adsorption processes revealing the occurrence of catalytic reactions between gac and h2o2 for oh generation as shown in fig 11 both 50 cycle gac h2o2 and virgin gac h2o2 processes achieved around 30 cod removal in roc indicating the heterogeneous fenton reaction between immobilized irons and h2o2 was insignificant this could be attributed to low iron content on gac surface and low catalytic activity of ferrihydrite valentine and wang 1998 in addition acidic condition could maximize the catalytic property of gac in a way make the contribution of heterogeneous fenton reaction less significant fan et al 2006 reported similar acid black 24 decolorization efficiencies in gac h2o2 74 and iron oxide coated gac h2o2 76 at reaction ph of 2 classic fenton process achieved a final cod removal efficiency of 40 which contributed up to 55 of total cod removal in fbr fenton gac process this suggested homogenous fenton reaction to be one of the main organics removal mechanisms in fbr fenton gac reaction system in addition fbr fenton sand process also obtained a cod removal efficiency of 40 for roc treatment fig 3 indicating insignificant contribution of sand carriers to organics removal in conclusion gac carrier could promote cod removal in roc via gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction immobilized iron species were not able to initiate effective heterogeneous fenton reaction with h2o2 molecules based on roc treatment performance data the contribution to bulk cod reduction decreased in the order of homogenous fenton reaction gac adsorption gac h2o2 catalytic reaction fig 12 shows decomposition of pcba by oh oxidation in different controlled processes pseudo first rate constants for pcba decomposition and overall oh exposures in different processes are summarized in table s2 pcba concentrations decreased more quickly in fbr fenton gac and gac h2o2 processes oh exposure increased at considerably higher rates in fbr fenton gac process than classic fenton process indicating the catalytic activity between h2o2 and gac for oh generation the overall oh exposure achieved in fbr fenton gac was 2 89 10 10 m s and it was 2 8 times higher than that in classic fenton 7 62 10 11 m s during the 300 s pcba decomposition gac h2o2 process obtained even higher oh exposure of 1 60 10 10 m s than classic fenton while fig 11 demonstrates lower cod removal efficiency in 1 h roc treatment with gac h2o2 process this could be due to that higher cod loading retarded the reaction kinetics as the initial cod level ranged from 50 to 350 mg l and the initial concentration of pcba was only 400 μg l furthermore without process optimization for effective h2o2 decomposition h2o2 could be overdosed in the gac h2o2 process where the residual h2o2 molecules could scavenge oh at a rate constant of 4 5 107 m 1s 1 sychev and isak 1995 this radical scavenging would not affect pcba decomposition as the rate constant of reaction between pcba and oh is known as 5 2 109 m 1s 1 but it definitely inhibited radical oxidation for cod removal therefore lower cod removal in roc was observed with gac h2o2 process it was also found that fbr fenton zeolite and fbr fenton sand processes achieved similar pcba decomposition rates and oh exposures with classic fenton process these data suggested that catalytic effects of zeolite and sand carriers for oh generation were not significant and catalytic reaction between gac and h2o2 contributed to higher oxidation capability of fbr fenton gac process 4 conclusion the results obtained in the present study demonstrated that implementation of gac carrier in fbr fenton process for roc treatment could enhance recalcitrant organics removal average cod level in roc was reduced from 85 to 28 mg l control and mechanism studies verified that in fbr fenton gac system the main mechanisms for organics removal involve homogenous fenton reaction gac adsorption and catalytic reaction between gac and h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction was observed to be negligible due to low iron content on the gac surface and low catalytic activity of ferrihydrite more than 90 regeneration of gac s bet surface area pore volume adsorption capacity in micropores and mesopores were founded during the long term operation of fbr fenton gac process fenton oxidation did not result in significant deterioration of gac s physical structure and adsorption capacity immobilized iron species did not inhibit gac adsorption process for cod removal in roc besides of enhancing process effectiveness the observed in situ gac regeneration could also prolong gac lifetime and hence reduce the operating cost of fbr fenton process future pilot scale studies and economic analysis will be conducted to assess the cost effectiveness of fbr fenton gac process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

crystallization process continuous in situ gac regeneration with more than 90 recoveries of surface area pore volume and adsorption capacity were observed along the roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process mechanism studies revealed that better cod removal performance in fbr fenton gac process was attributed to the combining effects of homogenous fenton reaction gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis concentrate fluidized bed reactor fenton granular activated carbon organics removal regeneration 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro has been widely applied in reclamation of secondary effluent in industrial wastewater treatment reverse osmosis concentrate roc comprises 10 20 of the feed water volume and contains almost all the contaminants presented in the original wastewater at levels of 6 7 times higher al rifai et al 2007 mauguin and corsin 2005 treatment of roc from industrial water reuse is especially challenging due to the inhibitory properties of recalcitrant organic pollutants the need to meet stringent discharge standard and variable inorganic compositions in the water matrix a widely recognized efficient treatment alternative of wastewater containing recalcitrant compounds is the use of advanced technologies based on chemical oxidation such as the advanced oxidation processes aops aops typically involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh which are capable of oxidizing most organic compounds without restriction to specific classes or groups of compounds several aop technologies such as uv photocatalysis fenton processes ozonation and electrochemical oxidation processes were reported to be effective for organics removal in roc benner et al 2008 fernandes et al 2017 hurwitz et al 2014

a modified fenton process by conducting fenton reaction in a fluidized bed reactor which could synergistically combine the effectiveness of homogeneous fenton and sludge reduction of heterogeneous fenton boonrattanakij et al 2018 most fluidized materials used in fbr fenton system are inert solids and they are defined as carriers which provide available sites for iron hydroxides crystallization and precipitation and hence reduce the sludge production in fenton reaction different carriers have been adopted in fbr fenton process including sio2 sand al2o3 fe2o3 granular activated carbon gac ceramsite and bricks particle anotai et al 2012 bello et al 2019 boonrattanakij et al 2018 briones et al 2012 chen et al 2015 liu et al 2014 lyu et al 2016 matira et al 2015 su et al 2011 2013 most carrier studies aimed to select the best carrier with highest iron removal efficiency though the reported results did not agree well with each other meanwhile long term performance stability of selected carrier was seldom assessed fenton driven regeneration of spent gac has been reported with effective regeneration efficiency of more than 90 with minimal loss of carbon surface area pore volume and adsorption capacity huling and hwang 2010 huling et al 2005 toledo et al 2003 in an fbr fenton reaction system that gac is utilized as the carrier besides promoting iron crystallization gac carrier could also facilitate organics removal through the adsorption process after fenton reaction are initiated in the fluidized bed reactor in situ gac regeneration and bulk organics decomposition would occur simultaneously as organics oxidation could concurrently take place in the bulk solution carbon pores and gac surfaces this in situ gac regeneration would enhance overall organics removal efficiency by combining gac adsorption and fenton oxidation processes as well as increase the lifetime of gac carrier used in fbr fenton system it is known that activated carbon ac could act as an electron transfer catalyst for h2o2 activation and radicals would be formed on ac surface through the following reactions kimura and miyamoto 1994 1a a c h 2 o 2 a c o h h o 2a a c h 2 o 2 a c h o 2 h radicals generation and effective organics degradation in catalytic ac h2o2 process have been reported in several studies huang et al 2003 reported effective catalytic decomposition of h2o2 in the presence of chemical modified gac the gac h2o2 reaction system achieved higher degradation efficiency of 4 chlorophenol than that in single gac adsorption process georgi et al georgi and kopinke 2005 demonstrated effective oh formation in ac h2o2 process with radical quenching studies more than 90 removal of methyl tert butyl ether was also observed in ac h2o2 suspension system in fbr fenton based treatment system the organics removal could be attributed to four mechanisms 1 homogenous fenton reaction 2 heterogeneous fenton reaction between immobilized irons and h2o2 3 adsorption to the carriers and 4 catalytic reaction between carriers and h2o2 for oh generation in recent years fbr fenton process has been adopted for pharmaceuticals removal thin film transistor liquid crystal displays wastewater textile wastewater and silicon wastewater treatment guo et al 2018 matira et al 2015 chen et al 2015 lyu et al 2016 liu et al 2014 contribution of each individual process to bulk organics removal has not been clearly addressed in the recent studies as well as how the carriers take part in organics removal the present study focused on roc treatment in fbr fenton system with three types of carriers including sand zeolite and gac performances of the three fbr fenton systems were evaluated based on chemical oxygen demand cod removal biodegradability enhancement and iron removal in roc along the roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process gac performance stability in situ gac regeneration as well as the gac adsorption performance for cod removal in roc were evaluated contribution of each above mentioned organics removal mechanism to bulk cod reduction in roc was also assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and roc samples hydrogen peroxide 30 ferrous sulfate heptahydrate 99 sodium hydroxide pellets 98 sulfuric acid 95 98 catalase from bovine liver lyophilized powder 2000 5000 units mg protein and 4 chlorobenzoic acid pcba 99 were procured from

and system flow rate was 2l h effluent of each fbr column was collected for subsequent cod analysis 2 3 fbr fenton process after column adsorption studies batch fbr fenton reactions were carried out in sand zeolite and gac fbr columns ph of roc water was firstly adjusted with 5m h2so4 solution specific amount of 30 h2o2 and 2m feso4 7h2o stock solutions were dosed into the three fbr fenton columns to initiate the oxidation process optimum operation condition of fbr fenton process has been determined in a previous study cai et al 2019 with ph of 3 10 mm h2o2 and 1 25 mm fe2 in the reaction system internal circulation rate of each fbr column was maintained at 0 5l min and the bed expansion rate was maintained at 30 total reaction durations of three fbr fenton processes were all 60min 10 ml roc samples were withdrawn at selected intervals collected roc samples were firstly neutralized with 0 5m naoh solution followed by adding 50 μl of 2000 5000 unit ml catalase for h2o2 quenching after 2 h settling supernatants were collected for water quality analysis continuous fbr fenton system consisted of one influent tank one neutralization tank one fbr fenton column one

subsequent sample preparations were carried out with the same protocols used in batch fbr fenton studies 2 4 carriers characterization surface morphologies of three carriers before and after fenton reaction were characterized with scanning electron microscopy sem images by using zeiss microscope sigma 500 crystal structures of virgin gac and iron coated gac were characterized by the x ray powder diffraction xrd spectroscopy d8 discover bruker axs element composition was analyzed by the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultra kratos surface area and pore structure of gac samples were determined by low temperature n2 adsorption at 196 c using a micromeritics asap 2020apparatus and samples were pretreated by degassing at 100 c for 420min 2 5 analytical methods cod and 5 day bod tests were conducted for roc samples in accordance with apha standard method 5220d 5210b 1998 2 5 times dilution with milliq water was performed for each roc sample to overcome the interference of high chloride concentration a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa was used to determine the cod level in roc total iron content in roc sample was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 5110 agilent usa gac iodine number measurement was conducted according to the procedures defined by astm international d4607 94 2001 methylene blue number analysis was carried out using gb standard method gb t 12496 10 1999 oh exposures during different roc treatment processes were determined from 400 μg l pcba degradation kinetics using eq 3 elovitz and von gunten

experiments were firstly conducted with the selected carriers only gac and zeolite achieved significant cod removal in roc the equilibrium data obtained from the adsorption experiments were fitted to freundlich model and langmuir model fig 1 depicts the adsorption models of roc organic matters using gac and zeolite the fitted values of parameters in freundlich model and langmuir model for cod removal are summarized in table 2 it was found that gac adsorption data exhibited a two stage linearized expressions fig 1a and b when equilibrium cod level was less than 20 mg l ce 20 mg l gac adsorption data were better fitted to freundlich model with higher correlation coefficient r2 0 9648 comparing to langmuir model r2 0 8834 it was noted that gac exhibited poor adsorption characteristics at the first stage as the amount of cod adsorbed on gac surface increased slowly with higher initial cod level presented in roc low magnitude of the exponent n n 0 4 1 also suggested low favorability of gac adsorption at the second stage where equilibrium cod level was higher than 20 mg l ce 20 mg l gac adsorption data could be well fitted to both freundlich model r2 0 9735 and langmuir model r2 0 9820 in freundlich model high magnitude of the exponent n n 2 13 1 suggested gac to be a good adsorbent for cod removal in roc in langmuir model the predicted maximum adsorption capacity was estimated to be 0 56 mg g in terms of roc organic matters adsorption on zeolite surface fig 1c and d freundlich model better described the equilibrium data due to higher correlation coefficient r2 0 9769 comparing to gac adsorption model zeolite adsorption model obtained lower n value of 1 69 indicating gac was the better adsorbent for organics removal in roc column adsorption experiments were carried out by continuously feeding the roc water into sand gac and zeolite fluidized bed columns the cod removal curves of three carriers are shown in fig 2 sand exhibited negligible adsorption of roc organic matters and gac achieved higher cod removal efficiency than zeolite during the adsorption process with an initial cod level of 92 mg l zeolite and gac fluidized bed could achieve maximum cod removal of 50 and 78 within 15 h respectively lyu et al 2016 reported 65 cod removal in dye wastewater with single gac column adsorption and bello et al 2020 reported 28 cod removal in reactive black 5 solution through gac carrier adsorption both studies indicated that gac carrier adsorption could significantly enhance the overall organics removal efficiency of fbr fenton process column saturation in zeolite fluidized bed occurred at 50 h and in gac fluidized bed the column saturation occurred at 60 h 3 2 fbr fenton process for roc treatment 3 2 1 performances of fbr fenton processes with three carriers after column saturation fenton reagents were dosed into the three fluidized bed columns to initiate the fenton reaction for roc treatment the optimal operation conditions were previously determined as 1 25 mm fe2 10 mm h2o2 and ph of 3 cai et al 2019 fig 3 demonstrates roc treatment performances of fbr fenton processes with three carriers during the 60min reaction fbr fenton gac process obtained highest cod removal efficiency of 72 fbr fenton zeolite and fbr fenton sand process achieved 52 and 40 of cod removal in roc respectively in fbr fenton gac process cod level in roc was reduced from 108 mg l to 30 mg l in addition to organics removal higher biodegradability enhancement in roc was observed in gac fluidized bed column after fbr fenton gac process the average bod5 cod ratio in roc was increased from 0 03 to 0 3 while the increment of bod5 cod ratio during fbr fenton zeolite and fbr fenton sand process was limited with a final value of 0 17 and 0 12 respectively in real practice carriers will be used repeatedly for a certain period of time in the fluidized bed reactor hence it is important to characterize carrier s performance stability in a long term application 50 cycles of fbr fenton gac process were firstly performed to treat same batch of roc water and the results are shown in fig 4 during the long term operation of fbr fenton gac process the overall cod removal efficiency in roc was 72 with an average influent cod of 108 mg l and an average effluent cod of 23 mg l final cod removal efficiencies obtained among the 50 cycles were all above 70 indicating good stability of gac as the carrier continuous flow fbr fenton processes using three carriers were further conducted for roc treatment with same operation conditions table 3 summarizes 2 month performance data of the three fbr fenton processes similar with the results obtained in batch studies fbr fenton gac process consistently achieved higher cod removal efficiency comparing to fbr fenton zeolite and fbr fenton sand processes with an average influent cod of 85 mg l the average effluent cod in gac fluidized bed column was 28 mg l with a total cod removal efficiency of 67 the continuous study results agreed well the batch study results further validating the performance stability of fbr fenton gac process in a long term application as previously mentioned most fbr fenton studies demonstrated carrier materials properties and capabilities for total iron removal while in the present study both batch experiment and long term application results demonstrated that gac carrier could enhance cod removal efficiency this might be attributed to good adsorption capacity of gac with large surface and pore volume previous adsorption studies also demonstrated higher cod removal efficiency in gac adsorption process huling et al huling and hwang 2010 reported effective regeneration of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe spent gac with fenton process in which the immobilized mtbe was oxidized and degraded during the fenton process in another study conducted by an et al 2015 nom saturated gac was successfully regenerated with uv persulfate oxidation process findings of these two studies suggested that in the present roc treatment study gac regeneration might continuously occur along the fbr fenton process promoted cod removal efficiency in fbr fenton gac process might be due to the synergistic effects of three processes gac adsorption fenton oxidation and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction in each operation cycle of roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process one portion of organics was removed by fenton oxidation another portion of organics was adsorbed on gac surface and these immobilized organics were subsequently oxidized by oh generated in fenton and gac h2o2 reactions in fbr fenton gac reaction system bulk organics removal and gac regeneration simultaneously occurred thus free active sites in gac was recovered and gac adsorption capacity was constantly maintained throughout the treatment process gac regeneration during roc treatment process will be further investigated in the following parts 3 2 2 total iron removal and iron crystallization during the roc treatment with fbr fenton process total iron removals in gac zeolite and sand columns were monitored and fig 5 depicts the iron removal efficiencies of three fbr fenton processes in their first operation cycles significant iron removal occurred within the first 10min of fenton reaction in the three columns gac fluidized bed achieved highest total iron removal of 93 4 followed by 60 5 and 36 1 in zeolite and sand fluidized bed respectively in the subsequent operation cycles of 3 6 and 10 gac constantly achieved higher total iron removal efficiency comparing to zeolite and sand in the study conducted by lyu et al 2016 gac was also reported to be the better carrier for iron removal and this could be owning to its higher surface area total iron removal in fbr fenton gac system was monitored till the 35th operation cycle and the results are presented in fig 6 it was found that the iron removal rate significantly dropped in the first 10 operation cycles and tended to slowly decrease along the subsequent operation cycles after 20 operation cycles total iron removal during each fenton reaction was less than 10 mg and it gradually became negligible after 30 operation cycles a fitted correlation between operation cycle number and iron removal was established based on the regression analysis based on this correlation r2 0 996 total iron removal in each operation cycle of fbr fenton gac process could be calculated as well as the accumulated iron on gac surface after each operation cycle notable iron immobilization occurred in the first 10 operation cycles followed by slower iron accumulation on gac surface along the subsequent operation cycles by the end of 35th operation cycle total accumulated iron amount was 1 021g and the iron gac mass ratio was 0 19 mechanisms of iron immobilization on gac surface include ligand complexation ion exchange adsorption and precipitation hegenberger et al 1987 pakuła et al 1998 in the fbr fenton system fe2 would be converted to fe3 over a very short period of time after the fenton reaction has been initiated within the ph range of fenton process most fe3 would be precipitated in the form of amorphous iron hydroxide ferrihydrite cudennec and lecerf 2006 iron hydroxide precipitates would further deposit on foreign particle gac to start the heterogeneous crystallization process therefore precipitation is suggested to be the dominant iron immobilization mechanism in the fbr fenton gac system comparing to zeolite and sand gac has porous structure and larger specific surface area providing good surface properties for iron hydroxide deposition and crystallization thus gac achieved higher total iron removal efficiency in each operation cycle significant drop of iron removal efficiency along the operation cycles could be due to less available foreign surface for heterogeneous nucleation of iron hydroxide surface morphologies of the three carriers before and after fbr fenton process were characterized with sem analysis as shown in fig 7 before fenton oxidation the three carriers all obtained smooth surfaces fig 7a c and 7e after 20 cycle operation there were lots of impurities and particles generated on the surface of sand while zeolite and gac had rough and scaling surfaces these results demonstrated that iron crystallization occurred on the surfaces of three carriers to investigate the crystal structures of iron oxide species coated on gac surface xrd patterns of virgin gac and 20 cycle gac were characterized as shown in fig 8 virgin gac and 20 cycle gac shared similar xrd patterns peak at 2θ 26 3 corresponded to a highly graphitized fraction in activated carbon while the weak and broad peak at 2θ 43 5 indicated that the 100 and 101 peaks merged and yielded a single 10 reflection demonstrating a relatively higher degree of randomness in the carbon materials dandekar et al 1998 jänes et al 2007 no other specific diffraction peaks corresponding to iron oxide species were detected in the xrd patterns this might be due to low level of immobilized irons on gac surface based on the regression analysis presented in fig 6 iron gac mass ratio in 20 cycle gac was as low as 0 162 variations of gac element compositions through fbr fenton and iron crystallization processes were further investigated with xps analysis fig 9 a shows the full xps profiles of virgin gac and 20 cycle gac information on peaks binding energy and area percentage is summarized in table s1 it was found that o and c were the major elements in the two gac samples in high resolution xps spectra of o 1s fig 9b two fitting peaks at the binding energy of 332 0 ev and 333 1 ev corresponded to hydroxyl and carbonyl groups respectively the specific fitting peak at 536 0 ev was ascribed to adsorbed water molecules notably no expected metal oxide peaks were detected in 20 cycle gac which could be due to low iron content on the gac surface in addition the fitted peaks of metal oxide with binding energy between 530 1 ev and 530 6 ev might overlap with the high intensity hydroxyl group peak at 532 0 ev xu et al 2008 zhou et al 2007 while it was noted that after 20 cycle fbr fenton reaction the peak area percentage of hydroxyl group increased from 31 3 to 36 7 which indirectly indicate deposition of ferric hydroxide on the gac surface and generation of hydroxyl groups during the fenton like process according to high resolution xps of c 1s profile fig 9c graphitized c was found to be the dominant c component in virgin gac and 20 cycle gac with same peak area percentage of 59 1 this result agreed well with the xrd analysis result indicating highly graphitized fraction in gac the peaks with binding energy appearing at 286 0ev and 287 3ev corresponded to c in phenolic alcohol groups and c in carbonyl groups respectively these two groups of organics typically represent those intermediates generated during the oxidation of humic substances higher peak area percentages of these two c components observed in 20 cycle gac demonstrated adsorption of organic intermediates generated during humic substances degradation which were the dominant organic species in roc water cai et al 2019 furthermore high resolution xps of fe 2p profile fig 9d suggested that fe was not detected in virgin gac while small peaks with binding energy at around 711 7 ev and 726 5 ev were detected in 20 cycle gac these two peaks corresponded to fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 in iron oxides respectively 4 5 suggesting the crystallization of iron precipitates on gac surface impacts of these immobilized irons on gac regeneration and heterogeneous fenton oxidation for cod removal in roc were further investigated results are presented and discussed in the following parts 3 3 gac regeneration surface area and pore structure are important physical properties related with gac adsorption capacity to assess gac regeneration efficiency brunauer emmett teller bet surface area external surface area and pore volume of gac samples used in different treatment processes were characterized and the results are shown in table 4 after column saturation gac bet surface area and total pore volume was reduced by 46 and 43 respectively due to adsorbed organics on gac surface and pore blocking by the organics in roc after 3 cycles of fbr fenton gac process bet surface area of 3 cycle gac was recovered by 71 and 72 of total pore volume was recovered these results revealed that spent gac was regenerated in oh involved processes along with organics degradation in roc during the long term operation of fbr fenton gac process both bet surface area and total pore volume gradually increased with more operation cycles 10 cycle gac and 20 cycle gac indicating occurrence of continuous gac regeneration in the fenton reaction system in addition external surface area development in regenerated gac samples was found to be insignificant as the external surface area is not associated with micropores retained external surface area suggested that the original micropore surface was well maintained and therefore fenton oxidation did not induce significant loss of carbon microporosity and damage of carbon pore structure these results agreed well with the pore size distribution curve of virgin gac and 20 cycle gac fig s1 comparing to virgin gac 20 cycle gac exhibited certain loss of pore volume in the micropore region 2 nm while no increment of pore volume in the mesopore region 2 50 nm thus there was no conversion of micropores to mesopores during the regeneration process a good micropore volume recovery rate of 94 was observed in 20 cycle gac which could be attributed to the fully fluidized and acidic reaction conditions in fbr fenton system where the fenton reagents and generated hydroxyl radicals could effectively penetrate far into the microporous structure of gac and initiate carbon regeneration process kan and huling 2009 comparing the 20 cycle gac with virgin gac there were only 5 declines in bet surface area and pore volume this suggested that the 20 cycle gac regeneration with fenton oxidation were successfully carried out without significant deterioration of gac s physical structure and adsorption capacity the miner reduction of surface area and pore volume could be due to iron crystallization as ferric precipitates accumulated predominantly on the exterior of gac particle and resulted in gac pore blockage huling and hwang 2010 to further assess the regeneration of gac adsorption capacity in micropore 2 nm mesopore 2 50 nm and macropore regions 50 nm variations of iodine and methylene blue numbers for gac used along roc treatment were monitored and the results are illustrated in fig 10 iodine number defines the micropores of gac and therefore reflects its ability to adsorb small substances raposo et al 2009 as shown in fig 10a virgin gac obtained an iodine number of 778 mg g a drop of 82 in iodine number was observed for saturated gac suggesting loss of micropores at the column saturation stage after 3 cycles of fbr fenton gac process iodine number was increased from 142 to 725 mg g with a micropore adsorption capacity recovery rate of 93 this significant increment demonstrated that the microporosity in virgin gac could be regenerated in fbr fenton gac process fairly constant iodine number recovery was observed in the subsequent operation cycles and the recovered iodine number tended to be stable at 757 mg g after 45 operation cycles based on iodine number calculation 97 of gac micropore adsorption capacity was restored along roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process methylene blue number is related to the meso and macropore adsorption capacity of gac raposo et al 2009 after column saturation there was a 34 reduction in methylene number for saturated gac when compared to virgin gac after 3 cycles of fbr fenton gac process the methylene blue number was enhanced from 3450 to 4560 mg g revealing 87 recovery of meso and macropore adsorption capacity continuous enhancement of methylene blue number occurred from 10th to 40th operation cycle and stable methylene blue number of 5160 mg g was obtained after 45 operation cycles as calculated by methylene blue number 98 of gac meso and macropore adsorption capacity was regenerated during roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process 3 4 organics removal mechanisms to investigate how gac carrier and immobilized irons could facilitate organics removal in fbr fenton process series of control studies were conducted for roc treatment and their 1 h cod removal performances are summarized in fig 11 h2o2 alone process reduced the total cod level by 3 due to limited oxidizing capability of h2o2 for recalcitrant organics decomposition 50 cycle gac adsorption achieved a cod removal efficiency of 23 which was comparable to that of 24 in virgin gac adsorption process these results further confirmed effective in situ regeneration of gac carrier throughout the 50 cycles of fbr fenton gac process as well as minimal adverse effect of immobilized irons on gac adsorption capacity during the 1 h roc treatment gac h2o2 processes exhibited higher cod removal efficiencies than gac adsorption processes revealing the occurrence of catalytic reactions between gac and h2o2 for oh generation as shown in fig 11 both 50 cycle gac h2o2 and virgin gac h2o2 processes achieved around 30 cod removal in roc indicating the heterogeneous fenton reaction between immobilized irons and h2o2 was insignificant this could be attributed to low iron content on gac surface and low catalytic activity of ferrihydrite valentine and wang 1998 in addition acidic condition could maximize the catalytic property of gac in a way make the contribution of heterogeneous fenton reaction less significant fan et al 2006 reported similar acid black 24 decolorization efficiencies in gac h2o2 74 and iron oxide coated gac h2o2 76 at reaction ph of 2 classic fenton process achieved a final cod removal efficiency of 40 which contributed up to 55 of total cod removal in fbr fenton gac process this suggested homogenous fenton reaction to be one of the main organics removal mechanisms in fbr fenton gac reaction system in addition fbr fenton sand process also obtained a cod removal efficiency of 40 for roc treatment fig 3 indicating insignificant contribution of sand carriers to organics removal in conclusion gac carrier could promote cod removal in roc via gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction immobilized iron species were not able to initiate effective heterogeneous fenton reaction with h2o2 molecules based on roc treatment performance data the contribution to bulk cod reduction decreased in the order of homogenous fenton reaction gac adsorption gac h2o2 catalytic reaction fig 12 shows decomposition of pcba by oh oxidation in different controlled processes pseudo first rate constants for pcba decomposition and overall oh exposures in different processes are summarized in table s2 pcba concentrations decreased more quickly in fbr fenton gac and gac h2o2 processes oh exposure increased at considerably higher rates in fbr fenton gac process than classic fenton process indicating the catalytic activity between h2o2 and gac for oh generation the overall oh exposure achieved in fbr fenton gac was 2 89 10 10 m s and it was 2 8 times higher than that in classic fenton 7 62 10 11 m s during the 300 s pcba decomposition gac h2o2 process obtained even higher oh exposure of 1 60 10 10 m s than classic fenton while fig 11 demonstrates lower cod removal efficiency in 1 h roc treatment with gac h2o2 process this could be due to that higher cod loading retarded the reaction kinetics as the initial cod level ranged from 50 to 350 mg l and the initial concentration of pcba was only 400 μg l furthermore without process optimization for effective h2o2 decomposition h2o2 could be overdosed in the gac h2o2 process where the residual h2o2 molecules could scavenge oh at a rate constant of 4 5 107 m 1s 1 sychev and isak 1995 this radical scavenging would not affect pcba decomposition as the rate constant of reaction between pcba and oh is known as 5 2 109 m 1s 1 but it definitely inhibited radical oxidation for cod removal therefore lower cod removal in roc was observed with gac h2o2 process it was also found that fbr fenton zeolite and fbr fenton sand processes achieved similar pcba decomposition rates and oh exposures with classic fenton process these data suggested that catalytic effects of zeolite and sand carriers for oh generation were not significant and catalytic reaction between gac and h2o2 contributed to higher oxidation capability of fbr fenton gac process 4 conclusion the results obtained in the present study demonstrated that implementation of gac carrier in fbr fenton process for roc treatment could enhance recalcitrant organics removal average cod level in roc was reduced from 85 to 28 mg l control and mechanism studies verified that in fbr fenton gac system the main mechanisms for organics removal involve homogenous fenton reaction gac adsorption and catalytic reaction between gac and h2o2 heterogeneous fenton reaction was observed to be negligible due to low iron content on the gac surface and low catalytic activity of ferrihydrite more than 90 regeneration of gac s bet surface area pore volume adsorption capacity in micropores and mesopores were founded during the long term operation of fbr fenton gac process fenton oxidation did not result in significant deterioration of gac s physical structure and adsorption capacity immobilized iron species did not inhibit gac adsorption process for cod removal in roc besides of enhancing process effectiveness the observed in situ gac regeneration could also prolong gac lifetime and hence reduce the operating cost of fbr fenton process future pilot scale studies and economic analysis will be conducted to assess the cost effectiveness of fbr fenton gac process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17784,about 25 golf courses in ontario canada have environmental compliance approvals to use reclaimed water for irrigation where disinfection is confirmed through e coli limits a previous study at five ontario municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps confirmed that enteric viruses are less susceptible to disinfection than e coli when plants provided conventional secondary or tertiary treatment and routine chlorine or uv disinfection here we query whether these four treatment disinfection scenarios plus 60 day lagoon storage of disinfected effluent would be sufficient to reduce norovirus genogroups i and ii nov gi and gii risk of infection to tolerable levels for a golfer who incidentally ingests nov after handling wet golf balls at a golf course irrigated with reclaimed water we used our rt qpcr nov enumeration datasets from the four treatment disinfection scenarios above and modeled detected and non detected nov by bayesian inference in r monte carlo simulation included pre disinfection nov gi and gii gene copy densities ontario wwtp derived chlorine and uv log10 reductions literature derived effluent storage decay parameters and golfer ingested volumes followed by six different nov dose response dr models quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra results suggest that there is an unacceptable nov infection risk when using the conservative assumption that all detected nov particles rt qpcr gene copies are infectious in both aggregated or disaggregated form however after adjusting for pcr target sequences and for infectiousness using data from recently published studies on cultivation of human nov in human intestinal enteroids we noted a significant reduction of infection risk however this less conservative i e less protective assumption for water reuse applications such as golf course irrigation may not be corroborated until human nov are efficiently and routinely grown in cell cultures in addition further studies on drivers of nov risk estimation by dr models are needed e g the extent of nov particle aggregation resulting from wastewater treatment as well as the role of immunity meantime regulatory agencies could consider more stringent treatment disinfection requirements that target enteric viruses rather than e coli and testing of actual reclaimed irrigation waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords norovirus risk qmra irrigation gene copy to infectious unit ratio 1 introduction in many parts of the world water reuse is an important management consideration due to water scarcity and the geographic scope of water scarcity is likely to increase due to climate change hofste et al 2019 pedro monzonís et al 2015 golfing is a highly popular recreational activity where considerable resources are invested in maintenance and irrigation of greens for instance in 2009 the state of florida used 55 of its total reclaimed water for landscape irrigation and golf courses u s e p a 2012 usually reclaimed water regulatory requirements are in terms of wastewater treatment and disinfection technologies where indicator bacterial limits and minimum concentration time ct values of disinfectant are prescribed e g tertiary treatment no detectable indicator bacteria and total chlorine residuals in the range of 90 450 mg min l u s e p a 2012 c d p h 2018 enteric viruses may be present in reclaimed water applications such as landscape and golf course irrigation among others and may potentially pose a risk of infection for golfers asano et al 1992 olivieri and seto 2007 seto et al 2018 thus enteric viruses are explicitly addressed by california c d p h 2018 in its definition of tertiary disinfected reclaimed water where the disinfection process combined with the filtration process must achieve a 5 log10 reduction of plaque forming units of f bacteriophage ms2 or poliovirus or a virus as least as resistant to disinfection as poliovirus noroviruses novs were discovered in 1973 and are now widely recognized as the most prominent viral agents of acute gastrointestinal illness globally robilotti et al 2015 katayama and vinjé 2017 in the community transmission is foodborne including shellfish and waterborne but secondary cases among family members also occur hall and lopman 2016 however novs will not grow in routine cell cultures and are detected and quantified by molecular methods that target sequences of the rna genome not informing the extent to which these sequences represent infectious virus particles the first dose response dr model was developed by teunis et al 2008 where infection risks are assessed as a function of nov genome copies gc with virus particle aggregation or disaggregation defining lower bound or upper bound infection risk limits respectively van abel et al 2017 have reviewed studies using qmra to evaluate infection risks associated with drinking water direct and indirect potable reuse recreational water fresh and marine wastewater raw sewage sludge land applied biosolids effluent storm water irrigation water etc in parallel regulators are paying increased attention to enteric viruses in wastewater and recreational water and reviewing their water quality criteria to accommodate nov associated health risks for instance the u s e p a 2017 recognizes that enteric viruses cause most illnesses associated with recreational waters impacted by human sources and is exploring the use of coliphage viral indicator to supplement enterococcus and e coli bacterial indicators of recreational water quality in ontario canada currently there are circa 25 golf courses that utilize reclaimed water for irrigation under approval of the ministry of the environment conservation and parks mecp where e coli is used as the indicator of appropriate disinfection together with 60 day lagoon storage of the effluent ontario 2008 a unique quantitative nov dataset generated in a recent study of enteric viruses in the effluent from five ontario wastewater treatment plants simhon et al 2019 was used to inform a screening level quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra evaluating nov risks of infection illness in an exposure scenario where a golfer who recreates early in the day handles wet golf balls and incidentally ingests various doses of nov genome copies gc at a hypothetical golf course irrigated with reclaimed wastewater the night before using six different dose response models we present nov infection risk estimates when qmra assumes that all nov gcs represent infectious virus or a fraction thereof in either aggregated or disaggregated form 2 methods a methods schematic for this study appears in fig 1 we previously reported the results of full year monthly sampling at three wwtps providing secondary biological oxidation treatment and at two wwtps providing tertiary biological oxidation plus sand filtration treatment during 2014 2017 simhon et al 2019 treatment and disinfection methods are summarized in table 1 the total number of monthly paired pre and post disinfection samples for three secondary treatment plants was 34 out of a possible 36 12 3 minus two equipment malfunctions for two tertiary treatment plants the monthly number of paired samples was 24 out of 24 12 2 2 1 nov enumeration nov genogroup i and ii gi and gii were enumerated by rt qpcr per u s e p a method 1615 u s e p a 2014 concentrations of nov gi and gii in terms of gene copies per liter gc l were calculated per method 1615 taking into account the number of detected gc total dilution factor for volume reductions any dilution made to overcome inhibitory wastewater matrix effects gauged by spiked armored hepatitis g dna as well as the original volume sample that was assayed non detects were reported as gc l as above except that the number of gc was set to 1 while keeping in the formula the dilution factors and original volume sample that was assayed raw datasets for nov and enteroviruses are available in simhon et al 2019 2 2 modeling of nov concentrations in secondary and tertiary pre disinfection effluent nov gi and gii pre disinfection datasets of two tertiary wwtp effluents were combined together and likewise those of three secondary wwtp effluents because we wished to compare the effect of sand filtration in tertiary wwtps against no sand filtration in secondary wwtps as well as to increase the statistical power of the comparison a bayesian approach devleesschauwer et al 2017 together with jags 2017 and coda plummer et al 2006 within r was used see appendix a for simulated chain values under online supplementary material nov gi and gii concentration data gc l in treated pre disinfection effluent generated as bayesian modeled posteriors were fitted to distributions by oracle crystal ball 11 1 4 2015 and ranked by anderson darling goodness of fit statistic see appendix b under online supplementary material 2 3 log10 reductions lr 2 3 1 disinfection in order to define distribution parameters for disinfection log10 reductions lr of nov gi and gii we considered the following four treatment disinfection scenarios 1 uv lrs in tertiary treated effluent plant a 2 chlorine lrs in tertiary treated effluent plant c 3 chlorine lrs in secondary treated effluent plants d and e combined and 4 uv lrs in secondary treated effluent plant b gamma fitted bayesian posteriors for pre and post disinfection density values chains of 5000 values each were generated except for scenario 2 where gamma posteriors could not be generated likely because of 67 non detects see below for treatment disinfection scenarios 1 3 and 4 we took the 25th percentile minimum 50th percentile most likely and 75th percentile maximum and calculated nov gi and nov gii lrs skraber et al 2009 defining assumptions as beta pert distributions which are widely used in risk analysis project management body of knowledge 2013 we assumed that this would reduce uncertainty associated with 10th 90th or 5th 95th percentile values scenario 2 had a high percentage of non detects so we used left censored data estimation helsel 2012 lee 2017 to calculate lrs that were then fitted into a normal distribution with their respective mean and standard deviation parameters for nov gi and nov gii assumptions for disinfection lrs are summarized in table 2 2 3 2 storage decay lr lagoon storage is a treatment modality in ontario where effluents may be subsequently used to irrigate golf courses ontario 2008 we estimated nov gi and nov gii nucleic acid inactivation following 60 day lagoon storage by using two published models of indigenous nov gi and gii in wastewater skraber et al 2009 described a log linear indigenous nov gi inactivation in wastewater at 20 c slope 0 0445 t90 22 5 days 0 95 c i 15 4 29 5 days as well kauppinen and miettinen 2017 described a best fit log linear shoulder tail model of indigenous nov gii in wastewater at 21 c where the maximum achievable inactivation was 1 21 log10 which showed persistence up to the end of the study s 140 day observation period storage decay assumptions are summarized in table 2 2 3 3 nov infectiousness in this study we considered two infectiousness options separately 1 100 of nov particles detected as gc by rt qpcr are infectious van abel et al 2017 and 2 only a fraction of the virus particles is infectious for the latter we adjusted ingested doses by dividing by a factor of 1000 as follows i a factor of 10 accounted for the fact that our rt qpcr three sets of nov primers and probes targeted genetic sequences different from the one targeted by teunis et al 2008 to develop their dr model ii a factor of 100 to account for defective or growth limited virus per estes et al 2019 where human intestinal enteroids that were routinely seeded with 10 5 nov gc well recover nov tcid50 infectious doses of approximately 10 3 tcid50 gc well a ratio of 100 for the purposes of a monte carlo simulation these adjustments were defined as an additional log10 reduction where the ingested nov dose gc is effectively reduced by three orders of magnitude thus adjusted gcs that our golfer ingests could still be applied in the six dose response models employed in this study 2 4 exposure assessment 2 4 1 ingested volumes our assumptions on ingested volumes are based on literature derived values a golfer who recreates early in the day at a golf course that was irrigated with reclaimed water the night before and who handles wet golf balls may incidentally ingest 1 2 10 4 to 1 2 10 2 l 0 12 12 ml of reclaimed water olivieri and seto 2007 seto et al 2018 these assumptions have been described in detail by soller et al 2008 potential inactivation resulting from sunlight uv radiation evaporation and temperature was not considered 2 4 2 ingested dose in a feeding study subjects receive known doses of the pathogen and their clinical response is assessed however in this study s qmra evaluation doses are average doses here dose gc is equal to the nov concentration gc l times ingested volume l oracle s crystal ball was used to calculate nov gi and gii doses as follows eq 1 dose un adjusted for infectiousness pre disinf conc 10 disinf lr 10 storage lr ingested volume or eq 2 dose adjusted for infectiousness pre disinf conc 10 disinf lr 10 storage lr 10 infectious

additional targets recognized by pcr ingested volume distribution for ingested volumes n b see table 2 for monte carlo input parameter details 2 5 dose response dr models a stored stool extract of the original norwalk virus outbreak 8fiia now classified as norovirus hu gi 1 8fiia 1968 usa see ncbi txid1184498 and a secondary stool extract 8fiib from one of the in the infected subjects were used by teunis et al 2008 to develop their dr model norwalk virus inocula 8fiia 8fiib were titrated by rt pcr using specific primers for sequences located in the rna polymerase region however in this study nov gi and gii were enumerated per us epa method 1615 u s e p a 2014 using three sets of primers and probes of jothikumar et al 2005 and butot et al 2010 where standards are prepared from an armored rna reagent that contains the target sequences for the norovirus and hepatitis g virus primer probe sets thus even though our nov gcs were detected through different genetic target sequences we applied them to the different dr models see below as if they belonged to the norwalk gi 1 strain because the environmental decay of nov gi and nov gii in wastewater has been reported to be different under experimental storage conditions skraber et al 2009 kauppinen and miettinen 2017 in this study doses were calculated separately then summed assuming that both genogroups share the same dose response and used in four hypergeometric dose response dr models teunis et al 2008 with two levels of aggregation messner et al 2014 schmidt 2015 per gsl package of hankin 2006 2019 in r the fractional poisson model of messner et al 2014 was also used in crystal ball with two levels of aggregation dr parameters are summarized in table 3 we assumed a tolerable probability of infection of 2 7 10 7 per golfing day equivalent to the u s e p a implicit drinking water risk benchmark of 1 0 10 4 regli et al 1991 per person year with 365 exposures per year equation 3 and then solved for daily risk haas et al 2014 equation 4 eq 3 tolerable p infection per year 1 10 4 0 0001 1 1 p infection day 365 eq 4 tolerable p infection per golfing day 1 1 0 0001 1 365 the risk of illness given infection used a point estimate of 0 6 i e only 60 of those infected develop illness soller et al 2010 viau et al 2011 mcbride et al 2013 3 results 3 1 ingested doses table 3 summarizes the exposure assessment for four different treatment disinfection exposure scenarios as well as parameters for the six dose response dr models used ingested doses gc are presented un adjusted 10th to 90th percentile range 1 33 10 7 to 3 29 10 2 as well as adjusted for infectiousness 10th to 90th percentile range 1 44 10 10 to 4 72 10 1 adjusted doses were about three orders of magnitude lower table 3 tertiary treated uv or chlorine disinfected and 60 day lagoon stored reclaimed water treatment scenarios s1 and s2 produced lower nov gc doses than equivalent secondary treatments without sand filtration scenarios s3 and s4 it should be noted that wwtps in this study disinfecting with either uv light or chlorine did not target viruses but e coli fecal indicator nevertheless 60 day lagoon storage provided additional log reductions treatment scenario s1 tertiary treatment with uv disinfection and 60 day lagoon storage was the best performer i e produced the smallest doses in the exposure assessment and was chosen for evaluation with six different dr models 3 2 nov risk of infection 3 2 1 treatment disinfection scenario s1 using four hypergeometric and two fractional poisson dr models fig 2 a and b illustrate the probabilities of infection for a range of ingested nov gc doses un adjusted and adjusted for infectiousness respectively broken horizontal lines represent the daily risk benchmark of 2 7 10 7 a lower bound infection risk cluster m1 m2 m3 m5 dr models as well as an upper bound m4 and m6 dr models infection risk cluster are evident in both panels m3 dr model schmidt 2015 considers disaggregated particles however its risk estimates cluster as lower bound together with other aggregated particle dr models because this model applies a parameter of apparent immunity teunis hypergeometric models m1 and m4 gave a lower bound to upper bound median risk of infection range of 8 91 10 6 to 2 95 10 3 see below after exposure to un adjusted gc doses similarly messner s fractional poisson models m5 and m6 gave a median infection risk range of 4 58 10 6 to 5 05 10 3 the above ranges span 2 5 to 3 0 orders of magnitude respectively lower bound and upper bound estimates gave median risks of infection above the daily risk benchmark when exposure occurred with gc doses un adjusted for infectiousness fig 2a after adjusting for infectiousness only the two upper bound dr models m4 and m6 gave median risks of infection above the benchmark fig 2b 3 2 2 risk of infection estimates for four treatment disinfection scenarios s1 s4 using four hypergeometric dr models box plots in fig 3 a and b compare four treatment disinfection scenarios s1 s4 and their risk of infection per golfing day as estimated by four hypergeometric dr models m1 m4 where gc doses are unadjusted or adjusted for infectiousness respectively broken horizontal lines represent the 2 7 10 7 daily risk of infection benchmark of the four exposure treatment scenarios s1 tertiary treatment with uv disinfection plus 60 day storage was associated with the smallest doses and consequently produced the lowest risk of infection estimates whereas s4 secondary treatment with uv disinfection plus 60 day storage was the opposite scenarios s2 and s3 were somewhere in the middle with very similar doses even though s2 consisted of tertiary treated effluent with chlorine disinfection and low ammonia nitrogen while s3 consisted of effluent from two secondary chlorinating wwtps with no ammonia removal strategy in place all four hypergeometric dr models gave median risk of infection estimates above the 2 7 10 7 per golfing day benchmark with m4 teunis disaggregated producing the upper bound risk estimate by contrast m1 teunis aggregated m2 messner aggregated and m3 schmidt disaggregated with immunity gave very similar lower bound estimates after adjusting for infectiousness lower bound median risk of infection per golfing day for s1 s2 and s3 was below or very close to the benchmark please see table in appendix c under online supplementary material for probabilities of illness given infection for a range of un adjusted and adjusted gc doses evaluated by six dr models 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of nov densities and lrs we recently reported that nov gi gii were abundant in secondary disinfected and tertiary disinfected effluents at mean densities of 3 6 10 5 gc l and 2 7 10 4 gc l respectively which we have used in our nov database for this investigation routine chlorine or uv disinfection that targeted e coli indicator produced modest nov gi gii lrs of 0 5 0 8 simhon et al 2019 this was not totally unexpected as kingsley et al 2017 reported that human nov is not effectively inactivated by chlorine at levels normally used for wastewater disinfection our nov densities and lrs are consistent with values reported in the literature for instance katayama et al 2008 reported that noroviruses gi and gii were detected in post chlorination effluent from six japanese wwtps at geometric mean concentrations of 2 9 10 3 and 2 6 10 3 gc l respectively as well qiu et al 2015 in edmonton alberta canada detected nov in final uv disinfected effluent in 16 100 of samples at average concentrations of 2 3 10 4 gc l where the uv process accounted for a lr of 0 1 0 4 s d similarly qiu et al 2018 reported poor inactivation of nov gi and gii nucleic acid at two uv disinfecting wwtps in calgary alberta canada where mean densities in disinfected effluent ranged from 10 4 to 1 3 10 5 gc l and mean lrs from 0 1 to 0 2 by contrast seto et al 2018 reported efficient norovirus inactivation at a secondary treatment chlorine disinfecting plant in vacaville california where nov gi and gii were reduced from a median density of 5 3 10 3 and 6 0 10 3 gc l in raw sewage respectively to below the commercial kit s detection limit of 2 gc l 0 of 11 samples were positive in final chlorine disinfected effluent similarly alonso et al 2006 reported that hepatitis a virus enteroviruses and rotaviruses were not detected by rt qpcr in secondary effluent used to irrigate golf courses in spain and portugal while somatic coliphages were detected by culture 4 2 qmras of reclaimed water for golf course irrigation california s wastewater reclamation criteria have been evaluated through qmra using culturable enteric virus monitoring data and enterovirus dr models asano et al 1992 as well as with culturable enterovirus occurrence data and a rotavirus dr model olivieri and seto 2007 and more recently with an ms2 bacteriophage to enteric virus relationship and a rotavirus dr model seto et al 2018 nov is now recognized as the leading viral agent of acute gastrointestinal illness robilotti et al 2015 katayama and vinjé 2017 but seto et al 2018 cite the following limitations when analyzing nov risk of infection by qmra uncertainty with respect to dr model selection lack of regulatory agreement about which dr to use inability to establish the genome copy density to infectious unit ratio in the water environment and inability of very sensitive molecular methods to inform how infectious nov genome sequences are despite these limitations authors have used nov qmra to predict human enteric virus risks in reclaimed water applications such as direct potable reuse chaudhry et al 2017 soller et al 2018 as well as in recreational water soller et al 2010 2017 daily human enteric virus risk of infection from exposure to tertiary chlorinated reclaimed water for golf course irrigation was reported to be in the range of 10 5 to 10 9 asano et al 1992 olivieri and seto 2007 while exposure to secondary disinfected reclaimed water resulted in median enteric virus risk of 3 0 10 5 to 6 2 10 5 per golfing day olivieri and seto 2007 seto et al 2018 of note seto et al 2018 reported that their estimated median annualized risk of virus infection 7 6 10 7 after 25 golfing days equivalent to 3 10 5 per event following exposure to secondary disinfected reclaimed water is lower than the one annual infection per 10 4 california assumed level of acceptable infection for recreational exposure to our knowledge this investigation is the first report where a nov dataset derived from five wwtps providing secondary or tertiary treatment and routine uv or chlorine disinfection together with an additional 60 day lagoon storage and decay parameters from the literature has been used to evaluate nov infection risk in a qmra for landscape golf course irrigation our assumption for the incidental golfer exposure route ingestion following handling of wet golf balls was essentially the same as the one used by the authors referenced above however our exposure assessment differs in that we used a nov database from five wwtps with four different treatment disinfection scenarios rather than estimating human enteric virus risk following irrigation with reclaimed water using dr models for enterovirus enterovirus rotavirus or coliphage rotavirus we used six nov dr models that clustered into very similar lower bound and upper bound risk limits for instance the hypergeometric models m1 lower bound and m4 upper bound of teunis et al 2008 produced similar risk estimates to the simpler fractional poisson m5 lower bound and m6 upper bound models of messner et al 2014 where lower to upper bound risk ranges span 2 5 to 3 0 orders of magnitude respectively in order to obviate the latter soller et al 2017 have utilized a weighted approach by randomly sampling from a cloud where weighted nov risk estimates inherently approximate the upper bound model estimates because of differences in magnitude interestingly m3 dr model of schmidt 2015 casts doubt on teunis m4 upper bound disaggregated particle model without immunity schmidt s consideration of completely disaggregated particles allows risk calculation from a single infectious particle among secretor individuals who produce an essential secretion but are non susceptible because of apparent immunity due to other mechanisms this rationalization is elegant and obviates upper and lower bound estimates differing by three orders of magnitude 4 3 infectious doses an important aspect of qmra consists of translating pathogen monitoring data into an ingested dose following enumeration by rt qpcr and exposure assessment we calculated ingested doses in terms of nov gcs unadjusted for infectiousness as well as ingested doses adjusted for infectiousness applying unadjusted dose to the inoculum in the dr model implies that the ratio between infectious and non infectious particles in the monitoring samples is the same to that in the inoculum of the dr model but teunis et al 2008 indicate the following our best estimate of norwalk virus infectivity is so close to 1 that we can only conclude that at least half of the virus particles virions in both the 8fiia and 8fiib inocula were infectious to humans 8fiia is the original norwalk extract that had been frozen for decades as a high protein suspension and contained aggregated virus which could not be dispersed by sonication and which was fed to a total of 53 secretor subjects deemed susceptible in two trials while 8fiib refers to a secondary inoculum i e after one human passage which contained disaggregated virus derived from one infected subject who had been inoculated with 8fiia and fed to 27 secretor subjects in a third trial teunis et al 2008 also add if possible a quantitative comparison of nov enumeration by q rt pcr and cell culture should be conducted to examine the relation between genome copy and cell culture infectious units such quantitative comparison is now possible since human nov shed in the feces of infected persons have been successfully replicated in stem cell derived human intestinal enteroids ettayebi et al 2016 estes et al 2019 in this study adjustment of ingested doses consisted of dividing gcs by a factor of 1000 as follows i a factor of 10 accounted for the fact that our rt qpcr three sets of nov primers and probes targeted genetic sequences different from the one used by teunis et al 2008 to develop their dr model ii a factor of 100 to account for defective or growth limited virus per estes et al 2019 where human intestinal enteroids that were routinely seeded with 10 5 nov gc well recovered nov tcid50 infectious doses of approximately 10 3 gc well a ratio of 100 of note mcbride et al 2013 harmonized teunis et al 2008 clinical trial genome copy data by dividing gcs by a factor of 18 5 based on different target sequences giving different threshold standard curve values for the latter we used a factor of 10 instead of 18 5 since our standard curves were built using hepatitis g armored rna per u s e p a method 1615 u s e p a 2014 whereas teunis et al 2008 used purified norwalk gi 1 virus the greatest uncertainty lies in ratio of total titrated gcs to tcid50 infectious gcs assumed by us since there could be factors in the fecal extracts that potentially limit growth of infectious virus thus resulting in an underestimation of infectious gcs also the human intestinal enteroids culture system is inefficient as evidenced by the large number of gcs required in the inoculum however the magnitude of the adjustment is in line with what has been reported for other human rna viruses and summarized by mcbride et al 2013 as qmra

disaggregated virus no assumed immunity differed from lower bound estimates m1 and m2 aggregated virus and m3 disaggregated virus with immunity by 2 5 3 0 orders of magnitude mcbride 2014 has noted that further studies are needed to determine the degree of nov aggregation in wastewater as certain processes such as conventional activated sludge promote some aggregation of particles and this would have an effect on qmra infection risk estimates soller et al 2017 recently used a weighted approach to nov infectivity by randomly sampling uniformly distributed weights of a lower bound model aggregated fractional poisson in our case m5 and an upper bound model disaggregated hypergeometric in our case m4 by sampling from a cloud this weighted nov infectivity model s median predicted risk of illness that closely approximated the median observed rate of illness in surfers exposed to contaminated coastal waters following wet weather however it would be expected that overall the weighted results will be closer to the upper bound disaggregated model because of differences in magnitude between the upper and lower bound model 4 5 lack of reports linking acute gastrointestinal illness with reclaimed water bacterial and parasitic acute gastrointestinal illness agi is reportable in ontario canada but viral agi is not unless it is associated with outbreaks it has been estimated that for each case of agi reported in ontario over 300 cases occur in the community thomas et al 2008 thus nov associated agi is probably highly under reported possibly because it is usually a mild to moderate illness where symptoms resolve within a couple of days hall and lopman 2016 however we noticed an absence of reports in the media grey and scientific literature of agi in general and nov associated agi in particular among golfers who recreated at golf courses irrigated with reclaimed water but this could have resulted from lack of awareness from the public about potential microbial risks associated with reclaimed water on the other hand we hypothesized that unadjusted doses and consequent estimates of infection risk may be inflated and that a portion of the predicted infections would not have occurred at all as a result of a potentially over conservative assumption that all detected nov gcs in wastewater are infectious van abel et al 2017 on the one hand we adjusted our gc densities by a factor of 10 since our rt qpcr assay u s e p a 2014 used three sets of primers and probes recognizing more genetic sequences as well as the use of a hepatitis g virus armored sequence for construction of standard curves and secondly by a factor of 100 to account for a ratio of total seeded gcs to recovered infectious gcs in the human intestinal epithelioid cell culture system reported by estes et al 2019 as a result our risk estimates were reduced by three orders of magnitude overall where only dr models that considered disaggregated particles in the absence of immunity m4 and m6 gave risk estimates above the benchmark however gerba et al 2017 argue that since neither cell culture nor molecular methods can assess all the potentially infectious virus in wastewater conservative estimates should be used for instance soller et al 2018 reported that viruses need to be reduced by 14 logs or more to consistently achieve currently applied benchmark levels of protection associated with direct potable reuse 4 6 improving virus lrs in reclaimed water in wwtps that do not remove ammonia through nitrification chlorine disinfection is mostly dominated by chloramines which are not very effective against viruses metcalf eddy inc 2003 rose et al 2004 studied five chlorinating water reclamation facilities where only one practiced nutrient removal and therefore had minimal ammonia available for reacting with chlorine at this facility enterovirus chlorine lr was 3 2 by contrast enterovirus chlorine lr at the other four facilities ranged from 0 1 to 1 7 the latter facility achieved only 1 7 lr despite total chlorine ct values of 975 2400 mg min l two to five times the ct values prescribed by california s title 22 tertiary water recycling criteria c d p h 2018 however in this study we did not observe that ammonia removal in scenario s2 low chloramines had an impact on reduction of ingested doses and probabilities of infection compared with those of scenario s3 where no ammonia removal strategy was in place unfortunately chlorine residual values at the end of the chlorine contact chamber were not measured so ct value comparisons could not be made further studies are needed to investigate contributing factors at play tertiary treatment with sand filtration will reduce total suspended solids reduce shielding and improve the effectiveness of both uv and chlorine disinfection as well as reduce chlorine demand by organic compounds u s e p a 2003 particularly in secondary wwtps such as those in treatment disinfection scenarios s3 and s4 regarding uv disinfection this study s plant a and b disinfected at an intensity of 30 40 mj cm2 the national water research institute nwri guidelines n w r i 2012 recommend using 100 mj cm2 following sand filtration thus increasing the uv dose increase should provide further virus inactivation improvement finally environmental decay storage could be increased from 60 to 90 days in order to increase nov gi inactivation which is reportedly log linear skraber et al 2009 storage with natural sunlight may improve on nov gii log linear shoulder tail decay studied by kauppinen and miettinen 2017 under bench scale dark storage conditions 4 7 study limitations limitations of this study include a limited dataset of full year monthly sampling events at five wwtps from which we calculated pre and post disinfection densities of nov gi and gii and their respective lr following disinfection detected values as well as non detects were modeled by bayesian inference each consisting of a 5000 value chain except for one treatment scenario which used left censored modeling for our 60 day lagoon storage we used nov gi and gii decay parameters from the literature without taking into account natural sunlight inactivation in the exposure assessment we assumed that 1 the hypothetical golf course was irrigated the night before 2 that our golfer handled wet golf balls early in the day sunlight uv radiation temperature and evaporation were not considered and 3 seasonality was not considered either as novs were detected throughout the year regarding our comparison of the four hypergeometric dr models and the two fractional poisson dr models we only used small gc doses per our exposure assessment larger ingested doses could have yielded different results finally our adjustment for infectiousness could be deemed non conservative unprotective we acknowledge that there is uncertainty associated with the way we translated our gc doses into dr gc doses on the grounds of pcr target sequences as well as in the assumed ratio of total seeded gcs to recovered infectious gcs in the human intestinal enteroids however we note that irrespective of decay considerations in the environment other rna enteric viruses are known to produce an excess of viral particles that are not infectious yet detectable by molecular methods 5 conclusions we used qmra to estimate nov risk at a hypothetical golf course irrigated with reclaimed water six models forecast nov risk of infection above 2 7 10 7 per golfing day equivalent to the implicit drinking water benchmark of 10 4 per person year to avoid potential overestimation of risk we adjusted doses for different pcr genetic target sequences as well as for reported total seeded gc to infectious gc ratio in human epithelial enteroids which resulted in a considerable reduction of infection risk however this less conservative i e less protective assumption for water reuse applications such as golf course irrigation may not be corroborated until human nov are efficiently and routinely grown in cell cultures in addition further studies on drivers of nov risk estimation by dr models are needed e g the extent of nov particle aggregation resulting from wastewater treatment as well as the role of immunity regulators should be cognizant of nov associated risk in applications where the public comes in contact with reclaimed water nov risk can be mitigated with more stringent treatment ammonia removal and tertiary treatment with sand filtration and optimized disinfection modalities disclaimer the

17784,about 25 golf courses in ontario canada have environmental compliance approvals to use reclaimed water for irrigation where disinfection is confirmed through e coli limits a previous study at five ontario municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps confirmed that enteric viruses are less susceptible to disinfection than e coli when plants provided conventional secondary or tertiary treatment and routine chlorine or uv disinfection here we query whether these four treatment disinfection scenarios plus 60 day lagoon storage of disinfected effluent would be sufficient to reduce norovirus genogroups i and ii nov gi and gii risk of infection to tolerable levels for a golfer who incidentally ingests nov after handling wet golf balls at a golf course irrigated with reclaimed water we used our rt qpcr nov enumeration datasets from the four treatment disinfection scenarios above and modeled detected and non detected nov by bayesian inference in r monte carlo simulation included pre disinfection nov gi and gii gene copy densities ontario wwtp derived chlorine and uv log10 reductions literature derived effluent storage decay parameters and golfer ingested volumes followed by six different nov dose response dr models quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra results suggest that there is an unacceptable nov infection risk when using the conservative assumption that all detected nov particles rt qpcr gene copies are infectious in both aggregated or disaggregated form however after adjusting for pcr target sequences and for infectiousness using data from recently published studies on cultivation of human nov in human intestinal enteroids we noted a significant reduction of infection risk however this less conservative i e less protective assumption for water reuse applications such as golf course irrigation may not be corroborated until human nov are efficiently and routinely grown in cell cultures in addition further studies on drivers of nov risk estimation by dr models are needed e g the extent of nov particle aggregation resulting from wastewater treatment as well as the role of immunity meantime regulatory agencies could consider more stringent treatment disinfection requirements that target enteric viruses rather than e coli and testing of actual reclaimed irrigation waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords norovirus risk qmra irrigation gene copy to infectious unit ratio 1 introduction in many parts of the world water reuse is an important management consideration due to water scarcity and the geographic scope of water scarcity is likely to increase due to climate change hofste et al 2019 pedro monzonís et al 2015 golfing is a highly popular recreational activity where considerable resources are invested in maintenance and irrigation of greens for instance in 2009 the state of florida used 55 of its total reclaimed water for landscape irrigation and golf courses u s e p a 2012 usually reclaimed water regulatory requirements are in terms of wastewater treatment and disinfection technologies where indicator bacterial limits and minimum concentration time ct values of disinfectant are prescribed e g tertiary treatment no detectable indicator bacteria and total chlorine residuals in the range of 90 450 mg min l u s e p a 2012 c d p h 2018 enteric viruses may be present in reclaimed water applications such as landscape and golf course irrigation among others and may potentially pose a risk of infection for golfers asano et al 1992 olivieri and seto 2007 seto et al 2018 thus enteric viruses are explicitly addressed by california c d p h 2018 in its definition of tertiary disinfected reclaimed water where the disinfection process combined with the filtration process must achieve a 5 log10 reduction of plaque forming units of f bacteriophage ms2 or poliovirus or a virus as least as resistant to disinfection as poliovirus noroviruses novs were discovered in 1973 and are now widely recognized as the most prominent viral agents of acute gastrointestinal illness globally robilotti et al 2015 katayama and vinjé 2017 in the community transmission is foodborne including shellfish and waterborne but secondary cases among family members also occur hall and lopman 2016 however novs will not grow in routine cell cultures and are detected and quantified by molecular methods that target sequences of the rna genome not informing the extent to which these sequences represent infectious virus particles the first dose response dr model was developed by teunis et al 2008 where infection risks are assessed as a function of nov genome copies gc with virus particle aggregation or disaggregation defining lower bound or upper bound infection risk limits respectively van abel et al 2017 have reviewed studies using qmra to evaluate infection risks associated with drinking water direct and indirect potable reuse recreational water fresh and marine wastewater raw sewage sludge land applied biosolids effluent storm water irrigation water etc in parallel regulators are paying increased attention to enteric viruses in wastewater and recreational water and reviewing their water quality criteria to accommodate nov associated health risks for instance the u s e p a 2017 recognizes that enteric viruses cause most illnesses associated with recreational waters impacted by human sources and is exploring the use of coliphage viral indicator to supplement enterococcus and e coli bacterial indicators of recreational water quality in ontario canada currently there are circa 25 golf courses that utilize reclaimed water for irrigation under approval of the ministry of the environment conservation and parks mecp where e coli is used as the indicator of appropriate disinfection together with 60 day lagoon storage of the effluent ontario 2008 a unique quantitative nov dataset generated in a recent study of enteric viruses in the effluent from five ontario wastewater treatment plants simhon et al 2019 was used to inform a screening level quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra evaluating nov risks of infection illness in an exposure scenario where a golfer who recreates early in the day handles wet golf balls and incidentally ingests various doses of nov genome copies gc at a hypothetical golf course irrigated with reclaimed wastewater the night before using six different dose response models we present nov infection risk estimates when qmra assumes that all nov gcs represent infectious virus or a fraction thereof in either aggregated or disaggregated form 2 methods a methods schematic for this study appears in fig 1 we previously reported the results of full year monthly sampling at three wwtps providing secondary biological oxidation treatment and at two wwtps providing tertiary biological oxidation plus sand filtration treatment during 2014 2017 simhon et al 2019 treatment and disinfection methods are summarized in table 1 the total number of monthly paired pre and post disinfection samples for three secondary treatment plants was 34 out of a possible 36 12 3 minus two equipment malfunctions for two tertiary treatment plants the monthly number of paired samples was 24 out of 24 12 2 2 1 nov enumeration nov genogroup i and ii gi and gii were enumerated by rt qpcr per u s e p a method 1615 u s e p a 2014 concentrations of nov gi and gii in terms of gene copies per liter gc l were calculated per method 1615 taking into account the number of detected gc total dilution factor for volume reductions any dilution made to overcome inhibitory wastewater matrix effects gauged by spiked armored hepatitis g dna as well as the original volume sample that was assayed non detects were reported as gc l as above except that the number of gc was set to 1 while keeping in the formula the dilution factors and original volume sample that was assayed raw datasets for nov and enteroviruses are available in simhon et al 2019 2 2 modeling of nov concentrations in secondary and tertiary pre disinfection effluent nov gi and gii pre disinfection datasets of two tertiary wwtp effluents were combined together and likewise those of three secondary wwtp effluents because we wished to compare the effect of sand filtration in tertiary wwtps against no sand filtration in secondary wwtps as well as to increase the statistical power of the comparison a bayesian approach devleesschauwer et al 2017 together with jags 2017 and coda plummer et al 2006 within r was used see appendix a for simulated chain values under online supplementary material nov gi and gii concentration data gc l in treated pre disinfection effluent generated as bayesian modeled posteriors were fitted to distributions by oracle crystal ball 11 1 4 2015 and ranked by anderson darling goodness of fit statistic see appendix b under online supplementary material 2 3 log10 reductions lr 2 3 1 disinfection in order to define distribution parameters for disinfection log10 reductions lr of nov gi and gii we considered the following four treatment disinfection scenarios 1 uv lrs in tertiary treated effluent plant a 2 chlorine lrs in tertiary treated effluent plant c 3 chlorine lrs in secondary treated effluent plants d and e combined and 4 uv lrs in secondary treated effluent plant b gamma fitted bayesian posteriors for pre and post disinfection density values chains of 5000 values each were generated except for scenario 2 where gamma posteriors could not be generated likely because of 67 non detects see below for treatment disinfection scenarios 1 3 and 4 we took the 25th percentile minimum 50th percentile most likely and 75th percentile maximum and calculated nov gi and nov gii lrs skraber et al 2009 defining assumptions as beta pert distributions which are widely used in risk analysis project management body of knowledge 2013 we assumed that this would reduce uncertainty associated with 10th 90th or 5th 95th percentile values scenario 2 had a high percentage of non detects so we used left censored data estimation helsel 2012 lee 2017 to calculate lrs that were then fitted into a normal distribution with their respective mean and standard deviation parameters for nov gi and nov gii assumptions for disinfection lrs are summarized in table 2 2 3 2 storage decay lr lagoon storage is a treatment modality in ontario where effluents may be subsequently used to irrigate golf courses ontario 2008 we estimated nov gi and nov gii nucleic acid inactivation following 60 day lagoon storage by using two published models of indigenous nov gi and gii in wastewater skraber et al 2009 described a log linear indigenous nov gi inactivation in wastewater at 20 c slope 0 0445 t90 22 5 days 0 95 c i 15 4 29 5 days as well kauppinen and miettinen 2017 described a best fit log linear shoulder tail model of indigenous nov gii in wastewater at 21 c where the maximum achievable inactivation was 1 21 log10 which showed persistence up to the end of the study s 140 day observation period storage decay assumptions are summarized in table 2 2 3 3 nov infectiousness in this study we considered two infectiousness options separately 1 100 of nov particles detected as gc by rt qpcr are infectious van abel et al 2017 and 2 only a fraction of the virus particles is infectious for the latter we adjusted ingested doses by dividing by a factor of 1000 as follows i a factor of 10 accounted for the fact that our rt qpcr three sets of nov primers and probes targeted genetic sequences different from the one targeted by teunis et al 2008 to develop their dr model ii a factor of 100 to account for defective or growth limited virus per estes et al 2019 where human intestinal enteroids that were routinely seeded with 10 5 nov gc well recover nov tcid50 infectious doses of approximately 10 3 tcid50 gc well a ratio of 100 for the purposes of a monte carlo simulation these adjustments were defined as an additional log10 reduction where the ingested nov dose gc is effectively reduced by three orders of magnitude thus adjusted gcs that our golfer ingests could still be applied in the six dose response models employed in this study 2 4 exposure assessment 2 4 1 ingested volumes our assumptions on ingested volumes are based on literature derived values a golfer who recreates early in the day at a golf course that was irrigated with reclaimed water the night before and who handles wet golf balls may incidentally ingest 1 2 10 4 to 1 2 10 2 l 0 12 12 ml of reclaimed water olivieri and seto 2007 seto et al 2018 these assumptions have been described in detail by soller et al 2008 potential inactivation resulting from sunlight uv radiation evaporation and temperature was not considered 2 4 2 ingested dose in a feeding study subjects receive known doses of the pathogen and their clinical response is assessed however in this study s qmra evaluation doses are average doses here dose gc is equal to the nov concentration gc l times ingested volume l oracle s crystal ball was used to calculate nov gi and gii doses as follows eq 1 dose un adjusted for infectiousness pre disinf conc 10 disinf lr 10 storage lr ingested volume or eq 2 dose adjusted for infectiousness pre disinf conc 10 disinf lr 10 storage lr 10 infectious ratio ingested volume where pre disinf conc distribution for bayesian derived pre disinfection nov concentration disinf lr distributions for lr reductions specific for each treatment disinfection type

additional targets recognized by pcr ingested volume distribution for ingested volumes n b see table 2 for monte carlo input parameter details 2 5 dose response dr models a stored stool extract of the original norwalk virus outbreak 8fiia now classified as norovirus hu gi 1 8fiia 1968 usa see ncbi txid1184498 and a secondary stool extract 8fiib from one of the in the infected subjects were used by teunis et al 2008 to develop their dr model norwalk virus inocula 8fiia 8fiib were titrated by rt pcr using specific primers for sequences located in the rna polymerase region however in this study nov gi and gii were enumerated per us epa method 1615 u s e p a 2014 using three sets of primers and probes of jothikumar et al 2005 and butot et al 2010 where standards are prepared from an armored rna reagent that contains the target sequences for the norovirus and hepatitis g virus primer probe sets thus even though our nov gcs were detected through different genetic target sequences we applied them to the different dr models see below as if they belonged to the norwalk gi 1 strain because the environmental decay of nov gi and nov gii in wastewater has been reported to be different under experimental storage conditions skraber et al 2009 kauppinen and miettinen 2017 in this study doses were calculated separately then summed assuming that both genogroups share the same dose response and used in four hypergeometric dose response dr models teunis et al 2008 with two levels of aggregation messner et al 2014 schmidt 2015 per gsl package of hankin 2006 2019 in r the fractional poisson model of messner et al 2014 was also used in crystal ball with two levels of aggregation dr parameters are summarized in table 3 we assumed a tolerable probability of infection of 2 7 10 7 per golfing day equivalent to the u s e p a implicit drinking water risk benchmark of 1 0 10 4 regli et al 1991 per person year with 365 exposures per year equation 3 and then solved for daily risk haas et al 2014 equation 4 eq 3 tolerable p infection per year 1 10 4 0 0001 1 1 p infection day 365 eq 4 tolerable p infection per golfing day 1 1 0 0001 1 365 the risk of illness given infection used a point estimate of 0 6 i e only 60 of those infected develop illness soller et al 2010 viau et al 2011 mcbride et al 2013 3 results 3 1 ingested doses table 3 summarizes the exposure assessment for four different treatment disinfection exposure scenarios as well as parameters for the six dose response dr models used ingested doses gc are presented un adjusted 10th to 90th percentile range 1 33 10 7 to 3 29 10 2 as well as adjusted for infectiousness 10th to 90th percentile range 1 44 10 10 to 4 72 10 1 adjusted doses were about three orders of magnitude lower table 3 tertiary treated uv or chlorine disinfected and 60 day lagoon stored reclaimed water treatment scenarios s1 and s2 produced lower nov gc doses than equivalent secondary treatments without sand filtration scenarios s3 and s4 it should be noted that wwtps in this study disinfecting with either uv light or chlorine did not target viruses but e coli fecal indicator nevertheless 60 day lagoon storage provided additional log reductions treatment scenario s1 tertiary treatment with uv disinfection and 60 day lagoon storage was the best performer i e produced the smallest doses in the exposure assessment and was chosen for evaluation with six different dr models 3 2 nov risk of infection 3 2 1 treatment disinfection scenario s1 using four hypergeometric and two fractional poisson dr models fig 2 a and b illustrate the probabilities of infection for a range of ingested nov gc doses un adjusted and adjusted for infectiousness respectively broken horizontal lines represent the daily risk benchmark of 2 7 10 7 a lower bound infection risk cluster m1 m2 m3 m5 dr models as well as an upper bound m4 and m6 dr models infection risk cluster are evident in both panels m3 dr model schmidt 2015 considers disaggregated particles however its risk estimates cluster as lower bound together with other aggregated particle dr models because this model applies a parameter of apparent immunity teunis hypergeometric models m1 and m4 gave a lower bound to upper bound median risk of infection range of 8 91 10 6 to 2 95 10 3 see below after exposure to un adjusted gc doses similarly messner s fractional poisson models m5 and m6 gave a median infection risk range of 4 58 10 6 to 5 05 10 3 the above ranges span 2 5 to 3 0 orders of magnitude respectively lower bound and upper bound estimates gave median risks of infection above the daily risk benchmark when exposure occurred with gc doses un adjusted for infectiousness fig 2a after adjusting for infectiousness only the two upper bound dr models m4 and m6 gave median risks of infection above the benchmark fig 2b 3 2 2 risk of infection estimates for four treatment disinfection scenarios s1 s4 using four hypergeometric dr models box plots in fig 3 a and b compare four treatment disinfection scenarios s1 s4 and their risk of infection per golfing day as estimated by four hypergeometric dr models m1 m4 where gc doses are unadjusted or adjusted for infectiousness respectively broken horizontal lines represent the 2 7 10 7 daily risk of infection benchmark of the four exposure treatment scenarios s1 tertiary treatment with uv disinfection plus 60 day storage was associated with the smallest doses and consequently produced the lowest risk of infection estimates whereas s4 secondary treatment with uv disinfection plus 60 day storage was the opposite scenarios s2 and s3 were somewhere in the middle with very similar doses even though s2 consisted of tertiary treated effluent with chlorine disinfection and low ammonia nitrogen while s3 consisted of effluent from two secondary chlorinating wwtps with no ammonia removal strategy in place all four hypergeometric dr models gave median risk of infection estimates above the 2 7 10 7 per golfing day benchmark with m4 teunis disaggregated producing the upper bound risk estimate by contrast m1 teunis aggregated m2 messner aggregated and m3 schmidt disaggregated with immunity gave very similar lower bound estimates after adjusting for infectiousness lower bound median risk of infection per golfing day for s1 s2 and s3 was below or very close to the benchmark please see table in appendix c under online supplementary material for probabilities of illness given infection for a range of un adjusted and adjusted gc doses evaluated by six dr models 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of nov densities and lrs we recently reported that nov gi gii were abundant in secondary disinfected and tertiary disinfected effluents at mean densities of 3 6 10 5 gc l and 2 7 10 4 gc l respectively which we have used in our nov database for this investigation routine chlorine or uv disinfection that targeted e coli indicator produced modest nov gi gii lrs of 0 5 0 8 simhon et al 2019 this was not totally unexpected as kingsley et al 2017 reported that human nov is not effectively inactivated by chlorine at levels normally used for wastewater disinfection our nov densities and lrs are consistent with values reported in the literature for instance katayama et al 2008 reported that noroviruses gi and gii were detected in post chlorination effluent from six japanese wwtps at geometric mean concentrations of 2 9 10 3 and 2 6 10 3 gc l respectively as well qiu et al 2015 in edmonton alberta canada detected nov in final uv disinfected effluent in 16 100 of samples at average concentrations of 2 3 10 4 gc l where the uv process accounted for a lr of 0 1 0 4 s d similarly qiu et al 2018 reported poor inactivation of nov gi and gii nucleic acid at two uv disinfecting wwtps in calgary alberta canada where mean densities in disinfected effluent ranged from 10 4 to 1 3 10 5 gc l and mean lrs from 0 1 to 0 2 by contrast seto et al 2018 reported efficient norovirus inactivation at a secondary treatment chlorine disinfecting plant in vacaville california where nov gi and gii were reduced from a median density of 5 3 10 3 and 6 0 10 3 gc l in raw sewage respectively to below the commercial kit s detection limit of 2 gc l 0 of 11 samples were positive in final chlorine disinfected effluent similarly alonso et al 2006 reported that hepatitis a virus enteroviruses and rotaviruses were not detected by rt qpcr in secondary effluent used to irrigate golf courses in spain and portugal while somatic coliphages were detected by culture 4 2 qmras of reclaimed water for golf course irrigation california s wastewater reclamation criteria have been evaluated through qmra using culturable enteric virus monitoring data and enterovirus dr models asano et al 1992 as well as with culturable enterovirus occurrence data and a rotavirus dr model olivieri and seto 2007 and more recently with an ms2 bacteriophage to enteric virus relationship and a rotavirus dr model seto et al 2018 nov is now recognized as the leading viral agent of acute gastrointestinal illness robilotti et al 2015 katayama and vinjé 2017 but seto et al 2018 cite the following limitations when analyzing nov risk of infection by qmra uncertainty with respect to dr model selection lack of regulatory agreement about which dr to use inability to establish the genome copy density to infectious unit ratio in the water environment and inability of very sensitive molecular methods to inform how infectious nov genome sequences are despite these limitations authors have used nov qmra to predict human enteric virus risks in reclaimed water applications such as direct potable reuse chaudhry et al 2017 soller et al 2018 as well as in recreational water soller et al 2010 2017 daily human enteric virus risk of infection from exposure to tertiary chlorinated reclaimed water for golf course irrigation was reported to be in the range of 10 5 to 10 9 asano et al 1992 olivieri and seto 2007 while exposure to secondary disinfected reclaimed water resulted in median enteric virus risk of 3 0 10 5 to 6 2 10 5 per golfing day olivieri and seto 2007 seto et al 2018 of note seto et al 2018 reported that their estimated median annualized risk of virus infection 7 6 10 7 after 25 golfing days equivalent to 3 10 5 per event following exposure to secondary disinfected reclaimed water is lower than the one annual infection per 10 4 california assumed level of acceptable infection for recreational exposure to our knowledge this investigation is the first report where a nov dataset derived from five wwtps providing secondary or tertiary treatment and routine uv or chlorine disinfection together with an additional 60 day lagoon storage and decay parameters from the literature has been used to evaluate nov infection risk in a qmra for landscape golf course irrigation our assumption for the incidental golfer exposure route ingestion following handling of wet golf balls was essentially the same as the one used by the authors referenced above however our exposure assessment differs in that we used a nov database from five wwtps with four different treatment disinfection scenarios rather than estimating human enteric virus risk following irrigation with reclaimed water using dr models for enterovirus enterovirus rotavirus or coliphage rotavirus we used six nov dr models that clustered into very similar lower bound and upper bound risk limits for instance the hypergeometric models m1 lower bound and m4 upper bound of teunis et al 2008 produced similar risk estimates to the simpler fractional poisson m5 lower bound and m6 upper bound models of messner et al 2014 where lower to upper bound risk ranges span 2 5 to 3 0 orders of magnitude respectively in order to obviate the latter soller et al 2017 have utilized a weighted approach by randomly sampling from a cloud where weighted nov risk estimates inherently approximate the upper bound model estimates because of differences in magnitude interestingly m3 dr model of schmidt 2015 casts doubt on teunis m4 upper bound disaggregated particle model without immunity schmidt s consideration of completely disaggregated particles allows risk calculation from a single infectious particle among secretor individuals who produce an essential secretion but are non susceptible because of apparent immunity due to other mechanisms this rationalization is elegant and obviates upper and lower bound estimates differing by three orders of magnitude 4 3 infectious doses an important aspect of qmra consists of translating pathogen monitoring data into an ingested dose following enumeration by rt qpcr and exposure assessment we calculated ingested doses in terms of nov gcs unadjusted for infectiousness as well as ingested doses adjusted for infectiousness applying unadjusted dose to the inoculum in the dr model implies that the ratio between infectious and non infectious particles in the monitoring samples is the same to that in the inoculum of the dr model but teunis et al 2008 indicate the following our best estimate of norwalk virus infectivity is so close to 1 that we can only conclude that at least half of the virus particles virions in both the 8fiia and 8fiib inocula were infectious to humans 8fiia is the original norwalk extract that had been frozen for decades as a high protein suspension and contained aggregated virus which could not be dispersed by sonication and which was fed to a total of 53 secretor subjects deemed susceptible in two trials while 8fiib refers to a secondary inoculum i e after one human passage which contained disaggregated virus derived from one infected subject who had been inoculated with 8fiia and fed to 27 secretor subjects in a third trial teunis et al 2008 also add if possible a quantitative comparison of nov enumeration by q rt pcr and cell culture should be conducted to examine the relation between genome copy and cell culture infectious units such quantitative comparison is now possible since human nov shed in the feces of infected persons have been successfully replicated in stem cell derived human intestinal enteroids ettayebi et al 2016 estes et al 2019 in this study adjustment of ingested doses consisted of dividing gcs by a factor of 1000 as follows i a factor of 10 accounted for the fact that our rt qpcr three sets of nov primers and probes targeted genetic sequences different from the one used by teunis et al 2008 to develop their dr model ii a factor of 100 to account for defective or growth limited virus per estes et al 2019 where human intestinal enteroids that were routinely seeded with 10 5 nov gc well recovered nov tcid50 infectious doses of approximately 10 3 gc well a ratio of 100 of note mcbride et al 2013 harmonized teunis et al 2008 clinical trial genome copy data by dividing gcs by a factor of 18 5 based on different target sequences giving different threshold standard curve values for the latter we used a factor of 10 instead of 18 5 since our standard curves were built using hepatitis g armored rna per u s e p a method 1615 u s e p a 2014 whereas teunis et al 2008 used purified norwalk gi 1 virus the greatest uncertainty lies in ratio of total titrated gcs to tcid50 infectious gcs assumed by us since there could be factors in the fecal extracts that potentially limit growth of infectious virus thus resulting in an underestimation of infectious gcs also the human intestinal enteroids culture system is inefficient as evidenced by the large number of gcs required in the inoculum however the magnitude of the adjustment is in line with what has been reported for other human rna viruses and summarized by mcbride et al 2013 as qmra harmonization rules 1 enterovirus pfu 773 qpcr rna genomes puig et al 1994 jonsson et al 2009 1 human rotavirus fluorescent focus unit ffu 1900 qpcr rna genomes puig et al 1994 de roda husman et al 2009 jonsson et al 2009 4 4 virus aggregation disaggregation in dr models virus aggregation disaggregation is a complex process which is highly dependent on the type of virus and water quality conditions gerba and betancourt 2017 the six dr models that we tested in this paper considered various degrees of aggregation disaggregation upper bound nov infection risk estimates m4 model disaggregated virus no assumed immunity differed from lower bound estimates m1 and m2 aggregated virus and m3 disaggregated virus with immunity by 2 5 3 0 orders of magnitude mcbride 2014 has noted that further studies are needed to determine the degree of nov aggregation in wastewater as certain processes such as conventional activated sludge promote some aggregation of particles and this would have an effect on qmra infection risk estimates soller et al 2017 recently used a weighted approach to nov infectivity by randomly sampling uniformly distributed weights of a lower bound model aggregated fractional poisson in our case m5 and an upper bound model disaggregated hypergeometric in our case m4 by sampling from a cloud this weighted nov infectivity model s median predicted risk of illness that closely approximated the median observed rate of illness in surfers exposed to contaminated coastal waters following wet weather however it would be expected that overall the weighted results will be closer to the upper bound disaggregated model because of differences in magnitude between the upper and lower bound model 4 5 lack of reports linking acute gastrointestinal illness with reclaimed water bacterial and parasitic acute gastrointestinal illness agi is reportable in ontario canada but viral agi is not unless it is associated with outbreaks it has been estimated that for each case of agi reported in ontario over 300 cases occur in the community thomas et al 2008 thus nov associated agi is probably highly under reported possibly because it is usually a mild to moderate illness where symptoms resolve within a couple of days hall and lopman 2016 however we noticed an absence of reports in the media grey and scientific literature of agi in general and nov associated agi in particular among golfers who recreated at golf courses irrigated with reclaimed water but this could have resulted from lack of awareness from the public about potential microbial risks associated with reclaimed water on the other hand we hypothesized that unadjusted doses and consequent estimates of infection risk may be inflated and that a portion of the predicted infections would not have occurred at all as a result of a potentially over conservative assumption that all detected nov gcs in wastewater are infectious van abel et al 2017 on the one hand we adjusted our gc densities by a factor of 10 since our rt qpcr assay u s e p a 2014 used three sets of primers and probes recognizing more genetic sequences as well as the use of a hepatitis g virus armored sequence for construction of standard curves and secondly by a factor of 100 to account for a ratio of total seeded gcs to recovered infectious gcs in the human intestinal epithelioid cell culture system reported by estes et al 2019 as a result our risk estimates were reduced by three orders of magnitude overall where only dr models that considered disaggregated particles in the absence of immunity m4 and m6 gave risk estimates above the benchmark however gerba et al 2017 argue that since neither cell culture nor molecular methods can assess all the potentially infectious virus in wastewater conservative estimates should be used for instance soller et al 2018 reported that viruses need to be reduced by 14 logs or more to consistently achieve currently applied benchmark levels of protection associated with direct potable reuse 4 6 improving virus lrs in reclaimed water in wwtps that do not remove ammonia through nitrification chlorine disinfection is mostly dominated by chloramines which are not very effective against viruses metcalf eddy inc 2003 rose et al 2004 studied five chlorinating water reclamation facilities where only one practiced nutrient removal and therefore had minimal ammonia available for reacting with chlorine at this facility enterovirus chlorine lr was 3 2 by contrast enterovirus chlorine lr at the other four facilities ranged from 0 1 to 1 7 the latter facility achieved only 1 7 lr despite total chlorine ct values of 975 2400 mg min l two to five times the ct values prescribed by california s title 22 tertiary water recycling criteria c d p h 2018 however in this study we did not observe that ammonia removal in scenario s2 low chloramines had an impact on reduction of ingested doses and probabilities of infection compared with those of scenario s3 where no ammonia removal strategy was in place unfortunately chlorine residual values at the end of the chlorine contact chamber were not measured so ct value comparisons could not be made further studies are needed to investigate contributing factors at play tertiary treatment with sand filtration will reduce total suspended solids reduce shielding and improve the effectiveness of both uv and chlorine disinfection as well as reduce chlorine demand by organic compounds u s e p a 2003 particularly in secondary wwtps such as those in treatment disinfection scenarios s3 and s4 regarding uv disinfection this study s plant a and b disinfected at an intensity of 30 40 mj cm2 the national water research institute nwri guidelines n w r i 2012 recommend using 100 mj cm2 following sand filtration thus increasing the uv dose increase should provide further virus inactivation improvement finally environmental decay storage could be increased from 60 to 90 days in order to increase nov gi inactivation which is reportedly log linear skraber et al 2009 storage with natural sunlight may improve on nov gii log linear shoulder tail decay studied by kauppinen and miettinen 2017 under bench scale dark storage conditions 4 7 study limitations limitations of this study include a limited dataset of full year monthly sampling events at five wwtps from which we calculated pre and post disinfection densities of nov gi and gii and their respective lr following disinfection detected values as well as non detects were modeled by bayesian inference each consisting of a 5000 value chain except for one treatment scenario which used left censored modeling for our 60 day lagoon storage we used nov gi and gii decay parameters from the literature without taking into account natural sunlight inactivation in the exposure assessment we assumed that 1 the hypothetical golf course was irrigated the night before 2 that our golfer handled wet golf balls early in the day sunlight uv radiation temperature and evaporation were not considered and 3 seasonality was not considered either as novs were detected throughout the year regarding our comparison of the four hypergeometric dr models and the two fractional poisson dr models we only used small gc doses per our exposure assessment larger ingested doses could have yielded different results finally our adjustment for infectiousness could be deemed non conservative unprotective we acknowledge that there is uncertainty associated with the way we translated our gc doses into dr gc doses on the grounds of pcr target sequences as well as in the assumed ratio of total seeded gcs to recovered infectious gcs in the human intestinal enteroids however we note that irrespective of decay considerations in the environment other rna enteric viruses are known to produce an excess of viral particles that are not infectious yet detectable by molecular methods 5 conclusions we used qmra to estimate nov risk at a hypothetical golf course irrigated with reclaimed water six models forecast nov risk of infection above 2 7 10 7 per golfing day equivalent to the implicit drinking water benchmark of 10 4 per person year to avoid potential overestimation of risk we adjusted doses for different pcr genetic target sequences as well as for reported total seeded gc to infectious gc ratio in human epithelial enteroids which resulted in a considerable reduction of infection risk however this less conservative i e less protective assumption for water reuse applications such as golf course irrigation may not be corroborated until human nov are efficiently and routinely grown in cell cultures in addition further studies on drivers of nov risk estimation by dr models are needed e g the extent of nov particle aggregation resulting from wastewater treatment as well as the role of immunity regulators should be cognizant of nov associated risk in applications where the public comes in contact with reclaimed water nov risk can be mitigated with more stringent treatment ammonia removal and tertiary treatment with sand filtration and optimized disinfection modalities disclaimer the
