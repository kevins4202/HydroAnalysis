5455,mitigation of the urban heat island uhi effect by regulating the transpiration rate of urban vegetation is one of the most important aspects for adapting to global warming and urbanization accurate estimation of the transpiration rate of urban trees is critical for it urban trees are usually geographically dispersed e g street trees and the only feasible method to measure the transpiration rate is the sap flow method which is seriously limited owing to its destructiveness and lack of representativeness to overcome this challenge this study developed an advanced approach based on the three temperature 3t model by extending its energy balance from two dimensional 2d to three dimensional 3d the advanced approach was thus named as the 3d 3t model and verified by the sap flow method the results showed that 1 there was a good agreement between the results of the two methodologies in the daytime with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 88 and root mean square error rmse of 0 01 mm h 1 this is the first result worldwide to successfully measure the transpiration rate for a large tree without contact or damage 2 the leaf transpiration rate measured by a li 6400xt and the plant transpiration transfer coefficient of ficus concinna from the 3d 3t model also showed a good agreement at nighttime r2 0 97 3 the urban f concinna could consume not only most of the net radiation but also the sensible heat from the surrounding air thereby helping to reduce the ambient temperature and mitigate the uhi effect these results provide a feasible way to accurately estimate the transpiration rate of individual urban trees and may be useful for urban environmental management and urban planning keywords transpiration three temperature model thermal infrared remote sensing sap flow 1 introduction under the dual impact of global warming and urbanization urban heat islands uhis and heat waves have been observed worldwide they have caused adverse effects such as an increase in energy consumption and anthropogenic heat generation an increase in atmospheric pollutants affecting living environment and human health chen et al 2014 dousset et al 2011 gabriel and endlicher 2011 kalnay and cai 2003 linares and diaz 2008 sun et al 2014 it is urgent to regulate the uhi effect and improve the urban thermal environment possible measures include modifying the albedo of urban buildings reducing human heat discharge and absorbing the anthropogenic heat and solar energy by evapotranspiration et from urban water or vegetation rizwan et al 2008 taha 1997 many studies have demonstrated the cooling effect of urban vegetation which differed in the vegetation area distribution composition and configuration li and zhou 2019 kong et al 2016 potchter et al 2006 jenerette et al 2007 weng and yang 2004 yan et al 2020 although the cooling effects of vegetation have been attributed to the extra transpiration dimoudi and nikolopoulou 2003 peters et al 2015 scott et al 1998 it is still challenging to obtain a quantitative relationship between the cooling effect and the transpiration rate johnson et al 2015 kong et al 2016 liu et al 2017 rahman et al 2015 especially for urban forests with the largest cooling effect potchter et al 2006 weng and yang 2004 owing to the diverse plant composition growing conditions and micrometeorological conditions in street canyons tree transpiration in urban areas is usually difficult to measure or model georgi and dimitriou 2010 kong et al 2016 litvak and pataki 2015 litvak et al 2017a rahman et al 2017 wang 2003 wu et al 2012 yan et al 2012 in addition urban et is often ignored or underestimated by models liu et al 2017 for example ignoring et from trees may cause serious underestimation of the latent heat flux le even at sites with relatively low tree coverage liu et al 2017 lysimeter and sap flow methods have been applied to measure the transpiration of urban vegetation asawa et al 2017 jacobs et al 2015 pataki et al 2011 but the application of lysimeter is restricted for large trees wullschleger et al 1998 thereby making the sap flow method the only available methodology to measure the transpiration rate of urban trees nevertheless it is difficult for the results from a single tree represent other trees owing to the diversity of tree species age size and habitat ewers et al 2002 horna et al 2011 kumagai et al 2008 moreover the required number of instruments and the need for tree protection will also limit the use of the sap flow method making it difficult to measure transpiration of a large quantity of urban trees in recent years many models have been developed to estimate urban et but most are empirical models beeson 2016 bournez et al 2016 gkatsopoulos 2017 johnson et al 2015 litvak and pataki 2015 litvak et al 2017b for example reference et has been applied to calculate et in cities with site specific empirical coefficients but the results have not been verified beeson 2016 johnson et al 2015 although some urban energy water balance models have been applied for urban sites validation of these methods is actually limited by the current availability of observed data lemonsu et al 2007 2012 jiang and weng 2017 for example the town energy balance teb model have been improved for urban areas and it can explicitly reveal the influences of urban vegetation areas as well the differences in local microclimatic conditions lemonsu et al 2007 2012 however it has not been evaluated with no actual urban observations similarly the two source energy balance tseb model can provide reasonable variations of urban et but the model itself is not suitable for the urban environment and more importantly the results remain unverified jiang and weng 2017 other models such as the weather research and forecasting model wrf urban model chen et al 2011 and the surface urban energy balance scheme suews järvi et al 2011 has been developed for the neighborhood scale however these models needed a vast number of site specific micrometeorological parameters which are difficult to parameterize with limited existing data sets the three temperature 3t model proposed by qiu 1996 requires a minimum number of parameters net radiation soil heat flux surface temperature of the drying surface and dry soil and air temperature and does not include aerodynamic resistance which makes it is easy to apply in combination with thermal remote sensing until now it has been applied and verified to estimate et under conditions of various scales from ground based thermal remote sensing qiu and ben asher 2010 qiu and zhao 2010 qiu et al 1996 2002 2003 2006 2015 to satellite based thermal remote sensing luo et al 2012 tian et al 2013 wang et al 2016 xiong and qiu 2011 2014 xiong et al 2019 in addition qiu et al 2017 estimated the et of urban lawns using the 3t model infrared remote sensing method and the results were consistent with the measured results by the bowen ratio system with rmse less than 0 04 mm 1 our previous study showed that it can provide a reasonable diurnal variation trend of transpiration for large urban tree ficus concinna but fails to accurately estimate the transpiration rate tan 2016 the reason for this discrepancy might be that the original 3t model two dimensional 2d 3t model was primarily developed to estimate the transpiration under 2d conditions where the energy for transpiration is assumed to only originate from solar radiation however for a large individual tree canopy under urban conditions such as that of ficus concinna there might be significant differences in the energy sources for transpiration among different parts of the crown our assumption is that besides solar radiation the sensible heat around the canopy also provides additional energy for transpiration which cannot be neglected under urban conditions to verify this hypothesis an advanced three dimensional 3d method to measure urban tree transpiration is necessary therefore the objectives of the study were 1 to improve the 2d 3t model ir remote sensing method into a 3d 3t model ir remote sensing method 2 to verify its accuracy and applicability for daytime and nighttime and 3 to identify the energy sources for transpiration in different parts of the tree canopy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study area is located in the university town of shenzhen guangdong province china 22 26 59 22 51 49 n 113 45 44 114 37 21 e it is subjected to the influence of subtropical oceanic monsoons with the coldest month in january 14 9 c and hottest month in july 28 6 c the mean annual air temperature is 22 3 c the mean daily solar radiation is 14 3 mj m 2 and the sunshine duration is 5 6 h the mean annual precipitation is 1924 7 mm most of which occurs between april and september the mean annual wind speed is 2 7 m s 1 and it is higher in spring and winter reaching 2 8 3 0 m s 1 f concinna is a native tree species that is commonly cultivated in subtropical areas e g guangdong guangxi guizhou and yunnan provinces chinese academy of science flora of china editorial board 1998 because it has low soil requirements a fast growth rate developed root system strong shade strong wind resistance and low cultivation and maintenance cost it has been widely used in the greening of subtropical cities zhang et al 2011 in addition it generally has a large crown structure which might show a clear 3d distribution of the energy budget therefore f concinna was selected for the present study the experimental site was located in the campus of peking university shenzhen graduate school fig 1 the target tree of f concinna with a large crown are selected in an open area between two buildings the height diameter at the breast height dbh and crown area of the target tree were 8 m 22 cm and 27 m2 respectively 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 sap flow measurement the sap flux density of the target tree was measured using the thermal dissipation method granier 1987 a pair of sf g type probes length 20 mm diameter 2 mm ecomatik munich germany were installed the breast height on the north side to avoid the thermal effect caused by direct sunlight in this study we assumed that there was no azimuthal variability in the sap flow thus we installed one commercial sap flow sensor for the target tree and replaced it with a new sensor at the beginning of the growing season for each year a radiation protection shield was also installed around the sensor to minimize the temperature fluctuations in the sapwood and the top of the shield was sealed off with silicon paste to protect the sensors from dripping rainwater sap flow data were sampled every minute and 5 min averages were recorded on a data logger from july 11 2014 to the present cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for the purpose of sap flow data process meteorological data including solar radiation photosynthetic active radiation net radiation soil heat flux air temperature and humidity were also measured and recorded by the bowen ratio system at intervals of 10 min for the same period more details about the bowen ratio system are provided by qiu et al 2017 to determine whether the observed nighttime sap flow was used for nighttime transpiration the leaf stomata status at night was investigated and nighttime leaf stomatal conductance was measured every hour from 18 00 to 5 00 local time on june 24th and 25th 2016 using a li 6400xt portable photosynthesis measurement system li cor lincoln ne usa to keep the leaves under natural conditions the measurements were conducted on a ladder and three healthy mature and clean leaves were randomly selected for measurement the period with net radiation of less than 5 w m 2 was generally defined as night daley and phillips 2006 wang et al 2012 2 2 2 measurement of input parameters for the 3d 3t model considering its large crown the f concinna tree may have different transpiration rates at different areas of the crown which need to be measured separately in this study 10 observation locations points around the tree were determined by considering the crown size and the field of view of the thermal camera ir flexcam ti55 thermal imager fluke corp usa fig 2 the points were distributed with one at the top one at the bottom four at the upper sides east west south and north and four at lower sides east west south and north measurements were carried out from these locations toward the canopy the observation directions were vertical to the ground at the top and bottom while they were horizontal to the ground from the eight other locations the net radiation air temperature canopy surface temperature and reference leaf temperature were measured from these 10 locations every 2 h on sunny days the net radiation was measured by a cnr4 net radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands which was installed on a 7 m steel rod to measure the net radiation at different points the installation position and direction of the net radiometer was adjusted correspondingly meanwhile a t type thermocouple resolution of 0 1 c was installed near the radiometer to measure the air temperature in addition the net radiation and temperature of the reference leave with no transpiration were measured synchronously we used dry green paper 420 mm 297 mm as the reference leaf the reference leave were installed at the corresponding location at the top bottom upper sides east south west and north and lower sides east south west and north of canopy and a total of 10 reference leave were measured to avoid the net radiation observation error caused by the material color and roughness the color of the green paper was as close as possible to that of the actual leaf color with a smooth surface the reference leave were placed about 20 cm from each observation point 30 min before each measurement to provide similar circumstances to the leave in the canopy the net radiation of the reference leave were then measured by the cnr4 net radiometer and the surface temperatures of reference leave reference temperature were measured using an ir flexcam ti55 thermal imager fluke corp usa the temperatures of 76 800 points can be measured in one shot by this thermal imager to obtain the 3d temperature distribution of the tree crown ground based thermal remote sensing was conducted at each location using the ir flexcam ti55 thermal imager to keep the shooting angle vertical to each part of tree crown the thermal images of the bottom and lower sides were taken on the ground and the thermal images of the top and upper sides were taken on the surrounding buildings the temperatures were averaged separately for the sunlit leaves when the layer was facing to sunshine or for the shaded leaves when the layer was shaded table 1 summarized all the instruments used for the 3d 3t model the instruments for air temperature and net radiation were installed on a 7 m steel rod which is fixed on a movable stand for each measurement we needed two people to adjust the height of the steel rod and move the stand to different locations and one people to take thermal images for the same time for the inputs of the 3d 3t model during daytime measurements on 10 different points around the crown were conducted every 2 h with three replicates from 8 00 to 17 00 on november 4 5 6 7 8 and 15 2016 in addition leaf transpiration rate measured by the li 6400xt and similar measurements for the 3d 3t model were conducted every hour from 20 00 on june 24 to 5 00 on june 25 2016 2 3 data analysis and model improvement 2 3 1 estimation of the transpiration rate by the sap flow method the sap flux density fd g m 2 s 1 was calculated using the empirical equation from granier 1987 as follows 1 f d 119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where fd is the sap flux density g m 2 s 1 δt is the temperature difference between the heated and the unheated probes and δtm is the maximum temperature difference between the two probes when the sap flow was expected to be zero the sap flow density was calculated using the baseliner program v3 0 11 designed by the c h2o ecology lab group of duke university the maximum temperature differences were defined when the nighttime vapor pressure deficit was lower than 0 05 kpa the transpiration rate water use of the whole tree tr mm h 1 was calculated as follows 2 t r f d 3600 1 0 3 a s a c where ac is the crown area 28 27 m2 and as is the sapwood area m2 the conducting wood area for 10 f concinna trees on the campus was determined from wood cores using a haglof increment borer and the sapwood area was distinguished from heartwood by the distinct color change after dyeing the sapwood area for the target tree could then be estimated from the dbh by using the following equation tan 2016 3 a s a d b h b where a and b are the fitting parameters from the other 10 f concinna trees for the present study a and b were equal to 1 01 and 1 79 respectively the dbh for these trees ranged from 3 6 cm to 22 5 cm 2 3 2 estimation of the transpiration rate by the 3d 3t model the 3t model was proposed by qiu 1996 and used to estimate et for bare soil vegetation or a mixture of soil and vegetation qiu et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 by including a reference leaf which is leaf without transpiration but under similar meteorological conditions as vegetation the 2d 3t model for the estimation of vegetation transpiration can be expressed as follows more details are provided by qiu 1996 and qiu et al 2015 4 l e c r n c r n c p t c t a t cp t a where lec w m 2 is the canopy transpiration latent heat transpiration rate and rn c w m 2 and rn cp w m 2 are the net radiation of the canopy and reference leaves leaf with no transpiration respectively tc tcp and ta are the canopy surface temperature reference leaf surface temperature and air temperature c respectively all the parameters are measured from the top of the canopy however for a large individual tree canopy under urban conditions such as f concinna differences in the energy budget occurred among different parts of the crown we hypothesized that transpiration and energy exchange occur from the whole canopy to different directions not just from the top therefore the energy budget for the whole crown can be expressed as follows 5 1 n r n i l i 1 n l e i l i 1 n h i l i where i is the various parts of the canopy i 1 n where n is equal to 10 in this study rn i w m 2 is the net radiation of part i of the canopy lei w m 2 is the latent heat flux of part i of the canopy hi w m 2 is the sensible heat flux of part i of the canopy and li is the ratio of the surface area of each part of the canopy to the total surface area of the canopy combining eqs 4 and 5 the transpiration rate under 3d condition can be expressed as follows 3d 3t model 6 l e c 1 n l e c i l i 1 n r c i r cp i t c i t a i t cp i t a i l i the temperature term in eq 4 can be used to evaluate the environmental quality and plant water status and was defined as the plant transpiration transfer coefficient hat qiu et al 2009 7 h at t c t a t c p t a theoretically hat 1 when the vegetation is subjected to a large water deficit or environmental stress tc tcp hat is assumed to be the maximum value hat 1 and transpiration is its minimum value zero this minimum transpiration is limited by the lack of water supply however when hat has a minimum value transpiration can reach a maximum value potential transpiration rate which is controlled by the available energy and atmospheric diffusion conditions therefore hat can determine the transpiration rate from the minimum value to the maximum value generally a lower value of hat corresponds to a higher transpiration rate qiu et al 2009 in this study the performances of the 2d 3t model and 3d 3t model in the daytime were evaluated by the sap flow method while during the nighttime the plant transpiration transfer coefficient was compared with the transpiration rate measured by the li 6400xt portable photosynthesis measurement system in our study the ratio of the surface area of each part of the canopy to the total surface area of the canopy was estimated by assuming the whole crown to be a half sphere with a radius of 3 m according to the projected image of the crown on the ground the ratio of the surface area of the top upper sides 4 directions lower sides 4 directions and bottom was 6 3 4 4 4 18 2 3 3 data analyses and parameter calculation for the present study the results from the 3d 3t model and sap flow measurement were

and 15 2016 was performed in excel 2016 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa the statistical analysis of the fitting parameter was conducted using the eviews 8 software package for windows eviews his global inc london uk the wald test was used to test the parameter differences for linear fitting cures a probability of p 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant 3 results 3 1 performances of the 2d 3t model and 3d 3t model in the daytime the 2d 3t model was first used here to estimate the transpiration rate of f concinna and the results were compared with the sap flow measurements fig 3 it was shown that although the variation trends were similar for the two methods the transpiration rate was clearly overestimated by the 2d 3t model for an individual urban tree the daytime water use measured by the sap flow measurement was less than 2 mm while it was approximately 4 6 mm for the 2d 3t model fig 3d considering the heterogeneity of the whole crown and the different solar radiation on different parts of the canopy measurements were conducted at 10 points at different locations and directions throughout the canopy and the 3d 3t model was used for estimation of transpiration the results were shown in figs 4 and 5 a comparison of the diurnal transpiration estimates by the proposed model and the sap flow method for november 4 6 and november 8 2016 is shown in fig 4 it clearly showed that both the trends and values of the two estimates were similar to each other with root mean square error rmse of 0 01 0 02 mm h 1 respectively furthermore the linear regression analysis between the estimated transpiration from the 3d 3t model and the measured transpiration from the sap flow method showed that the scatter distribution was very close to the 1 1 line with a determination coefficient of 0 89 and rmse of 0 02 mm h 1 fig 5a the intercept of the regression line 0 01 was not significantly different from zero at the 0 05 probability level however the slope was slightly higher than the unity 1 10 thereby suggesting a slight overestimation from the 3d 3t model in addition both the transpiration rates measured by sap flow method and the transpiration rates estimated by the 3d 3t model have good correlations with the potential evapotranspiration r2 0 51 as shown in fig 5b the intercepts of both regression lines were close to zero and the slopes were 0 21 and 0 23 respectively therefore the good consistency between the estimates and measurements r2 0 89 rmse 0 02 mm h 1 indicated that the 3d 3t model is an accurate and applicable method for estimating the transpiration of individual trees 3 2 validation of the 3d 3t model during nighttime as verified in section 3 1 the 3d 3t model proved to be applicable for estimating the daytime transpiration rate of individual urban trees and needed to be further validated for the nighttime however it is generally accepted that nighttime sap flow can be used for water refilling and transpiration and it is difficult to accurately partition the two components by the sap flow method fisher et al 2007 thereby making it inappropriate to validate the 3d 3t model during the nighttime therefore this study evaluated the proposed model by the measurements from the li 6400xt as shown in fig 6 the leaf stomatal conductance on the west and north side is slightly higher than that on the east and the south the higher stomatal conductance on the west between 20 00 to 22 00 might have been due to the exposure of the west part of the canopy to more sunlight than that of the other sides before sunset the nighttime stomatal conductance of f concinna was greater than zero until 2 00 indicating that the stomata remained partially open during this period fig 6a in addition the nighttime sap flow was consistent with the change in the leaf stomatal conductance with a determination coefficient of 0 74 fig 6b this strong correlation indicated that the night stomatal conductance could adequately explain the change in sap flow and the occurrence of transpiration however it is difficult to determine the nighttime transpiration by the sap flow and stomatal conductivity methods therefore we attempted to use the transpiration transfer coefficient hat to indicate the nighttime transpiration fig 7 shows a comparison of the leaf transpiration rate measured by the li 6400xt and hat of f concinna at nighttime on june 24 2016 and in the early morning on june 25 2016 the leaf transpiration rate was 0 36 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 at 20 00 and then decreased gradually to close to 0 around and after 2 00 meanwhile it was shown that hat increased rapidly from 0 71 at 20 00 to 0 86 at 1 00 and afterwards it maintained a high value of between 0 87 and 0 90 in this study a hat value of 0 86 can be regarded as the threshold to indicate whether transpiration occurs if hat 0 86 transpiration could be very close to zero fig 7b the change in hat adequately reflected the change of nighttime transpiration these results illustrated the applicability of hat to estimate of nighttime transpiration 3 3 characteristics of the daytime energy budget for an individual urban tree canopy fig 8 shows the diurnal leaf temperatures from various parts of the crown on november 4 2016 the highest leaf temperature was observed on the top with the strongest radiation while the lowest appeared at the bottom with a maximum difference of 4 61 c at 12 00 in addition larger variations among different directions were observed for the upper sides than the lower sides it also showed that for the other three directions except for the north direction leaf temperatures were generally higher at the lower sides than at the upper sides which might be attributed to the better cooling effect from the higher transpiration rate at the upper sides with slightly better radiation conditions data not shown these 3d temperature distributions reflected different energy exchanges for each part of the crown thus it is necessary to develop a 3d model for the estimation of the transpiration and energy budget of the crown fig 9 shows the diurnal transpiration rate from various parts of the canopy on november 4 2016 the highest transpiration rate was found at the top with a maximum value of 0 78 mm h 1 at 12 00 while the transpiration rate at the bottom was close to zero 0 01 0 02 mm h 1 and was almost negligible similarly the transpiration rates at the upper sides and lower sides on the north were less than 0 06 mm h 1 the transpiration rates of the upper side and lower side crown on the south showed typical diurnal variations ranging from 0 03 to 0 61 mm h 1 and from 0 01 to 0 57 mm h 1 respectively the upper side and lower side of the crown on the east generally had high transpiration rates in the morning which reached peaks of 0 68 mm h 1 and 0 23 mm h 1 at 10 00 local time respectively the transpiration rates of the upper side and lower side of the crown on the west were higher in the afternoon with peaks of 0 20 mm h 1 and 0 10 mm h 1 at 16 00 respectively although the energy budget of urban tree canopy is considered important the understanding of energy budget of individual tree canopy is not clear due to the lack of accurate estimation of the latent heat flux of the canopy by using the 3d 3t model to estimate the latent heat flux the energy budget was analyzed for the whole tree crown for the period of november 4 6 and november 8 2016 fig 10 although the diurnal variations in rn and the le had a single peak there was a lag between them rn peaked at around 10 00 while le reached its peak 2 h after rn the le could be very close to rn and sometimes larger than rn suggesting that the energy from radiation is mostly consumed by the latent heat flux transpiration meanwhile it was shown that almost all the values of sensible heat flux h were negative even on sunny days for example on november 4 when clouds appeared and net radiation significantly declined the positive h changed to negative on cloudy days november 6 and 8 it was negative for the whole daytime these results indicated that urban sensible heat migrated from the surrounding atmosphere toward the canopy these results clearly showed that besides solar radiation the canopy also absorbed sensible heat as an energy source from the surrounding air for transpiration which is important for mitigating the effect of uhi and reducing the negative effect of heat waves 4 discussion tree transpiration in urban areas which plays an important role in municipal water budgets as well as energy budgets is difficult to measure or model because of the diverse plant composition growing conditions and micrometeorological conditions in street canyons kong et al 2016 litvak and pataki 2015 litvak et al 2017a rahman et al 2017 owing to the lack of measuring or modelling methods urban et is often ignored or underestimated by models liu et al 2017 to overcome this challenge the 2d 3t model which can provide reasonable results for urban lawns qiu et al 2017 was first employed to estimate the transpiration rate of urban f concinna which showed high potential for the cooling effect although similar variation trends were showed between the 2d 3t model and the sap flow method the 2d 3t model clearly overestimated the transpiration rate this is because the exchange of water through transpiration and energy between the individual tree canopy and the surrounding air occurs from all directions however the 2d 3t model assumes that the energy for transpiration only comes from the top of canopy in this context the 2d 3t model was extended to three dimensions to considering the role of micrometeorological variability and the differences in energy budget at each point around the crown we found a lower transpiration peak in the afternoon which might be due to the shadow effect of another large tree on the west these large differences in transpiration rates at different locations and directions of the tree crown could be attributed to the different radiation conditions for each part of canopy in addition there was a good consistency between the daytime estimates and measurements r2 0 89 and the model estimation was within acceptable limits rmse 0 02 mm h 1 during nighttime hat in the 3t model was in a good agreement with transpiration rates directly measured by the li 6400xt portable photosynthesis measurement system r2 0 97 illustrating the potential applicability of hat to estimate nighttime transpiration these results show that the 3d 3t model is a reasonable method for measuring the transpiration rate and the 3d energy budget of individual urban trees and that it can be an effective alternative to the sap flow method for trees under strict protection because of its remote and non destructive characteristics there are mainly three advantages of the 3d 3t model firstly it is difficult to estimate urban et accurately based on limited onsite micrometeorological data because the spatial differences in urban micrometeorological conditions are poorly characterized digiovanni et al 2013 grimmond and oke 2002 gober et al 2009 the proposed model is able to assess the spatial differences in energy balance which is associated with the spatial differences in micrometeorological conditions around the crown secondly although there are some mechanistic models which also account for site scale variability in micrometeorological conditions chen et al 2011 järvi et al 2011 jiang and weng 2017 lemonsu et al 2007 lemonsu et al 2012 these models remain unverified for lack of observed data in contrast the 3d 3t model was validated by the sap flow method lastly but not least these models that consider the influence of urban green areas and differences in local microclimatic conditions requires a number of inputs which are difficult to parameterize with limited existing data sets on the contrary only a minimum number of parameters net radiation reference net radiation leaf temperature reference leaf temperature and air temperature are required in the 3d 3t model and these critical site specific micrometeorological inputs are easy to parameterize with minimum measurements essentially the proposed 3d 3t model eq 6 is a theoretical model that provides a new methodology and possibility to measure tree transpiration under urban conditions it requires the measurement of the canopy surface temperature not only from the top but also from several locations at the sides in this study we measured the surface temperature from 10 n 10 different locations because the measured surface from these 10 locations can almost covered all of the canopy total of 768 000 measurement points the parameter n in eq 6 is flexible and can be adjusted according to different requirements and the local situation the basic principle is to meet the minimum representation requirement because the proposed model needs to adjust position of the instruments for each measurement which might lead to potential errors improvements could be made by in situ measurements around the crown for the spatial distribution of micrometeorological conditions and the unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared remote sensing for the spatial distribution of surface temperature however the following points require further attention 1 although the plant transpiration transfer coefficient was closely related to the nighttime transpiration there may be errors when the reference leaf temperature is close air temperature zhou et al 2014 2 one possible way to obtain the reference leaf temperature is to use the measured maximum temperature the canopy as a substitute which has been successfully applied for remotely estimating regional evapotranspiration xiong and qiu 2014 3 this study focused on an individual urban tree to explore the basic mechanistic and verify the proposed methodology in this study although the 3d 3t model can obtain reasonable transpiration data for f concinna and it is expected to be applicable for other tree species because it is a mechanistic model it still needs to be validated for other urban tree species and further developed in the future 5 conclusion a 3d 3t model was proposed and verified to estimate the transpiration rate of an individual urban tree in this study the results showed that there was a good agreement between the 3d 3t model and the sap flow method with a determination coefficient of 0 89 and rmse of 0 02 mm h 1 during the nighttime the leaf transpiration rate measured by the li 6400xt and the plant transpiration transfer coefficient obtained by the 3d 3t model also showed a good agreement r2 0 97 these results indicate that the 3d 3t model is an accurate mechanic model for estimating the transpiration of individual trees to the best of our knowledge this is the first successful non destructive method for estimating the transpiration of large individual trees the good consistency between the nighttime sap flow and leaf stomatal conductance r2 0 74 validates the occurrence of nighttime transpiration in addition a hat value less than 0 86 for f concinna can be used as an indicate of the occurrence of night transpiration if hat 0 86 transpiration could be close to zero and there is no nighttime transpiration besides solar radiation the sensible heat flux between the canopy and the surrounding air can also provide a portion of the energy for transpiration under urban conditions therefore tree transpiration not only consumes most of the solar radiation but also the sensible heat flux from the surroundings thereby helping to reduce the ambient temperature mitigating the uhi effect and heat waves although the 3d 3t model can obtain reasonable transpiration data for f concinna and it is expected to be applicable for other tree species because it is a mechanistic model further validations for other urban tree species are needed and the proposed model can be improved by in situ measurements around the crown for the spatial distribution of micrometeorological conditions and uav thermal infrared remote

5455,mitigation of the urban heat island uhi effect by regulating the transpiration rate of urban vegetation is one of the most important aspects for adapting to global warming and urbanization accurate estimation of the transpiration rate of urban trees is critical for it urban trees are usually geographically dispersed e g street trees and the only feasible method to measure the transpiration rate is the sap flow method which is seriously limited owing to its destructiveness and lack of representativeness to overcome this challenge this study developed an advanced approach based on the three temperature 3t model by extending its energy balance from two dimensional 2d to three dimensional 3d the advanced approach was thus named as the 3d 3t model and verified by the sap flow method the results showed that 1 there was a good agreement between the results of the two methodologies in the daytime with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 88 and root mean square error rmse of 0 01 mm h 1 this is the first result worldwide to successfully measure the transpiration rate for a large tree without contact or damage 2 the leaf transpiration rate measured by a li 6400xt and the plant transpiration transfer coefficient of ficus concinna from the 3d 3t model also showed a good agreement at nighttime r2 0 97 3 the urban f concinna could consume not only most of the net radiation but also the sensible heat from the surrounding air thereby helping to reduce the ambient temperature and mitigate the uhi effect these results provide a feasible way to accurately estimate the transpiration rate of individual urban trees and may be useful for urban environmental management and urban planning keywords transpiration three temperature model thermal infrared remote sensing sap flow 1 introduction under the dual impact of global warming and urbanization urban heat islands uhis and heat waves have been observed worldwide they have caused adverse effects such as an increase in energy consumption and anthropogenic heat generation an increase in atmospheric pollutants affecting living environment and human health chen et al 2014 dousset et al 2011 gabriel and endlicher 2011 kalnay and cai 2003 linares and diaz 2008 sun et al 2014 it is urgent to regulate the uhi effect and improve the urban thermal environment possible measures include modifying the albedo of urban buildings reducing human heat discharge and absorbing the anthropogenic heat and solar energy by evapotranspiration et from urban water or vegetation rizwan et al 2008 taha 1997 many studies have demonstrated the cooling effect of urban vegetation which differed in the vegetation area distribution composition and configuration li and zhou 2019 kong et al 2016 potchter et al 2006 jenerette et al 2007 weng and yang 2004 yan et al 2020 although the cooling effects of vegetation have been attributed to the extra transpiration dimoudi and nikolopoulou 2003 peters et al 2015 scott et al 1998 it is still challenging to obtain a quantitative relationship between the cooling effect and the transpiration rate johnson et al 2015 kong et al 2016 liu et al 2017 rahman et al 2015 especially for urban forests with the largest cooling effect potchter et al 2006 weng and yang 2004 owing to the diverse plant composition growing conditions and micrometeorological conditions in street canyons tree transpiration in urban areas is usually difficult to measure or model georgi and dimitriou 2010 kong et al 2016 litvak and pataki 2015 litvak et al 2017a rahman et al 2017 wang 2003 wu et al 2012 yan et al 2012 in addition urban et is often ignored or underestimated by models liu et al 2017 for example ignoring et from trees may cause serious underestimation of the latent heat flux le even at sites with relatively low tree coverage liu et al 2017 lysimeter and sap flow methods have been applied to measure the transpiration of urban vegetation asawa et al 2017 jacobs et al 2015 pataki et al 2011 but the application of lysimeter is restricted for large trees wullschleger et al 1998 thereby making the sap flow method the only available methodology to measure the transpiration rate of urban trees nevertheless it is difficult for the results from a single tree represent other trees owing to the diversity of tree species age size and habitat ewers et al 2002 horna et al 2011 kumagai et al 2008 moreover the required number of instruments and the need for tree protection will also limit the use of the sap flow method making it difficult to measure transpiration of a large quantity of urban trees in recent years many models have been developed to estimate urban et but most are empirical models beeson 2016 bournez et al 2016 gkatsopoulos 2017 johnson et al 2015 litvak and pataki 2015 litvak et al 2017b for example reference et has been applied to calculate et in cities with site specific empirical coefficients but the results have not been verified beeson 2016 johnson et al 2015 although some urban energy water balance models have been applied for urban sites validation of these methods is actually limited by the current availability of observed data lemonsu et al 2007 2012 jiang and weng 2017 for example the town energy balance teb model have been improved for urban areas and it can explicitly reveal the influences of urban vegetation areas as well the differences in local microclimatic conditions lemonsu et al 2007 2012 however it has not been evaluated with no actual urban observations similarly the two source energy balance tseb model can provide reasonable variations of urban et but the model itself is not suitable for the urban environment and more importantly the results remain unverified jiang and weng 2017 other models such as the weather research and forecasting model wrf urban model chen et al 2011 and the surface urban energy balance scheme suews järvi et al 2011 has been developed for the neighborhood scale however these models needed a vast number of site specific micrometeorological parameters which are difficult to parameterize with limited existing data sets the three temperature 3t model proposed by qiu 1996 requires a minimum number of parameters net radiation soil heat flux surface temperature of the drying surface and dry soil and air temperature and does not include aerodynamic resistance which makes it is easy to apply in combination with thermal remote sensing until now it has been applied and verified to estimate et under conditions of various scales from ground based thermal remote sensing qiu and ben asher 2010 qiu and zhao 2010 qiu et al 1996 2002 2003 2006 2015 to satellite based thermal remote sensing luo et al 2012 tian et al 2013 wang et al 2016 xiong and qiu 2011 2014 xiong et al 2019 in addition qiu et al 2017 estimated the et of urban lawns using the 3t model infrared remote sensing method and the results were consistent with the measured results by the bowen ratio system with rmse less than 0 04 mm 1 our previous study showed that it can provide a reasonable diurnal variation trend of transpiration for large urban tree ficus concinna but fails to accurately estimate the transpiration rate tan 2016 the reason for this discrepancy might be that the original 3t model two dimensional 2d 3t model was primarily developed to estimate the transpiration under 2d conditions where the energy for transpiration is assumed to only originate from solar radiation however for a large individual tree canopy under urban conditions such as that of ficus concinna there might be significant differences in the energy sources for transpiration among different parts of the crown our assumption is that besides solar radiation the sensible heat around the canopy also provides additional energy for transpiration which cannot be neglected under urban conditions to verify this hypothesis an advanced three dimensional 3d method to measure urban tree transpiration is necessary therefore the objectives of the study were 1 to improve the 2d 3t model ir remote sensing method into a 3d 3t model ir remote sensing method 2 to verify its accuracy and applicability for daytime and nighttime and 3 to identify the energy sources for transpiration in different parts of the tree canopy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study area is located in the university town of shenzhen guangdong province china 22 26 59 22 51 49 n 113 45 44 114 37 21 e it is subjected to the influence of subtropical oceanic monsoons with the coldest month in january 14 9 c and hottest month in july 28 6 c the mean annual air temperature is 22 3 c the mean daily solar radiation is 14 3 mj m 2 and the sunshine duration is 5 6 h the mean annual precipitation is 1924 7 mm most of which occurs between april and september the mean annual wind speed is 2 7 m s 1 and it is higher in spring and winter reaching 2 8 3 0 m s 1 f concinna is a native tree species that is commonly cultivated in subtropical areas e g guangdong guangxi guizhou and yunnan provinces chinese academy of science flora of china editorial board 1998 because it has low soil requirements a fast growth rate developed root system strong shade strong wind resistance and low cultivation and maintenance cost it has been widely used in the greening of subtropical cities zhang et al 2011 in addition it generally has a large crown structure which might show a clear 3d distribution of the energy budget therefore f concinna was selected for the present study the experimental site was located in the campus of peking university shenzhen graduate school fig 1 the target tree of f concinna with a large crown are selected in an open area between two buildings the height diameter at the breast height dbh and crown area of the target tree were 8 m 22 cm and 27 m2 respectively 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 sap flow measurement the sap flux density of the target tree was measured using the thermal dissipation method granier 1987 a pair of sf g type probes length 20 mm diameter 2 mm ecomatik munich germany were installed the breast height on the north side to avoid the thermal effect caused by direct sunlight in this study we assumed that there was no azimuthal variability in the sap flow thus we installed one commercial sap flow sensor for the target tree and replaced it with a new sensor at the beginning of the growing season for each year a radiation protection shield was also installed around the sensor to minimize the temperature fluctuations in the sapwood and the top of the shield was sealed off with silicon paste to protect the sensors from dripping rainwater sap flow data were sampled every minute and 5 min averages were recorded on a data logger from july 11 2014 to the present cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for the purpose of sap flow data process meteorological data including solar radiation photosynthetic active radiation net radiation soil heat flux air temperature and humidity were also measured and recorded by the bowen ratio system at intervals of 10 min for the same period more details about the bowen ratio system are provided by qiu et al 2017 to determine whether the observed nighttime sap flow was used for nighttime transpiration the leaf stomata status at night was investigated and nighttime leaf stomatal conductance was measured every hour from 18 00 to 5 00 local time on june 24th and 25th 2016 using a li 6400xt portable photosynthesis measurement system li cor lincoln ne usa to keep the leaves under natural conditions the measurements were conducted on a ladder and three healthy mature and clean leaves were randomly selected for measurement the period with net radiation of less than 5 w m 2 was generally defined as night daley and phillips 2006 wang et al 2012 2 2 2 measurement of input parameters for the 3d 3t model considering its large crown the f concinna tree may have different transpiration rates at different areas of the crown which need to be measured separately in this study 10 observation locations points around the tree were determined by considering the crown size and the field of view of the thermal camera ir flexcam ti55 thermal imager fluke corp usa fig 2 the points were distributed with one at the top one at the bottom four at the upper sides east west south and north and four at lower sides east west south and north measurements were carried out from these locations toward the canopy the observation directions were vertical to the ground at the top and bottom while they were horizontal to the ground from the eight other locations the net radiation air temperature canopy surface temperature and reference leaf temperature were measured from these 10 locations every 2 h on sunny days the net radiation was measured by a cnr4 net radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands which was installed on a 7 m steel rod to measure the net radiation at different points the installation position and direction of the net radiometer was adjusted correspondingly meanwhile a t type thermocouple resolution of 0 1 c was installed near the radiometer to measure the air temperature in addition the net radiation and temperature of the reference leave with no transpiration were measured synchronously we used dry green paper 420 mm 297 mm as the reference leaf the reference leave were installed at the corresponding location at the top bottom upper sides east south west and north and lower sides east south west and north of canopy and a total of 10 reference leave were measured to avoid the net radiation observation error caused by the material color and roughness the color of the green paper was as close as possible to that of the actual leaf color with a smooth surface the reference leave were placed about 20 cm from each observation point 30 min before each measurement to provide similar circumstances to the leave in the canopy the net radiation of the reference leave were then measured by the cnr4 net radiometer and the surface temperatures of reference leave reference temperature were measured using an ir flexcam ti55 thermal imager fluke corp usa the temperatures of 76 800 points can be measured in one shot by this thermal imager to obtain the 3d temperature distribution of the tree crown ground based thermal remote sensing was conducted at each location using the ir flexcam ti55 thermal imager to keep the shooting angle vertical to each part of tree crown the thermal images of the bottom and lower sides were taken on the ground and the thermal images of the top and upper sides were taken on the surrounding buildings the temperatures were averaged separately for the sunlit leaves when the layer was facing to sunshine or for the shaded leaves when the layer was shaded table 1 summarized all the instruments used for the 3d 3t model the instruments for air temperature and net radiation were installed on a 7 m steel rod which is fixed on a movable stand for each measurement we needed two people to adjust the height of the steel rod and move the stand to different locations and one people to take thermal images for the same time for the inputs of the 3d 3t model during daytime measurements on 10 different points around the crown were conducted every 2 h with three replicates from 8 00 to 17 00 on november 4 5 6 7 8 and 15 2016 in addition leaf transpiration rate measured by the li 6400xt and similar measurements for the 3d 3t model were conducted every hour from 20 00 on june 24 to 5 00 on june 25 2016 2 3 data analysis and model improvement 2 3 1 estimation of the transpiration rate by the sap flow method the sap flux density fd g m 2 s 1 was calculated using the empirical equation from granier 1987 as follows 1 f d 119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where fd is the sap flux density g m 2 s 1 δt is the temperature difference between the heated and the unheated probes and δtm is the maximum temperature difference between the two probes when the sap flow was expected to be zero the sap flow density was calculated using the baseliner program v3 0 11 designed by the c h2o ecology lab group of duke university the maximum temperature differences were defined when the nighttime vapor pressure deficit was lower than 0 05 kpa the transpiration rate water use of the whole tree tr mm h 1 was calculated as follows 2 t r f d 3600 1 0 3 a s a c where ac is the crown area 28 27 m2 and as is the sapwood area m2 the conducting wood area for 10 f concinna trees on the campus was determined from wood cores using a haglof increment borer and the sapwood area was distinguished from heartwood by the distinct color change after dyeing the sapwood area for the target tree could then be estimated from the dbh by using the following equation tan 2016 3 a s a d b h b where a and b are the fitting parameters from the other 10 f concinna trees for the present study a and b were equal to 1 01 and 1 79 respectively the dbh for these trees ranged from 3 6 cm to 22 5 cm 2 3 2 estimation of the transpiration rate by the 3d 3t model the 3t model was proposed by qiu 1996 and used to estimate et for bare soil vegetation or a mixture of soil and vegetation qiu et al 2015 xiong et al 2019 by including a reference leaf which is leaf without transpiration but under similar meteorological conditions as vegetation the 2d 3t model for the estimation of vegetation transpiration can be expressed as follows more details are provided by qiu 1996 and qiu et al 2015 4 l e c r n c r n c p t c t a t cp t a where lec w m 2 is the canopy transpiration latent heat transpiration rate and rn c w m 2 and rn cp w m 2 are the net radiation of the canopy and reference leaves leaf with no transpiration respectively tc tcp and ta are the canopy surface temperature reference leaf surface temperature and air temperature c respectively all the parameters are measured from the top of the canopy however for a large individual tree canopy under urban conditions such as f concinna differences in the energy budget occurred among different parts of the crown we hypothesized that transpiration and energy exchange occur from the whole canopy to different directions not just from the top therefore the energy budget for the whole crown can be expressed as follows 5 1 n r n i l i 1 n l e i l i 1 n h i l i where i is the various parts of the canopy i 1 n where n is equal to 10 in this study rn i w m 2 is the net radiation of part i of the canopy lei w m 2 is the latent heat flux of part i of the canopy hi w m 2 is the sensible heat flux of part i of the canopy and li is the ratio of the surface area of each part of the canopy to the total surface area of the canopy combining eqs 4 and 5 the transpiration rate under 3d condition can be expressed as follows 3d 3t model 6 l e c 1 n l e c i l i 1 n r c i r cp i t c i t a i t cp i t a i l i the temperature term in eq 4 can be used to evaluate the environmental quality and plant water status and was defined as the plant transpiration transfer coefficient hat qiu et al 2009 7 h at t c t a t c p t a theoretically hat 1 when the vegetation is subjected to a large water deficit or environmental stress tc tcp hat is assumed to be the maximum value hat 1 and transpiration is its minimum value zero this minimum transpiration is limited by the lack of water supply however when hat has a minimum value transpiration can reach a maximum value potential transpiration rate which is controlled by the available energy and atmospheric diffusion conditions therefore hat can determine the transpiration rate from the minimum value to the maximum value generally a lower value of hat corresponds to a higher transpiration rate qiu et al 2009 in this study the performances of the 2d 3t model and 3d 3t model in the daytime were evaluated by the sap flow method while during the nighttime the plant transpiration transfer coefficient was compared with the transpiration rate measured by the li 6400xt portable photosynthesis measurement system in our study the ratio of the surface area of each part of the canopy to the total surface area of the canopy was estimated by assuming the whole crown to be a half sphere with a radius of 3 m according to the projected image of the crown on the ground the ratio of the surface area of the top upper sides 4 directions lower sides 4 directions and bottom was 6 3 4 4 4 18 2 3 3 data analyses and parameter calculation for the present study the results from the 3d 3t model and sap flow measurement were

and 15 2016 was performed in excel 2016 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa the statistical analysis of the fitting parameter was conducted using the eviews 8 software package for windows eviews his global inc london uk the wald test was used to test the parameter differences for linear fitting cures a probability of p 0 05 was regarded as statistically significant 3 results 3 1 performances of the 2d 3t model and 3d 3t model in the daytime the 2d 3t model was first used here to estimate the transpiration rate of f concinna and the results were compared with the sap flow measurements fig 3 it was shown that although the variation trends were similar for the two methods the transpiration rate was clearly overestimated by the 2d 3t model for an individual urban tree the daytime water use measured by the sap flow measurement was less than 2 mm while it was approximately 4 6 mm for the 2d 3t model fig 3d considering the heterogeneity of the whole crown and the different solar radiation on different parts of the canopy measurements were conducted at 10 points at different locations and directions throughout the canopy and the 3d 3t model was used for estimation of transpiration the results were shown in figs 4 and 5 a comparison of the diurnal transpiration estimates by the proposed model and the sap flow method for november 4 6 and november 8 2016 is shown in fig 4 it clearly showed that both the trends and values of the two estimates were similar to each other with root mean square error rmse of 0 01 0 02 mm h 1 respectively furthermore the linear regression analysis between the estimated transpiration from the 3d 3t model and the measured transpiration from the sap flow method showed that the scatter distribution was very close to the 1 1 line with a determination coefficient of 0 89 and rmse of 0 02 mm h 1 fig 5a the intercept of the regression line 0 01 was not significantly different from zero at the 0 05 probability level however the slope was slightly higher than the unity 1 10 thereby suggesting a slight overestimation from the 3d 3t model in addition both the transpiration rates measured by sap flow method and the transpiration rates estimated by the 3d 3t model have good correlations with the potential evapotranspiration r2 0 51 as shown in fig 5b the intercepts of both regression lines were close to zero and the slopes were 0 21 and 0 23 respectively therefore the good consistency between the estimates and measurements r2 0 89 rmse 0 02 mm h 1 indicated that the 3d 3t model is an accurate and applicable method for estimating the transpiration of individual trees 3 2 validation of the 3d 3t model during nighttime as verified in section 3 1 the 3d 3t model proved to be applicable for estimating the daytime transpiration rate of individual urban trees and needed to be further validated for the nighttime however it is generally accepted that nighttime sap flow can be used for water refilling and transpiration and it is difficult to accurately partition the two components by the sap flow method fisher et al 2007 thereby making it inappropriate to validate the 3d 3t model during the nighttime therefore this study evaluated the proposed model by the measurements from the li 6400xt as shown in fig 6 the leaf stomatal conductance on the west and north side is slightly higher than that on the east and the south the higher stomatal conductance on the west between 20 00 to 22 00 might have been due to the exposure of the west part of the canopy to more sunlight than that of the other sides before sunset the nighttime stomatal conductance of f concinna was greater than zero until 2 00 indicating that the stomata remained partially open during this period fig 6a in addition the nighttime sap flow was consistent with the change in the leaf stomatal conductance with a determination coefficient of 0 74 fig 6b this strong correlation indicated that the night stomatal conductance could adequately explain the change in sap flow and the occurrence of transpiration however it is difficult to determine the nighttime transpiration by the sap flow and stomatal conductivity methods therefore we attempted to use the transpiration transfer coefficient hat to indicate the nighttime transpiration fig 7 shows a comparison of the leaf transpiration rate measured by the li 6400xt and hat of f concinna at nighttime on june 24 2016 and in the early morning on june 25 2016 the leaf transpiration rate was 0 36 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 at 20 00 and then decreased gradually to close to 0 around and after 2 00 meanwhile it was shown that hat increased rapidly from 0 71 at 20 00 to 0 86 at 1 00 and afterwards it maintained a high value of between 0 87 and 0 90 in this study a hat value of 0 86 can be regarded as the threshold to indicate whether transpiration occurs if hat 0 86 transpiration could be very close to zero fig 7b the change in hat adequately reflected the change of nighttime transpiration these results illustrated the applicability of hat to estimate of nighttime transpiration 3 3 characteristics of the daytime energy budget for an individual urban tree canopy fig 8 shows the diurnal leaf temperatures from various parts of the crown on november 4 2016 the highest leaf temperature was observed on the top with the strongest radiation while the lowest appeared at the bottom with a maximum difference of 4 61 c at 12 00 in addition larger variations among different directions were observed for the upper sides than the lower sides it also showed that for the other three directions except for the north direction leaf temperatures were generally higher at the lower sides than at the upper sides which might be attributed to the better cooling effect from the higher transpiration rate at the upper sides with slightly better radiation conditions data not shown these 3d temperature distributions reflected different energy exchanges for each part of the crown thus it is necessary to develop a 3d model for the estimation of the transpiration and energy budget of the crown fig 9 shows the diurnal transpiration rate from various parts of the canopy on november 4 2016 the highest transpiration rate was found at the top with a maximum value of 0 78 mm h 1 at 12 00 while the transpiration rate at the bottom was close to zero 0 01 0 02 mm h 1 and was almost negligible similarly the transpiration rates at the upper sides and lower sides on the north were less than 0 06 mm h 1 the transpiration rates of the upper side and lower side crown on the south showed typical diurnal variations ranging from 0 03 to 0 61 mm h 1 and from 0 01 to 0 57 mm h 1 respectively the upper side and lower side of the crown on the east generally had high transpiration rates in the morning which reached peaks of 0 68 mm h 1 and 0 23 mm h 1 at 10 00 local time respectively the transpiration rates of the upper side and lower side of the crown on the west were higher in the afternoon with peaks of 0 20 mm h 1 and 0 10 mm h 1 at 16 00 respectively although the energy budget of urban tree canopy is considered important the understanding of energy budget of individual tree canopy is not clear due to the lack of accurate estimation of the latent heat flux of the canopy by using the 3d 3t model to estimate the latent heat flux the energy budget was analyzed for the whole tree crown for the period of november 4 6 and november 8 2016 fig 10 although the diurnal variations in rn and the le had a single peak there was a lag between them rn peaked at around 10 00 while le reached its peak 2 h after rn the le could be very close to rn and sometimes larger than rn suggesting that the energy from radiation is mostly consumed by the latent heat flux transpiration meanwhile it was shown that almost all the values of sensible heat flux h were negative even on sunny days for example on november 4 when clouds appeared and net radiation significantly declined the positive h changed to negative on cloudy days november 6 and 8 it was negative for the whole daytime these results indicated that urban sensible heat migrated from the surrounding atmosphere toward the canopy these results clearly showed that besides solar radiation the canopy also absorbed sensible heat as an energy source from the surrounding air for transpiration which is important for mitigating the effect of uhi and reducing the negative effect of heat waves 4 discussion tree transpiration in urban areas which plays an important role in municipal water budgets as well as energy budgets is difficult to measure or model because of the diverse plant composition growing conditions and micrometeorological conditions in street canyons kong et al 2016 litvak and pataki 2015 litvak et al 2017a rahman et al 2017 owing to the lack of measuring or modelling methods urban et is often ignored or underestimated by models liu et al 2017 to overcome this challenge the 2d 3t model which can provide reasonable results for urban lawns qiu et al 2017 was first employed to estimate the transpiration rate of urban f concinna which showed high potential for the cooling effect although similar variation trends were showed between the 2d 3t model and the sap flow method the 2d 3t model clearly overestimated the transpiration rate this is because the exchange of water through transpiration and energy between the individual tree canopy and the surrounding air occurs from all directions however the 2d 3t model assumes that the energy for transpiration only comes from the top of canopy in this context the 2d 3t model was extended to three dimensions to considering the role of micrometeorological variability and the differences in energy budget at each point around the crown we found a lower transpiration peak in the afternoon which might be due to the shadow effect of another large tree on the west these large differences in transpiration rates at different locations and directions of the tree crown could be attributed to the different radiation conditions for each part of canopy in addition there was a good consistency between the daytime estimates and measurements r2 0 89 and the model estimation was within acceptable limits rmse 0 02 mm h 1 during nighttime hat in the 3t model was in a good agreement with transpiration rates directly measured by the li 6400xt portable photosynthesis measurement system r2 0 97 illustrating the potential applicability of hat to estimate nighttime transpiration these results show that the 3d 3t model is a reasonable method for measuring the transpiration rate and the 3d energy budget of individual urban trees and that it can be an effective alternative to the sap flow method for trees under strict protection because of its remote and non destructive characteristics there are mainly three advantages of the 3d 3t model firstly it is difficult to estimate urban et accurately based on limited onsite micrometeorological data because the spatial differences in urban micrometeorological conditions are poorly characterized digiovanni et al 2013 grimmond and oke 2002 gober et al 2009 the proposed model is able to assess the spatial differences in energy balance which is associated with the spatial differences in micrometeorological conditions around the crown secondly although there are some mechanistic models which also account for site scale variability in micrometeorological conditions chen et al 2011 järvi et al 2011 jiang and weng 2017 lemonsu et al 2007 lemonsu et al 2012 these models remain unverified for lack of observed data in contrast the 3d 3t model was validated by the sap flow method lastly but not least these models that consider the influence of urban green areas and differences in local microclimatic conditions requires a number of inputs which are difficult to parameterize with limited existing data sets on the contrary only a minimum number of parameters net radiation reference net radiation leaf temperature reference leaf temperature and air temperature are required in the 3d 3t model and these critical site specific micrometeorological inputs are easy to parameterize with minimum measurements essentially the proposed 3d 3t model eq 6 is a theoretical model that provides a new methodology and possibility to measure tree transpiration under urban conditions it requires the measurement of the canopy surface temperature not only from the top but also from several locations at the sides in this study we measured the surface temperature from 10 n 10 different locations because the measured surface from these 10 locations can almost covered all of the canopy total of 768 000 measurement points the parameter n in eq 6 is flexible and can be adjusted according to different requirements and the local situation the basic principle is to meet the minimum representation requirement because the proposed model needs to adjust position of the instruments for each measurement which might lead to potential errors improvements could be made by in situ measurements around the crown for the spatial distribution of micrometeorological conditions and the unmanned aerial vehicle uav thermal infrared remote sensing for the spatial distribution of surface temperature however the following points require further attention 1 although the plant transpiration transfer coefficient was closely related to the nighttime transpiration there may be errors when the reference leaf temperature is close air temperature zhou et al 2014 2 one possible way to obtain the reference leaf temperature is to use the measured maximum temperature the canopy as a substitute which has been successfully applied for remotely estimating regional evapotranspiration xiong and qiu 2014 3 this study focused on an individual urban tree to explore the basic mechanistic and verify the proposed methodology in this study although the 3d 3t model can obtain reasonable transpiration data for f concinna and it is expected to be applicable for other tree species because it is a mechanistic model it still needs to be validated for other urban tree species and further developed in the future 5 conclusion a 3d 3t model was proposed and verified to estimate the transpiration rate of an individual urban tree in this study the results showed that there was a good agreement between the 3d 3t model and the sap flow method with a determination coefficient of 0 89 and rmse of 0 02 mm h 1 during the nighttime the leaf transpiration rate measured by the li 6400xt and the plant transpiration transfer coefficient obtained by the 3d 3t model also showed a good agreement r2 0 97 these results indicate that the 3d 3t model is an accurate mechanic model for estimating the transpiration of individual trees to the best of our knowledge this is the first successful non destructive method for estimating the transpiration of large individual trees the good consistency between the nighttime sap flow and leaf stomatal conductance r2 0 74 validates the occurrence of nighttime transpiration in addition a hat value less than 0 86 for f concinna can be used as an indicate of the occurrence of night transpiration if hat 0 86 transpiration could be close to zero and there is no nighttime transpiration besides solar radiation the sensible heat flux between the canopy and the surrounding air can also provide a portion of the energy for transpiration under urban conditions therefore tree transpiration not only consumes most of the solar radiation but also the sensible heat flux from the surroundings thereby helping to reduce the ambient temperature mitigating the uhi effect and heat waves although the 3d 3t model can obtain reasonable transpiration data for f concinna and it is expected to be applicable for other tree species because it is a mechanistic model further validations for other urban tree species are needed and the proposed model can be improved by in situ measurements around the crown for the spatial distribution of micrometeorological conditions and uav thermal infrared remote

5456,hydrological modeling is a challenging task in poorly gauged catchments especially in developing countries like pakistan open access precipitation and temperature datasets with different spatial and temporal resolutions provide alternative sources in data scarce regions however individual satellite precipitation datasets spds have significant uncertainties motivated by data scarcity issues significant spatial and temporal gaps in in situ observations and poor performance of individual spds in hydrological models this study evaluates the performance of two merged precipitation datasets mpds to simulate daily streamflow using soil and water assessment tool swat in potohar plateau pakistan these two mpds are based on dynamic clustered bayesian averaging dcba and dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma respectively and have 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution precipitation data from rain gauges rgs are also used and results were compared with mpds simulated streamflow multi site calibration and validation are performed at seven stations and the performance of rgs dcba and dbma in streamflow simulation was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency ns and percent bias pbias the results demonstrated that precipitation input from rgs presented better performance very good to good in streamflow simulation even with its sparse distribution the performance of dcba showed better agreement with the results from rgs however dbma presented satisfactory results on occasional bases it is concluded from the current study that mpds combines the advantages of individual spds and have higher potential for hydrological applications significantly reduce the uncertainties of individual spds and can be used as alternatives to rgs in poorly gauged or ungauged catchments keywords swat satellite precipitation dynamic clustered bayesian averaging dynamic bayesian model averaging streamflow simulation flow routing 1 introduction hydrological models are indispensable tools to comprehend the hydrological processes in a catchment characterized by spatiotemporal variability and powerful decision making tools for sustainable water resources management practices tuo et al 2016 wellen et al 2015 hydrological models allow users to explain predict and estimate different catchment processes where ground based observations are either scarce not accessible or time consuming and economically inefficient baffaut et al 2015 hydrological models modeling simplify or omit insignificant information in the model structure rather than comprehending all relevant processes to simulate every scenario realistically lambin et al 2003 nguyen et al 2019 therefore hydrological models with different complexity levels have been developed to support different decisions regarding alternative management policies related to efficient water management practices land use and climate change and pollution control rode et al 2010 wellen et al 2015 model structures vary from simple lumped models to complex process based distributed models such as soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 nguyen et al 2019 precipitation and temperature are two important weather variable inputs for hydrological models duan et al 2019 precise estimation and representation of spatial and temporal variability of precipitation and temperature are important for effective simulations and predictions from hydrological models laiti et al 2018 wagner et al 2012 for best simulations a reasonably dense network of stations is required that provide reliable precipitation and temperature inputs to the models and effectively represent the weather at the basin scale however the gauge stations are often sparsely distributed in reality and station based measurements with limited coverage are probably unable to capture the spatial and temporal variability of weather input variables duan et al 2019 the data availability scenario is even worst in developing countries like pakistan and in remote areas where gauge observations are either scarcely available or even not exists the gauge stations are substantially increased over the last few decades in pakistan but their density is still not adequate to meet the scientific and practical requirements rahman et al 2019 on the other hand strict data sharing policy also restricts their free access for public use and inadequate data quality hinders hydrological applications to overcome these problems the data collection process needs significant improvements and or there is a need to explore possible alternative data sources more specifically the application of advanced remote sensing techniques for hydrological applications such as land use and climate change water resources and agricultural water management is needed in pakistan rahman et al 2019 several studies have evaluated the accuracy of open access weather datasets specifically focusing on precipitation data only in hydrological models to simulate streamflow using gauge precipitation data as a reference duan et al 2019 climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr is a common source of weather data precipitation temperature relative humidity etc for the swat community cfsr is an interpolated dataset with a 38 km spatial resolution developed using a climate forecast system with the most available in situ observations and satellite data radcliffe and mukundan 2017 the easy availability of cfsr weather data has attracted many researchers to use the cfsr dataset in hydrological models for example cfsr precipitation data was used in lake tana basin ethiopia to simulate streamflow and satisfactory results have been achieved dile and srinivasan 2014 similar results were reported in four small catchments in the usa and the gumera catchment in ethiopia fuka et al 2014 however unsatisfactory results have been obtained in two upstream catchments of the three gorges reservoir in china yang et al 2014 and two catchments in the usa radcliffe and mukundan 2017 tuo et al 2016 evaluated the performance of chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data as input to the swat model which resulted in satisfactory results in simulating monthly streamflow recently the chirps dataset is evaluated in the upper blue nile basin with four other gridded precipitation datasets and showed high accuracy bayissa et al 2017 duan et al 2019 also reported better performance of chirps as compared to tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and cfsr using swat model to simulate daily and monthly streamflow in the upper gilgel abay basin ethiopia the performance of individual satellite precipitation datasets spds is dependent on many factors including topography climate temporal variability daily monthly seasonal and annually and intensity maggioni et al 2016 however the performance of spds is improving day by day but still individual spds are subjected to significant errors as compared to merged precipitation datasets mpds mpds i e the merging of two or more different spds using relative adaptive or dynamic weights are developed to reduce such kind of non negligible errors in spds ma et al 2018a rahman et al 2018 tang et al 2016 the application of mpds can significantly improve the accuracy of meteorological and hydrological model applications raftery et al 2005 ma et al 2018b evaluated the performance of the mpd developed using the dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma scheme and simulated the discharge in the headwater of the yangtze river using crest coupled routing and excess storage model v2 1 they demonstrated that mpd has higher potential satisfactory to very good nse scores of 0 82 and 0 58 during calibration and validation periods respectively for hydrological modeling at catchment level in remote and complex topographic regions the current study evaluates the performance of two mpds developed using dynamic clustered bayesian averaging dcba and dbma against the rain gauges rgs in streamflow simulations using the swat model which is calibrated and validated at seven sub catchments in potohar plateau pakistan main difficulty in streamflow simulation in the potohar plateau is data scarcity limited precipitation and temperature stations to represent the spatial variability the data scarcity and comparatively lower accuracy of individual spds motivated us to explore the alternative input sources for streamflow simulation this study will answer two important scientific questions should we use the mpds instead of spds to simulate streamflow and other hydrological processes are mpds accurate enough to supersede the conventional application of rgs this study is organized as follows the study area is introduced in section 2 section 3 presents the datasets and methodology section 4 provides detailed results and discussion and section 5 summarizes the conclusions and main findings of the current research 2 study area potohar plateau is situated in north eastern pakistan shown in fig 1 a which is the northern part of punjab province of pakistan the study area borders the western part of azad kashmir and southern part of khyber pakhtunkhwa provinces of pakistan with an area of 22 254 km2 potohar plateau is geographically bounded by jhelum river on the east indus river on the west kala chitta range having haro and soan rivers and famous margalla hills on north and salt ranges on the south elevation of the study area is ranging between 178 and 2255 m above mean sea level a m s l fig 1 b potohar plateau consists of four important districts of jhelum chakwal and rawalpindi as well as the capital islamabad the potohar plateau has a very high undulating topography and erratic precipitation pattern agriculture in the study area is largely dependent on precipitation which averages 380 500 mm annually climate of the plateau is semi arid to sub humid in nature the highest precipitation is recorded in northwest of the study area which declines to an arid condition in the southwest about 80 of precipitation occurs during the monsoon period july to september summer temperature is ranging between 15 c to 40 c while in winter it is 4 c to 25 c fig 1 b shows the location of meteorology stations with measurements of precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity downstream part of the catchment has no precipitation and meteorology stations however upstream stations are enough to simulate streamflow in the catchment the potohar plateau mainly includes seven sub catchments fig 1 c and the distribution of flow gauges used to calibrate and validate the swat model is also shown in fig 1 c streamflow is not simulated in the shaded portion of fig 1 c because there are no flow gauges to record the streamflow at the outlet of the catchment fig 1 d represents the major land use classes i e forest agriculture bare soil and residential area of potohar plateau about 55 of the area is cultivated agricultural area with main crops of wheat barley sorghum legumes melons and tobacco which are grown in fertile areas near the indus river 3 datasets and methodology 3 1 rain gauges rgs meteorology stations and flow gauges data precipitation and meteorology temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed in situ observations data at eight stations fig 1 b for swat were obtained from pakistan meteorology department pmd and water and power development authority wapda however flow records of seven flow gauges fig 1 c are collected from wapda table 1 lists the gauges stations available data and its temporal span after rigorous analyses of obtained in situ data the period 1995 2004 is selected for calibration and validation for which all the data is available during this period all gauges stations have daily precipitation and meteorology data and flow observations with few exceptions since pmd and wapda collect the data manually therefore both organizations follow the world meteorological organization standard code wmo n to evaluate and correct the in situ observations swat model has the capability to fill out missing meteorology data automatically using a weather generator to do so more observed data and further efforts are needed to prepare the input data therefore missing data in precipitation and meteorology observations were filled using the zero order method while the data quality was checked using skewness and kurtosis data quality tests rahman et al 2018 before applying as input to swat model swat model arcswat distributes the gauge station data automatically to the sub catchments using the input data from one gauge station nearest to the centroid of each sub catchment tuo et al 2016 3 2 merged satellite precipitation datasets two merged satellite precipitation datasets mpds one based on dynamic cluster bayesian averaging dcba algorithm rahman et al 2020b and the other based on dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma algorithm rahman et al 2020a are used as alternative precipitation input sources for rain gauges clustered bayesian averaging cba is a relatively new method as compared to traditional bayesian model averaging bma which considers the non regionality of bma using the bayes theorem yu et al 2013 using cba we merged four spds namely tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 v7 climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data record persiann cdr and era interim the spatial and temporal resolutions of the developed mpd are 0 25 and daily scale respectively during 2000 2015 considering the advantages of variation of weights both spatially and temporally dynamic weights the weights are dynamically varied dcba dcba analyses were carried out at pixel by pixel where the coincidence of pixel with each rg is checked with spds both spatially and temporally readers are referred to rahman et al 2020b for a detailed description of dcba methodology the mpd using dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma is developed by following the methodology proposed by ma et al 2018a bma was used to develop an mpd by optimally merging four spds i e trmm tmpa 3b42 v7 cmoprh persiann cdr and era interim at 0 25 spatial and daily temporal scale during 2000 2015 across four climate regions of pakistan rahman et al 2020a the selected four climate regions are glacial humid arid and hyper arid regions the weights of individual spd are optimized on a daily scale ma et al 2018a in the first stage individual spd weights were fitted independently using the expectation maximization em algorithm at each rg and each day em algorithm iterates the optimal parameter in two steps i e e expectation and m maximization until the maximization of the log likelihood function missing data of optimal variable causes the em algorithm to produce an error in maximum log likelihood function mclachlan and krishnan 2007 weights of spds obtained through bma are adjusted at each rg on a daily temporal scale bma weights are applied to the next day merging weights in the second step the next day s weights are calculated based on the previous day s bma weights using a moving averaging scheme forty days training period during each year is selected based on previous literature hamill 2007 ma et al 2018a improving the number of training days improves the accuracy of mpd however no significant improvements are observed beyond 40 days ma et al 2018a therefore the weights for an arbitrary day are dynamically varied using 5 40 days training period forty days before the day under consideration and the same 40 days in each of the previous four years for more details regarding dbma mpd readers are referred to ma et al 2018a and rahman et al 2020a 3 3 flow routing in order to consider the study area as an independent region i e no influence of upstream catchments streamflow is routed from upstream flow gauges if any to the catchment boundary using muskingum cunge mc routing method cunge 1969 flow routing is performed before the application of swat model to get the observed streamflow records without any upstream inflow contribution i e routed streamflow is subtracted from observed flow records at flow gauges inside the study area prior to application of mc the following information are assured franchini et al 2011 upstream section a series of streamflow data q u t recorded over a constant period of time b information about channel cross section a series of values for the wetted area a u t and depth y u t downstream section a series of streamflow data q d t recorded over a constant period of time and related to the same runoff flood events recorded at the upstream gauge b information about channel cross section a series of values for the wetted area a d t and depth y d t besides the reach information between upstream and downstream ends such as length mean slope and mean width are also required mc method considers the distributed lateral

continuous and spatially explicit model arnold et al 1998 swat model is developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture arnold et al 1998 swat is used to simulate hydrological processes such as rainfall runoff evapotranspiration soil erosion and water quality and can be used as a tool to evaluate the impact of land use change on water resources nutrient and sediment transport on the basis of meteorological soil land use land cover data neitsch et al 2011 song et al 2011 tuo et al 2016 swat model divides the entire catchment into sub catchments and then into hrus a unique combination of land use soil type and slope based on digital elevation model dem surface runoff for each hru in the hydrological component of land phase is simulated using daily rainfall by modified soil conservation service scs technique usda 1972 swat also offers the green and ampt infiltration method green and ampt 1911 to simulate surface runoff which requires sub daily precipitation as input in the routing phase simulated streamflow is routed through streams to the outlet of the catchment using either muskingum or variable storage routing rate and velocity of streamflow are defined using manning s equation neitsch et al 2011 land use map soil map including soil properties and elevation data are the basic requirements for swat model for the current study dem 30 m spatial resolution fig 1 b from shuttle radar topographic mission srtm was downloaded from usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov catchment delineation and topographic parameters for swat model were obtained from dem year 2000 middle of analysis period was selected to develop the land use map land use map fig 1 d was extracted from the global land cover

properties required by swat were prepared using harmonized world soil database v1 2 along with fao soil map and associated information moreover we used the default settings for simulating hydrological processes such as penman monteith equation for potential evapotranspiration requires air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed scs curve number method for streamflow simulations and variable storage routing method for streamflow routing 3 5 swat model calibration and validation using swat cup sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 in swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2015 is used to conduct the parameter optimization to mitigate the effect of initial conditions and to allow stable model performance the first three years 1995 1997 are considered as warm up period tuo et al 2016 the daily streamflow in each catchment seven in total in potohar plateau is calibrated and validated at multi sites during 1998 2000 and 2000 2004 respectively in order to ensure the same temporal span of mpds as rgs the precipitation data of cmorph spd is extrapolated backward using the out of sample forecasting technique in sata 15 and then merged with other spds using dcba and dbma approaches the performance of mpds is then calibrated with rgs observations to make sure that there is no significant deviation from observed data sensitive parameters for model calibration are selected based on previous studies abbaspour et al 2015 arnold et al 2012 bhatta et al 2019 cibin et al 2010 duan et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 shrestha et al 2016 the sensitive parameters are then verified using global sensitivity analysis in swat cup table 2 shows the hydrological parameters considered in the current study for each sub catchment multi sites the initial parameter ranges are the physically reasonable intervals for each corresponding parameter according to the literature grusson et al 2015 tuo et al 2016 and swat official documentation arnold et al 2012 the model was calibrated using four iterations with 1000 simulation sum up to a total of 4000 simulations during calibration using nash sutcliffe efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 as an objective function recommended by abbaspour 2015 the parameters range was modified narrowed down after each iteration according to both the new parameters suggested by swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 and their reasonable physical ranges a more detailed description of the calibration procedures can be found in abbaspour 2015 and abbaspour et al 2015 several statistical metrics are available to evaluate model performance bennett et al 2013 in the current study we used the ns percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 as a goodness of fit between observed and simulated streamflow which are defined as 9 ns 1 i q m i q s i 2 i q m i q m 2 10 pbias 100 i q m i q s i i q m i 11 r 2 i q m i q m q s i q s 2 i q m i q m 2 i q s i q s 2 where qm i and qs i are observed and simulated streamflow while q m and q s are averages of observed and simulated streamflow respectively the ns determines the quantitative difference between the observed data and predictions with the desired value of 1 pbias measures the average tendency of simulated values to overestimate underestimate the corresponding observed data desirable value for pbias is 0 and positive and negative values of pbias indicate overestimation and underestimation respectively model performance is divided into four categories by following the criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 unsatisfactory ns 0 50 pbias 25 satisfactory 0 50 ns 0 65 15 pbias 25 good 0 65 ns 0 75 10 pbias 15 and very good ns 0 75 pbias 10 3 6 performance assessment of mpds in streamflow simulation using indicators of hydrologic alterations iha assessment of hydrologic alterations in streams rivers is important for planning and managing water resources understanding and quantifying the human impact on streamflow and ecology and for sustainable stream s biological health bunn and arthington 2002 lytle and poff 2004 poff and zimmerman 2010 hart and breaker 2019 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha developed by the nature conservancy has been successfully utilized to assess the impact of hydrologic alterations human induced changes on streamflow lee et al 2014 richter et al 1996 as suggested by a reviewer here we used iha to assess the alterations of observed streamflow and simulated streamflow using different precipitation datasets i e rgs dcba and dbma as swat inputs rva range of variability approach approach was initially used to assess alterations in streamflow in terms of magnitude duration frequency timing and the rate of change in streamflow the iha consists of 33 hydrological variables in five groups that characterize the intra and inter annual variations in streamflow mathews and richter 2007 richter et al 1996 the rva measures the alteration in streamflow using the frequency difference of ihas falling within the specified target range of natural pre altered and altered post altered periods mathews and richter 2007 shiau and wu 2007 on the other hand the rva methods do not consider the variation in its variables falling within or outside of the range of pre and post altered periods and sometimes significantly underestimate the degree of alterations shiau and wu 2007 in the current study we have tested the mpds and rgs simulated streamflow using iha to see whether mpds are effective in capturing the seasonality and hydrologic alterations of streamflow the iha analyses are performed during january and august which are characterized by low flow dry season and high flow wet season rates respectively 4 results 4 1 comparison rgs and mpds precipitation inputs in the current study ground based observations of meteorology variables such as temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed are kept constant while precipitation input is changing with datasets i e rgs dcba and dbma the cumulative fraction of daily precipitation inputs from rgs and mpds averaged over potohar catchment during calibration and validation periods 1998 2004 is shown in fig 2 rgs and mpds show different probability of occurrence for the dry day precipitation 0 mm day which are 51 15 46 49 and 43 60 for rgs dcba and dbma respectively dcba has an almost similar distribution to rgs for all precipitation intensities even the dry days with a difference of 4 66 moreover mpds dcba and dbma have very close dry days distribution the smaller difference 2 89 may be attributed to different merging algorithms dcba and dbma have an insignificant difference in cumulative fraction for precipitation events smaller than moderate precipitation fig 2 c the probabilities for the occurrence of tiny precipitation events 2 mm day are 17 47 22 11 and 25 63 for rgs dcba and dbma respectively dbma shows a larger difference as compared to rgs for precipitation ranging between 10 and 50 mm day especially for precipitation from 15 to 30 mm day the difference between rgs and dcba is decreasing with an increase in precipitation intensity 35 mm day average annual precipitation in the study area during the calibration and validation period is 373 95 mm year 405 76 mm year and 449 60 mm year for rgs dcba and dbma respectively fig 3 shows the total monthly precipitation averaged over eight rgs across the potohar plateau from rgs dcba and dbma dcba follows an almost similar trend and precipitation magnitude with an exception at heavy precipitation seasons as compared to rgs however dbma has different trends at some months and high peaks during heavy precipitation seasons may september fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of rgs two mpds and four spds precipitation across the potohar plateau the figure depicts that dcba significantly improved the accuracy of spds to estimate the precipitation dcba has closer precipitation estimates to rgs observations followed by dbma tmpa performed well among the other spds with reasonable precipitation estimates the figure confirms that mpds significantly improves the performance of individual spds and the hydrological utility of mpds should be tested in the data scarce region furthermore the mpds are statistically evaluated across potohar plateau both spatially and temporally using six statistical indices i e mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse unbiased rmse ubrmse correlation coefficient cc kling gupta efficiency score kge score and theil s u dcba has outperformed dbma which is confirmed with lower magnitude of statistical indices values rahman et al 2020b the results of statistical evaluation of dcba by rahman et al 2020b are briefly summarized below mbe depicted that dcba overestimated the precipitation with maximum and minimum mbe values of 0 97 mm day and 0 68 mm day at kalandar and murree stations with average mbe of 0 84 mm day mae rmse are ranging from a minimum of 1 27 mm day at islamabad 6 67 mm day at gujar khan to a maximum of 1 81 mm day at kalandar 9 39 mm day at mangla the average cc and kge score of dcba across potohar plateau is 0 74 and 0 63 respectively theil s u was used to assess the accuracy of mpds the minimum the theil s u values the higher the accuracy the minimum and maximum values of theil s u for dcba are 0 34 at islamabad and 0 43 at kalandar with an average value of 0 38 rahman et al 2020a evaluated the performance of dbma mpd across pakistan the results of potohar plateau are briefly summarized below mbe for dbma shows overestimation which is ranging from a minimum of 0 88 mm day to a maximum of 1 45 mm day at murree and kalandar stations respectively mae ubrmse for dbma are ranging from a minimum of 1 64 mm day at islamabad 8 91 mm day at murree station to a maximum of 2 36 mm day at kalandar 10 16 mm day at mangla station the average cc and kge score for dbma across potohar plateau is 0 65 and 0 55 respectively the maximum and minimum theil s u values are 0 59 poor performance at kalandar and 0 47 relatively better performance at islamabad 4

defined using the t stat and p values the t stat is obtained by dividing the coefficient of parameter by its standard error it represents the accuracy with which a regression coefficient is measured in other words t stat shows the relative significance of each parameter the higher the absolute value the more sensitive the parameter the p values describe how the mean of a sample streamflow in the current scenario is expected to behave the larger the absolute value of t stat and the smaller the p value the more sensitive the parameter abbaspour 2015 the results in table 3 show that cn2 sol awc sol k and ch k2 are the most sensitive parameters for all seven sub catchments 4 3 model calibration with rgs as input and validation with rgs and mpds as input multi site calibration is preferred and has high performance as compared to a single site calibration shrestha et al 2016 therefore multi site calibration is performed using three interior and four outlet stations following lerat et al 2012 and duan et al 2019 the model was first calibrated using precipitation input from rgs at chirah sub catchment 1 after calibration at chirah the same parameters with initial values are used to calibrate the model at sill river sub catchment 2 and dhoke pattan sub catchment 3 stations a similar procedure is followed for haro sub catchment 4 khairabad sub catchment 5 palote sub catchment 6 and dhudnial sub catchment 7 stations for the sake of parity we have used similar ranges fitted calibrated values of rgs of sensitive parameters in each sub catchment during model calibration and validation using dcba and dbma during the calibration process initially we selected four parameters i e cn2 ch k2 sol awc and sol k which are proved to be the most sensitive parameters for streamflow calibration in several studies immerzeel and droogers 2008 shen et al 2008 shrestha et al 2016 as well as the present study table 3 the remaining sensitive parameters listed in table 2 were added in a group of five parameters each after every simulation total of three simulations for parameter selections the final selected parameters were used to calibrate the model at multi sites for sub catchments 1 7 table 4 shows the final calibrated values for selected sensitive parameters across seven sub catchments shown in fig 1 table 5 represents the evaluation of model performance during calibration and validation periods using r2 ns and pbias following the criteria specified by moriasi et al 2007 the rgs based streamflow simulation is classified as very good for both ns and pbias at all seven stations except the sill river station that performs good for ns during the calibration period and very good for pbias at all seven stations and good 4 stations to very good 3 stations for ns during the validation period slightly poor performance is found in the dcba based streamflow simulation which is classified as very good at all 7 stations for pbias in both the calibration and validation periods and good 3 and 6 stations in these two periods respectively to very good 4 and 1 stations for ns however significantly poor performance is found in the dbma based streamflow simulation which is good at all 7 stations for ns and good 4 stations to very good 3 stations for pbias in the calibration period and satisfactory 4 stations to good 3 stations for ns and good 6 stations to very good 1 station for pbias in the validation period as an example fig 5 shows the calibration and validation of daily streamflow at dhoke pattan station the model performance at dhoke pattan station is ranging between good and very good categories with the exception of dbma which shows satisfactory ns and good pbias performance during the validation period rgs underestimated streamflow maximum during may september during calibration while overestimated during the validation period the mpds overestimated streamflow in both calibration and validation periods except dcba which underestimated the peak flows similar results are obtained for sill river station where the results reveal very good performance for rgs both in calibration and validation however good ns and very good pbias performance are observed for dcba and dbma in calibration and validation periods the calibration and validation results at khairabad station table 5 depict that all the input precipitation datasets overestimated the streamflow negative pbias at khairabad station except rgs during the validation period rgs and dcba slightly overestimated the streamflow with pbias in the very good range however dbma has overestimated the streamflow relatively higher with pbias in the range of very good calibration and good validation in terms of ns both rgs and dcba have very good calibration and good validation performances while dbma has good calibration and satisfactory validation performances moreover the rgs and dcba have very good performance in calibration and validation periods at haro station except a good range for ns during validation of dcba table 5 dbma shows good performance in calibration satisfactory ns and good pbias in the validation period rgs slightly underestimated with pbias of 4 11 1 09 dcba slightly overestimated 3 74 6 57 of pbias and dbma moderately overestimated with pbias 10 84 12 51 the streamflow at haro station rgs based simulation is very good dcba depicts good ns and very good pbias and dbma presents good performances at palote station during the calibration period similar results for rgs and dcba are observed during the validation period however dbma shows satisfactory ns and good pbias performances all the input precipitation datasets overestimated the streamflow rgs and dcba underestimated the peak flows during the validation period dbma highly overestimate the streamflow at palote station performances of precipitation input datasets are very good for both rgs and dcba and good for dbma during the calibration and validation periods at dhudnial station rgs underestimated the streamflow positive pbias while mpds overestimated negative pbias the observed streamflow during both calibration and validation periods overall rgs and dcba depicted very good performance based on ns and pbias while the performance of dbma is in the good range 4 4 calibration of swat model using dcba and dbma mpds the hydrological utility of mpds is further assessed using dcba or dbma as input precipitation datasets during model calibration the sensitive parameters and their final calibrated values across seven sub catchments are listed in table 6 the calibration and validation results fig 6 show that the performance of dbma has significantly improved while that of dcba slightly improved as compared with the model calibrated with rgs as precipitation input table 5 the improvements in r2 for dbma based simulations at chirah khairabad dhoke pattan and dhudnial stations are 2 70 5 63 6 85 and 4 during calibration and 3 95 5 88 5 79 and 8 45 during validation periods respectively similarly improvements in ns pbias during calibration period are 10 81 50 72 8 22 62 06 10 39 53 01 and 12 67 83 32 and during validation period 4 35 18 05 15 87 49 83 1 59 45 46 and 7 35 70 53 respectively at these four stations the more significant improvement of dbma is mainly due to the relatively poorer performance of dbma based simulation using the calibrated parameters with rgs precipitation as input besides the results demonstrate significant improvements in pbias only however no significant improvements are observed in terms of ns and r2 table 7 represents the results of evaluation of model performance calibrated and validated with dcba and dbma as precipitation input the ns and pbias results of dcba presented significant improvement of model performance when calibrated with dcba table 7 depicts very good both for ns and pbias performance at chirah sill river dhoke pattan khairabad and dhudnial stations during both calibration and validation periods however dcba presented good ns and very good pbias performances at the remaining stations during validation period overall dcba underestimated positive pbias the streamflow across all the catchments of potohar plateau on the other hand dbma shows good ns and very good pbias for all stations during calibration and validation periods except khairabad and dhudnial stations very good ns and pbias during calibration period dbma overestimated negative pbias the streamflow at most of the stations it can be comprehended from the comparison of the results tables 5 and 7 that the mpds can be used whether the model is calibrated using rgs or mpds as input meanwhile the performance of dcba is better than that of dbma fig 6 and closer to that of rgs table 5 which is similar to the results when the model is calibrated with rgs precipitation as input the results recommend that the dcba can be used as an alternative for rgs in hydrological simulation in the study region to further compare the performances of spds and mpds the swat model is also calibrated with tmpa which is the best performing spd among all four spds fig 4 the results depicted satisfactory performance of tmpa across chirah station with r2 ns and pbias values of 0 68 0 61 and 12 67 during calibration period and 0 70 0 59 and 17 67 during validation period respectively the results confirm the overestimation of precipitation by tmpa across potohar plateau since the calibration and validation results at chirah station depicted the satisfactory results that is significantly poorer than rgs and mpds tmpa is not validated and calibrated at other stations 4 5 indicators of hydrologic alterations ihas ihas nowadays are of significant importance in water resources management ecological studies and other hydrological applications mathews and richter 2007 gao et al 2009 lee et al 2014 the nature conservancy 2007 to quantify the hydrologic alterations in observed and simulated streamflow we have considered the observed flow as a reference streamflow pre alteration period which must be defined at the beginning arthington et al 2006 carlisle et al 2010 the simulated streamflow using rgs dcba and dbma are considered as streamflow in post alteration period pbias is used to quantify the iha impact of rgs dcba dbma compared against the observed streamflow fig 7 iha analyses are performed in two different seasons i e dry season characterized with low flow in january left panel and wet season characterized with high flow in august right panel greater absolute values of pbias show higher alteration in rgs dcba dbma based simulated streamflow as compared with observed streamflow the results show that most pbias are in the range of 50 and 50 dbma shows high alteration as compared with other input precipitation datasets higher alteration is depicted at chirah station fig 7 a and b with the maximum value of more than 200 for dbma followed by dhoke pattan station fig 7 c and d furthermore the fig 7 also shows that the alterations are high during dry seasons as compared to wet seasons the january and august streamflows simulated using rgs dcba dbma are plotted against the observed flow at four stations fig 8 fig 8 shows that streamflow simulated with rgs and dcba generally followed the trend of observed streamflow reasonably well and shows low alteration on the other hand the magnitude of alteration is very high in dbma simulated streamflow as compared with rgs and dcba simulated flow and have similar variation trend the iha analyses confirm that rgs and mpds captures the alterations in streamflow reasonably well 5 discussion hydrological modeling is a challenging task in poorly gauged catchments hydrological modeling requires a dense distribution of gauges stations network that provides reasonable inputs to the models in contrast the distribution of gauges stations is sparse in reality and unable to capture the spatial and temporal variability the scenario is even worse in developing countries like pakistan where the data are either scarce or even not exist moreover hydrological modeling in poorly or ungauged catchments is subjected to a significant amount of uncertainties due to the limited availability of data for calibration and validation processes therefore recently several studies have focused on the evaluation of different precipitation datasets performance in hydrological modeling particularly swat model for simulating streamflow in poorly or ungauged catchments mpds combine the advantages of different individual spds which have a tendency of reducing uncertainties and have higher potential for hydrological application the current study is one of the attempts to demonstrate the potential benefits of mpds in hydrological application as compared to hydrological evaluation of individual spd most of the studies evaluated individual spds and reported good to satisfactory performance in simulating streamflow at daily and monthly temporal scales duan et al 2019 gao et al 2018 the current study shows that the performance of individual spds increased to very good and good when mpds are used as input in swat model very recently several studies have evaluated the open access precipitation datasets for streamflow simulation in poorly or ungauged basins bayissa et al 2017 chen et al 2018 duan et al 2019 gao et al 2018 gebrechorkos et al 2018 kimani et al 2017 tan et al 2018 tan et al 2017 however very few studies are available to develop and evaluate the performance of mpds in the current study we evaluated the performance of two mpds i e dcba and dbma against the rgs using swat to simulate daily streamflow in data scarce potohar plateau pakistan dcba and dbma were developed by merging four different spds trmm 3b42 v7 cmoprh persiann cdr and era interim using clustered bayesian averaging cba and bayesian model averaging bma algorithms with daily temporal and 0 25 spatial resolution rahman et al 2020a b dcba was comprehensively evaluated over the complex topography and diverse climate of pakistan rahman et al 2019b ma et al 2018a developed an mpd using the dbma algorithm at a daily temporal scale and 0 25 spatial resolution for the period of 2007 2012 and comprehensively evaluated over complex topography and high elevation of tibetan plateau the method proposed by ma et al 2018a was adopted to develop dbma for the current study rahman et al 2020a ma et al 2018b evaluated the performance and hydrological utility of the developed mpd named as emspd dbma and mswep v2 using crest coupled routing and excess storage model the analyses demonstrated superior performance of rgs even with its sparse distribution followed by emspd dbma compared to mswep v2 the ns values for rgs emspd dbma and mswep v2 during calibration validation periods are 0 88 0 60 0 82 0 58 and 0 21 0 11 respectively similarly our analyses also showed better performance of rgs in all sub catchments despite its sparse distribution moreover dcba performed well followed similar trend as well as almost similar performance as compared to rgs dbma has also reduced the potential uncertainties and has the capacity to be used in hydrological modeling ma et al 2018b further demonstrated that emspd dbma did not capture the peaks during calibration and validation periods in the headwaters of the yangtze river the current study also shows that the mpds are failed to accurately capture the peak flows especially dcba underestimated illustrating the importance of sensitive parameters during the calibration period given to sparse distribution of rgs and its better performance mpds seems to be reliable in simulating streamflow especially dcba 6 conclusion precipitation and temperature are the key inputs for hydrological simulation and a reasonably dense network of rgs stations is required to provide reliable input data in poorly gauged watershed mostly in developing countries like pakistan the distribution of rgs stations is sparse and does not meet the scientific requirements therefore to overcome the data scarcity issues an alternative option must be investigated that supersede the requirements of rg records this study investigates the performance of merged precipitation datasets mpds and evaluates mpds against conventional rain gauges rgs in simulating daily streamflow using swat in poorly gauged potohar plateau pakistan the current study address two important scientific questions should we use the mpds instead of spds in streamflow simulation and other hydrological applications are mpds accurate enough to supersede the conventional application of rgs based on the comprehensive evaluation of mpds the following conclusions are drawn 1 application of rgs as precipitation input yielded better performance even with sparse distribution in simulating daily streamflow when the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency ns and percent bias pbias are used to evaluate the performances 2 dcba showed higher potential to simulate streamflow which presented almost similar performance as compared to rgs and followed a similar trend in streamflow simulations 3 dbma presented good performance in most of the sub catchments however satisfactory results were obtained at a few stations 4 analyses showed that mpds can supersede the conventional application of rgs and can be used as an alternative input precipitation source in poorly gauged or ungauged catchments 5 rgs and dcba failed to simulate peak flow i e mostly underestimated peak flow during heavy precipitation seasons may september however dbma overestimated peak flows in most of the sub catchments 6 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha analyses confirmed that simulated streamflow with rgs and mpds performed reasonably well to capture the trends and alterations in streamflow rgs and dcba outperformed dbma showing lower magnitude of alteration as compared with observed streamflow and captured the original streamflow trend at all stations in the study area dbma depicted higher alterations at chirah station followed by dhoke pattan station overall the results show that mpds combines the advantages of individual spds and can be effectively used for hydrological simulation in poorly gauged catchments and data scarce regions most of the studies have evaluated the individual spds which resulted from good to satisfactory performances over different regions including china gao et al 2018 ethiopia duan et al 2019 singapore tan et al 2018 and malaysia tan et al 2017 mpds have significantly improved the performances dcba in the current study has presented very good to good performance while dbma depicted good performance satisfactory at a few stations credit authorship contribution statement khalil ur rahman conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

5456,hydrological modeling is a challenging task in poorly gauged catchments especially in developing countries like pakistan open access precipitation and temperature datasets with different spatial and temporal resolutions provide alternative sources in data scarce regions however individual satellite precipitation datasets spds have significant uncertainties motivated by data scarcity issues significant spatial and temporal gaps in in situ observations and poor performance of individual spds in hydrological models this study evaluates the performance of two merged precipitation datasets mpds to simulate daily streamflow using soil and water assessment tool swat in potohar plateau pakistan these two mpds are based on dynamic clustered bayesian averaging dcba and dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma respectively and have 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution precipitation data from rain gauges rgs are also used and results were compared with mpds simulated streamflow multi site calibration and validation are performed at seven stations and the performance of rgs dcba and dbma in streamflow simulation was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency ns and percent bias pbias the results demonstrated that precipitation input from rgs presented better performance very good to good in streamflow simulation even with its sparse distribution the performance of dcba showed better agreement with the results from rgs however dbma presented satisfactory results on occasional bases it is concluded from the current study that mpds combines the advantages of individual spds and have higher potential for hydrological applications significantly reduce the uncertainties of individual spds and can be used as alternatives

introduction hydrological models are indispensable tools to comprehend the hydrological processes in a catchment characterized by spatiotemporal variability and powerful decision making tools for sustainable water resources management practices tuo et al 2016 wellen et al 2015 hydrological models allow users to explain predict and estimate different catchment processes where ground based observations are either scarce not accessible or time consuming and economically inefficient baffaut et al 2015 hydrological models modeling simplify or omit insignificant information in the model structure rather than comprehending all relevant processes to simulate every scenario realistically lambin et al 2003 nguyen et al 2019 therefore hydrological models with different complexity levels have been developed to support different decisions regarding alternative management policies related to efficient water management practices land use and climate change and pollution control rode et al 2010 wellen et al 2015 model structures vary from simple lumped models to complex process based distributed models such as soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 nguyen et al 2019 precipitation and temperature are two important weather variable inputs for hydrological models duan et al 2019 precise estimation and representation of spatial and temporal variability of precipitation and temperature are important for effective simulations and predictions from hydrological models laiti et al 2018 wagner et al 2012 for best simulations a reasonably dense network of stations is required that provide reliable precipitation and temperature inputs to the models and effectively represent the weather at the basin scale however the gauge stations are often sparsely distributed in reality and station based measurements with limited coverage are probably unable to capture the spatial and temporal variability of weather input variables duan et al 2019 the data availability scenario is even worst in developing countries like pakistan and in remote areas where gauge observations are either scarcely available or even not exists the gauge stations are substantially increased over the last few decades in pakistan but their density is still not adequate to meet the scientific and practical requirements rahman et al 2019 on the other hand strict data sharing policy also restricts their free access for public use and inadequate data quality hinders hydrological applications to overcome these problems the data collection process needs significant improvements and or there is a need to explore possible alternative data sources more specifically the application of advanced remote sensing techniques for hydrological applications such as land use and climate change water resources and agricultural water management is needed in pakistan rahman et al 2019 several studies have evaluated the accuracy of open access weather datasets specifically focusing on precipitation data only in hydrological models to simulate streamflow using gauge precipitation data as a reference duan et al 2019 climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr is a common source of weather data precipitation temperature relative humidity etc for the swat community cfsr is an interpolated dataset with a 38 km spatial resolution developed using a climate forecast system with the most available in situ observations and satellite data radcliffe and mukundan 2017 the easy availability of cfsr weather data has attracted many researchers to use the cfsr dataset in hydrological models for example cfsr precipitation data was used in lake tana basin ethiopia to simulate streamflow and satisfactory results have been achieved dile and srinivasan 2014 similar results were reported in four small catchments in the usa and the gumera catchment in ethiopia fuka et al 2014 however unsatisfactory results have been obtained in two upstream catchments of the three gorges reservoir in china yang et al 2014 and two catchments in the usa radcliffe and mukundan 2017 tuo et al 2016 evaluated the performance of chirps climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data as input to the swat model which resulted in satisfactory results in simulating monthly streamflow recently the chirps dataset is evaluated in the upper blue nile basin with four other gridded precipitation datasets and showed high accuracy bayissa et al 2017 duan et al 2019 also reported better performance of chirps as compared to tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and cfsr using swat model to simulate daily and monthly streamflow in the upper gilgel abay basin ethiopia the performance of individual satellite precipitation datasets spds is dependent on many factors including topography climate temporal variability daily monthly seasonal and annually and intensity maggioni et al 2016 however the performance of spds is improving day by day but still individual spds are subjected to significant errors as compared to merged precipitation datasets mpds mpds i e the merging of two or more different spds using relative adaptive or dynamic weights are developed to reduce such kind of non negligible errors in spds ma et al 2018a rahman et al 2018 tang et al 2016 the application of mpds can significantly improve the accuracy of meteorological and hydrological model applications raftery et al 2005 ma et al 2018b evaluated the performance of the mpd developed using the dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma scheme and simulated the discharge in the headwater of the yangtze river using crest coupled routing and excess storage model v2 1 they demonstrated that mpd has higher potential satisfactory to very good nse scores of 0 82 and 0 58 during calibration and validation periods respectively for hydrological modeling at catchment level in remote and complex topographic regions the current study evaluates the performance of two mpds developed using dynamic clustered bayesian averaging dcba and dbma against the rain gauges rgs in streamflow simulations using the swat model which is calibrated and validated at seven sub catchments in potohar plateau pakistan main difficulty in streamflow simulation in the potohar plateau is data scarcity limited precipitation and temperature stations to represent the spatial variability the data scarcity and comparatively lower accuracy of individual spds motivated us to explore the alternative input sources for streamflow simulation this study will answer two important scientific questions should we use the mpds instead of spds to simulate streamflow and other hydrological processes are mpds accurate enough to supersede the conventional application of rgs this study is organized as follows the study area is introduced in section 2 section 3 presents the datasets and methodology section 4 provides detailed results and discussion and section 5 summarizes the conclusions and main findings of the current research 2 study area potohar plateau is situated in north eastern pakistan shown in fig 1 a which is the northern part of punjab province of pakistan the study area borders the western part of azad kashmir and southern part of khyber pakhtunkhwa provinces of pakistan with an area of 22 254 km2 potohar plateau is geographically bounded by jhelum river on the east indus river on the west kala chitta range having haro and soan rivers and famous margalla hills on north and salt ranges on the south elevation of the study area is ranging between 178 and 2255 m above mean sea level a m s l fig 1 b potohar plateau consists of four important districts of jhelum chakwal and rawalpindi as well as the capital islamabad the potohar plateau has a very high undulating topography and erratic precipitation pattern agriculture in the study area is largely dependent on precipitation which averages 380 500 mm annually climate of the plateau is semi arid to sub humid in nature the highest precipitation is recorded in northwest of the study area which declines to an arid condition in the southwest about 80 of precipitation occurs during the monsoon period july to september summer temperature is ranging between 15 c to 40 c while in winter it is 4 c to 25 c fig 1 b shows the location of meteorology stations with measurements of precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity downstream part of the catchment has no precipitation and meteorology stations however upstream stations are enough to simulate streamflow in the catchment the potohar plateau mainly includes seven sub catchments fig 1 c and the distribution of flow gauges used to calibrate and validate the swat model is also shown in fig 1 c streamflow is not simulated in the shaded portion of fig 1 c because there are no flow gauges to record the streamflow at the outlet of the catchment fig 1 d represents the major land use classes i e forest agriculture bare soil and residential area of potohar plateau about 55 of the area is cultivated agricultural area with main crops of wheat barley sorghum legumes melons and tobacco which are grown in fertile areas near the indus river 3 datasets and methodology 3 1 rain gauges rgs meteorology stations and flow gauges data precipitation and meteorology temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed in situ observations data at eight stations fig 1 b for swat were obtained from pakistan meteorology department pmd and water and power development authority wapda however flow records of seven flow gauges fig 1 c are collected from wapda table 1 lists the gauges stations available data and its temporal span after rigorous analyses of obtained in situ data the period 1995 2004 is selected for calibration and validation for which all the data is available during this period all gauges stations have daily precipitation and meteorology data and flow observations with few exceptions since pmd and wapda collect the data manually therefore both organizations follow the world meteorological organization standard code wmo n to evaluate and correct the in situ observations swat model has the capability to fill out missing meteorology data automatically using a weather generator to do so more observed data and further efforts are needed to prepare the input data therefore missing data in precipitation and meteorology observations were filled using the zero order method while the data quality was checked using skewness and kurtosis data quality tests rahman et al 2018 before applying as input to swat model swat model arcswat distributes the gauge station data automatically to the sub catchments using the input data from one gauge station nearest to the centroid of each sub catchment tuo et al 2016 3 2 merged satellite precipitation datasets two merged satellite precipitation datasets mpds one based on dynamic cluster bayesian averaging dcba algorithm rahman et al 2020b and the other based on dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma algorithm rahman et al 2020a are used as alternative precipitation input sources for rain gauges clustered bayesian averaging cba is a relatively new method as compared to traditional bayesian model averaging bma which considers the non regionality of bma using the bayes theorem yu et al 2013 using cba we merged four spds namely tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 v7 climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data record persiann cdr and era interim the spatial and temporal resolutions of the developed mpd are 0 25 and daily scale respectively during 2000 2015 considering the advantages of variation of weights both spatially and temporally dynamic weights the weights are dynamically varied dcba dcba analyses were carried out at pixel by pixel where the coincidence of pixel with each rg is checked with spds both spatially and temporally readers are referred to rahman et al 2020b for a detailed description of dcba methodology the mpd using dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma is developed by following the methodology proposed by ma et al 2018a bma was used to develop an mpd by optimally merging four spds i e trmm tmpa 3b42 v7 cmoprh persiann cdr and era interim at 0 25 spatial and daily temporal scale during 2000 2015 across four climate regions of pakistan rahman et al 2020a the selected four climate regions are glacial humid arid and hyper arid regions the weights of individual spd are optimized on a daily scale ma et al 2018a in the first stage individual spd weights were fitted independently using the expectation maximization em algorithm at each rg and each day em algorithm iterates the optimal parameter in two steps i e e expectation and m maximization until the maximization of the log likelihood function missing data of optimal variable causes the em algorithm to produce an error in maximum log likelihood function mclachlan and krishnan 2007 weights of spds obtained through bma are adjusted at each rg on a daily temporal scale bma weights are applied to the next day merging weights in the second step the next day s weights are calculated based on the previous day s bma weights using a moving averaging scheme forty days training period during each year is selected based on previous literature hamill 2007 ma et al 2018a improving the number of training days improves the accuracy of mpd however no significant improvements are observed beyond 40 days ma et al 2018a therefore the weights for an arbitrary day are dynamically varied using 5 40 days training period forty days before the day under consideration and the same 40 days in each of the previous four years for more details regarding dbma mpd readers are referred to ma et al 2018a and rahman et al 2020a 3 3 flow routing in order to consider the study area as an independent region i e no influence of upstream catchments streamflow is routed from upstream flow gauges if any to the catchment boundary using muskingum cunge mc routing method cunge 1969 flow routing is performed before the application of swat model to get the observed streamflow records without any upstream inflow contribution i e routed streamflow is subtracted from observed flow records at flow gauges inside the study area prior to application of mc the following information are assured franchini et al 2011 upstream section a series of streamflow data q u t recorded over a constant period of time b information about channel cross section a series of values for the wetted area a u t and depth y u t downstream section a series of streamflow data q d t recorded over a constant period of time and related to the same runoff flood events recorded at the upstream gauge b information about channel cross section a series of values for the wetted area a d t and depth y d t besides the reach information between upstream and downstream ends such as length mean slope and mean width are also required mc method considers the distributed lateral inflows as follows franchini and lamberti 1994 o donnell 1985 1 q d t f δ t 1 p t f c 1 q u t f c 2 q d t f 2 where δ t 2 k x 3 c 1 kx 0 5 δ t k k x 0 5 δ t 4 c 2 k k x 0 5 δ t k k x 0 5 δ t where t f

continuous and spatially explicit model arnold et al 1998 swat model is developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture arnold et al 1998 swat is used to simulate hydrological processes such as rainfall runoff evapotranspiration soil erosion and water quality and can be used as a tool to evaluate the impact of land use change on water resources nutrient and sediment transport on the basis of meteorological soil land use land cover data neitsch et al 2011 song et al 2011 tuo et al 2016 swat model divides the entire catchment into sub catchments and then into hrus a unique combination of land use soil type and slope based on digital elevation model dem surface runoff for each hru in the hydrological component of land phase is simulated using daily rainfall by modified soil conservation service scs technique usda 1972 swat also offers the green and ampt infiltration method green and ampt 1911 to simulate surface runoff which requires sub daily precipitation as input in the routing phase simulated streamflow is routed through streams to the outlet of the catchment using either muskingum or variable storage routing rate and velocity of streamflow are defined using manning s equation neitsch et al 2011 land use map soil map including soil properties and elevation data are the basic requirements for swat model for the current study dem 30 m spatial resolution fig 1 b from shuttle radar topographic mission srtm was downloaded from usgs earth explorer https earthexplorer usgs gov catchment delineation and topographic parameters for swat model were obtained from dem year 2000 middle of analysis period was selected to develop the land use map land use map fig 1 d was extracted from the global land cover glc map of year 2000 developed by the european commission downloaded from https forobs jrc ec europa eu products glc2000 products php soil data for swat was obtained from the world soil map developed by food and agriculture organization fao with 1 5 000 000 scale downloaded from http www fao org soils portal soil survey soil maps and databases faounesco soil map of the world en further the soil properties required by swat were prepared using harmonized world soil database v1 2 along with fao soil map and associated information moreover we used the default settings for simulating hydrological

and variable storage routing method for streamflow routing 3 5 swat model calibration and validation using swat cup sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 in swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2015 is used to conduct the parameter optimization to mitigate the effect of initial conditions and to allow stable model performance the first three years 1995 1997 are considered as warm up period tuo et al 2016 the daily streamflow in each catchment seven in total in potohar plateau is calibrated and validated at multi sites during 1998 2000 and 2000 2004 respectively in order to ensure the same temporal span of mpds as rgs the precipitation data of cmorph spd is extrapolated backward using the out of sample forecasting technique in sata 15 and then merged with other spds using dcba and dbma approaches the performance of mpds is then calibrated with rgs observations to make sure that there is no significant deviation from observed data sensitive parameters for model calibration are selected based on previous studies abbaspour et al 2015 arnold et al 2012 bhatta et al 2019 cibin et al 2010 duan et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019 shrestha et al 2016 the sensitive parameters are then verified using global sensitivity analysis in swat cup table 2 shows the hydrological parameters considered in the current study for each sub catchment multi sites the initial parameter ranges are the physically reasonable intervals for each corresponding parameter according to the literature grusson et al 2015 tuo et al 2016 and swat official documentation arnold et al 2012 the model was calibrated using four iterations with 1000 simulation sum up to a total of 4000 simulations during calibration using nash sutcliffe efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 as an objective function recommended by abbaspour 2015 the parameters range was modified narrowed down after each iteration according to both the new parameters suggested by swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 and their reasonable physical ranges a more detailed description of the calibration procedures can be found in abbaspour 2015 and abbaspour et al 2015 several statistical metrics are available to evaluate model performance bennett et al 2013 in the current study we used the ns percent bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 as a goodness of fit between observed and simulated streamflow which are defined as 9 ns 1 i q m i q s i 2 i q m i q m 2 10 pbias 100 i q m i q s i i q m i 11 r 2 i q m i q m q s i q s 2 i q m i q m 2 i q s i q s 2 where qm i and qs i are observed and simulated streamflow while q m and q s are averages of observed and simulated streamflow respectively the ns determines the quantitative difference between the observed data and predictions with the desired value of 1 pbias measures the average tendency of simulated values to overestimate underestimate the corresponding observed data desirable value for pbias is 0 and positive and negative values of pbias indicate overestimation and underestimation respectively model performance is divided into four categories by following the criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 unsatisfactory ns 0 50 pbias 25 satisfactory 0 50 ns 0 65 15 pbias 25 good 0 65 ns 0 75 10 pbias 15 and very good ns 0 75 pbias 10 3 6 performance assessment of mpds in streamflow simulation using indicators of hydrologic alterations iha assessment of hydrologic alterations in streams rivers is important for planning and managing water resources understanding and quantifying the human impact on streamflow and ecology and for sustainable stream s biological health bunn and arthington 2002 lytle and poff 2004 poff and zimmerman 2010 hart and breaker 2019 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha developed by the nature conservancy has been successfully utilized to assess the impact of hydrologic alterations human induced changes on streamflow lee et al 2014 richter et al 1996 as suggested by a reviewer here we used iha to assess the alterations of observed streamflow and simulated streamflow using different precipitation datasets i e rgs dcba and dbma as swat inputs rva range of variability approach approach was initially used to assess alterations in streamflow in terms of magnitude duration frequency timing and the rate of change in streamflow the iha consists of 33 hydrological variables in five groups that characterize the intra and inter annual variations in streamflow mathews and richter 2007 richter et al 1996 the rva measures the alteration in streamflow using the frequency difference of ihas falling within the specified target range of natural pre altered and altered post altered periods mathews and richter 2007 shiau and wu 2007 on the other hand the rva methods do not consider the variation in its variables falling within or outside of the range of pre and post altered periods and sometimes significantly underestimate the degree of alterations shiau and wu 2007 in the current study we have tested the mpds and rgs simulated streamflow using iha to see whether mpds are effective in capturing the seasonality and hydrologic alterations of streamflow the iha analyses are performed during january and august which are characterized by low flow dry season and high flow wet season rates respectively 4 results 4 1 comparison rgs and mpds precipitation inputs in the current study ground based observations of meteorology variables such as temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed are kept constant while precipitation input is changing with datasets i e rgs dcba and dbma the cumulative fraction of daily precipitation inputs from rgs and mpds averaged over potohar catchment during calibration and validation periods 1998 2004 is shown in fig 2 rgs and mpds show different probability of occurrence for the dry day precipitation 0 mm day which are 51 15 46 49 and 43 60 for rgs dcba and dbma respectively dcba has an almost similar distribution to rgs for all precipitation intensities even the dry days with a difference of 4 66 moreover mpds dcba and dbma have very close dry days distribution the smaller difference 2 89 may be attributed to different merging algorithms dcba and dbma have an insignificant difference in cumulative fraction for precipitation events smaller than moderate precipitation fig 2 c the probabilities for the occurrence of tiny precipitation events 2 mm day are 17 47 22 11 and 25 63 for rgs dcba and dbma respectively dbma shows a larger difference as compared to rgs for precipitation ranging between 10 and 50 mm day especially for precipitation from 15 to 30 mm day the difference between rgs and dcba is decreasing with an increase in precipitation intensity 35 mm day average annual precipitation in the study area during the calibration and validation period is 373 95 mm year 405 76 mm year and 449 60 mm year for rgs dcba and dbma respectively fig 3 shows the total monthly precipitation averaged over eight rgs across the potohar plateau from rgs dcba and dbma dcba follows an almost similar trend and precipitation magnitude with an exception at heavy precipitation seasons as compared to rgs however dbma has different trends at some months and high peaks during heavy precipitation seasons may september fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of rgs two mpds and four spds precipitation across the potohar plateau the figure depicts that dcba significantly improved the accuracy of spds to estimate the precipitation dcba has closer precipitation estimates to rgs observations followed by dbma tmpa performed well among the other spds with reasonable precipitation estimates the figure confirms that mpds significantly improves the performance of individual spds and the hydrological utility of mpds should be tested in the data scarce region furthermore the mpds are statistically evaluated across potohar plateau both spatially and temporally using six statistical indices i e mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse unbiased rmse ubrmse correlation coefficient cc kling gupta efficiency score kge score and theil s u dcba has outperformed dbma which is confirmed with lower magnitude of statistical indices values rahman et al 2020b the results of statistical evaluation of dcba by rahman et al 2020b are briefly summarized below mbe depicted that dcba overestimated the precipitation with maximum and minimum mbe values of 0 97 mm day and 0 68 mm day at kalandar and murree stations with average mbe of 0 84 mm day mae rmse are ranging from a minimum of 1 27 mm day at islamabad 6 67 mm day at gujar khan to a maximum of 1 81 mm day at kalandar 9 39 mm day at mangla the average cc and kge score of dcba across potohar plateau is 0 74 and 0 63 respectively theil s u was used to assess the accuracy of mpds the minimum the theil s u values the higher the accuracy the minimum and maximum values of theil s u for dcba are 0 34 at islamabad and 0 43 at kalandar with an average value of 0 38 rahman et al 2020a evaluated the performance of dbma mpd across pakistan the results of potohar plateau are briefly summarized below mbe for dbma shows overestimation which is ranging from a minimum of 0 88 mm day to a maximum of 1 45 mm day at murree and kalandar stations respectively mae ubrmse for dbma are ranging from a minimum of 1 64 mm day at islamabad 8 91 mm day at murree station to a maximum of 2 36 mm day at kalandar 10 16 mm day at mangla station the average cc and kge score for dbma across potohar plateau is 0 65 and 0 55 respectively the maximum and minimum theil s u values are 0 59 poor performance at kalandar and 0 47 relatively better performance at islamabad 4 2 sensitivity analysis table 3 presents the rank t stat and p value of each sensitive parameter obtained through global sensitivity analysis for seven sub catchments the sensitive parameters are defined using the t stat and p values the t stat is obtained by dividing the coefficient of parameter by its standard error it represents the accuracy with which a regression coefficient is measured in other words t stat shows the relative significance of each parameter the higher the absolute value the more sensitive the parameter the p values describe how the mean of a sample streamflow in the current scenario is expected to behave the larger the absolute value of t stat and the smaller the p value the more sensitive the parameter abbaspour 2015 the results in table 3 show that cn2 sol awc sol k and ch k2 are the most sensitive parameters for all seven sub catchments 4 3 model calibration with rgs as input and validation with rgs and mpds as input multi site calibration is preferred and has high performance as compared to a single site calibration shrestha et al 2016 therefore multi site calibration is performed using three interior and four outlet stations following lerat et al 2012 and duan et al 2019 the model was first calibrated using precipitation input from rgs at chirah sub catchment 1 after calibration at chirah the same parameters with initial values are used to calibrate the model at sill river sub catchment 2 and dhoke pattan sub catchment 3 stations a similar procedure is followed for haro sub catchment 4 khairabad sub catchment 5 palote sub catchment 6 and dhudnial sub catchment 7 stations for the sake of parity we have used similar ranges fitted calibrated values of rgs of sensitive parameters in each sub catchment during model calibration and validation using dcba and dbma during the calibration process initially we selected four parameters i e cn2 ch k2 sol awc and sol k which are proved to be the most sensitive parameters for streamflow calibration in several studies immerzeel and droogers 2008 shen et al 2008 shrestha et al 2016 as well as the present study table 3 the remaining sensitive parameters listed in table 2 were added in a group of five parameters each after every simulation total of three simulations for parameter selections the final selected parameters were used to calibrate the model at multi sites for sub catchments 1 7 table 4 shows the final calibrated values for selected sensitive parameters across seven sub catchments shown in fig 1 table 5 represents the evaluation of model performance during calibration and validation periods using r2 ns and pbias following the criteria specified by moriasi et al 2007 the rgs based streamflow simulation is classified as very good for both ns and pbias at all seven stations except the sill river station that performs good for ns during the calibration period and very good for pbias at all seven stations and good 4 stations to very good 3 stations for ns during the validation period slightly poor performance is found in the dcba based streamflow simulation which is classified as very good at all 7 stations for pbias in both the calibration and validation periods and good 3 and 6 stations in these two periods respectively to very good 4 and 1 stations for ns however significantly poor performance is found in the dbma based streamflow simulation which is good at all 7 stations for ns and good 4 stations to very good 3 stations for pbias in the calibration period and satisfactory 4 stations to good 3 stations for ns and good 6 stations to very good 1 station for pbias in the validation period as an example fig 5 shows the calibration and validation of daily streamflow at dhoke pattan station the model performance at dhoke pattan station is ranging between good and very good categories with the exception of dbma which shows satisfactory ns and good pbias performance during the validation period rgs underestimated streamflow maximum during may september during calibration while overestimated during the validation period the mpds overestimated streamflow in both calibration and validation periods except dcba which underestimated the peak flows similar results are obtained for sill river station where the results reveal very good performance for rgs both in calibration and validation however good ns and very good pbias performance are observed for dcba and dbma in calibration and validation periods the calibration and validation results at khairabad station table 5 depict that all the input precipitation datasets overestimated the streamflow negative pbias at khairabad station except rgs during the validation period rgs and dcba slightly overestimated the streamflow with pbias in the very good range however dbma has overestimated the streamflow relatively higher with pbias in the range of very good calibration and good validation in terms of ns both rgs and dcba have very good calibration and good validation performances while dbma has good calibration and satisfactory validation performances moreover the rgs and dcba have very good performance in calibration and validation periods at haro station except a good range for ns during validation of dcba table 5 dbma shows good performance in calibration satisfactory ns and good pbias in the validation period rgs slightly underestimated with pbias of 4 11 1 09 dcba slightly overestimated 3 74 6 57 of pbias and dbma moderately overestimated with pbias 10 84 12 51 the streamflow at haro station rgs based simulation is very good dcba depicts good ns and very good pbias and dbma presents good performances at palote station during the calibration period similar results for rgs and dcba are observed during the validation period however dbma shows satisfactory ns and good pbias performances all the input precipitation datasets overestimated the streamflow rgs and dcba underestimated the peak flows during the validation period dbma highly overestimate the streamflow at palote station performances of precipitation input datasets are very good for both rgs and dcba and good for dbma during the calibration and validation periods at dhudnial station rgs underestimated the streamflow positive pbias while mpds overestimated negative pbias the observed streamflow during both calibration and validation periods overall rgs and dcba depicted very good performance based on ns and pbias while the performance of dbma is in the good range 4 4 calibration of swat model using dcba and dbma mpds the hydrological utility of mpds is further assessed using dcba or dbma as input precipitation datasets during model calibration the sensitive parameters and their final calibrated values across seven sub catchments are listed in table 6 the calibration and validation results fig 6 show that the performance of dbma has significantly improved while that of dcba slightly improved as compared with the model calibrated with rgs as precipitation input table 5 the improvements in r2 for dbma based simulations at chirah khairabad dhoke pattan and dhudnial stations are 2 70 5 63 6 85 and 4 during calibration and 3 95 5 88 5 79 and 8 45 during validation periods respectively similarly improvements in ns pbias during calibration period are 10 81 50 72 8 22 62 06 10 39 53 01 and 12 67 83 32 and during validation period 4 35 18 05 15 87 49 83 1 59 45 46 and 7 35 70 53 respectively at these four stations the more significant improvement of dbma is mainly due to the relatively poorer performance of dbma based simulation using the calibrated parameters with rgs precipitation as input besides the results demonstrate significant improvements in pbias only however no significant improvements are observed in terms of ns and r2 table 7 represents the results of evaluation of model performance calibrated and validated with dcba and dbma as precipitation input the ns and pbias results of dcba presented significant improvement of model performance when calibrated with dcba table 7 depicts very good both for ns and pbias performance at chirah sill river dhoke pattan khairabad and dhudnial stations during both calibration and validation periods however dcba presented good ns and very good pbias performances at the remaining stations during validation period overall dcba underestimated positive pbias the streamflow across all the catchments of potohar plateau on the other hand dbma shows good ns and very good pbias for all stations during calibration and validation periods except khairabad and dhudnial stations very good ns and pbias during calibration period dbma overestimated negative pbias the streamflow at most of the stations it can be comprehended from the comparison of the results tables 5 and 7 that the mpds can be used whether the model is calibrated using rgs or mpds as input meanwhile the performance of dcba is better than that of dbma fig 6 and closer to that of rgs table 5 which is similar to the results when the model is calibrated with rgs precipitation as input the results recommend that the dcba can be used as an alternative for rgs in hydrological simulation in the study region to further compare the performances of spds and mpds the swat model is also calibrated with tmpa which is the best performing spd among all four spds fig 4 the results depicted satisfactory performance of tmpa across chirah station with r2 ns and pbias values of 0 68 0 61 and 12 67 during calibration period and 0 70 0 59 and 17 67 during validation period respectively the results confirm the overestimation of precipitation by tmpa across potohar plateau since the calibration and validation results at chirah station depicted the satisfactory results that is significantly poorer than rgs and mpds tmpa is not validated and calibrated at other stations 4 5 indicators of hydrologic alterations ihas ihas nowadays are of significant importance in water resources management ecological studies and other hydrological applications mathews and richter 2007 gao et al 2009 lee et al 2014 the nature conservancy 2007 to quantify the hydrologic alterations in observed and simulated streamflow we have considered the observed flow as a reference streamflow pre alteration period which must be defined at the beginning arthington et al 2006 carlisle et al 2010 the simulated streamflow using rgs dcba and dbma are considered as streamflow in post alteration period pbias is used to quantify the iha impact of rgs dcba dbma compared against the observed streamflow fig 7 iha analyses are performed in two different seasons i e dry season characterized with low flow in january left panel and wet season characterized with high flow in august right panel greater absolute values of pbias show higher alteration in rgs dcba dbma based simulated streamflow as compared with observed streamflow the results show that most pbias are in the range of 50 and 50 dbma shows high alteration as compared with other input precipitation datasets higher alteration is depicted at chirah station fig 7 a and b with the maximum value of more than 200 for dbma followed by dhoke pattan station fig 7 c and d furthermore the fig 7 also shows that the alterations are high during dry seasons as compared to wet seasons the january and august streamflows simulated using rgs dcba dbma are plotted against the observed flow at four stations fig 8 fig 8 shows that streamflow simulated with rgs and dcba generally followed the trend of observed streamflow reasonably well and shows low alteration on the other hand the magnitude of alteration is very high in dbma simulated streamflow as compared with rgs and dcba simulated flow and have similar variation trend the iha analyses confirm that rgs and mpds captures the alterations in streamflow reasonably well 5 discussion hydrological modeling is a challenging task in poorly gauged catchments hydrological modeling requires a dense distribution of gauges stations network that provides reasonable inputs to the models in contrast the distribution of gauges stations is sparse in reality and unable to capture the spatial and temporal variability the scenario is even worse in developing countries like pakistan where the data are either scarce or even not exist moreover hydrological modeling in poorly or ungauged catchments is subjected to a significant amount of uncertainties due to the limited availability of data for calibration and validation processes therefore recently several studies have focused on the evaluation of different precipitation datasets performance in hydrological modeling particularly swat model for simulating streamflow in poorly or ungauged catchments mpds combine the advantages of different individual spds which have a tendency of reducing uncertainties and have higher potential for hydrological application the current study is one of the attempts to demonstrate the potential benefits of mpds in hydrological application as compared to hydrological evaluation of individual spd most of the studies evaluated individual spds and reported good to satisfactory performance in simulating streamflow at daily and monthly temporal scales duan et al 2019 gao et al 2018 the current study shows that the performance of individual spds increased to very good and good when mpds are used as input in swat model very recently several studies have evaluated the open access precipitation datasets for streamflow simulation in poorly or ungauged basins bayissa et al 2017 chen et al 2018 duan et al 2019 gao et al 2018 gebrechorkos et al 2018 kimani et al 2017 tan et al 2018 tan et al 2017 however very few studies are available to develop and evaluate the performance of mpds in the current study we evaluated the performance of two mpds i e dcba and dbma against the rgs using swat to simulate daily streamflow in data scarce potohar plateau pakistan dcba and dbma were developed by merging four different spds trmm 3b42 v7 cmoprh persiann cdr and era interim using clustered bayesian averaging cba and bayesian model averaging bma algorithms with daily temporal and 0 25 spatial resolution rahman et al 2020a b dcba was comprehensively evaluated over the complex topography and diverse climate of pakistan rahman et al 2019b ma et al 2018a developed an mpd using the dbma algorithm at a daily temporal scale and 0 25 spatial resolution for the period of 2007 2012 and comprehensively evaluated over complex topography and high elevation of tibetan plateau the method proposed by ma et al 2018a was adopted to develop dbma for the current study rahman et al 2020a ma et al 2018b evaluated the performance and hydrological utility of the developed mpd named as emspd dbma and mswep v2 using crest coupled routing and excess storage model the analyses demonstrated superior performance of rgs even with its sparse distribution followed by emspd dbma compared to mswep v2 the ns values for rgs emspd dbma and mswep v2 during calibration validation periods are 0 88 0 60 0 82 0 58 and 0 21 0 11 respectively similarly our analyses also showed better performance of rgs in all sub catchments despite its sparse distribution moreover dcba performed well followed similar trend as well as almost similar performance as compared to rgs dbma has also reduced the potential uncertainties and has the capacity to be used in hydrological modeling ma et al 2018b further demonstrated that emspd dbma did not capture the peaks during calibration and validation periods in the headwaters of the yangtze river the current study also shows that the mpds are failed to accurately capture the peak flows especially dcba underestimated illustrating the importance of sensitive parameters during the calibration period given to sparse distribution of rgs and its better performance mpds seems to be reliable in simulating streamflow especially dcba 6 conclusion precipitation and temperature are the key inputs for hydrological simulation and a reasonably dense network of rgs stations is required to provide reliable input data in poorly gauged watershed mostly in developing countries like pakistan the distribution of rgs stations is sparse and does not meet the scientific requirements therefore to overcome the data scarcity issues an alternative option must be investigated that supersede the requirements of rg records this study investigates the performance of merged precipitation datasets mpds and evaluates mpds against conventional rain gauges rgs in simulating daily streamflow using swat in poorly gauged potohar plateau pakistan the current study address two important scientific questions should we use the mpds instead of spds in streamflow simulation and other hydrological applications are mpds accurate enough to supersede the conventional application of rgs based on the comprehensive evaluation of mpds the following conclusions are drawn 1 application of rgs as precipitation input yielded better performance even with sparse distribution in simulating daily streamflow when the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency ns and percent bias pbias are used to evaluate the performances 2 dcba showed higher potential to simulate streamflow which presented almost similar performance as compared to rgs and followed a similar trend in streamflow simulations 3 dbma presented good performance in most of the sub catchments however satisfactory results were obtained at a few stations 4 analyses showed that mpds can supersede the conventional application of rgs and can be used as an alternative input precipitation source in poorly gauged or ungauged catchments 5 rgs and dcba failed to simulate peak flow i e mostly underestimated peak flow during heavy precipitation seasons may september however dbma overestimated peak flows in most of the sub catchments 6 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha analyses confirmed that simulated streamflow with rgs and mpds performed reasonably well to capture the trends and alterations in streamflow rgs and dcba outperformed dbma showing lower magnitude of alteration as compared with observed streamflow and captured the original streamflow trend at all stations in the study area dbma depicted higher alterations at chirah station followed by dhoke pattan station overall the results show that mpds combines the advantages of individual spds and can be effectively used for hydrological simulation in poorly gauged catchments and data scarce regions most of the studies have evaluated the individual spds which resulted from good to satisfactory performances over different regions including china gao et al 2018 ethiopia duan et al 2019 singapore tan et al 2018 and malaysia tan et al 2017 mpds have significantly improved the performances dcba in the current study has presented very good to good performance while dbma depicted good performance satisfactory at a few stations credit authorship contribution statement khalil ur rahman conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation

5457,hydrology is a critical environmental condition for the evolution of wetland ecosystems the effects of hydrological changes on wetland cover are of great importance for preserving its ecological functions in this study the hydrological influences on wetland cover distribution and transition in a large complex lake floodplain system poyang lake china were investigated utilizing time series satellite remote sensing observations wetland cover types in poyang lake during 2000 2009 including water mudflat and the major vegetation communities were extracted and related to the wetland hydrological characteristics calculated by the hydrodynamic simulations the statistical results of annual inundation conditions for different wetland cover types indicated that vegetation communities were preferential to hydrological environments with shorter annual inundation than water and mudflats and different vegetation communities were distributed in areas with considerable variations in annual inundation which suggested a substantial hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover in poyang lake furthermore this study investigated the impact of hydrological changes on the wetland cover transitions between typical dry and wet years the results showed that hydrological fluctuations had various degrees of influences on different types of wetland cover transformation the spatial analysis indicated that hydrological changes were probably the dominant factor for the wetland cover evolution in the floodplain areas of the northern and central parts of poyang lake but not the unique determined factor for wetland cover transitions in the shallow floodplains near the sink of the inflows in the eastern and southwestern parts of poyang lake this study provides a practical reference for the effects of hydrological regulation in the protection and restoration of poyang lake wetland keywords poyang lake wetland hydrology wetland cover time series remote sensing hydrodynamic model 1 introduction wetlands are the transition areas between terrestrial and aquatic areas and usually provide significant economic and ecological functions such as in water purification flood reduction streamflow maintenance fish production and as a habitat for wild species mitsch and gosselink 2000 maltby et al 2011 wu et al 2011 the wetland cover substantially determines the structure and function of the wetland ecosystem ge et al 2009 dronoval et al 2012 wu et al 2014 however the wetland cover is sensitive to intensive human activities and natural processes such as climate change dramatic changes in the wetland cover types have been reported by a large number of researchers johnson et al 2005 gong et al 2010 chen et al 2014 spencer et al 2016 therefore the land cover distribution and transition are globally recognized issues in wetland protection wetland hydrology is one of the most important environmental element for the ecosystem the hydrological processes in the wetland play a critical role in the formation of land cover such as mudflats marshland and vegetation for example an appropriate amount of water can provide necessary conditions for vegetation growth while excess water or a lack of water can inhibit vegetation growth in the wetland zhao and running 2010 choo et al 2014 moreover as water demand varies from species to species changes in hydrological conditions may alter the dominance of species craine and dybzinski 2013 therefore the hydrological characteristics such as water level water depth and inundation character have been regarded as critical factors for wetland cover riis and hawes 2002 todd et al 2010 poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china with a complex lake floodplain system the significant hydrological fluctuations in poyang lake have led to the development of its internationally renowned wetland system the poyang lake wetland benefits the regional economy by providing a large amount of industrial materials more importantly the wetland serves as an indispensable habitat for a numerous species including hundreds of thousands of migratory birds wang et al 2013 cai et al 2017 unfortunately the wetland cover of poyang lake has experienced significant changes in recent years feng et al 2016 han et al 2015 2018 hu et al 2015 lei et al 2011 wu et al 2017 which seriously threatens the ecological functions of the wetland meanwhile the hydrology in poyang lake has varied dramatically due to climate changes and human activities feng et al 2012a b gao et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 studies have shown that poyang lake experienced a drier hydrological condition in the 2000s compared with the previous decades the influences of the impendence of the three gorges dam on the yangtze river climate changes in the catchment and other impact factors on the lake s hydrology have been frequently discussed and linked with the wetland cover changes in poyang lake xie et al 2015 feng et al 2016 han et al 2018 the potential hydrological influences on the wetland cover in poyang lake have been recognized by scholars governments and the public a series of measures were put forward to protect the poyang lake wetland by mitigating hydrological changes and restoring the hydrological conditions in the lake zhang et al 2012a b feng et al 2016 han et al 2018 for example the poyang lake water conservancy project was proposed to preserve water storage during the dry season lai et al 2015 wang et al 2015 qi et al 2016 however some researchers claimed that the proposed dam project may do harm to the wetland environment jiao 2009 it is still challenging to assess the effects of these measures on wetland protection and restoration therefore addressing the hydrological influence on the distribution and transition of wetland cover is of great practical significance in lake management a number of studies have discussed the effects of hydrology on the wetland cover in poyang lake however most previous studies did not fully consider the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in wetland hydrology and cover as they were performed on a relatively narrow spatial scale or a short time period hu et al 2010 zhang et al 2012a b tan et al 2016 owing to the significant annual and inter annual dynamics in hydrology and wetland cover in poyang lake studies with different datasets may result in different results moreover differences in the hydrological influences on various vegetation communities were not fully investigated in these studies for example some studies analyzed the influences of the lake s hydrology on the vegetation area or the distribution of some vegetation types dai et al 2016 han et al 2015 hu et al 2010 liu et al 2016 tan et al 2016 tan and jiang 2016 even though some studies have investigated the relationship between the lake s hydrology and the distribution of wetland cover the hydrological influences on the distribution of wetland cover were not well explained han et al 2018 furthermore few studies investigated the relationship between the changes in wetland hydrology and cover type therefore the effects of hydrological changes on wetland cover transitions remain largely unknown in this study time series of remote sensing and hydrodynamic simulation were used to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of the lake s hydrology and wetland cover during 2000 2009 to our knowledge the time series of remote sensing can capture the land cover conditions rapidly and periodically thus this method is able to provide detailed information of wetland cover on a relatively large scale moreover hydrodynamic simulation can provide an accurate hydrological regime to identify the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in hydrological conditions on the basis of the long term distribution of the hydrological regime and wetland cover the appropriate hydrological conditions for the major cover types in poyang lake wetland were explored furthermore the influences of hydrological changes on different wetland transitions and their spatial distribution were investigated this study aimed to identify the hydrological conditions for the distribution of different wetland cover types and reveal the influences of hydrological changes on different wetland cover transitions thereby providing a scientific reference for wetland protection and restoration 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data poyang lake 29 0 n 116 5 e lies at the junction of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river poyang lake has a drainage basin of approximate 16 2 104 km2 and receives water from the main five rivers xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe in the catchment as shown in fig 1 the lake naturally connects to the yangtze river though the outlet in the north poyang lake has a complex topography with wide shallow floodplains separated and interleaved by narrow deep channels min 2000 feng et al 2011 the lake bottom elevation decreases significantly from the south to the north influenced by the subtropical humid monsoon climate in the catchment and lake river interactions poyang lake usually experiences low water water rising high water and water receding periods within a year yao et al 2018 during the high water period the lake has a wide and calm water surface reaching more than 3000 km2 while during the low water period water flow is confined in the channel water surface can shrink to less than 1000 km2 and the difference in water level can reach more than 5 m from south to north generally spatial variations in lake topography and seasonal variations in climate conditions in the catchment induce significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the lake s hydrology the special hydrological fluctuations in poyang lake forms its unique wetland it serves as the habitat for many species for example it provides habitat for many rare migratory birds from siberia in winter poyang lake is recognized one of the most important wetlands due to its ecological functions during the water receding period water usually flows from the floodplain area to the channel and the majority of the lake s bottom is finally exposed the inundation gradually transfers to vegetation growth in contrast during the water rising period the vegetation is gradually covered by water and transfers to inundation again the wetland cover of poyang lake is substantially related to the hydrological fluctuations three data sets were collected for this study including gauge observations bottom elevation measurements and satellite remote sensing data daily hydrological observations in the catchment during 2000 2009 were collected from the department of water resources of jiangxi province the daily discharge of lake inflow and outflow were collected from eight gauging stations hukou qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng as shown in fig 1 lake water level from the five hydrological stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan as shown in fig 1 were collected the lake bottom topography data of 1998 and 2010 were acquired by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources and processed by the department of natural resources of jiangxi province the bathymetry of the lake during the 2000s were obtained by interpolation satellite remote sensing products were collected to obtain the cover state in poyang lake a landsat image acquired on july 8 1998 during the flooding period of poyang lake was obtained from the united states geological survey the modis level 3 8 day surface reflectance products during 2000 2009 were collected from the united states nasa goddard space flight center 2 2 hydrodynamic model to obtain the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the water regime in poyang lake a numerical model was implemented based on the delft3d flow model which has been widely applied in simulations of flows sediment transports and water quality of shallow waters delft hydraulics 2014 as a shallow and wide lake vertical currents in poyang lake can be neglected lai et al 2011 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a b yao et al 2018 thus a 2d free surface hydrodynamic model was constructed delft3d flow calculated the depth averaged shallow water equations derived from the 3d navier stokes equations on a staggered grid and solved them by an implicit finite difference method the numeric grid covered the maximum flooding area extracted by the landsat image disconnected segments separated by islands and artificial structures were removed rectangular grids with a resolution of 300 m were then generated to reflect the large seasonal variability in the water boundary of poyang lake a drying and flooding algorithm was used delft hydraulics 2014 bathymetry data were processed and interpolated into the grid points the model runtime extended from january 1 2000 to december 31 2009 and the computation interval step was set as 1 min to meet the courant friedrichs lewy condition for model stability and accuracy the upper open boundary conditions of the model were specified as the daily inflow discharges of poyang lake in addition to the observed gauged runoff of the five main rivers in the catchment the unknown water balance component including ungauged runoff groundwater inflow direct precipitation and evaporation zhang et al 2014 2017 lu et al 2018 were estimated and converted to inflow discharges through a model proposed by zhang et al 2014 the lower open boundary conditions were prescribed as the daily observed water levels at hukou initial conditions were obtained by interpolating the observed water levels at gauge stations the model parameters were initially defined based on literature values delft hydraulics 2014 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a qi et al 2016 li et al 2016 yao et al 2018 liang et al 2019 lu et al 2019 the critical parameters were calibrated and validated by comparing the simulation values and measurements according to our experience the manning s roughness coefficients spatially varied from 0 02 s m1 3 for the channel to 0 03 s m1 3 for the floodplain area the horizontal eddy viscosity was set as 1 m2 s and the threshold depth for the drying and flooding algorithm was set as 0 10 m in this study statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percentage bias pbias and root mean square error rsme were calculated to evaluate the model performance moriasi et al 2007 2 3 wetland cover classification the wetland of poyang lake consists of water mudflats and several kinds of vegetation the five major vegetation communities in poyang lake include a floating aquatic macrophytes community fam spare grass community sg carex spp community cs triarrhena lutarioriparia l and phragmites community tp and zizania latifolia community zi hu et al 2010 han et al 2018 these different cover types are generally distributed from the lake center to the shore and the vegetation communities occur in different periods time series remote sensing observations have the ability to recognize different vegetation communities and provides detailed wetland cover information the detailed composition and phenological characteristics of the vegetation community are summarized in table 1 in this study the wetland coverage in poyang lake during 2000 2009 was extracted through a decision tree classification method based on the phenological and spectral characteristics put forward by han et al 2018 the 8 day modis reflectance products were pre processed and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi time series were generated according to eq 1 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir and r are the reflectance of the near infrared band and red band in the modis product respectively as most of the fam is distributed in the disconnected segments of poyang lake the wetland coverage was classified into water mudflat and four major vegetation communities sg cs tp zi in this study the ndvi time series of each pixel were used to classify the different wetland cover types the ndvi values for water were negative throughout the whole year the ndvi values for the mudflat and sg community were generally negative in the wet season and positive in the dry season and sg showed higher values in the dry season the zi community has only one peak in the ndvi time series in each year while cs and tp community has two peaks in the ndvi time series in each year moreover the second peak of ndvi time series in each year for tp occurred earlier than cs and the values of the ndvi were usually higher for tp combining the ndvi fluctuations and the phenology of different communities we can distinguish the wetland cover type in poyang lake well han et al 2018 3 results 3 1 performance of hydrodynamic model the performance of the hydrodynamic model was evaluated by the time series 2000 2009 comparison of simulated and observed values in poyang lake including daily water levels at xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan and outflow discharge at hukou as shown in fig 2 a visual inspection of the time series amplitude and phase of the simulations and measurements suggested that the model generally showed good accuracy the statistical results showed that the r 2 and nse values of the water levels were all higher than 0 972 and 0 969 respectively the pbias values of the water levels varied from 0 42 to 1 08 which indicated that there was no significant overestimation or underestimation in the model the rmse values of the water levels varied from 0 105 m to 0 366 m the match of the outflow discharges was relatively poorer than that of the water levels nevertheless the r 2 and nse of discharge were as high as 0 928 and 0 913 respectively the pbias was 2 87 and the rmse was 874 3 m3 s generally the hydrodynamic model used in this study was capable of capturing the rapid seasonal changes as well as the significant spatial variations in the hydrological regime of poyang lake wetland 3 2 wetland inundation character and change analysis the annual inundation processes during 2000 2009 were simulated by the established hydrodynamic model if the computation grid was wet on a certain day then the grid was inundated on that day the annual inundation days of each grid were extracted through the simulation results fig 3 shows the annual inundation days of the poyang lake wetland during 2000 2009 the results indicated a significant spatiotemporal difference in the inundation character of the poyang lake wetland generally the inundation days of the wetland increased from the floodplain to the deep channel and the wetlands were inundated longer in the wet years than in the dry years the annual inundation days of the channel area and deep basin in the central and eastern parts of the lake were the largest reaching more than 360 days these areas were usually covered by water throughout the year the annual inundation days of floodplain areas near to the channel and the deep lake basin were 240 330 days owing to the significant differences in hydrological condition the inundation character of these areas varied greatly from more than 360 days in wet years to less than 120 days in the dry years the annual inundation days of the shallow areas in the southwestern part of poyang lake were the smallest which usually ranged from 60 days to 180 days in some dry years the annual inundation days of these areas could decrease to less than 30 days the significant heterogeneity in wetland inundation character provided different hydrological conditions for vegetation growth which may have further affected the wetland cover type a trend analysis was conducted on the annual inundation character of the poyang lake wetland during 2000 2009 a linear regression and t test were performed on each computation grid to detect the changing trend fig 4 shows the distribution of the trend of inundation in poyang lake wetland for areas covered by water throughout the year such as the channel the deep basin in the central and eastern lake and segments at the south end of the lake the annual inundation days showed no significant trend for the floodplain areas near to the channel and the deep lake basin the annual inundation days showed a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 the annual inundation days of the shallow floodplain areas decreased by 1 15 days year in the northern lake 7 30 days year in the central lake and could reach more than 30 days year in the southwest part of the lake for the channel edge areas the annual inundation days increased by 1 7 days year because of the erosion processes for the inflow river sink areas of poyang lake the sedimentation processes caused complicated terrain changes such as erosion uplift and partitions which resulted in a spatially fractured change trend in these areas 3 3 wetland cover type and change analysis the wetland cover of poyang lake during 2000 2009 was detected by the time series remote sensing data fig 5 shows the spatiotemporal distribution of different wetland cover types including water mudflats and the major four vegetation communities sg cs tp and zi permanent water areas were mainly distributed in the channel and deep basin in the central and eastern parts of the lake and the mudflat areas were distributed next to the permanent water areas the vegetation communities were distributed on the shallow floodplains among them sg and cs were distributed closer to the mudflat and permanent water areas while tp and zi were distributed closer to the lake shore a visual inspection of the wetland cover type indicated significant inter annual variabilities during 2000 2009 the area of each cover type during this period showed a significant decrease in water and mudflat while a significant increase was exhibited in vegetation as shown in fig 6 the areas of permanent water and mudflats in poyang lake wetland decreased by 63 9 km2 year and 26 6 km2 year respectively in contrast the vegetation coverage increased by 87 1 km2 year generally a decrease of the permanent water and mudflats and increase of vegetation were observed in the central and eastern parts of the lake among the four major vegetation communities in poyang lake sg cs and zi increased significantly with a trend of 40 0 km2 year 38 0 km2 year and 6 0 km2 year respectively the coverage of tp also showed an increasing but not significant trend of 3 1 km2 year 3 4 hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover in order to explore the hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover the relationship between the inundation character and wetland cover type was investigated a statistical analysis of each type of wetland cover area and the lake s averaged inundation character was conducted moreover the distribution of inundation condition for each type of wetland coverage was analyzed and the occurrence probabilities of different cover types under certain inundation conditions were calculated fig 7 shows the relationship between the mean inundation days of poyang lake and the coverage areas of water mudflat and vegetation including sg cs tp and zi the statistical results indicated that the coverage areas of water and mudflats in poyang lake wetland showed significant increasing trends of 12 9 km2 day and 5 2 km2 day with the average inundation days while the coverage areas of vegetation showed a decreasing trend of 17 5 km2 day with the average inundation days of poyang lake among the four vegetation communities coverage areas of sg and cs decreased significantly with the increase of average inundation days of the lake by 7 3 km2 day and 9 7 km2 day respectively in contrast the coverage areas of tp and zi also varied with the variation of average inundation days of the lake but they were less influenced the annual inundation conditions for different wetland cover types during 2000 2009 were further explored to reveal the hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover in poyang lake histogram analysis for the inundation days of water mudflat sg cs tp and zi covered areas during this period were performed for each wetland cover type in poyang lake the optimal inundation conditions accounting for the largest portion in the histogram and the suitable inundation conditions accounting for more than 10 in the histogram were obtained as shown in fig 8 the statistical results indicate a significant difference in the optimal inundation conditions of different wetland cover types a significant decrease was found in the optimal inundation days for water mudflat and vegetation covered areas among the four major vegetation communities the optimal inundation days for sg cs tp and zi decreased significantly in turn the suitable inundation days of different wetland cover types also showed a similar decreasing trend however in contrast to the optimal inundation conditions for different wetland cover overlaps in the suitable inundation conditions for different wetland cover types may exist for example the suitable inundation conditions for mudflat and sg both amounted to 180 210 days and the suitable inundation conditions for sg and cs both amounted to 150 180 days the statistical analysis of the inundation conditions for different wetland cover type suggested that the hydrological character had a significant impact on the distribution of wetland coverage in addition the occurrence probabilities of each wetland cover type in poyang lake under different inundation conditions were calculated to further analyze the hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover as shown in fig 9 generally the occurrence probabilities of all wetland cover types changed significantly with annual inundation days for areas with more than 45 weeks of annual inundation the occurrence probability of permanent water was the highest for areas with 31 45 weeks of annual inundation the occurrence probability of mudflats was the highest furthermore for areas with less than 31 weeks of annual inundation the occurrence probability of vegetation was the highest moreover for areas with less than 9 weeks of annual inundation tp was the dominant vegetation community and for areas with 10 31 weeks of annual inundation cs was the dominant vegetation community the occurrence probabilities of zi were all less than 10 under different inundation conditions as it accounted for a small portion of wetland cover in poyang lake during 2000 2009 the occurrence probability of sg reached its maximum 28 with 27 weeks of annual inundation however it was still smaller than cs this result indicated that although the hydrological character was significant but it did not show a uniquely determined impact on the distribution of wetland cover in poyang lake 3 5 relationship between hydrological changes and wetland cover transitions to reveal the role of hydrological changes in wetland cover evolution in poyang lake the relationship between changes in inundation character and cover type was analyzed a typical wet year 2002 and a dry year 2006 during 2000 2009 were selected changes in wetland coverage in the two years were extracted and the transitions among different cover types were calculated differences in inundation conditions between the two years were obtained from the hydrodynamic simulation the influences of hydrological changes on the wetland cover transitions were investigated fig 10 shows significant variabilities in wetland cover types between 2002 and 2006 as a large extent of the lake s bottom was exposed in the dry year a considerable permanent water area transferred to the mudflat or vegetation and a large portion of the mudflat area transferred to vegetation these transitions mainly occurred in the shallow floodplain areas near to the channel and deep basin in the northern and central parts of the lake moreover wetland cover transitions among different vegetation communities were found in the floodplain areas near the lake shore the quantitative assessment of wetland cover transitions between 2002 and 2006 were summarized in table 2 areas of permanent water and mudflat in 2006 decreased by 524 9 km2 and 229 4 km2 respectively for the four major vegetation communities in poyang lake the coverage area of sg increased most by 477 6 km2 followed by tp 239 0 km2 while increases in cs and zi were much smaller at 35 3 km2 and 2 4 km2 moreover the results indicate considerable transitions among different communities for example the coverage area of sg in 2006 reached 588 5 km2 among which more than 90 transferred from water and mudflat and about 68 and 17 sg in 2002 transferred to cs and tp in 2006 respectively fig 11 shows the differences in annual inundation days between 2002 and 2006 in poyang lake wetland on average the annual inundation decreased by 50 5 days in 2006 for the deep basin in the central and eastern parts of the lake and the channel there was little difference in annual inundation between the two years for the floodplain areas near the channel and deep basin in the central and southeastern parts of the lake annual inundation decreased by 90 150 days furthermore for the shallow floodplain areas in the northern and southwestern parts of the lake annual inundation decreased by 30 90 days influenced by the terrain variations in the lake the annual inundation increased in a few parts of the lake such as in some channel edge areas the consistency of changes in inundation conditions and wetland cover transitions were analyzed if the inundation days of a certain area both fell within the range of the suitable inundation conditions for its cover types in 2002 and 2006 and the inundation days of this area changed significantly 15 days it was regarded that changes in inundation conditions and wetland cover transition in this area were consistent fig 12 shows the percentage of consistent changes in inundation conditions and wetland cover for the major wetland cover transitions between 2002 and 2006 the percentages of different wetland cover transitions consistent with hydrological character varied significantly ranging from 54 5 to 91 2 for wetland cover changes from permanent water to mudflat and changes from mudflat to sg the percentages were larger than 90 which indicated a strong influence of hydrological changes on these types of wetland coverage transition whereas the percentage of consistency for the wetland cover change from sg to tp was only 54 5 which indicated a relatively weak hydrological influence on this wetland cover transition in general the results suggest that hydrological changes have varying effects on different wetland cover transitions fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of the consistent changes in inundation condition and wetland cover between 2002 and 2006 in poyang lake the results indicated that in the floodplain areas of the northern and central parts of the lake wetland cover transitions were well consistent with hydrological changes thereby the evolution of wetland cover may be dominated by the hydrological processes in these areas in contrast for the shallow floodplain near the lake shore in the eastern and southwestern parts of the lake wetland cover transitions were poorly consistent with hydrological changes thus hydrological variation was probably not the only determinant cause for the evolution of wetland cover in these areas spatially these areas were distributed around the sink of the inflow rivers therefore they were more susceptible to sediment and nutrient transport from the catchment 4 discussions 4 1 hydrological changes in poyang lake and dominant causes changes in the hydrology of rivers and lakes are highly associated with water supply for human life industry and ecosystems the hydrological regime of poyang lake plays an important role in local social and economic development as well as the wetland evolution a large number of studies have analyzed the hydrological regime changes in poyang lake it has been well recognized that poyang lake experienced a drier condition in the 2000s min and zhan 2012 liu et al 2013 ye et al 2013 gao et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the long term examination and trend testing of the observed lake water levels min and zhan 2012 zhang et al 2014 indicated that the lake s water levels were generally lower during the 2000s a shrink of the water surface in poyang lake was also observed by satellite remote sensing feng et al 2012 owing to the complicated meteorological and hydrological conditions as well as the complex terrain hydrological fluctuations in poyang lake are influenced by multiple factors on one hand the lake s hydrology is essentially related to the inflow runoff from the catchment feng et al 2012 guo et al 2008 yao et al 2016 station observations and satellite monitoring showed a decreasing trend of precipitation in the catchment which resulted in smaller inflow volume on the other hand the water regime in the poyang lake is strongly influenced by the yangtze river hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 cai et al 2017 a number of researchers considered the blocking effects of the yangtze river before and after the construction of the three gorges dam zhang et al 2012a b guo et al 2012 they claimed that the weaker blocking effects of the yangtze river have led to larger outflow discharges and lower water levels in poyang lake especially during september october in addition several studies lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 liang et al 2019 revealed that changes in the lake s bottom terrain had a significant impact on the hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in poyang lake the outcomes of this study demonstrated that the lake hydrology had a substantial impact on the wetland cover distribution and transition in poyang lake thereby elucidating the dominant causes of the hydrological variations in poyang lake can assist in efficient and appropriate lake management however owing to significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in natural conditions and anthropogenic influences on the lake hydrology more detailed knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of the driving forces behind the changes in hydrological processes is needed 4 2 wetland protection and restoration in poyang lake the poyang lake wetland is highly valued for its ecological functions changes in wetland cover type in poyang lake have caused a loss of habitat for some cherished species thus wetland protection and restoration in poyang lake have been a great concern of local governments since wetland cover is closely related to hydrological changes in the lake the local governments have developed several policies to protect the lake against more severe hydrological regimes the government issued sand mining bans in 2006 and 2008 in order to alleviate the significant decreases in water level during the dry season caused by the lake s terrain changes moreover the government proposed the plan of the poyang lake water conservancy project to regulate the hydrological processes of the lake it was suggested to construct a dam across the narrowest section of the outflow channel in the north of the lake the proposed dam aims to conserve the water storage of the lake during the dry season protecting and restoring the wetland environment this study explores the hydrological conditions for different types of wetland cover distribution and further reveals the role of hydrological changes in wetland cover transitions in poyang lake which can support the policy making decisions for wetland protection and restoration it is noteworthy that the hydrological regime is not the only determinant factor for the distribution and transition of wetland cover in poyang lake even as regards the hydrologically dominant wetland cover distribution and transformation the driving forces for the water regime may not be exactly the same therefore the effects of a certain measure on wetland cover need further study the protection and restoration of different types of wetland cover in different places in the poyang lake wetland may require different measures 5 conclusions this study combined time series remote sensing and hydrological simulation to reveal the hydrological impact on the distribution and transition of the wetland cover in a complex lake floodplain system poyang lake china the spatiotemporal distribution of wetland cover type in poyang lake including water mudflats and the major vegetation communities cs sg tp and zi during 2000 2009 were detected and linked with the lake s hydrological characteristics the results showed that hydrology had a substantial impact on the wetland cover in poyang lake generally the inundation condition of each cover type varied significantly a decreasing trend in annual inundation from water mudflats to the vegetation communities was observed and a decreasing trend in the favorable annual inundation days of sg cs tp and zi was found among the major vegetation communities in the poyang lake wetland furthermore hydrological changes showed various degrees of impacts on different types of wetland cover transitions in poyang lake spatially changes in the hydrological regime exert a strong influence on wetland cover transitions in the floodplain areas of the northern and central parts of the lake but a relatively weak influence on the wetland cover transitions in the shallow floodplains near the sink of the inflow tributaries of poyang lake the study of the hydrological influences on the distribution and transition of the wetland cover provides new insights into the evolution of the wetland ecological system the outcomes of this work support the assessment of the effects of hydrological regulations such as the proposed dam project on wetland cover although the lake s hydrology had a significant influence on the wetland cover it was not the unique factor for wetland cover evolution considering the varying impacts of hydrology on different wetland cover types

5457,hydrology is a critical environmental condition for the evolution of wetland ecosystems the effects of hydrological changes on wetland cover are of great importance for preserving its ecological functions in this study the hydrological influences on wetland cover distribution and transition in a large complex lake floodplain system poyang lake china were investigated utilizing time series satellite remote sensing observations wetland cover types in poyang lake during 2000 2009 including water mudflat and the major vegetation communities were extracted and related to the wetland hydrological characteristics calculated by the hydrodynamic simulations the statistical results of annual inundation conditions for different wetland cover types indicated that vegetation communities were preferential to hydrological environments with shorter annual inundation than water and mudflats and different vegetation communities were distributed in areas with considerable variations in annual inundation which suggested a substantial hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover in poyang lake furthermore this study investigated the impact of hydrological changes on the wetland cover transitions between typical dry and wet years the results showed that hydrological fluctuations had various degrees of influences on different types of wetland cover transformation the spatial analysis indicated that hydrological changes were probably the dominant factor for the wetland cover evolution in the floodplain areas of the northern and central parts of poyang lake but not the unique determined factor for wetland cover transitions in the shallow floodplains near the sink of the inflows in the eastern and southwestern parts of poyang lake this study provides a practical reference for the effects of hydrological regulation in the protection and restoration of poyang lake wetland keywords poyang lake wetland hydrology wetland cover time series remote sensing hydrodynamic model 1 introduction wetlands are the transition areas between terrestrial and aquatic areas and usually provide significant economic and ecological functions such as in water purification flood reduction streamflow maintenance fish production and as a habitat for wild species mitsch and gosselink 2000 maltby et al 2011 wu et al 2011 the wetland cover substantially determines the structure and function of the wetland ecosystem ge et al 2009 dronoval et al 2012 wu et al 2014 however the wetland cover is sensitive to intensive human activities and natural processes such as climate change dramatic changes in the wetland cover types have been reported by a large number of researchers johnson et al 2005 gong et al 2010 chen et al 2014 spencer et al 2016 therefore the land cover distribution and transition are globally recognized issues in wetland protection wetland hydrology is one of the most important environmental element for the ecosystem the hydrological processes in the wetland play a critical role in the formation of land cover such as mudflats marshland and vegetation for example an appropriate amount of water can provide necessary conditions for vegetation growth while excess water or a lack of water can inhibit vegetation growth in the wetland zhao and running 2010 choo et al 2014 moreover as water demand varies from species to species changes in hydrological conditions may alter the dominance of species craine and dybzinski 2013 therefore the hydrological characteristics such as water level water depth and inundation character have been regarded as critical factors for wetland cover riis and hawes 2002 todd et al 2010 poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china with a complex lake floodplain system the significant hydrological fluctuations in poyang lake have led to the development of its internationally renowned wetland system the poyang lake wetland benefits the regional economy by providing a large amount of industrial materials more importantly the wetland serves as an indispensable habitat for a numerous species including hundreds of thousands of migratory birds wang et al 2013 cai et al 2017 unfortunately the wetland cover of poyang lake has experienced significant changes in recent years feng et al 2016 han et al 2015 2018 hu et al 2015 lei et al 2011 wu et al 2017 which seriously threatens the ecological functions of the wetland meanwhile the hydrology in poyang lake has varied dramatically due to climate changes and human activities feng et al 2012a b gao et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 studies have shown that poyang lake experienced a drier hydrological condition in the 2000s compared with the previous decades the influences of the impendence of the three gorges dam on the yangtze river climate changes in the catchment and other impact factors on the lake s hydrology have been frequently discussed and linked with the wetland cover changes in poyang lake xie et al 2015 feng et al 2016 han et al 2018 the potential hydrological influences on the wetland cover in poyang lake have been recognized by scholars governments and the public a series of measures were put forward to protect the poyang lake wetland by mitigating hydrological changes and restoring the hydrological conditions in the lake zhang et al 2012a b feng et al 2016 han et al 2018 for example the poyang lake water conservancy project was proposed to preserve water storage during the dry season lai et al 2015 wang et al 2015 qi et al 2016 however some researchers claimed that the proposed dam project may do harm to the wetland environment jiao 2009 it is still challenging to assess the effects of these measures on wetland protection and restoration therefore addressing the hydrological influence on the distribution and transition of wetland cover is of great practical significance in lake management a number of studies have discussed the effects of hydrology on the wetland cover in poyang lake however most previous studies did not fully consider the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in wetland hydrology and cover as they were performed on a relatively narrow spatial scale or a short time period hu et al 2010 zhang et al 2012a b tan et al 2016 owing to the significant annual and inter annual dynamics in hydrology and wetland cover in poyang lake studies with different datasets may result in different results moreover differences in the hydrological influences on various vegetation communities were not fully investigated in these studies for example some studies analyzed the influences of the lake s hydrology on the vegetation area or the distribution of some vegetation types dai et al 2016 han et al 2015 hu et al 2010 liu et al 2016 tan et al 2016 tan and jiang 2016 even though some studies have investigated the relationship between the lake s hydrology and the distribution of wetland cover the hydrological influences on the distribution of wetland cover were not well explained han et al 2018 furthermore few studies investigated the relationship between the changes in wetland hydrology and cover type therefore the effects of hydrological changes on wetland cover transitions remain largely unknown in this study time series of remote sensing and hydrodynamic simulation were used to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of the lake s hydrology and wetland cover during 2000 2009 to our knowledge the time series of remote sensing can capture the land cover conditions rapidly and periodically thus this method is able to provide detailed information of wetland cover on a relatively large scale moreover hydrodynamic simulation can provide an accurate hydrological regime to identify the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in hydrological conditions on the basis of the long term distribution of the hydrological regime and wetland cover the appropriate hydrological conditions for the major cover types in poyang lake wetland were explored furthermore the influences of hydrological changes on different wetland transitions and their spatial distribution were investigated this study aimed to identify the hydrological conditions for the distribution of different wetland cover types and reveal the influences of hydrological changes on different wetland cover transitions thereby providing a scientific reference for wetland protection and restoration 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data poyang lake 29 0 n 116 5 e lies at the junction of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river poyang lake has a drainage basin of approximate 16 2 104 km2 and receives water from the main five rivers xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe in the catchment as shown in fig 1 the lake naturally connects to the yangtze river though the outlet in the north poyang lake has a complex topography with wide shallow floodplains separated and interleaved by narrow deep channels min 2000 feng et al 2011 the lake bottom elevation decreases significantly from the south to the north influenced by the subtropical humid monsoon climate in the catchment and lake river interactions poyang lake usually experiences low water water rising high water and water receding periods within a year yao et al 2018 during the high water period the lake has a wide and calm water surface reaching more than 3000 km2 while during the low water period water flow is confined in the channel water surface can shrink to less than 1000 km2 and the difference in water level can reach more than 5 m from south to north generally spatial variations in lake topography and seasonal variations in climate conditions in the catchment induce significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the lake s hydrology the special hydrological fluctuations in poyang lake forms its unique wetland it serves as the habitat for many species for example it provides habitat for many rare migratory birds from siberia in winter poyang lake is recognized one of the most important wetlands due to its ecological functions during the water receding period water usually flows from the floodplain area to the channel and the majority of the lake s bottom is finally exposed the inundation gradually transfers to vegetation growth in contrast during the water rising period the vegetation is gradually covered by water and transfers to inundation again the wetland cover of poyang lake is substantially related to the hydrological fluctuations three data sets were collected for this study including gauge observations bottom elevation measurements and satellite remote sensing data daily hydrological observations in the catchment during 2000 2009 were collected from the department of water resources of jiangxi province the daily discharge of lake inflow and outflow were collected from eight gauging stations hukou qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng as shown in fig 1 lake water level from the five hydrological stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan as shown in fig 1 were collected the lake bottom topography data of 1998 and 2010 were acquired by the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources and processed by the department of natural resources of jiangxi province the bathymetry of the lake during the 2000s were obtained by interpolation satellite remote sensing products were collected to obtain the cover state in poyang lake a landsat image acquired on july 8 1998 during the flooding period of poyang lake was obtained from the united states geological survey the modis level 3 8 day surface reflectance products during 2000 2009 were collected from the united states nasa goddard space flight center 2 2 hydrodynamic model to obtain the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the water regime in poyang lake a numerical model was implemented based on the delft3d flow model which has been widely applied in simulations of flows sediment transports and water quality of shallow waters delft hydraulics 2014 as a shallow and wide lake vertical currents in poyang lake can be neglected lai et al 2011 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a b yao et al 2018 thus a 2d free surface hydrodynamic model was constructed delft3d flow calculated the depth averaged shallow water equations derived from the 3d navier stokes equations on a staggered grid and solved them by an implicit finite difference method the numeric grid covered the maximum flooding area extracted by the landsat image disconnected segments separated by islands and artificial structures were removed rectangular grids with a resolution of 300 m were then generated to reflect the large seasonal variability in the water boundary of poyang lake a drying and flooding algorithm was used delft hydraulics 2014 bathymetry data were processed and interpolated into the grid points the model runtime extended from january 1 2000 to december 31 2009 and the computation interval step was set as 1 min to meet the courant friedrichs lewy condition for model stability and accuracy the upper open boundary conditions of the model were specified as the daily inflow discharges of poyang lake in addition to the observed gauged runoff of the five main rivers in the catchment the unknown water balance component including ungauged runoff groundwater inflow direct precipitation and evaporation zhang et al 2014 2017 lu et al 2018 were estimated and converted to inflow discharges through a model proposed by zhang et al 2014 the lower open boundary conditions were prescribed as the daily observed water levels at hukou initial conditions were obtained by interpolating the observed water levels at gauge stations the model parameters were initially defined based on literature values delft hydraulics 2014 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a qi et al 2016 li et al 2016 yao et al 2018 liang et al 2019 lu et al 2019 the critical parameters were calibrated and validated by comparing the simulation values and measurements according to our experience the manning s roughness coefficients spatially varied from 0 02 s m1 3 for the channel to 0 03 s m1 3 for the floodplain area the horizontal eddy viscosity was set as 1 m2 s and the threshold depth for the drying and flooding algorithm was set as 0 10 m in this study statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percentage bias pbias and root mean square error rsme were calculated to evaluate the model performance moriasi et al 2007 2 3 wetland cover classification the wetland of poyang lake consists of water mudflats and several kinds of vegetation the five major vegetation communities in poyang lake include a floating aquatic macrophytes community fam spare grass community sg carex spp community cs triarrhena lutarioriparia l and phragmites community tp and zizania latifolia community zi hu et al 2010 han et al 2018 these different cover types are generally distributed from the lake center to the shore and the vegetation communities occur in different periods time series remote sensing observations have the ability to recognize different vegetation communities and provides detailed wetland cover information the detailed composition and phenological characteristics of the vegetation community are summarized in table 1 in this study the wetland coverage in poyang lake during 2000 2009 was extracted through a decision tree classification method based on the phenological and spectral characteristics put forward by han et al 2018 the 8 day modis reflectance products were pre processed and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi time series were generated according to eq 1 1 ndvi nir r nir r where nir and r are the reflectance of the near infrared band and red band in the modis product respectively as most of the fam is distributed in the disconnected segments of poyang lake the wetland coverage was classified into water mudflat and four major vegetation communities sg cs tp zi in this study the ndvi time series of each pixel were used to classify the different wetland cover types the ndvi values for water were negative throughout the whole year the ndvi values for the mudflat and sg community were generally negative in the wet season and positive in the dry season and sg showed higher values in the dry season the zi community has only one peak in the ndvi time series in each year while cs and tp community has two peaks in the ndvi time series in each year moreover the second peak of ndvi time series in each year for tp occurred earlier than cs and the values of the ndvi were usually higher for tp combining the ndvi fluctuations and the phenology of different communities we can distinguish the wetland cover type in poyang lake well han et al 2018 3 results 3 1 performance of hydrodynamic model the performance of the hydrodynamic model was evaluated by the time series 2000 2009 comparison of simulated and observed values in poyang lake including daily water levels at xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan and outflow discharge at hukou as shown in fig 2 a visual inspection of the time series amplitude and phase of the simulations and measurements suggested that the model generally showed good accuracy the statistical results showed that the r 2 and nse values of the water levels were all higher than 0 972 and 0 969 respectively the pbias values of the water levels varied from 0 42 to 1 08 which indicated that there was no significant overestimation or underestimation in the model the rmse values of the water levels varied from 0 105 m to 0 366 m the match of the outflow discharges was relatively poorer than that of the water levels nevertheless the r 2 and nse of discharge were as high as 0 928 and 0 913 respectively the pbias was 2 87 and the rmse was 874 3 m3 s generally the hydrodynamic model used in this study was capable of capturing the rapid seasonal changes as well as the significant spatial variations in the hydrological regime of poyang lake wetland 3 2 wetland inundation character and change analysis the annual inundation processes during 2000 2009 were simulated by the established hydrodynamic model if the computation grid was wet on a certain day then the grid was inundated on that day the annual inundation days of each grid were extracted through the simulation results fig 3 shows the annual inundation days of the poyang lake wetland during 2000 2009 the results indicated a significant spatiotemporal difference in the inundation character of the poyang lake wetland generally the inundation days of the wetland increased from the floodplain to the deep channel and the wetlands were inundated longer in the wet years than in the dry years the annual inundation days of the channel area and deep basin in the central and eastern parts of the lake were the largest reaching more than 360 days these areas were usually covered by water throughout the year the annual inundation days of floodplain areas near to the channel and the deep lake basin were 240 330 days owing to the significant differences in hydrological condition the inundation character of these areas varied greatly from more than 360 days in wet years to less than 120 days in the dry years the annual inundation days of the shallow areas in the southwestern part of poyang lake were the smallest which usually ranged from 60 days to 180 days in some dry years the annual inundation days of these areas could decrease to less than 30 days the significant heterogeneity in wetland inundation character provided different hydrological conditions for vegetation growth which may have further affected the wetland cover type a trend analysis was conducted on the annual inundation character of the poyang lake wetland during 2000 2009 a linear regression and t test were performed on each computation grid to detect the changing trend fig 4 shows the distribution of the trend of inundation in poyang lake wetland for areas covered by water throughout the year such as the channel the deep basin in the central and eastern lake and segments at the south end of the lake the annual inundation days showed no significant trend for the floodplain areas near to the channel and the deep lake basin the annual inundation days showed a significant decreasing trend p 0 05 the annual inundation days of the shallow floodplain areas decreased by 1 15 days year in the northern lake 7 30 days year in the central lake and could reach more than 30 days year in the southwest part of the lake for the channel edge areas the annual inundation days increased by 1 7 days year because of the erosion processes for the inflow river sink areas of poyang lake the sedimentation processes caused complicated terrain changes such as erosion uplift and partitions which resulted in a spatially fractured change trend in these areas 3 3 wetland cover type and change analysis the wetland cover of poyang lake during 2000 2009 was detected by the time series remote sensing data fig 5 shows the spatiotemporal distribution of different wetland cover types including water mudflats and the major four vegetation communities sg cs tp and zi permanent water areas were mainly distributed in the channel and deep basin in the central and eastern parts of the lake and the mudflat areas were distributed next to the permanent water areas the vegetation communities were distributed on the shallow floodplains among them sg and cs were distributed closer to the mudflat and permanent water areas while tp and zi were distributed closer to the lake shore a visual inspection of the wetland cover type indicated significant inter annual variabilities during 2000 2009 the area of each cover type during this period showed a significant decrease in water and mudflat while a significant increase was exhibited in vegetation as shown in fig 6 the areas of permanent water and mudflats in poyang lake wetland decreased by 63 9 km2 year and 26 6 km2 year respectively in contrast the vegetation coverage increased by 87 1 km2 year generally a decrease of the permanent water and mudflats and increase of vegetation were observed in the central and eastern parts of the lake among the four major vegetation communities in poyang lake sg cs and zi increased significantly with a trend of 40 0 km2 year 38 0 km2 year and 6 0 km2 year respectively the coverage of tp also showed an increasing but not significant trend of 3 1 km2 year 3 4 hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover in order to explore the hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover the relationship between the inundation character and wetland cover type was investigated a statistical analysis of each type of wetland cover area and the lake s averaged inundation character was conducted moreover the distribution of inundation condition for each type of wetland coverage was analyzed and the occurrence probabilities of different cover types under certain inundation conditions were calculated fig 7 shows the relationship between the mean inundation days of poyang lake and the coverage areas of water mudflat and vegetation including sg cs tp and zi the statistical results indicated that the coverage areas of water and mudflats in poyang lake wetland showed significant increasing trends of 12 9 km2 day and 5 2 km2 day with the average inundation days while the coverage areas of vegetation showed a decreasing trend of 17 5 km2 day with the average inundation days of poyang lake among the four vegetation communities coverage areas of sg and cs decreased significantly with the increase of average inundation days of the lake by 7 3 km2 day and 9 7 km2 day respectively in contrast the coverage areas of tp and zi also varied with the variation of average inundation days of the lake but they were less influenced the annual inundation conditions for different wetland cover types during 2000 2009 were further explored to reveal the hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover in poyang lake histogram analysis for the inundation days of water mudflat sg cs tp and zi covered areas during this period were performed for each wetland cover type in poyang lake the optimal inundation conditions accounting for the largest portion in the histogram and the suitable inundation conditions accounting for more than 10 in the histogram were obtained as shown in fig 8 the statistical results indicate a significant difference in the optimal inundation conditions of different wetland cover types a significant decrease was found in the optimal inundation days for water mudflat and vegetation covered areas among the four major vegetation communities the optimal inundation days for sg cs tp and zi decreased significantly in turn the suitable inundation days of different wetland cover types also showed a similar decreasing trend however in contrast to the optimal inundation conditions for different wetland cover overlaps in the suitable inundation conditions for different wetland cover types may exist for example the suitable inundation conditions for mudflat and sg both amounted to 180 210 days and the suitable inundation conditions for sg and cs both amounted to 150 180 days the statistical analysis of the inundation conditions for different wetland cover type suggested that the hydrological character had a significant impact on the distribution of wetland coverage in addition the occurrence probabilities of each wetland cover type in poyang lake under different inundation conditions were calculated to further analyze the hydrological influence on the distribution of wetland cover as shown in fig 9 generally the occurrence probabilities of all wetland cover types changed significantly with annual inundation days for areas with more than 45 weeks of annual inundation the occurrence probability of permanent water was the highest for areas with 31 45 weeks of annual inundation the occurrence probability of mudflats was the highest furthermore for areas with less than 31 weeks of annual inundation the occurrence probability of vegetation was the highest moreover for areas with less than 9 weeks of annual inundation tp was the dominant vegetation community and for areas with 10 31 weeks of annual inundation cs was the dominant vegetation community the occurrence probabilities of zi were all less than 10 under different inundation conditions as it accounted for a small portion of wetland cover in poyang lake during 2000 2009 the occurrence probability of sg reached its maximum 28 with 27 weeks of annual inundation however it was still smaller than cs this result indicated that although the hydrological character was significant but it did not show a uniquely determined impact on the distribution of wetland cover in poyang lake 3 5 relationship between hydrological changes and wetland cover transitions to reveal the role of hydrological changes in wetland cover evolution in poyang lake the relationship between changes in inundation character and cover type was analyzed a typical wet year 2002 and a dry year 2006 during 2000 2009 were selected changes in wetland coverage in the two years were extracted and the transitions among different cover types were calculated differences in inundation conditions between the two years were obtained from the hydrodynamic simulation the influences of hydrological changes on the wetland cover transitions were investigated fig 10 shows significant variabilities in wetland cover types between 2002 and 2006 as a large extent of the lake s bottom was exposed in the dry year a considerable permanent water area transferred to the mudflat or vegetation and a large portion of the mudflat area transferred to vegetation these transitions mainly occurred in the shallow floodplain areas near to the channel and deep basin in the northern and central parts of the lake moreover wetland cover transitions among different vegetation communities were found in the floodplain areas near the lake shore the quantitative assessment of wetland cover transitions between 2002 and 2006 were summarized in table 2 areas of permanent water and mudflat in 2006 decreased by 524 9 km2 and 229 4 km2 respectively for the four major vegetation communities in poyang lake the coverage area of sg increased most by 477 6 km2 followed by tp 239 0 km2 while increases in cs and zi were much smaller at 35 3 km2 and 2 4 km2 moreover the results indicate considerable transitions among different communities for example the coverage area of sg in 2006 reached 588 5 km2 among which more than 90 transferred from water and mudflat and about 68 and 17 sg in 2002 transferred to cs and tp in 2006 respectively fig 11 shows the differences in annual inundation days between 2002 and 2006 in poyang lake wetland on average the annual inundation decreased by 50 5 days in 2006 for the deep basin in the central and eastern parts of the lake and the channel there was little difference in annual inundation between the two years for the floodplain areas near the channel and deep basin in the central and southeastern parts of the lake annual inundation decreased by 90 150 days furthermore for the shallow floodplain areas in the northern and southwestern parts of the lake annual inundation decreased by 30 90 days influenced by the terrain variations in the lake the annual inundation increased in a few parts of the lake such as in some channel edge areas the consistency of changes in inundation conditions and wetland cover transitions were analyzed if the inundation days of a certain area both fell within the range of the suitable inundation conditions for its cover types in 2002 and 2006 and the inundation days of this area changed significantly 15 days it was regarded that changes in inundation conditions and wetland cover transition in this area were consistent fig 12 shows the percentage of consistent changes in inundation conditions and wetland cover for the major wetland cover transitions between 2002 and 2006 the percentages of different wetland cover transitions consistent with hydrological character varied significantly ranging from 54 5 to 91 2 for wetland cover changes from permanent water to mudflat and changes from mudflat to sg the percentages were larger than 90 which indicated a strong influence of hydrological changes on these types of wetland coverage transition whereas the percentage of consistency for the wetland cover change from sg to tp was only 54 5 which indicated a relatively weak hydrological influence on this wetland cover transition in general the results suggest that hydrological changes have varying effects on different wetland cover transitions fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of the consistent changes in inundation condition and wetland cover between 2002 and 2006 in poyang lake the results indicated that in the floodplain areas of the northern and central parts of the lake wetland cover transitions were well consistent with hydrological changes thereby the evolution of wetland cover may be dominated by the hydrological processes in these areas in contrast for the shallow floodplain near the lake shore in the eastern and southwestern parts of the lake wetland cover transitions were poorly consistent with hydrological changes thus hydrological variation was probably not the only determinant cause for the evolution of wetland cover in these areas spatially these areas were distributed around the sink of the inflow rivers therefore they were more susceptible to sediment and nutrient transport from the catchment 4 discussions 4 1 hydrological changes in poyang lake and dominant causes changes in the hydrology of rivers and lakes are highly associated with water supply for human life industry and ecosystems the hydrological regime of poyang lake plays an important role in local social and economic development as well as the wetland evolution a large number of studies have analyzed the hydrological regime changes in poyang lake it has been well recognized that poyang lake experienced a drier condition in the 2000s min and zhan 2012 liu et al 2013 ye et al 2013 gao et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 the long term examination and trend testing of the observed lake water levels min and zhan 2012 zhang et al 2014 indicated that the lake s water levels were generally lower during the 2000s a shrink of the water surface in poyang lake was also observed by satellite remote sensing feng et al 2012 owing to the complicated meteorological and hydrological conditions as well as the complex terrain hydrological fluctuations in poyang lake are influenced by multiple factors on one hand the lake s hydrology is essentially related to the inflow runoff from the catchment feng et al 2012 guo et al 2008 yao et al 2016 station observations and satellite monitoring showed a decreasing trend of precipitation in the catchment which resulted in smaller inflow volume on the other hand the water regime in the poyang lake is strongly influenced by the yangtze river hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 cai et al 2017 a number of researchers considered the blocking effects of the yangtze river before and after the construction of the three gorges dam zhang et al 2012a b guo et al 2012 they claimed that the weaker blocking effects of the yangtze river have led to larger outflow discharges and lower water levels in poyang lake especially during september october in addition several studies lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 liang et al 2019 revealed that changes in the lake s bottom terrain had a significant impact on the hydrological and hydrodynamic processes in poyang lake the outcomes of this study demonstrated that the lake hydrology had a substantial impact on the wetland cover distribution and transition in poyang lake thereby elucidating the dominant causes of the hydrological variations in poyang lake can assist in efficient and appropriate lake management however owing to significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in natural conditions and anthropogenic influences on the lake hydrology more detailed knowledge of the spatiotemporal distribution of the driving forces behind the changes in hydrological processes is needed 4 2 wetland protection and restoration in poyang lake the poyang lake wetland is highly valued for its ecological functions changes in wetland cover type in poyang lake have caused a loss of habitat for some cherished species thus wetland protection and restoration in poyang lake have been a great concern of local governments since wetland cover is closely related to hydrological changes in the lake the local governments have developed several policies to protect the lake against more severe hydrological regimes the government issued sand mining bans in 2006 and 2008 in order to alleviate the significant decreases in water level during the dry season caused by the lake s terrain changes moreover the government proposed the plan of the poyang lake water conservancy project to regulate the hydrological processes of the lake it was suggested to construct a dam across the narrowest section of the outflow channel in the north of the lake the proposed dam aims to conserve the water storage of the lake during the dry season protecting and restoring the wetland environment this study explores the hydrological conditions for different types of wetland cover distribution and further reveals the role of hydrological changes in wetland cover transitions in poyang lake which can support the policy making decisions for wetland protection and restoration it is noteworthy that the hydrological regime is not the only determinant factor for the distribution and transition of wetland cover in poyang lake even as regards the hydrologically dominant wetland cover distribution and transformation the driving forces for the water regime may not be exactly the same therefore the effects of a certain measure on wetland cover need further study the protection and restoration of different types of wetland cover in different places in the poyang lake wetland may require different measures 5 conclusions this study combined time series remote sensing and hydrological simulation to reveal the hydrological impact on the distribution and transition of the wetland cover in a complex lake floodplain system poyang lake china the spatiotemporal distribution of wetland cover type in poyang lake including water mudflats and the major vegetation communities cs sg tp and zi during 2000 2009 were detected and linked with the lake s hydrological characteristics the results showed that hydrology had a substantial impact on the wetland cover in poyang lake generally the inundation condition of each cover type varied significantly a decreasing trend in annual inundation from water mudflats to the vegetation communities was observed and a decreasing trend in the favorable annual inundation days of sg cs tp and zi was found among the major vegetation communities in the poyang lake wetland furthermore hydrological changes showed various degrees of impacts on different types of wetland cover transitions in poyang lake spatially changes in the hydrological regime exert a strong influence on wetland cover transitions in the floodplain areas of the northern and central parts of the lake but a relatively weak influence on the wetland cover transitions in the shallow floodplains near the sink of the inflow tributaries of poyang lake the study of the hydrological influences on the distribution and transition of the wetland cover provides new insights into the evolution of the wetland ecological system the outcomes of this work support the assessment of the effects of hydrological regulations such as the proposed dam project on wetland cover although the lake s hydrology had a significant influence on the wetland cover it was not the unique factor for wetland cover evolution considering the varying impacts of hydrology on different wetland cover types

5458,quantitative analyses of empirical data requirements for hydrological simulations are rare this study aims to analyze how a multi objective optimization framework and information content computations aid in quantifying field scale data worth in drainage studies the results showed how a 1d numerical model and a differential evolution algorithm performed in describing the field water balance the choice of the optimization target subsurface drain discharge and surface runoff impacted the simulation results more than parameter deviations while the information content of surface runoff data was higher than that of drain discharge drain discharge data contained more information on most of the soil parameters uncertainties related to groundwater outflow data which were not used in the optimization were higher than those of drain discharge and surface runoff a central weighing optimization scheme with two data types produced the best but still incomplete description of the field hydrology despite the modest model performance the results demonstrated how the choice of empirical data and optimization strategy can lead to uncertainties in drainage simulations and how the uncertainties can be assessed practically a low amount of information and a parameter sensitivity analysis can lead to a biased description of uncertainty related to such hydrological variables which are not used in the optimization benefits of the modeling framework were shown when assessing 1 model structure adequacy with the pareto front analysis 2 information content of different data types regarding different parameters and 3 uncertainties related to simulating hydrological variables based on optimization against a given data type keywords information content hydrus multi objective optimization differential evolution pareto front identifiability 1 introduction assessing empirical data requirements for hydrological model analyses is an important part of conducting reliable simulations but such requirements are rarely quantified agricultural land drainage which has been studied for over a century jin and sands 2003 serves as a concrete example of a hydrological problem that has been widely studied using field measurements and simulation models however it is not clear what the best way to combine measurements with simulations is and what the implications of the related uncertainties are land drainage is currently facing new challenges due to changing climate and rival land uses improved understanding of data requirements can lead to more reliable hydrological impacts assessments in northern conditions drainage practices have traditionally been implemented in agricultural fields to provide optimal trafficability and soil moisture conditions for crop growth during wet spring and autumn periods e g blann et al 2009 however considering environmental impacts of agriculture e g tilman et al 2011 blann et al 2009 a drainage design also offers an opportunity to control environmental load generation sands et al 2015 skaggs et al 2005 mendez et al 2004 morrison et al 2013 skaggs and chescheir 2003 designing sustainable land drainage is among the measures to adapt to the climate change which is expected to increase the frequency of mild winter occurrence räisänen 2008 gillett et al 2003 and environmental loads to surface waters e g meier et al 2012 and thus to challenge the current drainage procedures while assessing hydrological processes by empirical means is a highly laborious and costly task combining numerical models with empirical data provides improved means to evaluate relevant processes different numerical modeling approaches e g de schepper et al 2017 turunen et al 2013 singh et al 2006 boivin et al 2006 have been previously developed and applied to describe hydrology of drained fields despite the advances in numerical modeling empirical data is inherently needed for model parameterization calibration and validation purposes silberstein 2006 estimation of empirical data requirements for a robust model assessment is often not systematized but assessed a priori by expert knowledge which inherently involves a degree of subjectivity the degree of subjectivity could be decreased by exploiting methodologies to quantify information content and worth of different observations with respect to the studied phenomena for example in earlier studies rozemeijer et al 2010 demonstrated the importance of drain discharge observations for model flow route simulations leaf 2017 further studied model data relations and showed how simulations could be applied to identify such observations which would reduce model predictive uncertainties the most also vrugt et al 2001 showed a methodology to quantify the information content of different observations the data worth of different observations could be further analyzed by calibrating a model against different data types one by one and assessing how accurately different hydrological variables can be reproduced based on a chosen data type the above quantitative methods offer approaches to identify hydrologically relevant data e g loritz et al 2018 and consequently to set a robust frame for the design of appropriate field scale measurement campaigns for simulation studies regarding drainage design studies the data worth of different observations has been rarely quantitatively assessed guillaume et al 2019 kikuchi 2017 moreover it has been recently suggested that information quantification could formulate a more robust and formally appropriate approach to provide model based knowledge as compared with traditional uncertainty analyses nearing and gupta 2018 nearing et al 2016 data worth analyses can be considered to be inherently different from widely applied sensitivity analyses nearing and gupta 2018 the implications of data worth analyses on practice oriented and concrete modeling cases such as land drainage would be worth studying this study aims to analyze how numerical modeling a multi objective optimization framework and information content analyses e g vrugt et al 2001 can be applied to quantitatively describe field scale data worth in the context of agricultural land drainage the studied data types include measured subsurface drain discharge and surface runoff time series drain discharge measurements are available from numerous research sites and they are more easily set up compared to surface runoff monitoring this study is motivated by the need to find out which one of these measurements is more valuable from the viewpoint of data worth 2 materials and methods 2 1 drained field site and empirical data the nummela experimental field is located in southern finland wgs84 60 51 59 n 23 25 50 e data of the studied field section with an area of 1 7 ha was utilized in this study the field has a heavy clay particle size 0 002 mm soil with the mean clay content of 66 vakkilainen et al 2010 the field section is flat with a slope of 1 the field was cultivated with oats and barley during the measurement campaigns preferential flowpaths dominate water flow in the clayey soil and allow relatively rapid drainage of the fields during rain storm and snowmelt events turunen et al 2015 turunen et al 2013 the field section c in turunen et al 2013 was initially subsurface drained in 1952 with a drain spacing of 16 m a drain depth of 1 m and an inner drain diameter of 0 05 m in june 2008 new supplementary drains were installed between the old drain lines resulting in a drain spacing of 8 m gravel was used as an envelope material and gravel deposits were installed every 7 m turunen et al 2013 vakkilainen et al 2010 the hydrology of the field section was monitored from may 2007 onwards thus the hydrological data was 11 years long the monitored hydrological variables used in the current study were subsurface drain discharge and surface runoff surface runoff was collected with gravel trenches depth 0 4 m to a subsurface drain pipe which conveyed the water to the measurement station at the station surface runoff and subsurface drain discharge were separately measured with datawater ws vertical helix meters maddalena povoletto italy at the pipe outlets the outflow variables were measured with a time resolution of 15 min the area of the monitored drain network was 1 7 ha and the area from which surface runoff was collected was 1 2 ha precipitation was measured on site with a time resolution of 15 min other meteorological variables air temperature air relative humidity and short wave radiation were available from a nearby 7 km from the site observatory of the finnish meteorological institute all data were aggregated into daily time steps for the simulations more detailed information on the site and the data is available in turunen et al 2013 and vakkilainen et al 2010 2 2 model the field hydrology was modeled using the hydrus model šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 due to its capability to describe preferential flow generation of subsurface drainage and surface runoff as well as other relevant hydrological processes in the snow affected nummela agricultural fields hydrus is a modular 1d process based model and its numerical solution is based on linear finite element schemes the vertical 1d model was assumed to provide a sufficient description of the flat nummela field e g salo et al 2015 li et al 2014 the time derivative is solved with a fully implicit discretization using the picard iterative solution scheme in this study the soil water flow was described with the dual porosity module of the model where the pore space is partitioned into mobile inter aggregate and immobile soil matrix regions 1 θ mo t x k h h x 1 s mo γ 2 θ im t s im γ where θmo and θim are the soil water content l3 l 3 in the mobile and immobile regions respectively x is the vertical spatial coordinate l k h is the hydraulic conductivity h is the pressure head l smo and sim are sink terms for the two regions t 1 and γ is the transfer rate of water from the mobile to immobile regions t 1 throughout the text the subscripts mo and im are used to refer to the mobile and immobile pore regions respectively water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were computed using the van genuchten 1980 schemes the water transfer between the two regions was described with the following equation 3 γ α h mo h im where α is the first order mass transfer coefficient l 1t 1 when the groundwater level was above the subsurface drain depth drain discharge was described as kroes et al 2008 4 q dr h dr γ drain where qdr is the drain discharge lt 1 hdr is the height of the watertable l above the drain depth at the midpoint between the drain lines and γ drain is the drain entrance resistance t which was calculated as 5 γ drain l dr 2 8 k hbot d eq 4 k htop h dr γ entr where ldr is the drain spacing l khbot and khtop are the horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivities lt 1 below and above the drain system respectively deq is the equivalent depth l and γ entr is the drain entrance resistance t deq was calculated with the method of van der molen and wesseling 1991 the impact of groundwater flow on the studied area was calculated using the equation of hopmans and stricker 1989 6 q gw a qh e x p b qh h b where qgw is the groundwater seepage flux lt 1 aqh lt 1 and bqh l 1 are empirical parameters and hb l is the depth of the water table below the surface of the simulated profile the seepage flux is assigned to the bottom node of the profile by simultaneously having both drain discharge and groundwater seepage processes active the model version differs from the standard model version of šimůnek et al 2008 the model describes snow accumulation by assuming that all precipitation is in the form of snow when the air temperature is lower than 2 c linear transition is set to control the form of snow between temperatures of 2 and 2 c all precipitation is considered to be in the liquid form for temperatures higher than 2 c snowmelt is described with a degree day approach where the snow layer melts proportionally to the air temperature greater than 0 c multiplied with a degree day coefficient d lt 1 evapotranspiration from the soil influences the layers within the root zone and is given as a precomputed time series turunen et al 2015 2 3 model application 2 3 1 modeling approach the data worth analysis was started with calibrating and validating the model against two data types drain discharge and surface runoff to assess the model performance for describing key hydrological processes in the studied site step 1 in fig 1 a in the second step the model was calibrated against one data type drain discharge or surface runoff at a time to assess how accurately the other data type can be predicted based on the calibration against one data type this approach was considered useful since it shows the boundaries of the possible pareto frontier in the model solution space e g madsen 2003 and can thus help to understand model data relations and data worth mertens et al 2006 in the third step the information content of the two data types with respect to different parameter was quantified based on prior and posterior parameter variations e g vrugt et al 2001 leaf 2017 this was done to compare how accurately different parameters can be identified based on a data type the combination of the above computations was assumed to give a reasonable understanding of model data relations and the results describe data worth in the current study fig 1a thereafter traditional parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess how the uncertainties related to the choice of data compare with the parameter sensitivity the modeling approach and the setup are described in more detail below in sections 2 3 2 2 3 6 and fig 1a 2 3 2 temporal data spatial discretization timestepping and boundary conditions since most water outflow at the study site occurs outside the growing seasons e g turunen et al 2015 two dormant season periods were chosen for the model application in this study the simulations were focused on two autumn winter spring periods with prevailing high north atlantic oscillation indices characterizing mild winters that are presumable typical of future winter conditions under climate warming e g gillett et al 2003 the periods were sep 2011 apr 2012 and sep 2014 apr 2015 for the model calibration and validation respectively computational time steps were set to vary between 0 00001 and 0 1 days in the simulations with the dynamic time stepping scheme of hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 spatially the field was described using a 2 m deep 1d profile that was discretized using a 0 02 m spacing system dependent boundary conditions were set at the top and bottom of the profile šimůnek et al 2008 at the top the atmospheric condition was controlled by precipitation evaporation and h at the soil surface at the bottom the boundary was described by the sum of eqs 4 and 6 drain discharge and groundwater seepage respectively a schematic presentation of the boundary conditions and key processes included in the model is shown in fig 1b 2 3 3 multi objective optimization the model was calibrated against multiple data types using the differential evolution algorithm the data type term refers to measurements of different hydrological phenomena the two data types in this study included cumulative surface runoff and drain discharge regarding the objective function the widely used root mean square error rmse was chosen to describe the difference between the simulated and observed time series fj l individual objective functions were formed by compensating differences in the magnitude of the two series by normalizing the rmse values by the standard deviation of the data nrmse and further by transforming the distance of the nrmses from the origin near the optimum e g köhne et al 2011 mertens et al 2006 madsen 2003 7 f j f j σ j φ j j 1 2 where fj is the individual objective function σ j is the standard deviation of the data l associated with f j φ j is the transformation constant and j denotes different objectives e g drain flow and surface runoff φ j was calculated as follows e g köhne et al 2011 mertens et al 2006 8 φ j max f 1 σ 1 f 2 σ 2 f j σ j j 1 2 the transformation constant keeps each individual objective function the same distance from the origin and thus balances their contributions in the aggregated objective function the actual aggregated objective function f agg was then formed by aggregating the individual objective functions following the central weighing scheme ocw mertens et al 2004 madsen 2003 9 f agg w f 1 1 w f 2 where w is the weighting coefficient which is given a value of 0 5 in the central weighing scheme 2 3 4 differential evolution the optimization was conducted with the metaheuristic differential evolution algorithm dea which is considered to be an effective global optimization method e g storn and price 1997 and has previously been successfully implemented in several hydrological modeling studies e g gurarslan and karahan 2015 ayvaz and gurarslan 2019 karterakis et al 2007 the dea starts by setting a number of candidate solutions in a model parameter space the algorithm considers each population member as a vector of parameters and evaluates the fitness of the population members with a given objective function eq 9 the search converges towards the global minimum by stochastically combining the parameters of population members by adding weighed differences between two population vectors to a third vector if the resulting vector has a lower objective function value than a chosen older parent vector the new vector replaces the old vector thus the population members self organize towards the global minimum there are numerous different approaches to apply the dea e g storn and price 1997 in the current study the so called de rand 1 bin storn and price 1997 strategy is applied following gurarslan and karahan 2015 the approach is presented shortly below in the algorithm a mutant vector vi g 1 is created for each population parent vector pi g during each generation 10 v i g 1 p r 1 g f p r 2 g p r 3 g r 1 r 2 r 3 i where i r1 r2 and r3 denote randomly selected vectors among the population f is the mutation factor and g is the generation number the parent vector pi g and the mutant vector vi g 1 are merged into a trial vector ui g 1 parameter wise as follows 11 u i k g 1 v i k g 1 i f r c r o r k r k p i k g o t h e r w i s e where uik g 1 is the resulting trial vector parameter k is the parameter index in a vector r 0 1 is a random number cr 0 1 is the crossover parameter and rk is a randomly selected index a new r is generated for each k but rk is common for each k of the trial vector thus rk ensures that at least one parameter is obtained from the mutant vector the trial vector ui g 1 replaces the parent vector p i g if the objective function value of the trial vector equals or is lower than the value of the parent in the current study the algorithm was set to stop when the standard deviation of the population objective function values was lower than 1 of the mean population objective function value the parameters f and cr were set to the value of 0 8 following gurarslan and karahan 2015 different population numbers 20 40 and 60 were tested to address their impact on the optimization results the population number had practically no impact on the results and the population number of 40 was used in the optimizations initialization of the population was performed using the latin hypercube sampling non convergent simulations were given a very high objective function value also since running a successful simulation typically took only a couple of seconds simulations taking more than 30 s were aborted and considered non convergent following brunetti et al 2016 2 3 5 model setup and calibrated parameters the spatial domain of the model was set to consist of five soil horizons with distinct soil properties 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 1 0 and 1 0 2 0 m the soil hydraulic parameters for the soil matrix immobile zone were derived from turunen et al 2015 as listed in table 1 based on previous studies in clayey fields in southern finland it was assumed that in addition to the soil hydraulic parameters in table 1 water flow in the field was mostly controlled by the hydraulic properties of the macropore system the parameters of the subsurface drainage system and the parameters controlling groundwater outflow from the field warsta et al 2013 turunen et al 2013 eight parameters were chosen to describe these features and plausible parameter value ranges were identified from the literature the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the mobile zone was computed as a product of a conductivity multiplier ksat mul l t 1 and θs mo table 1 following warsta et al 2013 and larsbo and jarvis 2003 the calibration parameters and their ranges are given in table 2 the van genuchten shape parameters for the mobile zone were adopted from gärdenäs et al 2006 2 3 6 data worth and sensitivity to assess uncertainties related to the possibly pareto optimized solution the model was also optimized separately against the discharge data type odr and the runoff data type or i e by setting φ to 0 eq 7 and w to 0 or 1 eq 9 when optimizing against drainage or surface runoff data respectively the purpose of the analysis was to explore the pareto front extremes and consequently to analyze how weighing of individual objective functions affected the solution e g madsen 2003 to further analyze the role of two different calibration data types in the model optimization and model data interactions their information content was analyzed similarly as by vrugt et al 2001 12 ic m p 1 σ p m σ p where icm p is information content of measurement m regarding parameter p σ p m is the standard deviation of parameter p in the accepted behavioral simulations with respect to measurement m and σ p is the standard deviation of the parameter in the initial parameter ranges thus an icm p value close to one indicates that the information content of measurement m regarding parameter p is high an icm p value near zero indicates a low information content information contents were analyzed with a simulation test where the parameter ranges were set as in table 2 then 80 000 simulations were conducted using the latin hypercube approach and such simulations which had the nrmse 1 0 were considered behavioral in the information content calculation eq 12 the sensitivity of the solution optimized with ocw the central weighing scheme to parameter deviations was assessed with a global sensitivity analysis where the calibrated parameters were altered by 10 the model realizations were conducted using the latin hypercube monte carlo sampling following brunetti et al 2016 5000 realizations per parameter were assumed to be sufficient to reasonably explore the model parameter space thus the analysis was conducted with 40 000 8 parameters and 5000 realizations model runs 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation the dea optimization resulted in nrmse of 0 19 and 0 18 for drain discharge and surface runoff respectively after 81 831 model realizations fig 2 the resulting model parameters are given in table 3 the optimum is located at the sharp edge of the model solution space blue circle in fig 2 the pareto front was found to be unsymmetrical with considerably longer euclidean distance between the optimum of ocw and odr dark green circle in fig 2 than between ocw and or light green circle in fig 2 the measured and simulated cumulative drain discharge and surface runoff for the calibration and validation periods are illustrated in fig 3 with the corresponding evaluation criteria other key water balance components were evapotranspiration 71 mm groundwater outflow 37 mm and soil water storage change 19 mm thus drain discharge was clearly the dominant water balance component during the simulation the groundwater table depth fluctuated between the soil surface and the depth of 1 4 m the validation results were qualitatively similar to the calibration results but the model overestimated drain discharge and underestimated surface runoff fig 3 3 2 sensitivity and information content analyses simulation results can be considered to be rather conservative with respect to parameter deviations since in qualitative terms they do not cause pronounced changes in the distribution of the two water balance components fig 4 simulation results were found to be less sensitive to parameter deviations than to the choice of the optimization objective fig 4 i e to the choice between the extremes of the pareto front as shown in fig 2 regarding the impact of the optimization approach i e odr or ocw on outflow components the accumulated surface runoff for odr differed by 63 mm from the one for ocw cumulative drain discharge for or differed by 28 mm from the one for ocw similarly differences in simulated groundwater outflow were considerable for different optimization approaches i e groundwater outflow was 37 mm for ocw 126 mm for odr and 8 mm for or differences in the parameters controlling the amount of groundwater outflow i e aqh and bqh in table 3 explained differences in the amount of simulated groundwater outflow regarding the information content of the different observations the mean icm p values for all parameters were 0 05 and 0 19 for odr and or respectively the number of converged realizations with the nrmse below the threshold of 1 0 was 43 603 and 540 for odr and or respectively the monte carlo process was considered to converge based on the mean information content and outflow values shown in fig 5 regarding individual parameters the icm p values are shown in table 4 the results showed that the surface runoff data type contained more information for θs mo 1 aqh and γ entr than drain discharge data type while the drain discharge data contained more information for remaining parameters than surface runoff data the information content was the highest regarding aqh and γ entr when the surface runoff objective was used and regarding bqh when the drain discharge objective was used information contents were lowest regarding ksat mul θs mo 2 i and α note that parameter ranges of accepted simulations were relatively wide table 4 vs table 2 4 discussion model optimization with the differential evolution algorithm central weighing scheme and the two objectives resulted in a reasonable reproduction of the measured variables but there were periods with a clear mismatch more often during validation than calibration the mismatch partly indicates epistemic uncertainties such as meteorological data inconsistent with hydrological measurements or limited knowledge of system dynamics while epistemic uncertainties are difficult to quantify e g beven 2016 data worth of the partly incompletely measured variables is the remaining question which our analysis aimed to answer the sharp edge of the pareto front fig 2 indicated that optimizations with two objectives did not induce a significant decrease in the goodness of a single objective optimum such an ability to simultaneously optimize two objectives is an indication of an adequate model structure regarding simulations of studied phenomena mertens et al 2006 the euclidean distance between the optimum and the origin indicates the magnitude of modeling and measurement error which can be considered small compared with the variance of the data fig 2 the applied multi objective framework can be used to partly demonstrate the adequacy of a model structure the value of the approach is highlighted by the fact that such an assessment is practically impossible with a traditional model calibration validation framework optimization with only one objective led to a reasonable description of that variable but to uncertainties regarding other studied variables rozemeijer et al 2010 showed how drain discharge data could be more important than groundwater level data when simulating water outflow pathway contributions our results further pointed out that when optimizing surface runoff or it was possible to estimate drain discharge slightly more accurately than it was to estimate surface runoff when optimizing drain discharge odr fig 4 on the other hand optimization with the surface runoff objective or resulted in an unreasonably low 8 mm estimate of groundwater outflow as compared with earlier studies on the site turunen et al 2015 turunen et al 2013 this distinction was also reflected in the overestimation of simulated drain discharge in the or scheme in the current study only the central weighing scheme resulted in a reasonable description of all considered outflow fluxes regarding model outputs relatively high uncertainties in data types not used in model calibration were previously reported by højberg and refsgaard 2005 in a groundwater simulation study intensive field scale data sets with various hydrological data types could be analyzed with the current approach to show how accurately different variables can be predicted based on another variable in other words the approach can practically help quantify the worth of different data and consequently to identify which data is relevant for a hydrological analysis the simulations further showed how a model framework could be set up to quantify differences in information contents of different data types the information content of surface runoff observations was higher than that of drain discharge observations however regarding parameters describing soil hydraulic properties ksat mul θs mo 1 θs mo 2 l and α rather than sink term properties the information content of drain discharge was typically higher than that of surface runoff table 4 it is noteworthy that the absolute values of information content were affected by the choice of parameter ranges which also typically involve subjectivity despite their physical meaning e g beven and binley 1992 however the information content analysis facilitated a quantitative comparison between different data types practically the approach can help a modeler to understand how much uncertainty is reflected in the model parameters when the model is optimized against a chosen data type it is also possible that surface runoff simulations and surface runoff observations measured with a 0 4 m deep trench were not entirely commensurable if seepage from the soil entered the trench in addition to the runoff from the field surface thus the information content analysis may include such epistemic uncertainties the computational concept could be further applied to study information contents during a range of different periods as the nature of data worth can be partially dynamic loritz et al 2018 vrugt et al 2001 for example during growing seasons when groundwater outflow dominates the total outflow e g turunen et al 2013 it is likely that data types describing subsurface hydrological observations have higher information content than for example surface runoff this points out the importance of considering the timing of monitoring periods when conducting a data worth analysis the information content analysis also showed how much different data types contained information about different parameters the highest difference between the two data types was found in the parameters controlling groundwater outflow and drainage resistance unexpectedly the surface runoff data constrained the range of the drainage resistance values considerably more than the drain discharge data since the saturation excess mechanism triggering surface runoff generation requires high subsurface moisture conditions which are largely controlled by drainage this mechanism also pointed out the coupling between the surface and subsurface domains and partly exemplified why both studied data types contain information about each other the parameter ranges of the single objective optimizations table 4 were rather wide which implied considerable non uniqueness in those solutions the non uniqueness and possible noise in empirical data explain why it can be difficult to identify a plausible model with only one objective due to possible small inaccuracies in input or calibration data it can be practically impossible to identify the most plausible model from many rather similarly performing model realizations fig 2 however increasing the number of data types in the simulation can narrow down the model solution space fig 2 model ensemble approaches can be argued to be often a necessity for reliable model assessments for decision making e g ferré 2017 information quantification of a data type can help identify the limits of model predictions which can be considered to be an inherently different approach than a parameter sensitivity analysis e g nearing and gupta 2018 our results provided a practical demonstration of how relatively low amounts of information and a parameter sensitivity analysis can lead to a biased description of uncertainty related to such hydrological variables which are not used in the optimization fig 4 information on the studied parameters could be more efficiently extracted from temporal data series by identifying such data subsets containing the most information for one of the parameters vrugt et al 2001 while this study assessed model uncertainty on the field scale it is suggested that studying the data worth of widely available hydrological satellite data e g xu et al 2014 combined with simple terrestrial observations could facilitate the assessment of the reliability of drainage related modelling on a larger scale overall our data worth analysis showed how the modeling framework could be used to assess 1 adequacy of the model structure with the pareto front analysis 2 information content of different data types regarding different parameters and 3 uncertainties related to simulating hydrological variables based on optimization against a given data type according to kikuchi 2017 such a quantitative approach can be considered as a formal data worth analysis as compared with more widely conducted informal analyses which are based on expert judgement as pointed out by kikuchi 2017 and guillaume et al 2019 data worth analyses are relatively rarely conducted despite their potential benefits our study demonstrated the benefits in the context of drainage and field scale studies 5 conclusions the numerical simulations combined with the field scale hydrological data demonstrated how the multi objective optimization framework information content computations and the pareto front analysis could be beneficial for drainage studies and designs of empirical monitoring campaigns their benefits were demonstrated when assessing 1 model structure adequacy with the pareto front analysis 2 information content of different data types regarding different parameters and 3 uncertainties related to simulating hydrological variables based on optimization against a given data type it was shown how the choice of the empirical data and optimization strategy had a larger impact on simulation results than parameter deviations in the model sensitivity analysis the information content of the surface runoff data was higher than that of subsurface drain discharge when different optimization strategies were compared the highest uncertainties were related to those data which were not used in any of the optimization approaches practically a low amount of information and a parameter sensitivity analysis can lead to a biased description of uncertainty related to such hydrological variables which are not used in the optimization the central weighing scheme with two available data types resulted in the best but still incomplete description of the field hydrology pointing out epistemic uncertainties in a wider context the quantitative modeling framework could be applied to map the data worth of a wide range of different data types to evaluate what types of data are required to

5458,quantitative analyses of empirical data requirements for hydrological simulations are rare this study aims to analyze how a multi objective optimization framework and information content computations aid in quantifying field scale data worth in drainage studies the results showed how a 1d numerical model and a differential evolution algorithm performed in describing the field water balance the choice of the optimization target subsurface drain discharge and surface runoff impacted the simulation results more than parameter deviations while the information content of surface runoff data was higher than that of drain discharge drain discharge data contained more information on most of the soil parameters uncertainties related to groundwater outflow data which were not used in the optimization were higher than those of drain discharge and surface runoff a central weighing optimization scheme with two data types produced the best but still incomplete description of the field hydrology despite the modest model performance the results demonstrated how the choice of empirical data and optimization strategy can lead to uncertainties in drainage simulations and how the uncertainties can be assessed practically a low amount of information and a parameter sensitivity analysis can lead to a biased description of uncertainty related to such hydrological variables which are not used in the optimization benefits of the modeling framework were shown when assessing 1 model structure adequacy with the pareto front analysis 2 information content of different data types

optimization differential evolution pareto front identifiability 1 introduction assessing empirical data requirements for hydrological model analyses is an important part of conducting reliable simulations but such requirements are rarely quantified agricultural land drainage which has been studied for over a century jin and sands 2003 serves as a concrete example of a hydrological problem that has been widely studied using field measurements and simulation models however it is not clear what the best way to combine measurements with simulations is and what the implications of the related uncertainties are land drainage is currently facing new challenges due to changing climate and rival land uses improved understanding of data requirements can lead to more reliable hydrological impacts assessments in northern conditions drainage practices have traditionally been implemented in agricultural fields to provide optimal trafficability and soil moisture conditions for crop growth during wet spring and autumn periods e g blann et al 2009 however considering environmental impacts of agriculture e g tilman et al 2011 blann et al 2009 a drainage design also offers an opportunity to control environmental load generation sands et al 2015 skaggs et al 2005 mendez et al 2004 morrison et al 2013 skaggs and chescheir 2003 designing sustainable land drainage is among the measures to adapt to the climate change which is expected to increase the frequency of mild winter occurrence räisänen 2008 gillett et al 2003 and environmental loads to surface waters e g meier et al 2012 and thus to challenge the current drainage procedures while assessing hydrological processes by empirical means is a highly laborious and costly task combining numerical models with empirical data provides improved means to evaluate relevant processes different numerical modeling approaches e g de schepper et al 2017 turunen et al 2013 singh et al 2006 boivin et al 2006 have been previously developed and applied to describe hydrology of drained fields despite the advances in numerical modeling empirical data is inherently needed for model parameterization calibration and validation purposes silberstein 2006 estimation of empirical data requirements for a robust model assessment is often not systematized but assessed a priori by expert knowledge which inherently involves a degree of subjectivity the degree of subjectivity could be decreased by exploiting methodologies to quantify information content and worth of different observations with respect to the studied phenomena for example in earlier studies rozemeijer et al 2010 demonstrated the importance of drain discharge observations for model flow route simulations leaf 2017 further studied model data relations and showed how simulations could be applied to identify such observations which would reduce model predictive uncertainties the most also vrugt et al 2001 showed a methodology to quantify the information content of different observations the data worth of different observations could be further analyzed by calibrating a model against different data types one by one and assessing how accurately different hydrological variables can be reproduced based on a chosen data type the above quantitative methods offer approaches to identify hydrologically relevant data e g loritz et al 2018 and consequently to set a robust frame for the design of appropriate field scale measurement campaigns for simulation studies regarding drainage design studies the data worth of different observations has been rarely quantitatively assessed guillaume et al 2019 kikuchi 2017 moreover it has been recently suggested that information quantification could formulate a more robust and formally appropriate approach to provide model based knowledge as compared with traditional uncertainty analyses nearing and gupta 2018 nearing et al 2016 data worth analyses can be considered to be inherently different from widely applied sensitivity analyses nearing and gupta 2018 the implications of data worth analyses on practice oriented and concrete modeling cases such as land drainage would be worth studying this study aims to analyze how numerical modeling a multi objective optimization framework and information content analyses e g vrugt et al 2001 can be applied to quantitatively describe field scale data worth in the context of agricultural land drainage the studied data types include measured subsurface drain discharge and surface runoff time series drain discharge measurements are available from numerous research sites and they are more easily set up compared to surface runoff monitoring this study is motivated by the need to find out which one of these measurements is more valuable from the viewpoint of data worth 2 materials and methods 2 1 drained field site and empirical data the nummela experimental field is located in southern finland wgs84 60 51 59 n 23 25 50 e data of the

is flat with a slope of 1 the field was cultivated with oats and barley during the measurement campaigns preferential flowpaths dominate water flow in the clayey soil and allow relatively rapid drainage of the fields during rain storm and snowmelt events turunen et al 2015 turunen et al 2013 the field section c in turunen et al 2013 was initially subsurface drained in 1952 with a drain spacing of 16 m a drain depth of 1 m and an inner drain diameter of 0 05 m in june 2008 new supplementary drains were installed between the old drain lines resulting in a drain spacing of 8 m gravel was used as an envelope material and gravel deposits were installed every 7 m turunen et al 2013 vakkilainen et al 2010 the hydrology of the field section was monitored from may 2007 onwards thus the hydrological data was 11 years long the monitored hydrological variables used in the current study were subsurface drain discharge and surface runoff surface runoff was collected with gravel trenches depth 0 4 m to a subsurface drain pipe which conveyed the water to the measurement station at the station surface runoff and subsurface drain discharge were separately measured with datawater ws vertical helix meters maddalena povoletto italy at the pipe outlets the outflow variables were measured with a time resolution of 15 min the area of the monitored drain network was 1 7 ha and the area from which surface runoff was collected was 1 2 ha precipitation was measured on site with a time resolution of 15 min other meteorological variables air temperature air relative humidity and short wave radiation were available from a nearby 7 km from the site observatory of the finnish meteorological institute all data were aggregated into daily time steps for the simulations more detailed information on the site and the data is available in turunen et al 2013 and vakkilainen et al 2010 2 2 model the field hydrology was modeled using the hydrus model šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 due to its capability to describe preferential flow generation of subsurface drainage and surface runoff as well as other relevant hydrological processes in the snow affected nummela agricultural fields hydrus is a modular 1d process based model and its numerical solution is based on linear finite element schemes the vertical 1d model was assumed to provide a sufficient description of the flat nummela field e g salo et al 2015 li et al 2014 the time derivative is solved with a fully implicit discretization using the picard iterative solution scheme in this study the soil water flow was described with the dual porosity module of the model where the pore space is partitioned into mobile inter aggregate and immobile soil matrix regions 1 θ mo t x k h h x 1 s mo γ 2 θ im t s im γ where θmo and θim are the soil water content l3 l 3 in the mobile and immobile regions respectively x is the vertical spatial coordinate l k h is the hydraulic conductivity h is the pressure head l smo and sim are sink terms for the two regions t 1 and γ is the transfer rate of water from the mobile to immobile regions t 1 throughout the text the subscripts mo and im are used to refer to the mobile and immobile pore regions respectively water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were computed using the van genuchten 1980 schemes the water transfer between the two regions was described with the following equation 3 γ α h mo h im where α is the first order mass transfer coefficient l 1t 1 when the groundwater level was above the subsurface drain depth drain discharge was described as kroes et al 2008 4 q dr h dr γ drain where qdr is the drain discharge lt 1 hdr is the height of the watertable l above the drain depth at the midpoint between the drain lines and γ drain is the drain entrance resistance t which was calculated as 5 γ drain l dr 2 8 k hbot d eq 4 k htop h dr γ entr where ldr is the drain spacing l khbot and khtop are the horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivities lt 1 below and above the drain system respectively deq is the equivalent depth l and γ entr is the drain entrance resistance t deq was calculated with the method of van der molen and wesseling 1991 the impact of groundwater flow on the studied area was calculated using the equation of hopmans and stricker 1989 6 q gw a qh e x p b qh h b where qgw is the groundwater seepage flux lt 1 aqh lt 1 and bqh l 1 are empirical parameters and hb l is the depth of the water table below the surface of the simulated profile the seepage flux is assigned to the bottom node of the profile by simultaneously having both drain discharge and groundwater seepage processes active the model version differs from the standard model version of šimůnek et al 2008 the model describes snow accumulation by assuming that all precipitation is in the form of snow when the air temperature is lower than 2 c linear transition is set to control the form of snow between temperatures of 2 and 2 c all precipitation is considered to be in the liquid form for temperatures higher than 2 c snowmelt is described with a degree day approach where the snow layer melts proportionally to the air temperature greater than 0 c multiplied with a degree day coefficient d lt 1 evapotranspiration from the soil influences the layers within the root zone and is given as a precomputed time series turunen et al 2015 2 3 model application 2 3 1 modeling approach the data worth analysis was started with calibrating and validating the model against two data types drain discharge and surface runoff to assess the model performance for describing key hydrological processes in the studied site step 1 in fig 1 a in the second step the model was calibrated against one data type drain discharge or surface runoff at a time to assess how accurately the other data type can be predicted based on the calibration against one data type this approach was considered useful since it shows the boundaries of the possible pareto frontier in the model solution space e g madsen 2003 and can thus help to understand model data relations and data worth mertens et al 2006 in the third step the information content of the two data types with respect to different parameter was quantified based on prior and posterior parameter variations e g vrugt et al 2001 leaf 2017 this was done to compare how accurately different parameters can be identified based on a data type the combination of the above computations was assumed to give a reasonable understanding of model data relations and the results describe data worth in the current study fig 1a thereafter traditional parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess how the uncertainties related to the choice of data compare with the parameter sensitivity the modeling approach and the setup are described in more detail below in sections 2 3 2 2 3 6 and fig 1a 2 3 2 temporal data spatial discretization timestepping and boundary conditions since most water outflow at the study site occurs outside the growing seasons e g turunen et al 2015 two dormant season periods were chosen for the model application in this study the simulations were focused on two autumn winter spring periods with prevailing high north atlantic oscillation indices characterizing mild winters that are presumable typical of future winter conditions under climate warming e g gillett et al 2003 the periods were sep 2011 apr 2012 and sep 2014 apr 2015 for the model calibration and validation respectively computational time steps were set to vary between 0 00001 and 0 1 days in the simulations with the dynamic time stepping scheme of hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 spatially the field was described using a 2 m deep 1d profile that was discretized using a 0 02 m spacing system dependent boundary conditions were set at the top and bottom of the profile šimůnek et al 2008 at the top the atmospheric condition was controlled by precipitation evaporation and h at the soil surface at the bottom the boundary was described by the sum of eqs 4 and 6 drain discharge and groundwater seepage respectively a schematic presentation of the boundary conditions and key processes included in the model is shown in fig 1b 2 3 3 multi objective optimization the model was calibrated against multiple data types using the differential evolution algorithm the data type term refers to measurements of different hydrological phenomena the two data types in this study included cumulative surface runoff and drain discharge regarding the objective function the widely used root mean square error rmse was chosen to describe the difference between the simulated and observed time series fj l individual objective functions were formed by compensating differences in the magnitude of the two series by normalizing the rmse values by the standard deviation of the data nrmse and further by transforming the distance of the nrmses from the origin near the optimum e g köhne et al 2011 mertens et al 2006 madsen 2003 7 f j f j σ j φ j j 1 2 where fj is the individual objective function σ j is the standard deviation of the data l associated with f j φ j is the transformation constant and j denotes different objectives e g drain flow and surface runoff φ j was calculated as follows e g köhne et al 2011 mertens et al 2006 8 φ j max f 1 σ 1 f 2 σ 2 f j σ j j 1 2 the transformation constant keeps each individual objective function the same distance from the origin and thus balances their contributions in the aggregated objective function the actual aggregated objective function f agg was then formed by aggregating the individual objective functions following the central weighing scheme ocw mertens et al 2004 madsen 2003 9 f agg w f 1 1 w f 2 where w is the weighting coefficient which is given a value of 0 5 in the central weighing scheme 2 3 4 differential evolution the optimization was conducted with the metaheuristic differential evolution algorithm dea which is considered to be an effective global optimization method e g storn and price 1997 and has previously been successfully implemented in several hydrological modeling studies e g gurarslan and karahan 2015 ayvaz and gurarslan 2019 karterakis et al 2007 the dea starts by setting a number of candidate solutions in a model parameter space the algorithm considers each population member as a vector of parameters and evaluates the fitness of the population members with a given objective function eq 9 the search converges towards the global minimum by stochastically combining the parameters of population members by adding weighed differences between two population vectors to a third vector if the resulting vector has a lower objective function value than a chosen older parent vector the new vector replaces the old vector thus the population members self organize towards the global minimum there are numerous different approaches to apply the dea e g storn and price 1997 in the current study the so called de rand 1 bin storn and price 1997 strategy is applied following gurarslan and karahan 2015 the approach is presented shortly below in the algorithm a mutant vector vi g 1 is created for each population parent vector pi g during each generation 10 v i g 1 p r 1 g f p r 2 g p r 3 g r 1 r 2 r 3 i where i r1 r2 and r3 denote randomly selected vectors among the population f is the mutation factor and g is the generation number the parent vector pi g and the mutant vector vi g 1 are merged into a trial vector ui g 1 parameter wise as follows 11 u i k g 1 v i k g 1 i f r c r o r k r k p i k g o t h e r w i s e where uik g 1 is the resulting trial vector parameter k is the parameter index in a vector r 0 1 is a random number cr 0 1 is the crossover parameter and rk is a randomly selected index a new r is generated for each k but rk is common for each k of the trial vector thus rk ensures that at least one parameter is obtained from the mutant vector the trial vector ui g 1 replaces the parent vector p i g if the objective function value of the trial vector equals or is lower than the value of the parent in the current study the algorithm was set to stop when the standard deviation of the population objective function values was lower than 1 of the mean population objective function value the parameters f and cr were set to the value of 0 8 following gurarslan and karahan 2015 different population numbers 20 40 and 60 were tested to address their impact on the optimization results the population number had practically no impact on the results and the population number of 40 was used in the optimizations initialization of the population was performed using the latin hypercube sampling non convergent simulations were given a very high objective function value also since running a successful simulation typically took only a couple of seconds simulations taking more than 30 s were aborted and considered non convergent following brunetti et al 2016 2 3 5 model setup and calibrated parameters the spatial domain of the model was set to consist of five soil horizons with distinct soil properties 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 1 0 and 1 0 2 0 m the soil hydraulic parameters for the soil matrix immobile zone were derived from turunen et al 2015 as listed in table 1 based on previous studies in clayey fields in southern finland it was assumed that in addition to the soil hydraulic parameters in table 1 water flow in the field was mostly controlled by the hydraulic properties of the macropore system the parameters of the subsurface drainage system and the parameters controlling groundwater outflow from the field warsta et al 2013 turunen et al 2013 eight parameters were chosen to describe these features and plausible parameter value ranges were identified from the literature the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the mobile zone was computed as a product of a conductivity multiplier ksat mul l t 1 and θs mo table 1 following warsta et al 2013 and larsbo and jarvis 2003 the calibration parameters and their ranges are given in table 2 the van genuchten shape parameters for the mobile zone were adopted from gärdenäs et al 2006 2 3 6 data worth and sensitivity to assess uncertainties related to the possibly pareto optimized solution the model was also optimized separately against the discharge data type odr and the runoff data type or i e by setting φ to 0 eq 7 and w to 0 or 1 eq 9 when optimizing against drainage or surface runoff data respectively the purpose of the analysis was to explore the pareto front extremes and consequently to analyze how weighing of individual objective functions affected the solution e g madsen 2003 to further analyze the role of two different calibration data types in the model optimization and model data interactions their information content was analyzed similarly as by vrugt et al 2001 12 ic m p 1 σ p m σ p where icm p is information content of measurement m regarding parameter p σ p m is the standard deviation of parameter p in the accepted behavioral simulations with respect to measurement m and σ p is the standard deviation of the parameter in the initial parameter ranges thus an icm p value close to one indicates that the information content of measurement m regarding parameter p is high an icm p value near zero indicates a low information content information contents were analyzed with a simulation test where the parameter ranges were set as in table 2 then 80 000 simulations were conducted using the latin hypercube approach and such simulations which had the nrmse 1 0 were considered behavioral in the information content calculation eq 12 the sensitivity of the solution optimized with ocw the central weighing scheme to parameter deviations was assessed with a global sensitivity analysis where the calibrated parameters were altered by 10 the model realizations were conducted using the latin hypercube monte carlo sampling following brunetti et al 2016 5000 realizations per parameter were assumed to be sufficient to reasonably explore the model parameter space thus the analysis was conducted with 40 000 8 parameters and 5000 realizations model runs 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation the dea optimization resulted in nrmse of 0 19 and 0 18 for drain discharge and surface runoff respectively after 81 831 model realizations fig 2 the resulting model parameters are given in table 3 the optimum is located at the sharp edge of the model solution space blue circle in fig 2 the pareto front was found to be unsymmetrical with considerably longer euclidean distance between the optimum of ocw and odr dark green circle in fig 2 than between ocw and or light green circle in fig 2 the measured and simulated cumulative drain discharge and surface runoff for the calibration and validation periods are illustrated in fig 3 with the corresponding evaluation criteria other key water balance components were evapotranspiration 71 mm groundwater outflow 37 mm and soil water storage change 19 mm thus drain discharge was clearly the dominant water balance component during the simulation the groundwater table depth fluctuated between the soil surface and the depth of 1 4 m the validation results were qualitatively similar to the calibration results but the model overestimated drain discharge and underestimated surface runoff fig 3 3 2 sensitivity and information content analyses simulation results can be considered to be rather conservative with respect to parameter deviations since in qualitative terms they do not cause pronounced changes in the distribution of the two water balance components fig 4 simulation results were found to be less sensitive to parameter deviations than to the choice of the optimization objective fig 4 i e to the choice between the extremes of the pareto front as shown in fig 2 regarding the impact of the optimization approach i e odr or ocw on outflow components the accumulated surface runoff for odr differed by 63 mm from the one for ocw cumulative drain discharge for or differed by 28 mm from the one for ocw similarly differences in simulated groundwater outflow were considerable for different optimization approaches i e groundwater outflow was 37 mm for ocw 126 mm for odr and 8 mm for or differences in the parameters controlling the amount of groundwater outflow i e aqh and bqh in table 3 explained differences in the amount of simulated groundwater outflow regarding the information content of the different observations the mean icm p values for all parameters were 0 05 and 0 19 for odr and or respectively the number of converged realizations with the nrmse below the threshold of 1 0 was 43 603 and 540 for odr and or respectively the monte carlo process was considered to converge based on the mean information content and outflow values shown in fig 5 regarding individual parameters the icm p values are shown in table 4 the results showed that the surface runoff data type contained more information for θs mo 1 aqh and γ entr than drain discharge data type while the drain discharge data contained more information for remaining parameters than surface runoff data the information content was the highest regarding aqh and γ entr when the surface runoff objective was used and regarding bqh when the drain discharge objective was used information contents were lowest regarding ksat mul θs mo 2 i and α note that parameter ranges of accepted simulations were relatively wide table 4 vs table 2 4 discussion model optimization with the differential evolution algorithm central weighing scheme and the two objectives resulted in a reasonable reproduction of the measured variables but there were periods with a clear mismatch more often during validation than calibration the mismatch partly indicates epistemic uncertainties such as meteorological data inconsistent with hydrological measurements or limited knowledge of system dynamics while epistemic uncertainties are difficult to quantify e g beven 2016 data worth of the partly incompletely measured variables is the remaining question which our analysis aimed to answer the sharp edge of the pareto front fig 2 indicated that optimizations with two objectives did not induce a significant decrease in the goodness of a single objective optimum such an ability to simultaneously optimize two objectives is an indication of an adequate model structure regarding simulations of studied phenomena mertens et al 2006 the euclidean distance between the optimum and the origin indicates the magnitude of modeling and measurement error which can be considered small compared with the variance of the data fig 2 the applied multi objective framework can be used to partly demonstrate the adequacy of a model structure the value of the approach is highlighted by the fact that such an assessment is practically impossible with a traditional model calibration validation framework optimization with only one objective led to a reasonable description of that variable but to uncertainties regarding other studied variables rozemeijer et al 2010 showed how drain discharge data could be more important than groundwater level data when simulating water outflow pathway contributions our results further pointed out that when optimizing surface runoff or it was possible to estimate drain discharge slightly more accurately than it was to estimate surface runoff when optimizing drain discharge odr fig 4 on the other hand optimization with the surface runoff objective or resulted in an unreasonably low 8 mm estimate of groundwater outflow as compared with earlier studies on the site turunen et al 2015 turunen et al 2013 this distinction was also reflected in the overestimation of simulated drain discharge in the or scheme in the current study only the central weighing scheme resulted in a reasonable description of all considered outflow fluxes regarding model outputs relatively high uncertainties in data types not used in model calibration were previously reported by højberg and refsgaard 2005 in a groundwater simulation study intensive field scale data sets with various hydrological data types could be analyzed with the current approach to show how accurately different variables can be predicted based on another variable in other words the approach can practically help quantify the worth of different data and consequently to identify which data is relevant for a hydrological analysis the simulations further showed how a model framework could be set up to quantify differences in information contents of different data types the information content of surface runoff observations was higher than that of drain discharge observations however regarding parameters describing soil hydraulic properties ksat mul θs mo 1 θs mo 2 l and α rather than sink term properties the information content of drain discharge was typically higher than that of surface runoff table 4 it is noteworthy that the absolute values of information content were affected by the choice of parameter ranges which also typically involve subjectivity despite their physical meaning e g beven and binley 1992 however the information content analysis facilitated a quantitative comparison between different data types practically the approach can help a modeler to understand how much uncertainty is reflected in the model parameters when the model is optimized against a chosen data type it is also possible that surface runoff simulations and surface runoff observations measured with a 0 4 m deep trench were not entirely commensurable if seepage from the soil entered the trench in addition to the runoff from the field surface thus the information content analysis may include such epistemic uncertainties the computational concept could be further applied to study information contents during a range of different periods as the nature of data worth can be partially dynamic loritz et al 2018 vrugt et al 2001 for example during growing seasons when groundwater outflow dominates the total outflow e g turunen et al 2013 it is likely that data types describing subsurface hydrological observations have higher information content than for example surface runoff this points out the importance of considering the timing of monitoring periods when conducting a data worth analysis the information content analysis also showed how much different data types contained information about different parameters the highest difference between the two data types was found in the parameters controlling groundwater outflow and drainage resistance unexpectedly the surface runoff data constrained the range of the drainage resistance values considerably more than the drain discharge data since the saturation excess mechanism triggering surface runoff generation requires high subsurface moisture conditions which are largely controlled by drainage this mechanism also pointed out the coupling between the surface and subsurface domains and partly exemplified why both studied data types contain information about each other the parameter ranges of the single objective optimizations table 4 were rather wide which implied considerable non uniqueness in those solutions the non uniqueness and possible noise in empirical data explain why it can be difficult to identify a plausible model with only one objective due to possible small inaccuracies in input or calibration data it can be practically impossible to identify the most plausible model from many rather similarly performing model realizations fig 2 however increasing the number of data types in the simulation can narrow down the model solution space fig 2 model ensemble approaches can be argued to be often a necessity for reliable model assessments for decision making e g ferré 2017 information quantification of a data type can help identify the limits of model predictions which can be considered to be an inherently different approach than a parameter sensitivity analysis e g nearing and gupta 2018 our results provided a practical demonstration of how relatively low amounts of information and a parameter sensitivity analysis can lead to a biased description of uncertainty related to such hydrological variables which are not used in the optimization fig 4 information on the studied parameters could be more efficiently extracted from temporal data series by identifying such data subsets containing the most information for one of the parameters vrugt et al 2001 while this study assessed model uncertainty on the field scale it is suggested that studying the data worth of widely available hydrological satellite data e g xu et al 2014 combined with simple terrestrial observations could facilitate the assessment of the reliability of drainage related modelling on a larger scale overall our data worth analysis showed how the modeling framework could be used to assess 1 adequacy of the model structure with the pareto front analysis 2 information content of different data types regarding different parameters and 3 uncertainties related to simulating hydrological variables based on optimization against a given data type according to kikuchi 2017 such a quantitative approach can be considered as a formal data worth analysis as compared with more widely conducted informal analyses which are based on expert judgement as pointed out by kikuchi 2017 and guillaume et al 2019 data worth analyses are relatively rarely conducted despite their potential benefits our study demonstrated the benefits in the context of drainage and field scale studies 5 conclusions the numerical simulations combined with the field scale hydrological data demonstrated how the multi objective optimization framework information content computations and the pareto front analysis could be beneficial for drainage studies and designs of empirical monitoring campaigns their benefits were demonstrated when assessing 1 model structure adequacy with the pareto front analysis 2 information content of different data types regarding different parameters and 3 uncertainties related to simulating hydrological variables based on optimization against a given data type it was shown how the choice of the empirical data and optimization strategy had a larger impact on simulation results than parameter deviations in the model sensitivity analysis the information content of the surface runoff data was higher than that of subsurface drain discharge when different optimization strategies were compared the highest uncertainties were related to those data which were not used in any of the optimization approaches practically a low amount of information and a parameter sensitivity analysis can lead to a biased description of uncertainty related to such hydrological variables which are not used in the optimization the central weighing scheme with two available data types resulted in the best but still incomplete description of the field hydrology pointing out epistemic uncertainties in a wider context the quantitative modeling framework could be applied to map the data worth of a wide range of different data types to evaluate what types of data are required to

5459,river discharge carries suspended matter into lakes reservoirs estuaries and coasts resulting in obvious plumes in river mouths river plumes are more likely to form in valley reservoirs due to the steep slopes in the basin which may accelerate fluvial transport from upstream to the river mouth causing a considerable particles load and increasing the appearance times and scale of river plumes during rainfall events information on the intensity and evolution of river plumes in valley reservoirs has important implications for understanding nearshore geomorphological processes and dynamics in the water quality surrounding river mouths taking the xin anjing reservoir a typical deep valley reservoir as a case study a plume index based on the relative reflectance height in the red band of hj 1 a b images was first proposed subsequently we used seventeen hj 1 a b images during 10 heavy rainfall events from 2009 to 2014 to characterize the spatial temporal variability in river plumes and illustrate the relation of the river plumes and total suspended matter tsm concentration to the amount of rainfall the results indicated that 10 heavy rainfall events caused different plume areas varying from 41 26 to 148 12 km2 with an average area of 76 45 35 03 km2 significant positive correlations were observed between plume areas tsm concentrations and rainfall amount p 0 005 the plumes would simultaneously emerge when the rapid surface flow reached the river mouth but increase to the maximum size after 2 3 days of these heavy rainfalls these results confirmed that the hj 1 a b images combined with our proposed plume index could detect and monitor the formation and diffusion of river plumes in valley reservoirs during heavy rainfall events keywords xin anjiang river hj 1 a b river plume heavy rainfall event 1 introduction a river plume generally carries high concentrations of suspended matter nutrients heavy metals and organic contaminants teodoro et al 2008 bourgeois et al 2011 which can significantly affect the physical processes nutrient dynamics and biogeochemical structure of the upper layer of a reservoir and limit underwater light availability white et al 2009 the specific effects can be considered from the following four aspects 1 elevated nutrient concentrations from agricultural industrial and domestic effluents greatly modify the nutrient concentrations in the plume region and thus increase the occurrence of harmful algal blooms jones et al 2002 2 high total suspended matter tsm in the river plume affects the underwater light field distribution phytoplankton biomass primary production and community distribution ondrusek et al 2012 3 tsm load accompanied by trace metals fertilizers and pesticides from the river mouth affect the biogeochemical characteristics of water and thus affect the growth of aquatic organisms and human health kannan et al 2012 moreno madriñán et al 2015 the traditional in situ measurements are impossible to accurately monitor the river plume because its formation development and disappearance zawada et al 2007 previous studies showed that the numerical simulation methods could be used to predict the geometry and dynamic development of the river plume with large scale for example nekouee et al 2015a 2015b monitored nearshore behavior of river plumes in lake michigan by using 3d hydrodynamic model and particle tracking model however the models required numerous parameters as inputs such as the wind temperature dew point cloud cover boundary conditions etc limiting their applications to capturing of plume information in contrast remote sensing technology could provide frequent large scale views and has been widely used to track the spatial temporal variation of river plumes in lakes and coastal waters nezlin et al 2005 characterized the dynamics and concluded the driving factors of river plumes with sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs data in the san pedro shelf california teodoro et al 2008 estimated the plume size based on segmentation techniques from a medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris image in the douro river portuguese lahet and stramski 2010 used threshold values based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data to extract turbid plumes and demonstrate the formation and evolution of the plume in association with rainstorm events in the coastal waters of southern california guneroglu et al 2013 proposed an automatic method to detect and monitor coastal plume zones with landsat data in the south eastern black sea zhang et al 2016 used a spatial autocorrelation method to extract river plumes from modis images and explored the formation mechanism of river plumes in lake taihu china hamidi et al 2017 have empirically developed a model based on modis images to map water turbidity and tsm in the southern green bay of lake michigan and defined the plume region with a threshold of tsm 5 mg l however as far as we know there is no study on river plume evolution or the effect on tsm dynamics with remote sensing technology in valley reservoirs the valley reservoirs are usually surrounded by mountains and characterized by small water surface and narrow river mouths the mainstream satellites such as seawifs modis meris and landsat data cannot capture the plume evolution of valley reservoirs either due to low temporal resolution or low spatial resolution the xin anjiang reservoir is a typical deep valley reservoir that serves as the drinking sources of approximately ten million people the annual inflow from the main inflow river xin anjiang river ranges from approximately 32 108 m3 to 119 108 m3 heavy rainfall carries a large amount of tsm accompanied by large quantity of nutrients micropollutants heavy metals and organic matter into the xin anjiang reservoir which may increase the number and scale of algal blooms in our previous study we used hj 1a b data 30 m spatial resolution and 2 day revisit time to develop an empirical model for tsm estimation and achieved the spatial temporal mapping of tsm in the reservoir zhang et al 2019 in this paper a plume index based on hj 1a b data was proposed to monitor the formation and dispersal process of the river plume and explore its effect on tsm concentration associated with heavy rainfall specifically the procedures consist of 1 automatically identifying the river plume from ambient water masses using a plume index 2 analyzing the spatial characteristics of the plume area during heavy rainfall events and 3 determining the relationship between the river plume areas tsm and rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 in situ collection and lab analysis we conducted two field campaigns during july 30 to august 1 2014 and august 19 21 2016 each campaign collected 60 water samples to measure tsm concentration and in situ recorded water turbidity fig 1 in addition real time series turbidity was measured at jiekou station fig 1 located in xin anjiang river during the period from december 13 2015 to june 12 2016 at 25 second interval the water turbidity was measured with a ysi exo2 multiparameter sonde exo2 yellow springs oh at a depth of 0 5 m beneath the water surface water samples 2 5 5 0 l were collected at a depth of 0 5 m beneath the water surface all samples were stored in a dark and cool container for transport to the laboratory and then filtered through a 0 7 um pores whatman gf f filters the concentration of tsm was determined by weighing zhang et al 2016 since the high frequency tsm is deficient in this study a strong relationship between tsm and turbidity was constructed to estimate high frequency tsm from measured real time turbidity data eq 1 fig s1 the high frequency tsm

resolution and short revisit interval make the data as the best candidate for monitoring short term and regional hydrological phenomena such as river plumes from hydrological events and tsm transport in the upstream part of the river to avoid the effect of cloud and water vapor on plume detection and tsm estimation moreno madriñán et al 2010 hamidi et al 2017 the images covered with cloud or obtained on immediate day after heavy rainfall event were not used in this study in this study 17 hj 1 a b images in the 10 heavy rainfall events were used for developing plume detection method and another 4 images in 4 heavy rainfall events were used to validate the performance of the method the empirical algorithm based on blue green and red bands of hj 1 a b images zhang et al 2019 was used to estimate the tsm concentration of xin anjiang reservoir in this study detailed description including radiometric calibration atmospheric correction model construction and validation and mapping of the spatial temporal distribution of the tsm was reported in our previous study zhang et al 2019 2 4 heavy rainfall events in this study 10 heavy rainfall events from 2009 to 2014 were selected for detection of the river plume from the hj 1 a b data the accumulated rainfall of seven days before image has been used as an effective factor to analyze its effect on plume size in gaoping river taiwan chung et al 2014 we also used the accumulated rainfall of seven days before image to explore the formation mechanism of river plumes in xin anjiang reservoir in this study 17 hj 1 a b images are examined in the 10 heavy rainfall events and three images gathered after the events were also pre rainfall images of the following events table 1 qian et al 2007 proposed 25 and 50 mm day as benchmarks for large rain and rainstorms respectively however an accumulated rainfall of seven days more than 25 mm has created apparent river plumes in xin anjiang reservoir fig s2 to better understand the influence of different grades of rainfall on the plume we classified strong rainfall into three grades 25 mm rainfall 50 mm heavy rainfall 50 mm rainfall 80 mm rainstorm and rainfall 80 mm heavy rainstorm 2 5 statistical analysis and accuracy assessment a statistical analysis was performed in spss 22 0 the r 2 was fit through the least squares method in matlab r2012a the spatial temporal distribution of the sampling sites and plume related parameters were mapped using arcgis 10 2 software the results with p 0 05 were reported to be significant in the t tests and linear regression analyses the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and the normalized root mean square error nrmse were used to characterize the accuracy of estimated tsm from turbidity 2 mre

estimated and measured tsm values and n is the number of values included in the calculation 3 results 3 1 development of method for plume detection using hj 1 a b images the river plumes were distinguished from the surrounding waters by their high tsm concentrations several studies have shown that the red band near 660 nm is beneficial for deriving tsm in turbid water nechad et al 2010 loisel et al 2014 previous study has shown that relative height method based on linear baseline drawn between two points on the either side of a sensitive wavelength has obvious advantage in magnifying the signal from high concentration of optical matters and thus distinguishing them from surrounding waters hu 2009 le et al 2016 therefore we choose 660 nm of hj 1 a b data as sensitive wavelength and built a plume index pi based on relative height method to distinguish the river plume from surrounding waters the pi is defined as the difference between r rs 660 and r rs 660 where r rs 660 is defined as a linear expression formed by r rs 560 and r rs 835 5 pi r rs 660 r rs 660 6 r rs 660 r rs 835 660 835 560 835 r rs 560 r rs 835 to define the threshold of pi in distinguishing river plumes from the surrounding waters we generate three datasets of reflectance from the 17 selected hj 1 a b images in the 10 heavy rainfall events fig 2 datasets i ii and iii were generated from the non plume region pixels the plume region pixels before rainfall and the plume region pixels after rainfall respectively in dataset i the plume water should have a reflectance that is larger than the maximum value in the red band fig 3 a in dataset ii the plume water should also have a reflectance that is larger than the maximum value in the red band fig 3b however in dataset iii the plume water should have a reflectance that is larger than the minimum and lower than the maximum value in the red band fig 3c therefore the threshold of pi in distinguishing river plumes from the surrounding waters could be defined as follows 7 dataset i pi 0 5 ave g ave nir min r or pi 0 5 ave g ave nir max r 8 dataset ii pi 0 5 ave g ave nir min r or pi 0 5 ave g ave nir max r 9 dataset iii pi min r 0 5 ave g ave nir and pi max r 0 5 ave g ave nir where max r min r ave g and ave nir are the maximum reflectance in the red band minimum reflectance in the red band averaged reflectance in the green band and averaged reflectance in the near infrared band a convolution operation was used to remove the discrete points which involved computation of the pixel neighbor median defined as follows 10 g m e d i a n x i where g is the result i is the number of pixels in an adjacent 3 3 window and xi is the contiguous variables of interest from eqs 7 9 we determined the pi threshold for the river plumes from the surrounding waters as 0 062 pi 0 016 we used another four hj 1 a b images in 4 heavy rainfall events to validate the performance of pi the derived tsm from the previously developed model showed a significantly higher value 5 63 1 51 mg l for plume waters than that of clear water 2 34 0 73 mg l fig 4 in addition both the plume and clear water pixels have pi values lower than 0 016 and the plume and clear water pixels were distributed on both sides of the threshold 0 062 which indicated that pi method with a threshold of 0 062 could effectively differentiate plume water from surrounding clear water 3 2 variation in plume distance and area the pi method was applied to 17 selected hj 1 a b images to derive the plume region from the surrounding water among the 10 selected heavy rainfall events the farthest distance of river plume dispersion from site 19 is 13 34 km the plume area was 41 26 148 12 km2 with an average area of 76 45 35 03 km2 table 1 the hj 1 a b images of the fuqiangxi river and wuqiangxi river which also feed the xin anjiang reservoir had minimal or no obvious plume detection indicating low discharge into the reservoir from these rivers the plume features during the heaviest rainfall 428 3 mm on february 21 march 18 2010 were specifically characterized in this study four hj 1 a b images show the detailed formation and evolution process of this river plume with one image before the strongest rainfall event february 21 2010 and three images after the strongest rainfall event march 11 12 and 18 2010 on february 21 no plume was detected in the hj 1 a b image fig 5 a the river plume peaked on march 11 2010 when the discharge values of the xin anjiang river were very high for this heavy rainfall event the tsm concentration exceeded 6 45 mg l even as far as 13 34 km offshore in the northeast direction a significant plume with a plume area of 148 12 km2 was also evident fig 5b on march 12 2010 3 days after this rainfall termination march 9 the detected plume area decreased from 148 12 km2 to 76 41 km2 and the river plume distance also showed a significant decline fig 5c the same situation occurred on march 18 2010 three days after the end of a 2 day heavy rainfall event march 14 15 where the accumulated rainfall was 76 2 mm the tsm concentration was lower than 6 45 mg l in areas located more than 8 km away from site 19 the river plume reveals the same northeast dispersion along the shoreline with an area of 104 26 km2 significant positive linear correlations were observed between the rainfall amount and plume area in ten rainfall events fig 6 a when the correlation analysis was performed with exclusion of the two largest plume areas march 11 2010 with total rainfall 160 mm march 18 2010 with a daily rainfall of 60 mm a highly significant positive relationship was still observed fig 6b further analyses were performed to reveal the rainfall effect on the plume area by calculating the ratio of plume area to rainfall the results showed that the average ratio was 0 95 0 54 km2 mm for the plume area 3 3 tsm variations related to river plume three heavy rainfall events on march 10 2009 rainfall 25 9 mm march 18 2010 rainfall 76 2 mm and march 11 2010 rainfall 168 2 mm were chose to analyze the relationships between tsm concentrations and distances to the open water we chose these three heavy rainfall events considering two key factors 1 the three rainfall events on march 10 2009 march 18 2010 and march 11 2010 could be effectively used to analyze the effect of rainfall with different gradations on the river plume and 2 the three rainfall events occurred in the same month with the same phenological vegetation characteristics in the surface soil which ensure consistent tsm loading at the watershed scale after rainfall events on march 10 2009 the tsm concentrations at sites 10 and 11 of the xin anjiang river were 6 28 and 6 75 mg l respectively from the mouth of the xin anjiang river to the open area the tsm decreased from 6 75 mg l at site 11 to 4 01 mg l at site 18 reflecting the gradual dilution and sedimentation with the surrounding water fig 7 a shows that the tsm value agrees with the distance to the river mouth with highly significant positive linear relationships r 2 0 74 p 0 001 on march 18 2010 the tsm concentrations of sites 10 and 11 in the xin anjiang river were as high as 6 43 and 7 01 mg l respectively from the mouth of the xin anjiang river to the open area the tsm value decreased from 6 40 mg l to 4 45 mg l from site 12 to site 18 fig 7b shows that the tsm concentration also agreed with the distance to the river mouth with highly significant positive linear relationships r 2 0 89 p 0 001 however on march 11 2010 the tsm concentration deviated significantly from the distance to the river mouth fig 7c this may attribute to few depositions of suspended matter from upstream to the river mouth due to rapid flow during the heaviest rainfall a contrastive analysis of tsm values before and after the 10 selected heavy rainfalls indicated the significant effect of heavy rainfalls on tsm concentration and distributions in the xin anjiang river table 1 for the 10 selected heavy rainfall events the mean tsm of 3 67 1 34 mg l before the heavy rainfall was significantly lower than the mean value of 6 61 1 03 mg l after the heavy rainfall in the river plume reflecting a large amount of tsm import from the xin anjiang river after the heavy rainfalls however different variation trends in tsm concentration were observed for the 10 selected heavy rainfall events which reflected the interaction between the tsm import dilution and sedimentation for example the tsm increased from 2 95 mg l on february 21 2009 to 6 51 mg l on march 10 2009 and further to 6 87 mg l on march 14 2009 the tsm increased from 2 43 mg l on february 21 2010 to 7 48 mg l on march 10 2010 in addition the tsm value increased from 5 36 mg l on april 23 2012 to 8 09 mg l on april 26 2012 in contrast during one of the rainfalls the tsm decreased from 7 48 mg l on march 11 2010 to 5 24 mg l on march 12 2010 which reflected the interaction between the tsm sedimentation and dilution with surrounding water table 1 the different variation trends in tsm after the 10 selected heavy rainfall events revealed different hydrological processes for the earlier 1 3 days after heavy rainfall the tsm value increased rapidly due to the large inflow from the upstream but then decreased in the latter 4 5 days as a result of tsm sedimentation and dilution with the surrounding water we further analyzed the relationships between rainfall amount and the mean tsm of the river plume after heavy rainfall significant positive linear correlations were observed between the rainfall amount and mean tsm of the plume fig 8 except for march 12 2010 when the interaction of the tsm sedimentation and dilution with the surrounding water disrupted this relationship but the high tsm in the plume was also significantly affected by the rainfall amount in this case 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the pi method in this work we performed the identification characterization and analysis of the xin anjiang river plume based on the 17 selected hj 1 a b images from 2009 to 2014 the 30 m spatial resolution and 4 day temporal resolution for the hj 1 a b data make it feasible to track short term and regional hydrological phenomena e g river discharge heavy rainfall and relate them to the shape and size of the river plume to characterize its erosional depositional processes an automatic method was proposed to detect the river plume in the selected hj 1 a b images traditionally the detection of river plumes is highly influenced by subjective consciousness in our study we detect the river plume automatically from the surrounding clear water in two steps 1 primary extraction of the plume region by calculating a pi with hj 1 a b images and 2 removing the discrete points through convolution operation the pi of tracking the xin anjiang river plume in the first step is based on the difference between the optical properties of the river plume and surrounding water in fact the pi represents the relative reflectance height of the red band fig 3 the reflectance in the red band is sensitive to water quality tsm transparency in turbid lakes reservoirs and coastal water and there are many studies estimating water tsm and transparency with satisfactory accuracy based on the red band reflectance dekker and peters 1993 olmanson et al 2008 wu et al 2009 mancino et al 2009 dona et al 2014 shi et al 2015 hou et al 2017 therefore the pi provided in this study is reasonably sensitive to turbid plume water in the xin anjiang reservoir in addition the pi method is also applied for plume extraction in lake poyanghu based on landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli data fig s3 to check the potential application the extracted plume region corresponded well with that in the rgb raw image however the threshold of pi may need a slight adjustment for other waters with different optical properties in this study other methods were also used to detect river plumes based on image processing these include region based methods teodoro et al 2008 and single optical parameter e g suspended matter organic matter or chla methods shi and wang 2009 however these methods performed with low accuracy and could not correctly isolate the river plume pixels from the pixels of the surrounding water similarly zhang et al 2016 found that a high concentration of tsm distinguishes the river plume from the surrounding waters and they successfully used a spatial autocorrelation method to extract the plumes from modis images by computing the differences in tsm values between a selected pixel and its neighbors the limitation of this method is that it relies on precise retrieval of tsm an alternative method based on the difference in optical properties between river plumes and surrounding water is provided in this paper which combines the effects of multiple optically active substances to detect river plumes in addition the subtraction form in eqs 5 6 makes the pi algorithm more stable in the face of an imperfect atmospheric correction than other methods le et al 2016 in the second step we use convolution operation eq 10 to remove the discrete points of the river plume in the hj 1 a b reflectance images this elimination of float pixels or remaining clouds gives the best boundaries of the xin anjiang river plume 4 2 factors affecting the plumes many studies have suggested that rainfall within the watershed of a study area determines the plume area in lakes or reservoirs nezlin et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 in the xin anjiang reservoir significant positive correlations were observed between i rainfall amount and plume areas fig 6 and ii rainfall amount and tsm concentrations fig 8 which may provide an alternative method to predict plume area and tsm from rainfall data the general plume characteristics of the mississippi river revealed from seawifs nezlin et al 2008 and the spatial temporal development of the tokachi river plume from seawifs lihan et al 2008 agree with the results of our study heavy rainfall did not immediately result in the maximum size of the river plume rather there is a lag period in our study the maximum flow rate occurred within one day mean lag time among the 10 heavy rainfall events in table 2 after the heavy rainfall fig 9 a the plumes emerged once the rapid surface flow reached the river mouth but increased to the maximum size 2 3 days after these heavy rainfall events nezlin et al 2008 conducted a similar study in southern california finding that the plumes increased to the maximum size 1 2 days after the heavy rainfall events watershed size land use type land topography elevation soil conditions and other factors likely affect the length of the lag in the xin anjiang river the natural watershed released its water and tsm into the reservoir more slowly than the urbanized watershed of the ventura and santa clara rivers which have channelized flow similarly a gap period for the water from released the urbanized watershed of tampa bay florida can be deduced from the increasing turbidity in the bay water with more days after heavy rainfall events moreno madriñán et al 2012 generally the river discharge is positively related to rainfall and thus the river discharges similarly affect the tsm concentration of the river plumes nezlin et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 in the xin anjiang river the observed tsm and daily inflow rate show a similar tendency on march 11 2016 the larger daily flow rate 544 m3 s causes a larger observed tsm 11 51 mg l similarly the other three larger flow rates on april 9 2016 april 22 2016 may 12 2016 caused a higher tsm concentration in the xin anjiang river fig 9b the vegetation coverage near the xin anjiang river reacts like a sponge and partly absorbs the surface runoff after heavy rainfall the rest of the runoff carried tsm organic matter and chemicals into river systems causing a significant increase in tsm concentration 4 3 application and future improvement ship based surveys suffer from limitations due to strong winds and the risks of navigating in rainfall making it challenging to detect plume boundaries or observe the propagational and extensional direction of river plumes the cloud free hj 1 a b images over the xin anjiang reservoir are not continuous every day heavy rainfall events are often accompanied by windy or stormy weather with high cloud coverage and high discharge values the 10 selected cloud free images after heavy rainfalls are within the decreasing discharge periods following flood peaks similar limitations also applied to the in situ measurements and previous remote observations for both small plumes in the southern california bight nezlin et al 2008 taihu zhang et al 2016 and large plumes in the mississippi d sa and miller 2003 amazon vecchio and subramaniam 2004 and columbia laurs 1990 as windy or stormy weather decreases the accuracy and quality of sampling data therefore the xin anjiang river plumes are not characterized throughout heavy rainfall events in this study and the maximum river plume area or maximal tsm concentrations in the plume may be underestimated despite these climatic limitations hj 1 a b images still provide frequent and regional overviews of the xin anjiang river plume these images allowed us to calculate important information about plume size and direction and the spatial risk of exposure from turbid upstream waters to the xin anjiang reservoir for the first time however further improvements are needed first increasing the number of satellites may increase the possibility of catching the development and extension process of the river plume second a higher spatial and temporal resolution would be better for characterizing smaller geographical and short term hydrological phenomena third proxies should also be developed to establish the relationship between the optical properties of river plumes and relevant physical and ecological parameters finally detailed explanations should be carried out to illustrate the relationship among the seasonal precipitation plume features and evolving global climate and thus the plume features of the xin anjiang river can be completely monitored 5 conclusions to derive the plume area from the ambient water masses and understand the spatial temporal variability in the xin anjiang river plume associated with rainstorms a pi for detecting river plumes from hj 1 a b images was proposed the method was based on the relative reflectance height of the red band in hj 1 a b images which could effectively detect the plume area and may be widely applied to other studies the significant positive correlations between plume areas tsm concentrations and the rainfall amount may provide an alternative method to predict plume area and tsm from rainfall data in the xin anjiang reservoir a total rainfall more than 25 mm will create an apparent river plume and a lag period exists between the heavy rainfall and the river plume area the maximum inflow rate occurred within one day after the heavy rainfall rapid inflow from upstream led to the occurrence of plumes and a maximum size formed 2 3 days after these heavy rainfall events these results confirmed that the hj 1 a b images can serve as effective way to monitor the formation evolution process of small plumes in valley reservoirs during heavy rainfall events however further improvements are needed to reveal the link between the optical properties of river plumes and relevant physical and ecological parameters by combining higher spatial temporal resolution images in situ water parameters and appropriate inversion models credit authorship contribution statement yibo zhang conceptualization methodology writing

5459,river discharge carries suspended matter into lakes reservoirs estuaries and coasts resulting in obvious plumes in river mouths river plumes are more likely to form in valley reservoirs due to the steep slopes in the basin which may accelerate fluvial transport from upstream to the river mouth causing a considerable particles load and increasing the appearance times and scale of river plumes during rainfall events information on the intensity and evolution of river plumes in valley reservoirs has important implications for understanding nearshore geomorphological processes and dynamics in the water quality surrounding river mouths taking the xin anjing reservoir a typical deep valley reservoir as a case study a plume index based on the relative reflectance height in the red band of hj 1 a b images was first proposed subsequently we used seventeen hj 1 a b images during 10 heavy rainfall events from 2009 to 2014 to characterize the spatial temporal variability in river plumes and illustrate the relation of the river plumes and total suspended matter tsm concentration to the amount of rainfall the results indicated that 10 heavy rainfall events caused different plume areas varying from 41 26 to 148 12 km2 with an average area of 76 45 35 03 km2 significant positive correlations were observed between plume areas tsm concentrations and rainfall amount p 0 005 the plumes would simultaneously emerge when the rapid surface flow reached the river mouth but increase to the maximum size after 2 3 days of these heavy rainfalls these results confirmed that the hj 1 a b images combined with our proposed plume index could detect and monitor the formation and diffusion of river plumes in valley reservoirs during heavy rainfall events keywords xin anjiang river hj 1 a b river plume heavy rainfall event 1 introduction a river plume generally carries high concentrations of suspended matter nutrients heavy metals and organic contaminants teodoro et al 2008 bourgeois et al 2011 which can significantly affect the physical processes nutrient dynamics and biogeochemical structure of the upper layer of a reservoir and limit underwater light availability white et al 2009 the specific effects can be considered from the following four aspects 1 elevated nutrient concentrations from agricultural industrial and domestic effluents greatly modify the nutrient concentrations in the plume region and thus increase the occurrence of harmful algal blooms jones et al 2002 2 high total suspended matter tsm in the river plume affects the underwater light field distribution phytoplankton biomass primary production and community distribution ondrusek et al 2012 3 tsm load accompanied by trace metals fertilizers and pesticides from the river mouth affect the biogeochemical characteristics of water and thus affect the growth of aquatic organisms and human health kannan et al 2012 moreno madriñán et al 2015 the traditional in situ measurements are impossible to accurately monitor the river plume because its formation development and disappearance zawada et al 2007 previous studies showed that the numerical simulation methods could be used to predict the geometry and dynamic development of the river plume with large scale for example nekouee et al 2015a 2015b monitored nearshore behavior of river plumes in lake michigan by using 3d hydrodynamic model and particle tracking model however the models required numerous parameters as inputs such as the wind temperature dew point cloud cover boundary conditions etc limiting their applications to capturing of plume information in contrast remote sensing technology could provide frequent large scale views and has been widely used to track the spatial temporal variation of river plumes in lakes and coastal waters nezlin et al 2005 characterized the dynamics and concluded the driving factors of river plumes with sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs data in the san pedro shelf california teodoro et al 2008 estimated the plume size based on segmentation techniques from a medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris image in the douro river portuguese lahet and stramski 2010 used threshold values based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data to extract turbid plumes and demonstrate the formation and evolution of the plume in association with rainstorm events in the coastal waters of southern california guneroglu et al 2013 proposed an automatic method to detect and monitor coastal plume zones with landsat data in the south eastern black sea zhang et al 2016 used a spatial autocorrelation method to extract river plumes from modis images and explored the formation mechanism of river plumes in lake taihu china hamidi et al 2017 have empirically developed a model based on modis images to map water turbidity and tsm in the southern green bay of lake michigan and defined the plume region with a threshold of tsm 5 mg l however as far as we know there is no study on river plume evolution or the effect on tsm dynamics with remote sensing technology in valley reservoirs the valley reservoirs are usually surrounded by mountains and characterized by small water surface and narrow river mouths the mainstream satellites such as seawifs modis meris and landsat data cannot capture the plume evolution of valley reservoirs either due to low temporal resolution or low spatial resolution the xin anjiang reservoir is a typical deep valley reservoir that serves as the drinking sources of approximately ten million people the annual inflow from the main inflow river xin anjiang river ranges from approximately 32 108 m3 to 119 108 m3 heavy rainfall carries a large amount of tsm accompanied by large quantity of nutrients micropollutants heavy metals and organic matter into the xin anjiang reservoir which may increase the number and scale of algal blooms in our previous study we used hj 1a b data 30 m spatial resolution and 2 day revisit time to develop an empirical model for tsm estimation and achieved the spatial temporal mapping of tsm in the reservoir zhang et al 2019 in this paper a plume index based on hj 1a b data was proposed to monitor the formation and dispersal process of the river plume and explore its effect on tsm concentration associated with heavy rainfall specifically the procedures consist of 1 automatically identifying the river plume from ambient water masses using a plume index 2 analyzing the spatial characteristics of the plume area during heavy rainfall events and 3 determining the relationship between the river plume areas tsm and rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 in situ collection and lab analysis we conducted two field campaigns during july 30 to august 1 2014 and august 19 21 2016 each campaign collected 60 water samples to measure tsm concentration and in situ recorded water turbidity fig 1 in addition real time series turbidity was measured at jiekou station fig 1 located in xin anjiang river during the period from december 13 2015 to june 12 2016 at 25 second interval the water turbidity was measured with a ysi exo2 multiparameter sonde exo2 yellow springs oh at a depth of 0 5 m beneath the water surface water samples 2 5 5 0 l were collected at a depth of 0 5 m beneath the water surface all samples were stored in a dark and cool container for transport to the laboratory and then filtered through a 0 7 um pores whatman gf f filters the concentration of tsm was determined by weighing zhang et al 2016 since the high frequency tsm is deficient in this study a strong relationship between tsm and turbidity was constructed to estimate high frequency tsm from measured real time turbidity data eq 1 fig s1 the high frequency tsm data was thus used to evaluate the impact of inflow on tsm variation in plume 1 tsm 1 36 t u r b i d i t y 0 35 r 2 0 88 mre 18 rmse 0 34 mg l nrmse 17 2 2 rainfall and inflow data we collected the rainfall and inflow data to assess their effect on the river plumes the daily rainfall data from chun an meteorological station 29o37 n 119o01 e fig 1 were acquired from the meteorological website of china http cdc nmic cn the daily mean inflow data of the xin anjiang river were acquired from the hydrological information system website http 218 1 102 99 8100 indexwater html 2 3 satellite data and tsm estimation model the hj 1 a b satellites were launched into orbit in september 2008 and are equipped with four ccd cameras the ccd sensor detects three visible bands blue green and red and one near infrared nir spectral band 430 520 nm 520 600 nm 630 690 nm and 760 900 nm hj 1 a b provides a 30 m ground pixel resolution 16 bits of radiometric resolution a 4 day revisit time the high spatial resolution and short revisit interval make the data as the best candidate for monitoring short term and regional hydrological phenomena such as river plumes from hydrological events and tsm transport in the upstream part of the river to avoid the effect of cloud and water vapor on plume detection and tsm estimation moreno madriñán et al 2010 hamidi et al 2017 the images covered with cloud or obtained on immediate day after heavy rainfall event were not used in this study in this study 17 hj 1 a b images in the 10 heavy rainfall events were used for developing plume detection method and another 4 images in 4 heavy rainfall events were used to validate the performance of the method the empirical algorithm based on blue green and red bands of hj 1 a b images zhang et al 2019 was used to estimate the tsm concentration of xin anjiang reservoir in this study detailed description including radiometric calibration atmospheric correction model construction and validation and mapping of the spatial temporal distribution of the tsm was reported in our previous study zhang et al 2019 2 4 heavy rainfall events in this study 10 heavy rainfall events from 2009 to 2014 were selected for detection of the river plume from the hj 1 a b data the accumulated rainfall of seven days before image has been used as an effective factor to analyze its effect on plume size in gaoping river taiwan chung et al 2014 we also used the accumulated rainfall of seven days before image to explore the formation mechanism of river plumes in xin anjiang reservoir in this study 17 hj 1 a b images are examined in the 10 heavy rainfall events and three images gathered after the events were also pre rainfall images of the following events table 1 qian et al 2007 proposed 25 and 50 mm day as benchmarks for large rain and rainstorms respectively however an accumulated rainfall of seven days more than 25 mm has created apparent river plumes in xin anjiang reservoir fig s2 to better understand the influence of different grades of rainfall on the plume we classified strong rainfall into three grades 25 mm rainfall 50 mm heavy rainfall 50 mm rainfall 80 mm rainstorm and rainfall 80

distinguished from the surrounding waters by their high tsm concentrations several studies have shown that the red band near 660 nm is beneficial for deriving tsm in turbid water nechad et al 2010 loisel et al 2014 previous study has shown that relative height method based on linear baseline drawn between two points on the either side of a sensitive wavelength has obvious advantage in magnifying the signal from high concentration of optical matters and thus distinguishing them from surrounding waters hu 2009 le et al 2016 therefore we choose 660 nm of hj 1 a b data as sensitive wavelength and built a plume index pi based on relative height method to distinguish the river plume from surrounding waters the pi is defined as the difference between r rs 660 and r rs 660 where r rs 660 is defined as a linear expression formed by r rs 560 and r rs 835 5 pi r rs 660 r rs 660 6 r rs 660 r rs 835 660 835 560 835 r rs 560 r rs 835 to define the threshold of pi in distinguishing river plumes from the surrounding waters we generate three datasets of reflectance from the 17 selected hj 1 a b images in the 10 heavy rainfall events fig 2 datasets i ii and iii were generated from the non plume region pixels the plume region pixels before rainfall and the plume region pixels after rainfall respectively in dataset i the plume water should have a reflectance that is larger than the maximum value in the red band fig 3 a in dataset ii the plume water should also have a reflectance that is larger than the maximum value in the red band fig 3b however in dataset iii the plume water should have a reflectance that is larger than the minimum and lower than the maximum value in the red band fig 3c therefore the threshold of pi in distinguishing river plumes from the surrounding waters could be defined as follows 7 dataset i pi 0 5 ave g ave nir min r or pi 0 5 ave g ave nir max r 8 dataset ii pi 0 5 ave g ave nir min r or pi 0 5 ave g ave nir max r 9 dataset iii pi min r 0 5 ave g ave nir and pi max r 0 5 ave g ave nir where max r min r ave g and ave nir are the maximum reflectance in the red band minimum reflectance in the red band averaged reflectance in the green band and averaged reflectance in the near infrared band a convolution operation was used to remove the discrete points which involved computation of the pixel neighbor median defined as follows 10 g m e d i a n x i where g is the result i is the number of pixels in an adjacent 3 3 window and xi is the contiguous variables of interest from eqs 7 9 we determined the pi threshold for the river plumes from the surrounding waters as 0 062 pi 0 016 we used another four hj 1 a b images in 4 heavy rainfall events to validate the performance of pi the derived tsm from the previously developed model showed a significantly higher value 5 63 1 51 mg l for plume waters than that of clear water 2 34 0 73 mg l fig 4 in addition both the plume and clear water pixels have pi values lower than 0 016 and the plume and clear water pixels were distributed on both sides of the threshold 0 062 which indicated that pi method with a threshold of 0 062 could effectively differentiate plume water from surrounding clear water 3 2 variation in plume distance and area the pi method was applied to 17 selected hj 1 a b images to derive the plume region from the surrounding water among the 10 selected heavy rainfall events the farthest distance of river plume dispersion from site 19 is 13 34 km the plume area was 41 26 148 12 km2 with an average area of 76 45 35 03 km2 table 1 the hj 1 a b images of the fuqiangxi river and wuqiangxi river which also feed the xin anjiang reservoir had minimal or no obvious plume detection indicating low discharge into the reservoir from these rivers the plume features during the heaviest rainfall 428 3 mm on february 21 march 18 2010 were specifically characterized in this study four hj 1 a b images show the detailed formation and evolution process of this river plume with one image before the strongest rainfall event february 21 2010 and three images after the strongest rainfall event march 11 12 and 18 2010 on february 21 no plume was detected in the hj 1 a b image fig 5 a the river plume peaked on march 11 2010 when the discharge values of the xin anjiang river were very high for this heavy rainfall event the tsm concentration exceeded 6 45 mg l even as far as 13 34 km offshore in the northeast direction a significant plume with a plume area of 148 12 km2 was also evident fig 5b on march 12 2010 3 days after this rainfall termination march 9 the detected plume area decreased from 148 12 km2 to 76 41 km2 and the river plume distance also showed a significant decline fig 5c the same situation occurred on march 18 2010 three days after the end of a 2 day heavy rainfall event march 14 15 where the accumulated rainfall was 76 2 mm the tsm concentration was lower than 6 45 mg l in areas located more than 8 km away from site 19 the river plume reveals the same northeast dispersion along the shoreline with an area of 104 26 km2 significant positive linear correlations were observed between the rainfall amount and plume area in ten rainfall events fig 6 a when the correlation analysis was performed with exclusion of the two largest plume areas march 11 2010 with total rainfall 160 mm march 18 2010 with a daily rainfall of 60 mm a highly significant positive relationship was still observed fig 6b further analyses were performed to reveal the rainfall effect on the plume area by calculating the ratio of plume area to rainfall the results showed that the average ratio was 0 95 0 54 km2 mm for the plume area 3 3 tsm variations related to river plume three heavy rainfall events on march 10 2009 rainfall 25 9 mm march 18 2010 rainfall 76 2 mm and march 11 2010 rainfall 168 2 mm were chose to analyze the relationships between tsm concentrations and distances to the open water we chose these three heavy rainfall events considering two key factors 1 the three rainfall events on march 10 2009 march 18 2010 and march 11 2010 could be effectively used to analyze the effect of rainfall with different gradations on the river plume and 2 the three rainfall events occurred in the same month with the same phenological vegetation characteristics in the surface soil which ensure consistent tsm loading at the watershed scale after rainfall events on march 10 2009 the tsm concentrations at sites 10 and 11 of the xin anjiang river were 6 28 and 6 75 mg l respectively from the mouth of the xin anjiang river to the open area the tsm decreased from 6 75 mg l at site 11 to 4 01 mg l at site 18 reflecting the gradual dilution and sedimentation with the surrounding water fig 7 a shows that the tsm value agrees with the distance to the river mouth with highly significant positive linear relationships r 2 0 74 p 0 001 on march 18 2010 the tsm concentrations of sites 10 and 11 in the xin anjiang river were as high as 6 43 and 7 01 mg l respectively from the mouth of the xin anjiang river to the open area the tsm value decreased from 6 40 mg l to 4 45 mg l from site 12 to site 18 fig 7b shows that the tsm concentration also agreed with the distance to the river mouth with highly significant positive linear relationships r 2 0 89 p 0 001 however on march 11 2010 the tsm concentration deviated significantly from the distance to the river mouth fig 7c this may attribute to few depositions of suspended matter from upstream to the river mouth due to rapid flow during the heaviest rainfall a contrastive analysis of tsm values before and after the 10 selected heavy rainfalls indicated the significant effect of heavy rainfalls on tsm concentration and distributions in the xin anjiang river table 1 for the 10 selected heavy rainfall events the mean tsm of 3 67 1 34 mg l before the heavy rainfall was significantly lower than the mean value of 6 61 1 03 mg l after the heavy rainfall in the river plume reflecting a large amount of tsm import from the xin anjiang river after the heavy rainfalls however different variation trends in tsm concentration were observed for the 10 selected heavy rainfall events which reflected the interaction between the tsm import dilution and sedimentation for example the tsm increased from 2 95 mg l on february 21 2009 to 6 51 mg l on march 10 2009 and further to 6 87 mg l on march 14 2009 the tsm increased from 2 43 mg l on february 21 2010 to 7 48 mg l on march 10 2010 in addition the tsm value increased from 5 36 mg l on april 23 2012 to 8 09 mg l on april 26 2012 in contrast during one of the rainfalls the tsm decreased from 7 48 mg l on march 11 2010 to 5 24 mg l on march 12 2010 which reflected the interaction between the tsm sedimentation and dilution with surrounding water table 1 the different variation trends in tsm after the 10 selected heavy rainfall events revealed different hydrological processes for the earlier 1 3 days after heavy rainfall the tsm value increased rapidly due to the large inflow from the upstream but then decreased in the latter 4 5 days as a result of tsm sedimentation and dilution with the surrounding water we further analyzed the relationships between rainfall amount and the mean tsm of the river plume after heavy rainfall significant positive linear correlations were observed between the rainfall amount and mean tsm of the plume fig 8 except for march 12 2010 when the interaction of the tsm sedimentation and dilution with the surrounding water disrupted this relationship but the high tsm in the plume was also significantly affected by the rainfall amount in this case 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the pi method in this work we performed the identification characterization and analysis of the xin anjiang river plume based on the 17 selected hj 1 a b images from 2009 to 2014 the 30 m spatial resolution and 4 day temporal resolution for the hj 1 a b data make it feasible to track short term and regional hydrological phenomena e g river discharge heavy rainfall and relate them to the shape and size of the river plume to characterize its erosional depositional processes an automatic method was proposed to detect the river plume in the selected hj 1 a b images traditionally the detection of river plumes is highly influenced by subjective consciousness in our study we detect the river plume automatically from the surrounding clear water in two steps 1 primary extraction of the plume region by calculating a pi with hj 1 a b images and 2 removing the discrete points through convolution operation the pi of tracking the xin anjiang river plume in the first step is based on the difference between the optical properties of the river plume and surrounding water in fact the pi represents the relative reflectance height of the red band fig 3 the reflectance in the red band is sensitive to water quality tsm transparency in turbid lakes reservoirs and coastal water and there are many studies estimating water tsm and transparency with satisfactory accuracy based on the red band reflectance dekker and peters 1993 olmanson et al 2008 wu et al 2009 mancino et al 2009 dona et al 2014 shi et al 2015 hou et al 2017 therefore the pi provided in this study is reasonably sensitive to turbid plume water in the xin anjiang reservoir in addition the pi method is also applied for plume extraction in lake poyanghu based on landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli data fig s3 to check the potential application the extracted plume region corresponded well with that in the rgb raw image however the threshold of pi may need a slight adjustment for other waters with different optical properties in this study other methods were also used to detect river plumes based on image processing these include region based methods teodoro et al 2008 and single optical parameter e g suspended matter organic matter or chla methods shi and wang 2009 however these methods performed with low accuracy and could not correctly isolate the river plume pixels from the pixels of the surrounding water similarly zhang et al 2016 found that a high concentration of tsm distinguishes the river plume from the surrounding waters and they successfully used a spatial autocorrelation method to extract the plumes from modis images by computing the differences in tsm values between a selected pixel and its neighbors the limitation of this method is that it relies on precise retrieval of tsm an alternative method based on the difference in optical properties between river plumes and surrounding water is provided in this paper which combines the effects of multiple optically active substances to detect river plumes in addition the subtraction form in eqs 5 6 makes the pi algorithm more stable in the face of an imperfect atmospheric correction than other methods le et al 2016 in the second step we use convolution operation eq 10 to remove the discrete points of the river plume in the hj 1 a b reflectance images this elimination of float pixels or remaining clouds gives the best boundaries of the xin anjiang river plume 4 2 factors affecting the plumes many studies have suggested that rainfall within the watershed of a study area determines the plume area in lakes or reservoirs nezlin et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 in the xin anjiang reservoir significant positive correlations were observed between i rainfall amount and plume areas fig 6 and ii rainfall amount and tsm concentrations fig 8 which may provide an alternative method to predict plume area and tsm from rainfall data the general plume characteristics of the mississippi river revealed from seawifs nezlin et al 2008 and the spatial temporal development of the tokachi river plume from seawifs lihan et al 2008 agree with the results of our study heavy rainfall did not immediately result in the maximum size of the river plume rather there is a lag period in our study the maximum flow rate occurred within one day mean lag time among the 10 heavy rainfall events in table 2 after the heavy rainfall fig 9 a the plumes emerged once the rapid surface flow reached the river mouth but increased to the maximum size 2 3 days after these heavy rainfall events nezlin et al 2008 conducted a similar study in southern california finding that the plumes increased to the maximum size 1 2 days after the heavy rainfall events watershed size land use type land topography elevation soil conditions and other factors likely affect the length of the lag in the xin anjiang river the natural watershed released its water and tsm into the reservoir more slowly than the urbanized watershed of the ventura and santa clara rivers which have channelized flow similarly a gap period for the water from released the urbanized watershed of tampa bay florida can be deduced from the increasing turbidity in the bay water with more days after heavy rainfall events moreno madriñán et al 2012 generally the river discharge is positively related to rainfall and thus the river discharges similarly affect the tsm concentration of the river plumes nezlin et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 in the xin anjiang river the observed tsm and daily inflow rate show a similar tendency on march 11 2016 the larger daily flow rate 544 m3 s causes a larger observed tsm 11 51 mg l similarly the other three larger flow rates on april 9 2016 april 22 2016 may 12 2016 caused a higher tsm concentration in the xin anjiang river fig 9b the vegetation coverage near the xin anjiang river reacts like a sponge and partly absorbs the surface runoff after heavy rainfall the rest of the runoff carried tsm organic matter and chemicals into river systems causing a significant increase in tsm concentration 4 3 application and future improvement ship based surveys suffer from limitations due to strong winds and the risks of navigating in rainfall making it challenging to detect plume boundaries or observe the propagational and extensional direction of river plumes the cloud free hj 1 a b images over the xin anjiang reservoir are not continuous every day heavy rainfall events are often accompanied by windy or stormy weather with high cloud coverage and high discharge values the 10 selected cloud free images after heavy rainfalls are within the decreasing discharge periods following flood peaks similar limitations also applied to the in situ measurements and previous remote observations for both small plumes in the southern california bight nezlin et al 2008 taihu zhang et al 2016 and large plumes in the mississippi d sa and miller 2003 amazon vecchio and subramaniam 2004 and columbia laurs 1990 as windy or stormy weather decreases the accuracy and quality of sampling data therefore the xin anjiang river plumes are not characterized throughout heavy rainfall events in this study and the maximum river plume area or maximal tsm concentrations in the plume may be underestimated despite these climatic limitations hj 1 a b images still provide frequent and regional overviews of the xin anjiang river plume these images allowed us to calculate important information about plume size and direction and the spatial risk of exposure from turbid upstream waters to the xin anjiang reservoir for the first time however further improvements are needed first increasing the number of satellites may increase the possibility of catching the development and extension process of the river plume second a higher spatial and temporal resolution would be better for characterizing smaller geographical and short term hydrological phenomena third proxies should also be developed to establish the relationship between the optical properties of river plumes and relevant physical and ecological parameters finally detailed explanations should be carried out to illustrate the relationship among the seasonal precipitation plume features and evolving global climate and thus the plume features of the xin anjiang river can be completely monitored 5 conclusions to derive the plume area from the ambient water masses and understand the spatial temporal variability in the xin anjiang river plume associated with rainstorms a pi for detecting river plumes from hj 1 a b images was proposed the method was based on the relative reflectance height of the red band in hj 1 a b images which could effectively detect the plume area and may be widely applied to other studies the significant positive correlations between plume areas tsm concentrations and the rainfall amount may provide an alternative method to predict plume area and tsm from rainfall data in the xin anjiang reservoir a total rainfall more than 25 mm will create an apparent river plume and a lag period exists between the heavy rainfall and the river plume area the maximum inflow rate occurred within one day after the heavy rainfall rapid inflow from upstream led to the occurrence of plumes and a maximum size formed 2 3 days after these heavy rainfall events these results confirmed that the hj 1 a b images can serve as effective way to monitor the formation evolution process of small plumes in valley reservoirs during heavy rainfall events however further improvements are needed to reveal the link between the optical properties of river plumes and relevant physical and ecological parameters by combining higher spatial temporal resolution images in situ water parameters and appropriate inversion models credit authorship contribution statement yibo zhang conceptualization methodology writing
