6050,in this study interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar is applied to analyze the land deformation across the gorgan plain iran where recent droughts and over exploitation of groundwater leading to widespread subsidence having significant long term and seasonal signals in head measurements analysis of tops s1 month scaled images from october 2014 to october 2016 exhibits significant inelastic 70 mm yr on average and seasonal elastic ranging from about 20 to 132 mm vertical land deformation over the gorgan confined aquifer system gcas according to the decomposed vertical displacement map the investigations indicate that these significant deformations are due to both severe head decline up to 2 m yr and the presence of thick aquitards intervening aquifers to obtain elastic land deformation totally recoverable and static head components the inelastic partially recoverable and long term head decline trends are removed by lines fitted to the land deformation and head time series respectively having a high cross correlation coefficient between the seasonal components of head and land deformation time series ranging from 0 60 to 0 93 0 78 on average we use a joint well insar data analysis to estimate bulk aquifer parameters of the elastic skeletal storativity 0 0035 to 0 0142 0 0085 on average specific storage 1 54 10 5 to 7 68 10 5 m 1 4 35 10 5 m 1 on average and compressibility 1 50 10 10 to 7 40 10 10 n m 2 4 20 10 10 n m 2 on average at 14 piezometer locations insar derived aquifer storage properties are reasonably correlated with the hydrogeological setting of gcas moreover the elastic land deformation data are acceptably transformed to head fluctuations at 14 piezometers and several arbitrary point locations it is observed that the heads reconstructed from insar and measured in piezometers are consistent over a broad portion of gcas seasonal elastic land deformations occurred between wet and dry seasons in 2015 are also used to map the confining degree across gcas the higher confining degree has been observed in those areas of higher subsidence signatures implying that the subsidence potential in confined aquifers is higher than that of unconfined aquifers in this study we have demonstrated more benefits of the insar observations in estimating aquifer storage properties and predicting head in confined aquifers of significant subsidence signatures with better temporal and spatial resolution than that can be retrieved from hydrogeological data alone keywords aquifer storage properties inelastic and elastic land deformation aquifer confining degree insar deformation map gorgan plain iran 1 introduction hydraulic head and aquifer parameters are of the most substantial information for each hydrogeology investigation peeters et al 2010 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 traditionally the hydraulic head is measured at piezometers monitoring wells and hydraulic parameters are often determined either in situ by drawdown rates during pumping tests in exploration wells pumping wells or from lab analysis and by inverse modeling both piezometers and exploration wells are irregularly scattered points across aquifers in most cases there are some temporal gaps in hydraulic head measurements because of 1 drying of incomplete piezometers during the periods of severe water level decline 2 damaged piezometers and 3 the lack of access to piezometer locations during heavy raining snowing periods in winter cressler et al 2001 bruce et al 2008 in spite of that hydraulic parameters e g storativity are often obtained from in situ pumping test pumping tests may be limited due to that they are 1 costly hoffmann et al 2001 and 2 predominantly representative of high permeable units flowing water to pumping wells owing to hydrodynamic lag time between high aquifers and low aquitards permeable units in aquifer systems galloway and burbey 2011 boni et al 2016 in addition in aquitards particularly thicker ones collecting a creditable head and flow data within reasonable time frames is difficult owing to very low permeability galloway and burbey 2011 rezaei et al 2013 2016 furthermore results from lab measurements reflect a small portion of aquifer materials and it therefore cannot be representative of in situ conditions riley 1998 interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar a remote sensing technique to measure sub centimeter level surface deformations can provide land deformation data on a global scale with better spatial coverage than the gps global positioning system measurements in hydrogeology insar data have been previously used to 1 map regions where permanent land deformation has occurred over aquifers galloway et al 1998 watson et al 2002 2 determine aquifer storage properties chaussard et al 2014 boni et al 2016 chen et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 and 3 calibrate the mathematical groundwater flow models hoffmann et al 2003 calderhead et al 2011 insar can provide a dense approach to fill temporal and spatial gaps in aquifer storage parameters and hydraulic head without requiring significant disruption of water use practices confined aquifer storage properties have been widely assessed using joint well insar data by previous researchers galloway et al 1998 sneed and galloway 2000 hoffmann et al 2001 2003 galloway and hoffmann 2007 zhang et al 2007 bell et al 2008 tomas et al 2010 wisely and schmidt 2010 chaussard et al 2014 ezquerro et al 2014 reeves et al 2014 boni et al 2016 smith et al 2017 boni et al 2016 used the ground level change and the insar derived storativity to represent the main ground motion responses to hydraulic head changes recently several works have been conducted to estimate hydraulic head using land deformation observed with insar for confined aquifers of insignificant permanent subsidence such as the santa clara valley california chaussard et al 2014 and the san luis valley colorado reeves et al 2014 chen et al 2016 lately chen et al 2016 used joint well insar data to predict hydraulic head fluctuations in the confined aquifer of the san luis valley colorado these insar head estimates attribute the fact that vertical elastic land deformations in confined aquifers integrate changes in both compressibility of the aquifer skeleton and expansion of the pore water and the whole aquifer thickness remains saturated when water is stored or expelled owing to the changes in hydraulic head this is not the case in unconfined aquifers where the water is predominantly drained by gravity from the pore spaces in fact elastic land deformations occurring in an confined aquifer result from the changes in aquifer thickness in response to the changes in hydraulic head rezaei 2018 so that the seasonal elastic vertical land deformations can serve as a low cost tool particularly via using open source data and software to map broadly the confining degree across a confined aquifer the logs may not be able to precisely map the confining degree of aquifers because in part wells are irregularly sparse across the aquifer system as well as they may not be fully penetrated in contrast the seasonal land deformation data derived from insar in addition to that can cover a region underlain by the whole aquifer at 30 m pixel resolution are representative of the bulk aquifer system the gorgan confined aquifer the most important confined aquifer of iran is located in the south east coast of the caspian sea and plays a major role in the economy of the area of interest fig 1 groundwater has been intensively exploiting since the 1960 s for agricultural industrial and drinking purposes leading to a severe water level decline and hence significant inelastic land subsidence in the study presented in this paper we attempt to 1 characterize vertical land deformation in the gorgan plain by time series analysis of the created interferograms with temporal baselines covering 21 october 2014 to 22 october 2016 on the roughly monthly intervals 2 provide a spatial map to indicate the regions where subsidence happened across the area 3 estimate the elastic storage properties of the aquifer and reconstruct head fluctuations in the gorgan confined aquifer by a combination of insar and hydraulic head measurements 4 fill both the temporal and spatial gaps in aquifer storage properties and in head fluctuations and 5 spatially map the confining degree across the gorgan plain by seasonal elastic land deformation derived from insar 2 background 2 1 the gorgan plain the gorgan plain with an area of about 4727 km2 is located in the northern portion of iran bounded to the west by the caspian sea to the south by the alborz mountains and to the north by the iran turkmenistan border fig 1 the annual mean values for temperature and rainfall are about 17 c and 505 mm respectively the gorganrood river gathers runoff producing over the eastern portion of the plain and flows westwards the runoff producing in the western portion of the plain is mainly collected by the ghareso river both the gorganrood and ghareso rivers flow to the caspian sea as a base level of the area fig 1 annually about 1270 million cubic meters mcm of groundwater extracts by 34000 production wells particularly from the southern portion of the gorganrood river kankash omran consulting 2009 which has led to a continues water level decline in gcas currently the golestan regional water authority which acquires the hydrogeological database for the gorgan plain is responsible for quantitatively evaluating and safely managing the groundwater resources in the plain the depth of the quaternary unconsolidated sediments deposited during the periods of high caspian sea level in the gorgan plain reaches down to 1000 m which mostly contain connate saline water abkavs consulting 1971 in the northern portion of the gorganrood river and the southern portion of the caspian sea fig 1 the pore water is predominantly saline across much of the thickness of the alluvial sediments and no sign of fresh groundwater exists however in the southern portion mostly the south of the gorganrood river the connate saline water has been washed by fresh groundwater coming from the alborz mountains a primary source of recharge to gcas abkav consulting 1971 however the upper 200 m of the sediments predominantly constitutes an active aquifer system containing fresh groundwater since the deeper portions contain connate saline pore water 2 2 geology history and hydrogeology settings geologically the gorgan plain is predominantly situated in the southern portion of the south caspian basin scb that is bounded to the south by the alborz mountains and to the east by the kope dagh mountains not shown it composed of a thick sequence of quaternary sediments clay and sand with no bedrock outcrop due to rapid subsidence of the scb and uplifting of both the alborz and kope dagh mountains simultaneously radfar et al 2018 the quaternary succession in the scb consists of the apshoren ancient caspian and neocaspian formations deposited during the pliocene quaternary period mousavi rouhbakhsh 2001 the apshoren formation comprised of clay and sand ii with a pretty much uniform thickness of 500 600 m the ancient caspian and neocaspian formations which deposited under a lacustrine environment in late pleistocene holocene contain the clay and sand i sediments these sediments consist of gray sticky clay with abundant shell fragments and fine grained unconsolidated sandstone in this paper we simply refer to the fine grained unconsolidated sandstone as sand furthermore widespread windy loos sediments mainly clay and silt with low permeability cover much of the northern and north eastern portions of the plain one can refer to radfar et al 2018 for more details of geological history and characteristics of the gorgan plain tectonic history and evolution of the area are predominantly constrained by the convergence of the gondwana retrieved terrains and eurasia radfar et al 2018 the major fault in the region is the khazar fault on paleo tethys suture zone that separates the gorgan plain from the alborz mountains with general e w direction fig 1 the exact location of the fault on the gorgan plain is not known from the structural perspective khazar is a double verging reverse and sub vertical strike slip fault system that extended parallel to the caspian shoreline from azerbaijan to afghanistan nabavi et al 2017 while the gorgan plain is situated on the hanging wall of the khazar fault thick alluvial sediments are deposited in the plain since pliocene having the left lateral activity of the khazar fault in the south and right lateral movement of the ashgabat fault not shown in the north of the gorgan plain the plain has a westward movement e g allen et al 2006 bretis et al 2012 radfar et al 2018 the gorgan plain has been partitioned into four aquifers by golestan regional water authority including one layer unconfined the southern portion of the plain in the immediate vicinity of the alborz mountains one layer confined the mid portion of the gorgan plain two layer confined unconfined located along the gorganrood river and dashlibron the north western portion as outlined in fig 1 regardless of the above classification lithology logs and the prepared hydrostratigraphy map clearly show that the gorgan plain composed of one confined aquifer that has limited areal extent and an unconfined aquifer that may or may not overly the confined aquifer in this paper we refer to the confined aquifer system all through the paper as a gorgan confined aquifer system gcas the fresh water gcas covers 86 of the gorgan plain and acts as a major supply for fresh water in the area whereas the fresh water unconfined aquifer covers 57 of the gorgan plain kankash omran consulting 2009 the unconfined aquifer in those portions overlaid gcas is thin 10 24 m while in a narrow area of the southern portions of the plain in the immediate vicinity of the alborz mountains it is thick up to 150 m as showed around wells 78 and 196 in figs 2 s1 and s2 in fact gcas converts to a thick unconfined aquifer consisting of coarse grained sediments that deposited by alluvial fans in the vicinity of the alborz mountains the ground water recharge to the gorgan plain comes primarily from the alborz mountains front recharge 470 mcm yr kankash omran consulting 2009 the mountain front recharge initially passes through the thick unconfined aquifer and then moves into the aquifer units of gcas as shown in fig 2 it is to be noted that the direct recharge to the gorgan plain is generally low since it equals 5 of annual precipitation in the upper unconfined aquifer and roughly equal to zero in the northern portion of the gorganrood river where windy fine grained sediments clay and silt with very low permeability constitute the near surface beds kankash omran consulting 2009 it seems that the vertical permeability between aquifer units in gcas is insignificant since gcas predominantly consists of two thin confined aquifer i e water bearing units coarse grained sediments of marine sand and gravel in somewhere one or three separated by thick fine grained units clay and silt as an example in hydrostratigraphy profiles in fig 2 the intervening fine grained units i e aquitards with 50 120 m thickness are about three times thicker than the coarse grained aquifers with 7 15 m thickness the total thickness of aquitards generally becomes thicker northward as well as towards the caspian sea moreover in spite of that the average representative unconfined hydraulic head 51 m over the period from 2005 to 2015 being greater than the head in gcas 23 m over the period from 2005 to 2015 the seasonal fluctuations in the unconfined aquifer head happen about one month after those in the gcas head implying that the vertical permeability is negligible fig s3 however if the vertical leakage rate from the unconfined to gcas is high the head of gcas could not change seasonally sooner that the head of the unconfined aquifer in addition the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations in the confined aquifer head 5 00 m is about nine times greater than that of the unconfined aquifer head 0 55 m these discrepancies demonstrate that both the unconfined aquifer and gcas are not hydraulically well connected given the above mentioned evidence we assumed that gcas is not a leaky aquifer or if it is the leakage volume is negligible for the time frame of this study within the unconsolidated alluvial sediments of gcas groundwater is derived predominantly from primary porosity although no measurements of porosity are available based on pumping tests transmissivity is 532 m2 day on average across the gorgan plain and varies from 20 m2 day in the northern portion to 2930 m2 day in the fan sediments of the southern portion in the alborz mountains foothills the aquifer test derived bulk storativity values range from 0 015 to 0 082 0 042 on average across gcas and are larger than the typical values 0 005 0 00005 for confined aquifers todd and mays 2005 poehls et al 2011 the possible reasons are 1 the aquifer test derived storativity values may are representative of a combination of both the unconfined aquifer and gcas since there is no available information about the screen depth and construction of wells used for aquifer tests 2 that portion of water released due to the inelastic compaction occurred in gcas as described in section 4 1 may contribute to the storativity derived from pumping test monthly historical head measurements for the unconfined and confined aquifers of the gorgan plain are accessible in the gorgan regional water archive the shallow down to the depth of 25 m and deep 180 250 m depth piezometers are monitoring the unconfined aquifer and gcas respectively the notable point should be made here is that deep piezometers are completely sealed across the shallow unconfined aquifer and mostly screened across several depth intervals coincide with the aquifers of gcas therefore head measured at a given deep piezometer is an integration of head values of the multiple aquifer s units in gcas and it is difficult to determine the individual role of each aquifer unit so that we considered the head measurements at the deep piezometers as a regional head level of gcas of the 49 deep piezometers scattered across the gorgan plain only 44 have a high coherence insar data fig 1 of these 44 piezometers only 21 are of head measurements correlated with insar data however we only can consider 14 piezometers of these 21 piezometer locations to estimate aquifer properties and predict the head by insar data since 1 three of them no 12 29 and 42 in fig 1 are monitoring the thick portion of the unconfined aquifer and 2 insar derived seasonal elastic land deformation at four of them no 7 17 22 and 37 in fig 1 cannot be highly correlated with seasonal head measurements the depth of the selected piezometers varies from 180 to 250 m in gcas note that in this study we overlook both the inelastic and elastic portions of land deformation associated with the unconfined aquifer overlaid gcas since 1 its long term water level decline 0 08 m yr is insignificant in comparison with gcas 1 33 m yr kankash omran consulting 2009 2 its thickness up to 24 m is thin in comparison with that of gcas 180 to 250 m based on lithology logs e g see fig 2 3 the unconfined aquifer and the confined units of gcas are most probably disconnected hydraulically as described in the above and 4 in reality the elastic vertical land deformation in an unconfined aquifer is very smaller than that of a confined aquifer under the same hydrogeological setting because the main portion of stored expelled water in an unconfined aquifer comes from pores not from the skeletal compressibility head measurements clearly show that both the long term and seasonal signals are significant in gcas a significant long term decline in heads of most piezometers such as 14 34 43 fig 3 has occurred owing to significant water storage depletion in gcas the long term head declines have a roughly linear trend so that we removed them from head time series by the fitted linear equations the notable point should be made here is that several numbers of piezometers have the artesian condition during winter time of the early years in such piezometers we required to show how the artesian head data can affect the fitted lines we therefore fitted two lines to each head series one to all the data including the artesian data and another only to non artesian data in all piezometers the two fitted lines have roughly the same slope as an example fig 3 shows the results from piezometers 14 and 43 note that we have taken into account the head time series of longer than 5 years for this study while the elastic seasonal head data have to be used to estimate elastic storage properties of gcas via using a combination of head measurements and insar derived deformation data we first removed the long term head decline trends by the fitted lines to the original head time series the detrended data series were successfully obtained since the slope of the line fitted to the remaining head data of each piezometer is approximately equal to zero as an example the slopes of the lines fitted to the detrended head time series from piezometers 14 34 and 43 are 0 00003 0 0003 and 0 00003 respectively fig 3 notably the detrended head time series show significant seasonal fluctuations as an example fig 3 clearly exhibits that the seasonal head amplitudes from piezometers 14 34 and 43 are about 8 5 5 and 7 5 m respectively these large seasonal head fluctuations are likely associated with significant seasonal changes in land deformation as described in section 4 2 so that one can use their combination to estimate aquifer storage properties and reconstruct heads 2 3 relationship between land deformation hydraulic head and aquifer properties first we try to present a review of the relationship among elastic land deformation hydraulic head and aquifer properties in confined aquifers if the total stress remains constant the bulk elastic skeletal storativity of the aquifer system s ke can be approximated from a combination of changes in both the hydraulic head and the thickness of the aquifer system as follows riley 1969 1 s ke ρ g b α ke b α ke δ b e δ h e where ρ signifies fluid density g is gravitational acceleration b and b are the thickness of aquifers and aquitards in the confined aquifer system respectively α ke and α ke are the elastic skeletal compressibility of aquifers and aquitards respectively δ b e represents the elastic portion of land deformation occurring in the aquifer system chen et al 2016 and δ h e is the drop in the hydraulic head that remains above the minimum pre consolidation head smith et al 2017 b e is the cumulative saturated thicknesses of those units both fine and coarse grained size units i e b in eq 2 which experiencing elastic deformation smith et al 2017 the bulk elastic skeletal storage s ke reflects the response of both the coarse and fine grained units to the change in head which are of great importance to groundwater resources investigations hoffmann et al 2001 the inelastic skeletal storage in aquifer units can be ignored if the sand particles are well sorted and well rounded galloway and burbey 2011 in fact in the cases of insignificant inelastic deformation eq 1 along with the data of elastic deformation and head can be simply used to determine the bulk elastic skeletal storativity of the confined aquifer system s ke for example this has been implemented previously in the tertiary alluvial aquifer of madrid spain ezquerro et al 2014 and the chalk aquifer london boni et al 2016 nevertheless in the cases of significant subsidence one should first remove the long term subsidence from the original deformation time series before using eq 1 for estimating the elastic storage properties such as that has been previously employed by bell et al 2008 for the las vegas valley in our case we thus removed the inelastic component of land deformation as described in section 2 4 before using eq 1 in a confined aquifer system aquifers and aquitards one can write the bulk elastic skeletal specific storage s s ke as follows galloway et al 1998 hoffmann et al 2001 2 s s ke ρ g α ke s ke b where b is the thickness of the confined aquifer system and α ke is the average elastic skeletal compressibility of the aquifer system likewise the elastic skeletal storativity can be converted to the elastic skeletal compressibility α ke based on eq 2 however eq 2 uses the elastic portion of land deformation occurring in short time scales whereas the long term inelastic portion of land deformation is applicable for the inelastic portion here to apply eqs 1 and 2 we first removed the long term inelastic portion of land deformation via using regression lines fitted to each time series 2 4 insar data analysis sar systems provide unique tools to map the surface displacement in the basin wide scale over nearly all weather conditions the phase difference between received signals in two satellite paths above an area can be related to the deformation occurred in the area the resulting differential interferometric phase is associated with the flatten phase the topographic phase and noise based on 3 δ φ int φ def φ flat φ topo φ noise where δ φ int is the differential interferometric phase φ def signifies the ground surface deformation signal φ flat is the flattening phase φ topo is the topographic phase associated with the topography relief and φ noise is related to the phase noise to obtain the land displacement across the gorgan plain small baseline subset sbas time series analysis berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 was performed on all flattened and topographic phase corrected interferograms having n 1s sar image for a time interval t 0 t 1 t 2 t n m interferograms can be created the phase difference δ φ i j for the same pixel between two images i and j can be express by following linear equation 4 δ φ i j φ j φ i where φ j and φ i are the phase value of the images i and j respectively it is possible to write the linear equation in matrix form as follows 5 δ φ a φ where δ φ is the interferometric phase for each pixel a signifies the design matrix and φ is the incremental delay for each pixel over time to obtain the phase evolution of the interferometric phase over time φ for each pixel in the interferograms and mean velocity map of the study area this linear system can be inverted using least square method berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 to retrieve the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the ground deformation from 2014 to 2016 we respectively analyzed 22 and 32 slc format images of ascending and descending s1 tops track using open source software gmtsar sandwell et al 2011 we created 44 and 54 interferograms using ascending and descending s1 tops images respectively based on sbas approach berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 with the perpendicular baseline smaller than 120 m and the temporal baseline larger than 130 days the topographic phase component was corrected using the 90 m shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem farr and kobrick 2000 the flatten phase component was corrected using a precise orbital coordinate we masked pixels with lower correlation than the threshold value before unwrapping hanssen 2001 finally we applied the sbas time series analysis on corrected and filtered interferograms to estimate the mean velocity map in both the radar and geographic coordinate systems sandwell et al 2011 fig 4 a and b present the mean velocity maps in the los direction for ascending and descending tracks respectively where the red color indicates the deformation going away from the satellite which is the same for both ascending and descending tracks in the subsidence area we decomposed these los displacement maps to vertical and east west horizontal components using the following equation 6 v los v v c o s θ v e c o s α v n s i n α s i n θ where θ is the incidence angle α is the azimuth angle and v v v e and v n are the vertical east west horizontal and north south horizontal velocities respectively hanssen 2001 considering near polar orbits and the incidence angle of sentinel satellites the sentinel observations are mostly sensitive to the vertical component and their sensitivity to the north component is minimal samieie esfahany et al 2009 we therefore projected the los deformation to vertical and east west horizontal components based on eq 6 by ignoring the north south component fig 4c and d present the decomposed vertical and east west horizontal deformation map covering the gorgan plain notably the obtained deformations from both the ascending and descending tracks in the subsidence area are the same based on the retrieved vertical and east west horizontal maps we can reasonably assume that the los deformation is mostly related to the vertical components rather than horizontal consequently to estimate the vertical deformation through time we converted the time series of pixels corresponding to the piezometers using ascending deformation map fig 5 via overlooking the horizontal components of displacement it is observed that the deformation rate in the line of sight los direction is approximately 60 mm yr on average and up to more than 90 mm yr in some regions across gcas fig 5 according to the resultant decomposed deformation maps fig 4c and d the land deformation rate in vertical direction equals 70 mm yr on average across the plain and reaches up to more than 120 mm yr in the southern part of the plain we previously obtained 42 20 mm yr of displacement in los direction from the gorgan permanent gps station by projecting 3d velocity filed of the station into the los direction in the time period 2009 2014 rezaei et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the subsidence value retrieved from the tops s1 mean velocity map 42 00 mm yr for the gorgan permanent gps location triangle in fig 5 is in good agreement with that from the gorgan permanent gps 42 20 mm yr it is worthwhile to express that in addition to significant subsidence the elastic component of land deformation has occurred significantly across gcas over the study period as described in section 4 2 note that for the above estimations we assumed that the subsidence occurring in gcas is inelastic in spite of a fact that a portion of long term subsidence could be elastic and elastic rebound may occur if the long term head decline begins to recover theoretically inelastic deformation only occurs when the head drops below the preconsolidation head in practice it is very difficult to determine when inelastic deformation occurs because 1 head records are often incomplete and 2 the preconsolidation head is the lowest head level in the aquitards not in the aquifers however head measurements in the aquitards are not available since heads at piezometers predominantly related to the aquifer units in fact in aquitards particularly thicker ones collecting creditable head and flow data within reasonable time frames is difficult galloway and burbey 2011 rezaei et al 2013 2016 having a roughly linear decline trend in both the head and land deformation time series figs 3 and 6 and table s1 we assumed that a semi equilibrium condition has occurred between the inelastic compaction and the long term change in the head within gcas for example this assumption has also been made previously by bell et al 2008 for the las vegas valley to estimate the inelastic aquifer properties furthermore rezaei et al 2017 demonstrated that the long term subsidence in gcas has a linear trend using daily land deformation data acquired from the gorgan continuous gps station between january 2009 and june 2014 an alternative explanation to the linear trend in gcas is that the aquitards clay and silt are very thick up to 120 m thickness in comparison with aquifers marine sand and gravel which its thickness is as high as 15 m ranging from 7 to 15 m in much of gcas given a severe continuing head decline and the presence of thick aquitards in gcas the linear trend of deformation time series may theoretically continue for a long time up to the future years or decades or even centuries ireland et al 1984 likewise all piezometers show a relatively linear decline trend owing to a continuing water level decline so that we fitted a linear equation to each long term head time series table s1 as discussed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 both the long term roughly linear and seasonal deformation signals are significant and correspond well to the heads in gcas since we only use the elastic component of land deformation to estimate the elastic component of storage properties we must first remove the long term subsidence from original land deformation series the long term trend was removed from each individual head and deformation time series by a fitted linear equation to obtain the detrended time series as an example fig 6 shows how the long term trend in the original land deformation time series at the piezometer locations 14 34 and 43 are removed the fitted line approach has also been used to remove the inelastic portion of land deformation by previous researchers e g hoffmann et al 2001 ezquerro et al 2014 to estimate elastic storage properties in the following sections we used the detrended head and land deformation time series 3 aquifer elastic properties hydraulic head and the confining degree of gcas we used the elastic portion of land deformation and static head to estimate the aquifer elastic properties reconstruct hydraulic head fluctuations and determine the spatial distribution of the confining degree of gcas via using insar after removing the known linear trend of the time series both head h t and land deformation b t we first estimated both the time delay τ and cross correlation between the head and deformation time series at each piezometer location using the covariance between each pair time series h t and b t and at lags k 0 1 2 based on the procedure proposed by box et al 1994 for data pairs h 1 b 1 h 2 b 2 h t b t the lag k cross covariance is 7 c h b k 1 t t 1 t k h t h b t k b k 0 1 2 1 t t 1 t k b t b h t k h k 0 1 2 where h and b are the sample means of the series the sample standard deviations of the series are s h c h h 0 and s b c b b 0 where c h h 0 v a r h and c b b 0 v a r b finally the cross correlation is defined as follows 8 r h b k c h b k s h s b k 0 1 2 subsequently the bulk elastic skeletal storativity s ke was estimated by minimizing the objective chen et al 2016 9 h t b t s ke 2 2 over some reasonable values having τ and s ke we converted deformation data to head it is to be noted that the change in deformation may occur after the change in the head so that we constantly shifted head data forward to relate insar head estimates directly to the measured heads chen et al 2016 finally to calculate the mean bulk elastic skeletal values of specific storage s s ke and compressibility α ke at each piezometer location we substituted gcas thickness values and our calibrated values of s s ke into eq 2 we have taken into account b in eq 2 as a total thickness including both aquitards and aquifers retrieved from the lithology logs to estimate elastic parameters at each piezometer location we also used the deformation data and our calibrated s ke values to 1 reconstruct hydraulic head at piezometer locations in order to fill the temporal gaps in head data sets and 2 predict head fluctuations at two arbitrary points located somewhere between piezometers to estimate the error bars on insar head estimates we used the following equation reeves et al 2011 10 δ h δ h δ b 2 δ b δ s ke 2 s ke where δ b δ s ke and δ h are the error in δ b s ke and δ h respectively we calculated the error bar for each derived head time series note that the uncertainty of estimated head associated with δ s ke is significantly smaller than that attributed to δ b to calculate the uncertainty of the s ke value at each piezometer location obtained from eq 9 we recalculated s ke using generated 100 new noisy head and deformation time series contaminated by random noise error and the mean standard deviation of these 100 new s ke values at each piezometer location was considered as an estimation error the calculated errors vary from 2 77 to 28 15 19 on average over gcas the random noise error added to the head data was selected to be in the range of 0 05 cm keeland et al 1997 and to each individual deformation time series was also chosen to be in the range of error associated with insar derived land deformation data commonly less than 5 mm at that piezometer location in this study we also determine the spatial distribution of the confining degree in gcas using seasonal elastic deformations derived from insar since there is a direct correspondence between the change in both hydraulic head and aquifer thickness as well as between change in both aquifer thickness and vertical land deformation rezaei 2018 4 results 4 1 subsidence 2014 2016 across the gorgan plain we prepared the mean velocity map across the area by solving eq 4 from 21 october 2014 to 22 october 2016 we also calculated the long term head decline rate m yr for each head data set as described in section 2 2 the land deformation rate in the los direction was estimated to be 60 mm yr on average and up to 90 mm yr over gcas fig 5 the inelastic portion as high as 90 mm yr is obtained in los direction around the middle portion of gcas as shown in fig 5 the subsidence has widely occurred in gcas due to 1 a severe head decline up to 2 m yr in fig 5 and 2 the presence of thick aquitards intervening aquifers figs 2 and 7 there is spatially a good agreement between the long term head drop and subsidence particularly in the areas of thick fine grained units as shown in figs 2 and 7 implying groundwater overexploitation is the major attributing factor in the inelastic deformation across gcas generally significant subsidence occurs in the areas of both the severe head decline and thick fine grained units figs 2 and 7 it is to be noted that in both the thick unconfined and dashlibron aquifers because of insignificant head decline insignificant subsidence has been observed the thick unconfined aquifer in addition to that consists of coarse grained sediments annually receives a high rate of the mountain front recharge the northern portion of the area also does not show a significant head decline and subsidence signature due to that it contains saline connate water 4 2 seasonal land deformation 2014 2016 across the gorgan plain after removing the inelastic portion we estimated the seasonal elastic deformation occurred 1 in a dense network of arbitrary points no 135 scattered over the gorgan plain to determine the spatial distribution of the confining degree in gcas and 2 at 14 piezometers to estimate the aquifer elastic properties and reconstruct head via a joint well insar data to identify whether the confining degree is higher in our study area we first estimated the local seasonal elastic land deformation at each individual point by calculating the difference in land level between april wet season and october dry season in 2015 we then prepared the seasonal land deformation map by interpolation of seasonal elastic deformation values calculated for 135 points regularly scattered over the gorgan plain theoretically significant seasonal land deformation may occur in response to seasonal head fluctuations of confined aquifers not unconfined aquifers rezaei 2018 therefore the spatial map of the seasonal land deformation can serve as a tool to map the spatial distribution of confined aquifer systems assuming non leaky condition in gcas based on hydrogeological evidence section 2 2 seasonal land deformation occurs predominantly in response to seasonal change in the head of the water bearing units and can therefore map the spatial distribution of the confining degree of gcas fig 7 exhibits that the confined aquifer of the gorgan plain has the highest degree of confining since it has the highest seasonal vertical deformations in addition the highest seasonal land deformation in fig 7 has occurred in those areas of the highest subsidence in fig 5 on the contrary in the northern portion of the plain where the subsidence is insignificant particularly in the dashlibron aquifer the seasonal land deformation fig 7 is insignificant these observations suggest that higher subsidence can occur in aquifers with a higher confining degree that is confined aquifers have a greater potential for subsidence compared to the unconfined aquifers however it should be notified that this issue is true for the confined aquifers with higher seasonal changes in the head i e significant annual seasonal recharge rates in winter times and significant discharge rates in summer times as shown in fig 7 the northern portion does not show significant seasonal deformations whereas it is a part of gcas based on the hydrostratigraphy map and consists of thick confining beds fine grained silt and clay theoretically this portion is supposed to have a high degree of confining condition and then high seasonal land deformations while observations do not depict a significant seasonal vertical land deformations it can therefore be concluded that this portion of the gcas has a poor hydraulic connection with the annual seasonal recharge not low confining degree since 1 it mostly contains connate saline groundwater and 2 for example the measured heads in piezometer 10 located within this portion do not change much over time not shown the connate saline water has been washed out from the middle and southern portions by a high annual recharge of fresh groundwater originates from the alborz mountains abkav consulting 1971 having the high recharge volume coming from the alborz mountains the southern portion of gcas has a high seasonal land deformation fig 7 the seasonal land deformation data can also be used to estimate the aquifer properties and predict head fluctuations in confined aquifer systems if seasonal head and elastic deformation time series have a high correlation with each other in our case we observe that the seasonal deformation corresponds with the seasonal head fluctuations for example before removing the trends the correlations between the head fluctuations and seasonal deformations at piezometer locations 14 and 43 are shown in fig 8 the time series clearly shows that the recovery decline of water head in winter summer highly correlates with the elastic land rebound subsidence at each piezometer location suggesting that the seasonal change in the land surface controls by the seasonal change in elastic stress i e head in gcas we therefore used these time series in combination with the head data sets to estimate the aquifer properties and reconstruct the head at 14 piezometers in section 4 3 4 3 insar estimated heads and aquifer elastic properties after removing the inelastic portion of compaction we converted the insar derived elastic deformation to head at 14 piezometer locations by minimizing the objective function eq 9 since there is a high correlation ranging from 0 60 to 0 93 0 78 on average between the seasonal head and deformation time series given the calculated correlation coefficients are not complete i e less than one one can conclude that the aquifers in gcas consist of a portion of fine grained sediments therefore in addition to bulk elastic skeletal storativity s ke we estimated the mean time delay τ between the change in head and change in deformation at 14 piezometer locations we investigated two distinct scenarios one where we used 2014 2016 data to in addition to τ and s ke calibration reconstruct head called the first scenario and one where we first applied the former year data 2014 2015 to calibrate τ and s ke and next reconstruct head for the later year 2015 2016 using derived parameters except for piezometer 5 called the second scenario in piezometer 5 we first used a later year data for calibration and next reconstruct head for the former year since it s head measurements has a large temporal gap during the former year we also converted our calibrated bulk elastic skeletal storativity s ke from the first scenario to bulk elastic skeletal values of specific storage s s ke and compressibility α ke based on eq 2 the results based on the calibrated values obtained from the first scenario demonstrate that the local time delay between the head and land deformation time series τ is of 27 days on average and varies from about zero at the piezometer location 4 up to 38 days at the piezometer location 23 as shown in fig 9 which the local time delays derived from the second scenario varies from about zero up to 43 days 24 days on average theoretically the zero time delay implies the absence of clay lenses within aquifers since the high permeable coarse grained aquifers respond to the change in the hydraulic head simultaneously chen et al 2016 on the contrary the non zero time delay between the change in head and the corresponding change in elastic land deformation possibly implies the presence of clay content within aquifers due to that the dewatering of the low permeable clay sediments takes longer time scale in comparison to the high permeable coarse grained sediments note that the time delay theoretically is longer in thicker clay lenses with higher specific storages and lower vertical permeabilities riley 1969 based on available lithological logs from piezometers of gcas in the places of longer local time delay such as the region surrounded piezometer 44 τ 37 days a larger content of fine grained sediments exist within aquifers in comparison to the places of zero short local time delay values such as piezometers 4 τ 0 day and 40 τ 1 day as an example the lithological logs from piezometers 40 and 44 are presented in fig s4 in supplementary information moreover as shown in fig s5 in supplementary information except for piezometers 13 23 and 39 with a seasonal land deformation smaller than 50 mm the time delay for the remaining piezometer locations roughly increases with increasing seasonal land deformation derived values of s ke vary from 0 0035 at piezometer 16 to 0 0142 at piezometer 39 using the first scenario fig 9 and from 0 0025 at piezometer 13 to 0 0131 at piezometer 39 using the second scenario fig 10 the averages of s ke values obtained from the first 0 0085 and second 0 0082 scenarios are approximately equal the estimated s s ke values also vary from 1 54 10 5 m 1 at piezometer 44 to 7 68 10 5 m 1 at piezometer 39 using the first scenario and from 1 19 10 5 m 1 at piezometer 13 to 10 00 10 5 m 1 at piezometer 41 using the second scenario the means values of s s ke derived from the first 4 35 10 5 m 1 and second 4 20 10 5 m 1 scenarios are roughly equal to each other and to the upper limit of the value range 8 2 10 7 to 4 3 10 5 m 1 for the confined aquifer of the santa clara valley chaussard et al 2014 accordingly the mean values of α ke derived from the first 4 20 10 10 m 2 n ranging from 1 50 10 10 to 7 40 10 10 and second 4 00 10 10 m 2 n ranging from 1 16 10 10 to 9 65 10 10 scenarios are roughly identical and lie within the typical range value of coarse grained sediments 10 10 to 10 8 n m 2 presented by freeze and cherry 1979 remind that the aquifer units in gcas consist of coarse grained sediments mainly sand and gravel notably the elastic compressibilities of skeleton obtained for gcas are in the range of the compressibility of water this may be due to the presence of high conductive aquifer units burbey 1999 however despite of this same range ignoring the storativity related to the compressibility of water s w is still reasonable since for example as an estimation the s w value of 2 6 10 4 obtained from the average porosity of about 0 30 average thickness of 200 m and the water compressibility of 4 4 10 10 m 2 n burbey 1999 is 32 times smaller than s ke values obtained here 0 0082 on average from the second scenario this may be due to that the volume of pore water is always less than the skeleton volume in each typical aquifer unit furthermore to calculated that portion of aquifer storativity which is related to the compressibility of water s w ρ g b n β the water compressibility must multiply by the porosity n typically a value between 0 and 0 5 while this is not the case for that portion of aquifer storativity which is associated to the skeleton compressibility the calibrated delay times and aquifer storage parameters s ke s s ke and α ke derived from the first and second scenarios at most piezometer locations are quite different from each other suggesting that the length of the insar and head time series used for calibration can influence the accuracy of the calibrated parameters the parameters obtained from the longer data may better representative of the real condition of the aquifer in our case table s2 the cross correlation between the head and deformation time series with two year length 0 78 is higher than that with one year length 0 58 and 0 70 from the first and second year data respectively suggesting that the parameters retrieved from the longer time series are more realistic so that we discussed the results based on those values obtained from the first scenario moreover as the dominant component frequency of seasonal head fluctuation is almost annual in gcas so that we believe the one year length is the threshold of the length of data to estimate the time delay and storage properties of the aquifer reasonably we further predicted head at 14 piezometer locations of gcas based on the calibrated values obtained from the first and second scenarios as shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the predicted head with error bar time series by both the scenarios show a seasonal behavior corresponding to the head measurements in both the scenarios most of the measured head values particularly in the rising limb of the head time series lie within the error bars eq 10 of their corresponding head values derived from a joint well insar data generally the higher prediction accuracies are obtained in those places with higher and regular seasonal changes in head and deformation such as piezometers 5 14 43 and 44 notably the cross correlation coefficients between the head and deformation time series at these piezometers are higher than 0 80 nevertheless several numbers of the measured head values do not fall within the error bars of the derived head values such as the late data in the piezometer 4 in fig 10 this may be due to the presence of bias in the calibrated values of s ke and τ 4 4 filling temporal and spatial gaps in the measured head data set using insar head measurements at two piezometers 5 and 44 from october 2014 to october 2016 have temporal gaps we filled temporal gaps in head measurements by elastic deformation data derived from insar and our calibrated values of the bulk elastic skeletal storativity from the second scenario as shown in fig 10 the derived heads from insar have reasonably filled the temporal gags in the head time series from piezometers 5 and 44 having a two year length deformation data in piezometer 5 we first used the later year 2015 2016 data to calibrate the storage properties and next used them to reconstruct head for the former year 2014 2015 while in piezometer 44 the data gap exists in the later year so that we used the former year data for calibration of aquifer storage properties and then reconstructed head for the second year 2015 2016 the derive head time series are in good agreement with those observed in the other piezometers to fill the spatial gaps in the head data we first interpolated our calibrated values of the bulk elastic skeletal storativity obtained from the first scenario at 14 piezometer locations by inverse distance weighted idw technique fig 11 we then selected the two piezometer locations 27 and 33 at which heads were not completely measured corresponds with the insar data fig 12 as well as two arbitrary points of p1 and p2 located somewhere between piezometers to test the capability of insar data in predicting head fluctuations at arbitrary points with no head measurements fig 11 we converted the elastic deformation data sets to head fluctuations at those four locations by a joint insar data and bulk elastic skeletal storativity obtained via using interpolation fig 11 head fluctuations predicted by a joint well insar data reasonably correlate with head fluctuation measurements in gcas fig 12 it is worthwhile to note that we fail to predict the absolute heads using the above approach because it requires the known values of both the time delay between the head and land deformation time series and the mean value of head at each arbitrary point although one can interpolate values to obtain them at unknown points it may cause large errors since the time delay τ may significantly change in space across the aquifer such as our case for example while piezometers 40 and 41 are located near each other in fig 11 the local time delay obtained for the piezometer 40 1 day is significantly different than that for piezometer 41 32 days as described in section 4 3 these large differences arise from the differences in clay content at different locations in an aquifer the obtained head fluctuations and aquifer properties can be used for each hydrogeological investigation in the area such as calibration purposes in the future numerical modeling of gcas 5 uncertainties and future works there are some uncertainties associated with the estimated aquifer properties and reconstructed head by a joint well insar data generally the calibrated elastic storage properties may bias if 1 there are significant horizontal deformations over the aquifer system hoffmann et al 2001 since burbey 1999 demonstrated that the storativity will be theoretically underestimated without considering the horizontal deformations and its storage contribution 2 the piezometers monitoring wells do not completely cross all the water producing units in the aquifer system since we assumed that each water head measurement represents the regional head of the aquifer system hoffmann et al 2001 3 the thicknesses of aquifers and aquitards in the saturated confined aquifer system are not measured precisely and 4 the long term subsidence is not removed completely from the land deformation time series for the cases of significant subsidence signatures in fact to completely remove both the long term subsidence and head decline trends from their time series and obtain time delay values with higher accuracies longer about several years insar and head time series with more frequently samples daily or weekly are required moreover by improving the accuracy of insar derived deformations the smaller land deformations could be captured thus the more precise estimating aquifer properties and reconstructing head through a joint well insar data will be applicable the uncertainties associated with insar head estimates may be due in part to the error associated with both estimates of elastic storage properties and the time delay between the head and deformation the other sources of uncertainty may come from incomplete removing of the inelastic portion of land deformation and head decline trend from the deformation and head time series generally better head estimates will be obtained in those areas of higher and more regular seasonal changes in both head and land deformation chaussard et al 2014 since insar may fail to capture the small deformation signals in response to the changes in head owing to low signal to noise ratio at these places chen et al 2016 this study represents one step of our continuous effort to estimate aquifer elastic properties and predict head in confined aquifers by a joint well insar data which are extremely important in terms of the groundwater modeling and management and of particular interest in environmental sciences and engineering 6 conclusions in this study the characteristics of land deformation hydraulic head and aquifer properties of the gorgan confined aquifer system gcas experiencing significant elastic and inelastic land deformations have been investigated via using insar analysis the results demonstrate that both components of inelastic 70 mm yr on average and seasonal elastic ranging from about 20 to 132 mm land deformation have occurred significantly in gcas between october 2014 and october 2016 the rate of subsidence in the line of sight los direction is approximately 60 mm yr on average and up to 90 mm yr in some portions over gcas it is observed that significant subsidence signatures have occurred in those areas of severe head decline and thick fine grained units moreover a high correlation ranging from 0 6 to 0 93 0 78 on average between the seasonal head and land deformation time series at the piezometer locations suggests that the change in head is the primary attributing factor in the land deformation occurrence across the area moreover the findings indicate that the regions of higher subsidence signatures display a higher seasonal land deformation implying the higher subsidence potential in confined aquifers than unconfined aquifers significant permanent subsidence is not observed in the thick unconfined aquifer located in the foothill of the alborz mountains since it consists of coarse grained sediments and annually receives a high rate of the mountain front recharge it is furthermore founded that insar can help to determine the confining degree of those portions of gcas which are prone to significant annual seasonal recharge some portions of gcas which consist of connate water particularly in the northern portion are not of significant seasonal deformations suggesting their poor hydraulic connection with the annual seasonal recharge the seasonal land deformation data were also used to estimate the aquifer properties and predict head fluctuations in gcas since the time series of seasonal head and elastic land deformation have a high correlation with each other 0 78 on average these estimates are conducted in two different scenarios derived mean values of the time delay between the change in head and the change in land deformation ranges from about zero up to 38 days for the period from october 2014 to october 2016 the first scenario and from zero to 43 days for the period from october 2015 to october 2016 the second scenario the non zero time delay in most piezometer locations possibly implies the presence of clay sediments within the aquifers generally the places with further clay content within aquifer units exhibit longer time delays although the average bulk elastic skeletal values of storativity 0 0085 and 0 0082 respectively specific storage 4 35 10 5 m 1 and 4 20 10 5 m 1 respectively and compressibility 4 20 10 10 m 2 n and 4 00 10 10 m 2 n respectively derived from the first and second scenarios are roughly equal the individual values obtained from both the scenarios are quite different from each other this issue demonstrates that the length of the insar and well data applied for calibration may influence the accuracy of the parameters here the longer head and deformation time series gives more realistic parameters since they show a higher cross correlation with each other moreover the head fluctuations in some piezometers of gcas were predicted using a combination of well insar data and the calibrated values obtained from the first and second scenarios the head estimates with error bar at 14 confined piezometer locations using both the scenarios are reasonably consistent with the measured head values in addition derived head fluctuations at two piezometers where the heads were not measured correspond with the time frame of insar data and at two arbitrary points located somewhere between piezometers are reasonably correlated with head fluctuation measurements of gcas this study demonstrates that insar derived land deformation data on the monthly scale can be used for characterization of hydraulic head and aquifer properties in confined aquifer systems even those aquifers of significant subsidence the findings of this work can also be used to improve the future numerical groundwater modeling of gcas as several new data including the inelastic and elastic land deformation and aquifer elastic storage properties are provided and

6050,in this study interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar is applied to analyze the land deformation across the gorgan plain iran where recent droughts and over exploitation of groundwater leading to widespread subsidence having significant long term and seasonal signals in head measurements analysis of tops s1 month scaled images from october 2014 to october 2016 exhibits significant inelastic 70 mm yr on average and seasonal elastic ranging from about 20 to 132 mm vertical land deformation over the gorgan confined aquifer system gcas according to the decomposed vertical displacement map the investigations indicate that these significant deformations are due to both severe head decline up to 2 m yr and the presence of thick aquitards intervening aquifers to obtain elastic land deformation totally recoverable and static head components the inelastic partially recoverable and long term head decline trends are removed by lines fitted to the land deformation and head time series respectively having a high cross correlation coefficient between the seasonal components of head and land deformation time series ranging from 0 60 to 0 93 0 78 on average we use a joint well insar data analysis to estimate bulk aquifer parameters of the elastic skeletal storativity 0 0035 to 0 0142 0 0085 on average specific storage 1 54 10 5 to 7 68 10 5 m 1 4 35 10 5 m 1 on average and compressibility 1 50 10 10 to 7 40 10 10 n m 2 4 20 10 10 n m 2 on average at 14 piezometer locations insar derived aquifer storage properties are reasonably correlated with the hydrogeological setting of gcas moreover the elastic land deformation data are acceptably transformed to head fluctuations at 14 piezometers and several arbitrary point locations it is observed that the heads reconstructed from insar and measured in piezometers are consistent over a broad portion of gcas seasonal elastic land deformations occurred between wet and dry seasons in 2015 are also used to map the confining degree across gcas the higher confining degree has been observed in those areas of higher subsidence signatures implying that the subsidence potential in confined aquifers is higher than that of unconfined aquifers in this study we have demonstrated more benefits of the insar observations in estimating aquifer storage properties and predicting head in confined aquifers of significant subsidence signatures with better temporal and spatial resolution than that can be retrieved from hydrogeological data alone keywords aquifer storage properties inelastic and elastic land deformation aquifer confining degree insar deformation map gorgan plain iran 1 introduction hydraulic head and aquifer parameters are of the most substantial information for each hydrogeology investigation peeters et al 2010 varouchakis and hristopulos 2013 traditionally the hydraulic head is measured at piezometers monitoring wells and hydraulic parameters are often determined either in situ by drawdown rates during pumping tests in exploration wells pumping wells or from lab analysis and by inverse modeling both piezometers and exploration wells are irregularly scattered points across aquifers in most cases there are some temporal gaps in hydraulic head measurements because of 1 drying of incomplete piezometers during the periods of severe water level decline 2 damaged piezometers and 3 the lack of access to piezometer locations during heavy raining snowing periods in winter cressler et al 2001 bruce et al 2008 in spite of that hydraulic parameters e g storativity are often obtained from in situ pumping test pumping tests may be limited due to that they are 1 costly hoffmann et al 2001 and 2 predominantly representative of high permeable units flowing water to pumping wells owing to hydrodynamic lag time between high aquifers and low aquitards permeable units in aquifer systems galloway and burbey 2011 boni et al 2016 in addition in aquitards particularly thicker ones collecting a creditable head and flow data within reasonable time frames is difficult owing to very low permeability galloway and burbey 2011 rezaei et al 2013 2016 furthermore results from lab measurements reflect a small portion of aquifer materials and it therefore cannot be representative of in situ conditions riley 1998 interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar a remote sensing technique to measure sub centimeter level surface deformations can provide land deformation data on a global scale with better spatial coverage than the gps global positioning system measurements in hydrogeology insar data have been previously used to 1 map regions where permanent land deformation has occurred over aquifers galloway et al 1998 watson et al 2002 2 determine aquifer storage properties chaussard et al 2014 boni et al 2016 chen et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 and 3 calibrate the mathematical groundwater flow models hoffmann et al 2003 calderhead et al 2011 insar can provide a dense approach to fill temporal and spatial gaps in aquifer storage parameters and hydraulic head without requiring significant disruption of water use practices confined aquifer storage properties have been widely assessed using joint well insar data by previous researchers galloway et al 1998 sneed and galloway 2000 hoffmann et al 2001 2003 galloway and hoffmann 2007 zhang et al 2007 bell et al 2008 tomas et al 2010 wisely and schmidt 2010 chaussard et al 2014 ezquerro et al 2014 reeves et al 2014 boni et al 2016 smith et al 2017 boni et al 2016 used the ground level change and the insar derived storativity to represent the main ground motion responses to hydraulic head changes recently several works have been conducted to estimate hydraulic head using land deformation observed with insar for confined aquifers of insignificant permanent subsidence such as the santa clara valley california chaussard et al 2014 and the san luis valley colorado reeves et al 2014 chen et al 2016 lately chen et al 2016 used joint well insar data to predict hydraulic head fluctuations in the confined aquifer of the san luis valley colorado these insar head estimates attribute the fact that vertical elastic land deformations in confined aquifers integrate changes in both compressibility of the aquifer skeleton and expansion of the pore water and the whole aquifer thickness remains saturated when water is stored or expelled owing to the changes in hydraulic head this is not the case in unconfined aquifers where the water is predominantly drained by gravity from the pore spaces in fact elastic land deformations occurring in an confined aquifer result from the changes in aquifer thickness in response to the changes in hydraulic head rezaei 2018 so that the seasonal elastic vertical land deformations can serve as a low cost tool particularly via using open source data and software to map broadly the confining degree across a confined aquifer the logs may not be able to precisely map the confining degree of aquifers because in part wells are irregularly sparse across the aquifer system as well as they may not be fully penetrated in contrast the seasonal land deformation data derived from insar in addition to that can cover a region underlain by the whole aquifer at 30 m pixel resolution are representative of the bulk aquifer system the gorgan confined aquifer the most important confined aquifer of iran is located in the south east coast of the caspian sea and plays a major role in the economy of the area of interest fig 1 groundwater has been intensively exploiting since the 1960 s for agricultural industrial and drinking purposes leading to a severe water level decline and hence significant inelastic land subsidence in the study presented in this paper we attempt to 1 characterize vertical land deformation in the gorgan plain by time series analysis of the created interferograms with temporal baselines covering 21 october 2014 to 22 october 2016 on the roughly monthly intervals 2 provide a spatial map to indicate the regions where subsidence happened across the area 3 estimate the elastic storage properties of the aquifer and reconstruct head fluctuations in the gorgan confined aquifer by a combination of insar and hydraulic head measurements 4 fill both the temporal and spatial gaps in aquifer storage properties and in head fluctuations and 5 spatially map the confining degree across the gorgan plain by seasonal elastic land deformation derived from insar 2 background 2 1 the gorgan plain the gorgan plain with an area of about 4727 km2 is located in the northern portion of iran bounded to the west by the caspian sea to the south by the alborz mountains and to the north by the iran turkmenistan border fig 1 the annual mean values for temperature and rainfall are about 17 c and 505 mm respectively the gorganrood river gathers runoff producing over the eastern portion of the plain and flows westwards the runoff producing in the western portion of the plain is mainly collected by the ghareso river both the gorganrood and ghareso rivers flow to the caspian sea as a base level of the area fig 1 annually about 1270 million cubic meters mcm of groundwater extracts by 34000 production wells particularly from the southern portion of the gorganrood river kankash omran consulting 2009 which has led to a continues water level decline in gcas currently the golestan regional water authority which acquires the hydrogeological database for the gorgan plain is responsible for quantitatively evaluating and safely managing the groundwater resources in the plain the depth of the quaternary unconsolidated sediments deposited during the periods of high caspian sea level in the gorgan plain reaches down to 1000 m which mostly contain connate saline water abkavs consulting 1971 in the northern portion of the gorganrood river and the southern portion of the caspian sea fig 1 the pore water is predominantly saline across much of the thickness of the alluvial sediments and no sign of fresh groundwater exists however in the southern portion mostly the south of the gorganrood river the connate saline water has been washed by fresh groundwater coming from the alborz mountains a primary source of recharge to gcas abkav consulting 1971 however the upper 200 m of the sediments predominantly constitutes an active aquifer system containing fresh groundwater since the deeper portions contain connate saline pore water 2 2 geology history and hydrogeology settings geologically the gorgan plain is predominantly situated in the southern portion of the south caspian basin scb that is bounded to the south by the alborz mountains and to the east by the kope dagh mountains not shown it composed of a thick sequence of quaternary sediments clay and sand with no bedrock outcrop due to rapid subsidence of the scb and uplifting of both the alborz and kope dagh mountains simultaneously radfar et al 2018 the quaternary succession in the scb consists of the apshoren ancient caspian and neocaspian formations deposited during the pliocene quaternary period mousavi rouhbakhsh 2001 the apshoren formation comprised of clay and sand ii with a pretty much uniform thickness of 500 600 m the ancient caspian and neocaspian formations which deposited under a lacustrine environment in late pleistocene holocene contain the clay and sand i sediments these sediments consist of gray sticky clay with abundant shell fragments and fine grained unconsolidated sandstone in this paper we simply refer to the fine grained unconsolidated sandstone as sand furthermore widespread windy loos sediments mainly clay and silt with low permeability cover much of the northern and north eastern portions of the plain one can refer to radfar et al 2018 for more details of geological history and characteristics of the gorgan plain tectonic history and evolution of the area are predominantly constrained by the convergence of the gondwana retrieved terrains and eurasia radfar et al 2018 the major fault in the region is the khazar fault on paleo tethys suture zone that separates the gorgan plain from the alborz mountains with general e w direction fig 1 the exact location of the fault on the gorgan plain is not known from the structural perspective khazar is a double verging reverse and sub vertical strike slip fault system that extended parallel to the caspian shoreline from azerbaijan to afghanistan nabavi et al 2017 while the gorgan plain is situated on the hanging wall of the khazar fault thick alluvial sediments are deposited in the plain since pliocene having the left lateral activity of the khazar fault in the south and right lateral movement of the ashgabat fault not shown in the north of the gorgan plain the plain has a westward movement e g allen et al 2006 bretis et al 2012 radfar et al 2018 the gorgan plain has been partitioned into four aquifers by golestan regional water authority including one layer unconfined the southern portion of the plain in the immediate vicinity of the alborz mountains one layer confined the mid portion of the gorgan plain two layer confined unconfined located along the gorganrood river and dashlibron the north western portion as outlined in fig 1 regardless of the above classification lithology logs and the prepared hydrostratigraphy map clearly show that the gorgan plain composed of one confined aquifer that has limited areal extent and an unconfined aquifer that may or may not overly the confined aquifer in this paper we refer to the confined aquifer system all through the paper as a gorgan confined aquifer system gcas the fresh water gcas covers 86 of the gorgan plain and acts as a major supply for fresh water in the area whereas the fresh water unconfined aquifer covers 57 of the gorgan plain kankash omran consulting 2009 the unconfined aquifer in those portions overlaid gcas is thin 10 24 m while in a narrow area of the southern portions of the plain in the immediate vicinity of the alborz mountains it is thick up to 150 m as showed around wells 78 and 196 in figs 2 s1 and s2 in fact gcas converts to a thick unconfined aquifer consisting of coarse grained sediments that deposited by alluvial fans in the vicinity of the alborz mountains the ground water recharge to the gorgan plain comes primarily from the alborz mountains front recharge 470 mcm yr kankash omran consulting 2009 the mountain front recharge initially passes through the thick unconfined aquifer and then moves into the aquifer units of gcas as shown in fig 2 it is to be noted that the direct recharge to the gorgan plain is generally low since it equals 5 of annual precipitation in the upper unconfined aquifer and roughly equal to zero in the northern portion of the gorganrood river where windy fine grained sediments clay and silt with very low permeability constitute the near surface beds kankash omran consulting 2009 it seems that the vertical permeability between aquifer units in gcas is insignificant since gcas predominantly consists of two thin confined aquifer i e water bearing units coarse grained sediments of marine sand and gravel in somewhere one or three separated by thick fine grained units clay and silt as an example in hydrostratigraphy profiles in fig 2 the intervening fine grained units i e aquitards with 50 120 m thickness are about three times thicker than the coarse grained aquifers with 7 15 m thickness the total thickness of aquitards generally becomes thicker northward as well as towards the caspian sea moreover in spite of that the average representative unconfined hydraulic head 51 m over the period from 2005 to 2015 being greater than the head in gcas 23 m over the period from 2005 to 2015 the seasonal fluctuations in the unconfined aquifer head happen about one month after those in the gcas head implying that the vertical permeability is negligible fig s3 however if the vertical leakage rate from the unconfined to gcas is high the head of gcas could not change seasonally sooner that the head of the unconfined aquifer in addition the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations in the confined aquifer head 5 00 m is about nine times greater than that of the unconfined aquifer head 0 55 m these discrepancies demonstrate that both the unconfined aquifer and gcas are not hydraulically well connected given the above mentioned evidence we assumed that gcas is not a leaky aquifer or if it is the leakage volume is negligible for the time frame of this study within the unconsolidated alluvial sediments of gcas groundwater is derived predominantly from primary porosity although no measurements of porosity are available based on pumping tests transmissivity is 532 m2 day on average across the gorgan plain and varies from 20 m2 day in the northern portion to 2930 m2 day in the fan sediments of the southern portion in the alborz mountains foothills the aquifer test derived bulk storativity values range from 0 015 to 0 082 0 042 on average across gcas and are larger than the typical values 0 005 0 00005 for confined aquifers todd and mays 2005 poehls et al 2011 the possible reasons are 1 the aquifer test derived storativity values may are representative of a combination of both the unconfined aquifer and gcas since there is no available information about the screen depth and construction of wells used for aquifer tests 2 that portion of water released due to the inelastic compaction occurred in gcas as described in section 4 1 may contribute to the storativity derived from pumping test monthly historical head measurements for the unconfined and confined aquifers of the gorgan plain are accessible in the gorgan regional water archive the shallow down to the depth of 25 m and deep 180 250 m depth piezometers are monitoring the unconfined aquifer and gcas respectively the notable point should be made here is that deep piezometers are completely sealed across the shallow unconfined aquifer and mostly screened across several depth intervals coincide with the aquifers of gcas therefore head measured at a given deep piezometer is an integration of head values of the multiple aquifer s units in gcas and it is difficult to determine the individual role of each aquifer unit so that we considered the head measurements at the deep piezometers as a regional head level of gcas of the 49 deep piezometers scattered across the gorgan plain only 44 have a high coherence insar data fig 1 of these 44 piezometers only 21 are of head measurements correlated with insar data however we only can consider 14 piezometers of these 21 piezometer locations to estimate aquifer properties and predict the head by insar data since 1 three of them no 12 29 and 42 in fig 1 are monitoring the thick portion of the unconfined aquifer and 2 insar derived seasonal elastic land deformation at four of them no 7 17 22 and 37 in fig 1 cannot be highly correlated with seasonal head measurements the depth of the selected piezometers varies from 180 to 250 m in gcas note that in this study we overlook both the inelastic and elastic portions of land deformation associated with the unconfined aquifer overlaid gcas since 1 its long term water level decline 0 08 m yr is insignificant in comparison with gcas 1 33 m yr kankash omran consulting 2009 2 its thickness up to 24 m is thin in comparison with that of gcas 180 to 250 m based on lithology logs e g see fig 2 3 the unconfined aquifer and the confined units of gcas are most probably disconnected hydraulically as described in the above and 4 in reality the elastic vertical land deformation in an unconfined aquifer is very smaller than that of a confined aquifer under the same hydrogeological setting because the main portion of stored expelled water in an unconfined aquifer comes from pores not from the skeletal compressibility head measurements clearly show that both the long term and seasonal signals are significant in gcas a significant long term decline in heads of most piezometers such as 14 34 43 fig 3 has occurred owing to significant water storage depletion in gcas the long term head declines have a roughly linear trend so that we removed them from head time series by the fitted linear equations the notable point should be made here is that several numbers of piezometers have the artesian condition during winter time of the early years in such piezometers we required to show how the artesian head data can affect the fitted lines we therefore fitted two lines to each head series one to all the data including the artesian data and another only to non artesian data in all piezometers the two fitted lines have roughly the same slope as an example fig 3 shows the results from piezometers 14 and 43 note that we have taken into account the head time series of longer than 5 years for this study while the elastic seasonal head data have to be used to estimate elastic storage properties of gcas via using a combination of head measurements and insar derived deformation data we first removed the long term head decline trends by the fitted lines to the original head time series the detrended data series were successfully obtained since the slope of the line fitted to the remaining head data of each piezometer is approximately equal to zero as an example the slopes of the lines fitted to the detrended head time series from piezometers 14 34 and 43 are 0 00003 0 0003 and 0 00003 respectively fig 3 notably the detrended head time series show significant seasonal fluctuations as an example fig 3 clearly exhibits that the seasonal head amplitudes from piezometers 14 34 and 43 are about 8 5 5 and 7 5 m respectively these large seasonal head fluctuations are likely associated with significant seasonal changes in land deformation as described in section 4 2 so that one can use their combination to estimate aquifer storage properties and reconstruct heads 2 3 relationship between land deformation hydraulic head and aquifer properties first we try to present a review of the relationship among elastic land deformation hydraulic head and aquifer properties in confined aquifers if the total stress remains constant the bulk elastic skeletal storativity of the aquifer system s ke can be approximated from a combination of changes in both the hydraulic head and the thickness of the aquifer system as follows riley 1969 1 s ke ρ g b α ke b α ke δ b e δ h e where ρ signifies fluid density g is gravitational acceleration b and b are the thickness of aquifers and aquitards in the confined aquifer system respectively α ke and α ke are the elastic skeletal compressibility of aquifers and aquitards respectively δ b e represents the elastic portion of land deformation occurring in the aquifer system chen et al 2016 and δ h e is the drop in the hydraulic head that remains above the minimum pre consolidation head smith et al 2017 b e is the cumulative saturated thicknesses of those units both fine and coarse grained size units i e b in eq 2 which experiencing elastic deformation smith et al 2017 the bulk elastic skeletal storage s ke reflects the response of both the coarse and fine grained units to the change in head which are of great importance to groundwater resources investigations hoffmann et al 2001 the inelastic skeletal storage in aquifer units can be ignored if the sand particles are well sorted and well rounded galloway and burbey 2011 in fact in the cases of insignificant inelastic deformation eq 1 along with the data of elastic deformation and head can be simply used to determine the bulk elastic skeletal storativity of the confined aquifer system s ke for example this has been implemented previously in the tertiary alluvial aquifer of madrid spain ezquerro et al 2014 and the chalk aquifer london boni et al 2016 nevertheless in the cases of significant subsidence one should first remove the long term subsidence from the original deformation time series before using eq 1 for estimating the elastic storage properties such as that has been previously employed by bell et al 2008 for the las vegas valley in our case we thus removed the inelastic component of land deformation as described in section 2 4 before using eq 1 in a confined aquifer system aquifers and aquitards one can write the bulk elastic skeletal specific storage s s ke as follows galloway et al 1998 hoffmann et al 2001 2 s s ke ρ g α ke s ke b where b is the thickness of the confined aquifer system and α ke is the average elastic skeletal compressibility of the aquifer system likewise the elastic skeletal storativity can be converted to the elastic skeletal compressibility α ke based on eq 2 however eq 2 uses the elastic portion of land deformation occurring in short time scales whereas the long term inelastic portion of land deformation is applicable for the inelastic portion here to apply eqs 1 and 2 we first removed the long term inelastic portion of land deformation via using regression lines fitted to each time series 2 4 insar data analysis sar systems provide unique tools to map the surface displacement in the basin wide scale over nearly all weather conditions the phase difference between received signals in two satellite paths above an area can be related to the deformation occurred in the area the resulting differential interferometric phase is associated with the flatten phase the topographic phase and noise based on 3 δ φ int φ def φ flat φ topo φ noise where δ φ int is the differential interferometric phase φ def signifies the ground surface deformation signal φ flat is the flattening phase φ topo is the topographic phase associated with the topography relief and φ noise is related to the phase noise to obtain the land displacement across the gorgan plain small baseline subset sbas time series analysis berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 was performed on all flattened and topographic phase corrected interferograms having n 1s sar image for a time interval t 0 t 1 t 2 t n m interferograms can be created the phase difference δ φ i j for the same pixel between two images i and j can be express by following linear equation 4 δ φ i j φ j φ i where φ j and φ i are the phase value of the images i and j respectively it is possible to write the linear equation in matrix form as follows 5 δ φ a φ where δ φ is the interferometric phase for each pixel a signifies the design matrix and φ is the incremental delay for each pixel over time to obtain the phase evolution of the interferometric phase over time φ for each pixel in the interferograms and mean velocity map of the study area this linear system can be inverted using least square method berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 to retrieve the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the ground deformation from 2014 to 2016 we respectively analyzed 22 and 32 slc format images of ascending and descending s1 tops track using open source software gmtsar sandwell et al 2011 we created 44 and 54 interferograms using ascending and descending s1 tops images respectively based on sbas approach berardino et al 2002 lanari et al 2004 with the perpendicular baseline smaller than 120 m and the temporal baseline larger than 130 days the topographic phase component was corrected using the 90 m shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem farr and kobrick 2000 the flatten phase component was corrected using a precise orbital coordinate we masked pixels with lower correlation than the threshold value before unwrapping hanssen 2001 finally we applied the sbas time series analysis on corrected and filtered interferograms to estimate the mean velocity map in both the radar and geographic coordinate systems sandwell et al 2011 fig 4 a and b present the mean velocity maps in the los direction for ascending and descending tracks respectively where the red color indicates the deformation going away from the satellite which is the same for both ascending and descending tracks in the subsidence area we decomposed these los displacement maps to vertical and east west horizontal components using the following equation 6 v los v v c o s θ v e c o s α v n s i n α s i n θ where θ is the incidence angle α is the azimuth angle and v v v e and v n are the vertical east west horizontal and north south horizontal velocities respectively hanssen 2001 considering near polar orbits and the incidence angle of sentinel satellites the sentinel observations are mostly sensitive to the vertical component and their sensitivity to the north component is minimal samieie esfahany et al 2009 we therefore projected the los deformation to vertical and east west horizontal components based on eq 6 by ignoring the north south component fig 4c and d present the decomposed vertical and east west horizontal deformation map covering the gorgan plain notably the obtained deformations from both the ascending and descending tracks in the subsidence area are the same based on the retrieved vertical and east west horizontal maps we can reasonably assume that the los deformation is mostly related to the vertical components rather than horizontal consequently to estimate the vertical deformation through time we converted the time series of pixels corresponding to the piezometers using ascending deformation map fig 5 via overlooking the horizontal components of displacement it is observed that the deformation rate in the line of sight los direction is approximately 60 mm yr on average and up to more than 90 mm yr in some regions across gcas fig 5 according to the resultant decomposed deformation maps fig 4c and d the land deformation rate in vertical direction equals 70 mm yr on average across the plain and reaches up to more than 120 mm yr in the southern part of the plain we previously obtained 42 20 mm yr of displacement in los direction from the gorgan permanent gps station by projecting 3d velocity filed of the station into the los direction in the time period 2009 2014 rezaei et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the subsidence value retrieved from the tops s1 mean velocity map 42 00 mm yr for the gorgan permanent gps location triangle in fig 5 is in good agreement with that from the gorgan permanent gps 42 20 mm yr it is worthwhile to express that in addition to significant subsidence the elastic component of land deformation has occurred significantly across gcas over the study period as described in section 4 2 note that for the above estimations we assumed that the subsidence occurring in gcas is inelastic in spite of a fact that a portion of long term subsidence could be elastic and elastic rebound may occur if the long term head decline begins to recover theoretically inelastic deformation only occurs when the head drops below the preconsolidation head in practice it is very difficult to determine when inelastic deformation occurs because 1 head records are often incomplete and 2 the preconsolidation head is the lowest head level in the aquitards not in the aquifers however head measurements in the aquitards are not available since heads at piezometers predominantly related to the aquifer units in fact in aquitards particularly thicker ones collecting creditable head and flow data within reasonable time frames is difficult galloway and burbey 2011 rezaei et al 2013 2016 having a roughly linear decline trend in both the head and land deformation time series figs 3 and 6 and table s1 we assumed that a semi equilibrium condition has occurred between the inelastic compaction and the long term change in the head within gcas for example this assumption has also been made previously by bell et al 2008 for the las vegas valley to estimate the inelastic aquifer properties furthermore rezaei et al 2017 demonstrated that the long term subsidence in gcas has a linear trend using daily land deformation data acquired from the gorgan continuous gps station between january 2009 and june 2014 an alternative explanation to the linear trend in gcas is that the aquitards clay and silt are very thick up to 120 m thickness in comparison with aquifers marine sand and gravel which its thickness is as high as 15 m ranging from 7 to 15 m in much of gcas given a severe continuing head decline and the presence of thick aquitards in gcas the linear trend of deformation time series may theoretically continue for a long time up to the future years or decades or even centuries ireland et al 1984 likewise all piezometers show a relatively linear decline trend owing to a continuing water level decline so that we fitted a linear equation to each long term head time series table s1 as discussed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 both the long term roughly linear and seasonal deformation signals are significant and correspond well to the heads in gcas since we only use the elastic component of land deformation to estimate the elastic component of storage properties we must first remove the long term subsidence from original land deformation series the long term trend was removed from each individual head and deformation time series by a fitted linear equation to obtain the detrended time series as an example fig 6 shows how the long term trend in the original land deformation time series at the piezometer locations 14 34 and 43 are removed the fitted line approach has also been used to remove the inelastic portion of land deformation by previous researchers e g hoffmann et al 2001 ezquerro et al 2014 to estimate elastic storage properties in the following sections we used the detrended head and land deformation time series 3 aquifer elastic properties hydraulic head and the confining degree of gcas we used the elastic portion of land deformation and static head to estimate the aquifer elastic properties reconstruct hydraulic head fluctuations and determine the spatial distribution of the confining degree of gcas via using insar after removing the known linear trend of the time series both head h t and land deformation b t we first estimated both the time delay τ and cross correlation between the head and deformation time series at each piezometer location using the covariance between each pair time series h t and b t and at lags k 0 1 2 based on the procedure proposed by box et al 1994 for data pairs h 1 b 1 h 2 b 2 h t b t the lag k cross covariance is 7 c h b k 1 t t 1 t k h t h b t k b k 0 1 2 1 t t 1 t k b t b h t k h k 0 1 2 where h and b are the sample means of the series the sample standard deviations of the series are s h c h h 0 and s b c b b 0 where c h h 0 v a r h and c b b 0 v a r b finally the cross correlation is defined as follows 8 r h b k c h b k s h s b k 0 1 2 subsequently the bulk elastic skeletal storativity s ke was estimated by minimizing the objective chen et al 2016 9 h t b t s ke 2 2 over some reasonable values having τ and s ke we converted deformation data to head it is to be noted that the change in deformation may occur after the change in the head so that we constantly shifted head data forward to relate insar head estimates directly to the measured heads chen et al 2016 finally to calculate the mean bulk elastic skeletal values of specific storage s s ke and compressibility α ke at each piezometer location we substituted gcas thickness values and our calibrated values of s s ke into eq 2 we have taken into account b in eq 2 as a total thickness including both aquitards and aquifers retrieved from the lithology logs to estimate elastic parameters at each piezometer location we also used the deformation data and our calibrated s ke values to 1 reconstruct hydraulic head at piezometer locations in order to fill the temporal gaps in head data sets and 2 predict head fluctuations at two arbitrary points located somewhere between piezometers to estimate the error bars on insar head estimates we used the following equation reeves et al 2011 10 δ h δ h δ b 2 δ b δ s ke 2 s ke where δ b δ s ke and δ h are the error in δ b s ke and δ h respectively we calculated the error bar for each derived head time series note that the uncertainty of estimated head associated with δ s ke is significantly smaller than that attributed to δ b to calculate the uncertainty of the s ke value at each piezometer location obtained from eq 9 we recalculated s ke using generated 100 new noisy head and deformation time series contaminated by random noise error and the mean standard deviation of these 100 new s ke values at each piezometer location was considered as an estimation error the calculated errors vary from 2 77 to 28 15 19 on average over gcas the random noise error added to the head data was selected to be in the range of 0 05 cm keeland et al 1997 and to each individual deformation time series was also chosen to be in the range of error associated with insar derived land deformation data commonly less than 5 mm at that piezometer location in this study we also determine the spatial distribution of the confining degree in gcas using seasonal elastic deformations derived from insar since there is a direct correspondence between the change in both hydraulic head and aquifer thickness as well as between change in both aquifer thickness and vertical land deformation rezaei 2018 4 results 4 1 subsidence 2014 2016 across the gorgan plain we prepared the mean velocity map across the area by solving eq 4 from 21 october 2014 to 22 october 2016 we also calculated the long term head decline rate m yr for each head data set as described in section 2 2 the land deformation rate in the los direction was estimated to be 60 mm yr on average and up to 90 mm yr over gcas fig 5 the inelastic portion as high as 90 mm yr is obtained in los direction around the middle portion of gcas as shown in fig 5 the subsidence has widely occurred in gcas due to 1 a severe head decline up to 2 m yr in fig 5 and 2 the presence of thick aquitards intervening aquifers figs 2 and 7 there is spatially a good agreement between the long term head drop and subsidence particularly in the areas of thick fine grained units as shown in figs 2 and 7 implying groundwater overexploitation is the major attributing factor in the inelastic deformation across gcas generally significant subsidence occurs in the areas of both the severe head decline and thick fine grained units figs 2 and 7 it is to be noted that in both the thick unconfined and dashlibron aquifers because of insignificant head decline insignificant subsidence has been observed the thick unconfined aquifer in addition to that consists of coarse grained sediments annually receives a high rate of the mountain front recharge the northern portion of the area also does not show a significant head decline and subsidence signature due to that it contains saline connate water 4 2 seasonal land deformation 2014 2016 across the gorgan plain after removing the inelastic portion we estimated the seasonal elastic deformation occurred 1 in a dense network of arbitrary points no 135 scattered over the gorgan plain to determine the spatial distribution of the confining degree in gcas and 2 at 14 piezometers to estimate the aquifer elastic properties and reconstruct head via a joint well insar data to identify whether the confining degree is higher in our study area we first estimated the local seasonal elastic land deformation at each individual point by calculating the difference in land level between april wet season and october dry season in 2015 we then prepared the seasonal land deformation map by interpolation of seasonal elastic deformation values calculated for 135 points regularly scattered over the gorgan plain theoretically significant seasonal land deformation may occur in response to seasonal head fluctuations of confined aquifers not unconfined aquifers rezaei 2018 therefore the spatial map of the seasonal land deformation can serve as a tool to map the spatial distribution of confined aquifer systems assuming non leaky condition in gcas based on hydrogeological evidence section 2 2 seasonal land deformation occurs predominantly in response to seasonal change in the head of the water bearing units and can therefore map the spatial distribution of the confining degree of gcas fig 7 exhibits that the confined aquifer of the gorgan plain has the highest degree of confining since it has the highest seasonal vertical deformations in addition the highest seasonal land deformation in fig 7 has occurred in those areas of the highest subsidence in fig 5 on the contrary in the northern portion of the plain where the subsidence is insignificant particularly in the dashlibron aquifer the seasonal land deformation fig 7 is insignificant these observations suggest that higher subsidence can occur in aquifers with a higher confining degree that is confined aquifers have a greater potential for subsidence compared to the unconfined aquifers however it should be notified that this issue is true for the confined aquifers with higher seasonal changes in the head i e significant annual seasonal recharge rates in winter times and significant discharge rates in summer times as shown in fig 7 the northern portion does not show significant seasonal deformations whereas it is a part of gcas based on the hydrostratigraphy map and consists of thick confining beds fine grained silt and clay theoretically this portion is supposed to have a high degree of confining condition and then high seasonal land deformations while observations do not depict a significant seasonal vertical land deformations it can therefore be concluded that this portion of the gcas has a poor hydraulic connection with the annual seasonal recharge not low confining degree since 1 it mostly contains connate saline groundwater and 2 for example the measured heads in piezometer 10 located within this portion do not change much over time not shown the connate saline water has been washed out from the middle and southern portions by a high annual recharge of fresh groundwater originates from the alborz mountains abkav consulting 1971 having the high recharge volume coming from the alborz mountains the southern portion of gcas has a high seasonal land deformation fig 7 the seasonal land deformation data can also be used to estimate the aquifer properties and predict head fluctuations in confined aquifer systems if seasonal head and elastic deformation time series have a high correlation with each other in our case we observe that the seasonal deformation corresponds with the seasonal head fluctuations for example before removing the trends the correlations between the head fluctuations and seasonal deformations at piezometer locations 14 and 43 are shown in fig 8 the time series clearly shows that the recovery decline of water head in winter summer highly correlates with the elastic land rebound subsidence at each piezometer location suggesting that the seasonal change in the land surface controls by the seasonal change in elastic stress i e head in gcas we therefore used these time series in combination with the head data sets to estimate the aquifer properties and reconstruct the head at 14 piezometers in section 4 3 4 3 insar estimated heads and aquifer elastic properties after removing the inelastic portion of compaction we converted the insar derived elastic deformation to head at 14 piezometer locations by minimizing the objective function eq 9 since there is a high correlation ranging from 0 60 to 0 93 0 78 on average between the seasonal head and deformation time series given the calculated correlation coefficients are not complete i e less than one one can conclude that the aquifers in gcas consist of a portion of fine grained sediments therefore in addition to bulk elastic skeletal storativity s ke we estimated the mean time delay τ between the change in head and change in deformation at 14 piezometer locations we investigated two distinct scenarios one where we used 2014 2016 data to in addition to τ and s ke calibration reconstruct head called the first scenario and one where we first applied the former year data 2014 2015 to calibrate τ and s ke and next reconstruct head for the later year 2015 2016 using derived parameters except for piezometer 5 called the second scenario in piezometer 5 we first used a later year data for calibration and next reconstruct head for the former year since it s head measurements has a large temporal gap during the former year we also converted our calibrated bulk elastic skeletal storativity s ke from the first scenario to bulk elastic skeletal values of specific storage s s ke and compressibility α ke based on eq 2 the results based on the calibrated values obtained from the first scenario demonstrate that the local time delay between the head and land deformation time series τ is of 27 days on average and varies from about zero at the piezometer location 4 up to 38 days at the piezometer location 23 as shown in fig 9 which the local time delays derived from the second scenario varies from about zero up to 43 days 24 days on average theoretically the zero time delay implies the absence of clay lenses within aquifers since the high permeable coarse grained aquifers respond to the change in the hydraulic head simultaneously chen et al 2016 on the contrary the non zero time delay between the change in head and the corresponding change in elastic land deformation possibly implies the presence of clay content within aquifers due to that the dewatering of the low permeable clay sediments takes longer time scale in comparison to the high permeable coarse grained sediments note that the time delay theoretically is longer in thicker clay lenses with higher specific storages and lower vertical permeabilities riley 1969 based on available lithological logs from piezometers of gcas in the places of longer local time delay such as the region surrounded piezometer 44 τ 37 days a larger content of fine grained sediments exist within aquifers in comparison to the places of zero short local time delay values such as piezometers 4 τ 0 day and 40 τ 1 day as an example the lithological logs from piezometers 40 and 44 are presented in fig s4 in supplementary information moreover as shown in fig s5 in supplementary information except for piezometers 13 23 and 39 with a seasonal land deformation smaller than 50 mm the time delay for the remaining piezometer locations roughly increases with increasing seasonal land deformation derived values of s ke vary from 0 0035 at piezometer 16 to 0 0142 at piezometer 39 using the first scenario fig 9 and from 0 0025 at piezometer 13 to 0 0131 at piezometer 39 using the second scenario fig 10 the averages of s ke values obtained from the first 0 0085 and second 0 0082 scenarios are approximately equal the estimated s s ke values also vary from 1 54 10 5 m 1 at piezometer 44 to 7 68 10 5 m 1 at piezometer 39 using the first scenario and from 1 19 10 5 m 1 at piezometer 13 to 10 00 10 5 m 1 at piezometer 41 using the second scenario the means values of s s ke derived from the first 4 35 10 5 m 1 and second 4 20 10 5 m 1 scenarios are roughly equal to each other and to the upper limit of the value range 8 2 10 7 to 4 3 10 5 m 1 for the confined aquifer of the santa clara valley chaussard et al 2014 accordingly the mean values of α ke derived from the first 4 20 10 10 m 2 n ranging from 1 50 10 10 to 7 40 10 10 and second 4 00 10 10 m 2 n ranging from 1 16 10 10 to 9 65 10 10 scenarios are roughly identical and lie within the typical range value of coarse grained sediments 10 10 to 10 8 n m 2 presented by freeze and cherry 1979 remind that the aquifer units in gcas consist of coarse grained sediments mainly sand and gravel notably the elastic compressibilities of skeleton obtained for gcas are in the range of the compressibility of water this may be due to the presence of high conductive aquifer units burbey 1999 however despite of this same range ignoring the storativity related to the compressibility of water s w is still reasonable since for example as an estimation the s w value of 2 6 10 4 obtained from the average porosity of about 0 30 average thickness of 200 m and the water compressibility of 4 4 10 10 m 2 n burbey 1999 is 32 times smaller than s ke values obtained here 0 0082 on average from the second scenario this may be due to that the volume of pore water is always less than the skeleton volume in each typical aquifer unit furthermore to calculated that portion of aquifer storativity which is related to the compressibility of water s w ρ g b n β the water compressibility must multiply by the porosity n typically a value between 0 and 0 5 while this is not the case for that portion of aquifer storativity which is associated to the skeleton compressibility the calibrated delay times and aquifer storage parameters s ke s s ke and α ke derived from the first and second scenarios at most piezometer locations are quite different from each other suggesting that the length of the insar and head time series used for calibration can influence the accuracy of the calibrated parameters the parameters obtained from the longer data may better representative of the real condition of the aquifer in our case table s2 the cross correlation between the head and deformation time series with two year length 0 78 is higher than that with one year length 0 58 and 0 70 from the first and second year data respectively suggesting that the parameters retrieved from the longer time series are more realistic so that we discussed the results based on those values obtained from the first scenario moreover as the dominant component frequency of seasonal head fluctuation is almost annual in gcas so that we believe the one year length is the threshold of the length of data to estimate the time delay and storage properties of the aquifer reasonably we further predicted head at 14 piezometer locations of gcas based on the calibrated values obtained from the first and second scenarios as shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively the predicted head with error bar time series by both the scenarios show a seasonal behavior corresponding to the head measurements in both the scenarios most of the measured head values particularly in the rising limb of the head time series lie within the error bars eq 10 of their corresponding head values derived from a joint well insar data generally the higher prediction accuracies are obtained in those places with higher and regular seasonal changes in head and deformation such as piezometers 5 14 43 and 44 notably the cross correlation coefficients between the head and deformation time series at these piezometers are higher than 0 80 nevertheless several numbers of the measured head values do not fall within the error bars of the derived head values such as the late data in the piezometer 4 in fig 10 this may be due to the presence of bias in the calibrated values of s ke and τ 4 4 filling temporal and spatial gaps in the measured head data set using insar head measurements at two piezometers 5 and 44 from october 2014 to october 2016 have temporal gaps we filled temporal gaps in head measurements by elastic deformation data derived from insar and our calibrated values of the bulk elastic skeletal storativity from the second scenario as shown in fig 10 the derived heads from insar have reasonably filled the temporal gags in the head time series from piezometers 5 and 44 having a two year length deformation data in piezometer 5 we first used the later year 2015 2016 data to calibrate the storage properties and next used them to reconstruct head for the former year 2014 2015 while in piezometer 44 the data gap exists in the later year so that we used the former year data for calibration of aquifer storage properties and then reconstructed head for the second year 2015 2016 the derive head time series are in good agreement with those observed in the other piezometers to fill the spatial gaps in the head data we first interpolated our calibrated values of the bulk elastic skeletal storativity obtained from the first scenario at 14 piezometer locations by inverse distance weighted idw technique fig 11 we then selected the two piezometer locations 27 and 33 at which heads were not completely measured corresponds with the insar data fig 12 as well as two arbitrary points of p1 and p2 located somewhere between piezometers to test the capability of insar data in predicting head fluctuations at arbitrary points with no head measurements fig 11 we converted the elastic deformation data sets to head fluctuations at those four locations by a joint insar data and bulk elastic skeletal storativity obtained via using interpolation fig 11 head fluctuations predicted by a joint well insar data reasonably correlate with head fluctuation measurements in gcas fig 12 it is worthwhile to note that we fail to predict the absolute heads using the above approach because it requires the known values of both the time delay between the head and land deformation time series and the mean value of head at each arbitrary point although one can interpolate values to obtain them at unknown points it may cause large errors since the time delay τ may significantly change in space across the aquifer such as our case for example while piezometers 40 and 41 are located near each other in fig 11 the local time delay obtained for the piezometer 40 1 day is significantly different than that for piezometer 41 32 days as described in section 4 3 these large differences arise from the differences in clay content at different locations in an aquifer the obtained head fluctuations and aquifer properties can be used for each hydrogeological investigation in the area such as calibration purposes in the future numerical modeling of gcas 5 uncertainties and future works there are some uncertainties associated with the estimated aquifer properties and reconstructed head by a joint well insar data generally the calibrated elastic storage properties may bias if 1 there are significant horizontal deformations over the aquifer system hoffmann et al 2001 since burbey 1999 demonstrated that the storativity will be theoretically underestimated without considering the horizontal deformations and its storage contribution 2 the piezometers monitoring wells do not completely cross all the water producing units in the aquifer system since we assumed that each water head measurement represents the regional head of the aquifer system hoffmann et al 2001 3 the thicknesses of aquifers and aquitards in the saturated confined aquifer system are not measured precisely and 4 the long term subsidence is not removed completely from the land deformation time series for the cases of significant subsidence signatures in fact to completely remove both the long term subsidence and head decline trends from their time series and obtain time delay values with higher accuracies longer about several years insar and head time series with more frequently samples daily or weekly are required moreover by improving the accuracy of insar derived deformations the smaller land deformations could be captured thus the more precise estimating aquifer properties and reconstructing head through a joint well insar data will be applicable the uncertainties associated with insar head estimates may be due in part to the error associated with both estimates of elastic storage properties and the time delay between the head and deformation the other sources of uncertainty may come from incomplete removing of the inelastic portion of land deformation and head decline trend from the deformation and head time series generally better head estimates will be obtained in those areas of higher and more regular seasonal changes in both head and land deformation chaussard et al 2014 since insar may fail to capture the small deformation signals in response to the changes in head owing to low signal to noise ratio at these places chen et al 2016 this study represents one step of our continuous effort to estimate aquifer elastic properties and predict head in confined aquifers by a joint well insar data which are extremely important in terms of the groundwater modeling and management and of particular interest in environmental sciences and engineering 6 conclusions in this study the characteristics of land deformation hydraulic head and aquifer properties of the gorgan confined aquifer system gcas experiencing significant elastic and inelastic land deformations have been investigated via using insar analysis the results demonstrate that both components of inelastic 70 mm yr on average and seasonal elastic ranging from about 20 to 132 mm land deformation have occurred significantly in gcas between october 2014 and october 2016 the rate of subsidence in the line of sight los direction is approximately 60 mm yr on average and up to 90 mm yr in some portions over gcas it is observed that significant subsidence signatures have occurred in those areas of severe head decline and thick fine grained units moreover a high correlation ranging from 0 6 to 0 93 0 78 on average between the seasonal head and land deformation time series at the piezometer locations suggests that the change in head is the primary attributing factor in the land deformation occurrence across the area moreover the findings indicate that the regions of higher subsidence signatures display a higher seasonal land deformation implying the higher subsidence potential in confined aquifers than unconfined aquifers significant permanent subsidence is not observed in the thick unconfined aquifer located in the foothill of the alborz mountains since it consists of coarse grained sediments and annually receives a high rate of the mountain front recharge it is furthermore founded that insar can help to determine the confining degree of those portions of gcas which are prone to significant annual seasonal recharge some portions of gcas which consist of connate water particularly in the northern portion are not of significant seasonal deformations suggesting their poor hydraulic connection with the annual seasonal recharge the seasonal land deformation data were also used to estimate the aquifer properties and predict head fluctuations in gcas since the time series of seasonal head and elastic land deformation have a high correlation with each other 0 78 on average these estimates are conducted in two different scenarios derived mean values of the time delay between the change in head and the change in land deformation ranges from about zero up to 38 days for the period from october 2014 to october 2016 the first scenario and from zero to 43 days for the period from october 2015 to october 2016 the second scenario the non zero time delay in most piezometer locations possibly implies the presence of clay sediments within the aquifers generally the places with further clay content within aquifer units exhibit longer time delays although the average bulk elastic skeletal values of storativity 0 0085 and 0 0082 respectively specific storage 4 35 10 5 m 1 and 4 20 10 5 m 1 respectively and compressibility 4 20 10 10 m 2 n and 4 00 10 10 m 2 n respectively derived from the first and second scenarios are roughly equal the individual values obtained from both the scenarios are quite different from each other this issue demonstrates that the length of the insar and well data applied for calibration may influence the accuracy of the parameters here the longer head and deformation time series gives more realistic parameters since they show a higher cross correlation with each other moreover the head fluctuations in some piezometers of gcas were predicted using a combination of well insar data and the calibrated values obtained from the first and second scenarios the head estimates with error bar at 14 confined piezometer locations using both the scenarios are reasonably consistent with the measured head values in addition derived head fluctuations at two piezometers where the heads were not measured correspond with the time frame of insar data and at two arbitrary points located somewhere between piezometers are reasonably correlated with head fluctuation measurements of gcas this study demonstrates that insar derived land deformation data on the monthly scale can be used for characterization of hydraulic head and aquifer properties in confined aquifer systems even those aquifers of significant subsidence the findings of this work can also be used to improve the future numerical groundwater modeling of gcas as several new data including the inelastic and elastic land deformation and aquifer elastic storage properties are provided and

6051,changes of global terrestrial water storage tws retrieved from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission have been extensively evaluated in previous studies however natural drivers and their relative contributions to global tws changes twsc are still poorly understood in this study based on two global precipitation p datasets three global evapotranspiration et datasets and one global runoff r dataset the responses of twsc to the three major water fluxes p et and r were comprehensively examined for 168 river basins in addition by using hierarchical partitioning hp analysis the corresponding relative contributions rc of p et and r to twsc were quantified the results showed that for the period jan 2003 dec 2011 significant increases in terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa were observed over 49 basins whereas 42 basins presented significant decreases in twsa a robust positive relationship between p and twsc was observed in low latitude basins but strong negative relationships of twsc with et and r were identified in mid and high latitude basins averaging the degree of explanation of 168 basins for all p et r combinations we found that three independent variables explained an average of 61 4 of twsc the corresponding rc of p et and r were 42 6 43 2 and 4 2 respectively in spatial terms a larger contribution of p to twsc was found in low latitude basins and larger contributions of et and r were identified for mid and high latitude basins the findings of this study were important for improving our understanding of global twsc responses to climate change keywords grace twsc precipitation evapotranspiration contribution 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws reflects all types of water stored on continents including surface water soil water glaciers and groundwater etc pokhrel et al 2012a tregoning et al 2012 yun et al 2017 variations in tws have large impacts on terrestrial ecosystems human beings and even the sea level deng and chen 2016 climate change and human activities have changed both the magnitude and spatial distribution of tws pokhrel et al 2012b tws monitoring and the investigation of its attributes are therefore crucial for water resource management and sustainable utilization observations made by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission have provided integrated and accurate measurements in global tws anomalies since april 2002 tapley et al 2004a b by this dataset global and regional tws changes twsc and its relationships with various climatic variables have been investigated for example based on grace data and model output for 30 basins felfelani et al 2017 investigated the component contribution ratios of snow water surface water and subsurface water to twsc asoka et al 2017 explored features of groundwater storage changes in india and highlighted the dominant influence of monsoon precipitation similar studies have also been conducted in africa to determine natural and anthropogenic influences on twsc ahmed et al 2014 strong anthropogenic influences tang et al 2013 and the impacts of climate extremes flood and drought on twsc have also been evaluated in depth khandu et al 2016 2015 leblanc et al 2009 long et al 2013 however a global examination of drivers and their contributions to twsc is still lacked precipitation p as the main input flux of terrestrial water together with evapotranspiration et and runoff r as two main output fluxes play key roles in the global water cycles oki and kanae 2006 thomas 2006 ignoring anthropogenic influences these three hydrological fluxes theoretically dominant global twsc rodell et al 2004 syed et al 2008 some studies have attempted to reveal their relationships with twsc at various scales syed et al 2008 evaluated the temporal and spatial characteristics of global land data assimilation system gldas based twsc and explored the relationship of p et and r on gldas based twsc they found that the positive correlation between p and twsc occurred in the low latitude and the relationships of et r and twsc were negative in the middle and high latitude respectively mo et al 2016 explored the temporal variation of grace based twsc in china and suggested that changes in p et and r contribute 46 41 and 32 to twsc from 2003 to 2013 respectively soni and syed 2015 evaluated the relationship of the hydrologic flux and twsc variation over the four river basins ganga godavari krishna and mahanadi basins in india they found that the p minus et played an important role in the twsc variation after considering the flux individually they found that p dominated the twsc over the basins currents studies either qualitatively investigated the relationships of twsc with hydrological fluxes at global scale or quantitatively determined their relationships at regional or basin scale few of these studies have quantified the relative contributions of hydrological fluxes to twsc at a global scale which is critical for understanding twsc under a changing climate the aims of this study are to examine the responses of twsc to precipitation p evapotranspiration et and runoff r in the global 168 major river basins and to quantify the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc in each basin based on hierarchical partitioning hp analysis to reduce the uncertainties associated with datasets two p datasets three et datasets and one observed r dataset were analyzed here as listed in table 1 the performances of different combinations of p et r datasets in explaining twsc were also evaluated and compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 study regions in this study 168 major river basins covering 66 106 km2 of global continents were selected here for analysis according to scanlon et al 2017 the criteria for basin selection are that 1 basin area is 40 000 km2 and 2 basin radius is 200 km the digital map of the 168 river basins was obtained from the global runoff data centre grdc http grdc bafg de fig 1 in addition following the aridity classification of the united nations environment programme the aridity of each basin was determined by calculating the ratio of 30 yr 1982 2011 mean p and mean potential evapotranspiration pet feng and fu 2013 fig 1 the p and pet datasets were obtained from the climate research union cru pet was calculated by the penman equation saylor 1992 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace data the newly released grace level 2 mascon solutions produced by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the center for space research csr at the university of texas were used here to estimate the monthly tws anomalies twsa the csr mascon solution calculated on equal area geodesic grids of about 120 km 1 at the equator is processed by constraining the original grace level 1 data through the tikhonov regularization method that effectively depresses the north south stripe errors save et al 2016 and is presented on 0 5 0 5 grids the jpl mascon data are constrained by both grace data and a priori information obtained from the near global geophysical models obtaining the same effect of suppressing corresponding errors watkins et al 2015 using downscaling factors calculated by the community land model clm ver 4 0 the coarse 3 3 jpl mascon data is then downscaled to 1 1 and resampled to 0 5 0 5 detailed descriptions of approaches to processing csr and jpl mascon products can be found in studies by watkins et al 2015 and save et al 2016 here the monthly twsa series from jan 2003 to dec 2011 was averaged from jpl mascon and csr mascon missing records for several months were replaced by averaging the values of adjacent months andrew et al 2017 long et al 2015 mo et al 2016 2 2 2 precipitation two monthly p datasets were used for analysis obtained from the climatic research unit cru http data ceda ac uk badc cru time series version 4 00 defined as pcru and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data gpcc html defined as pgpcc respectively the pcru dataset provides global 0 5 month by month precipitation data for the period 1901 2014 harris et al 2014 the 0 5 pgpcc dataset during 1901 2013 was produced by compiling monthly precipitation observations from more than 70 000 stations across the world schneider et al 2014 2 2 3 evapotranspiration in situ et observations can be obtained only from individual stations or regional studies therefore large scale et investigations still rely on estimations from satellite observations or simulations from land surface models in this study et of river basins was derived from three datasets 1 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis et product mod16a2 http files ntsg umt edu data ntsg products mod16 2 et estimations produced by jung et al 2009 based on in situ fluxnet observations https www bgcjena mpg de geodb projects filedetails php and 3 et products simulated by the noah vic clm and mosaic models with forcing by gldas 1 0 https hydro1 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov data gldas the three et products are identified using the following subscripts etmodis etjung and etgldas the etmodis product with a spatial resolution of 0 5 was estimated using the penman monteith equation mu et al 2011 with inputs from modis retrievals and provides global monthly et values from 2000 to 2014 this product has been widely used in research on land surface ecological and hydrological processes luus et al 2013 mishra et al 2015 the global 0 5 etjung product covering the period 1982 to 2011 was simulated through a machine learning method the model tree ensemble which is trained with global in situ fluxnet observations jung et al 2009 based on this dataset jung et al 2010 investigated the global trend and attributes of et gldas provides monthly et simulations from 1979 to present the global 1 etgldas data were averaged from outputs of noah vic clm and mosaic models covering the period 2003 to 2011 the accuracy of the etgldas has been validated by several studies for example khan et al 2018 evaluated the uncertainties in et based on gleam gldas and mod16 they found that the three products exhibited reasonable accuracy compared with in situ actual evapotranspiration within asia rodell et al 2004 compared global et datasets by classifying them into four categories 1 diagnostic datasets 2 lsm datasets 3 reanalysis datasets and 4 ipcc ar4 datasets the results revealed that the patterns of mean values are highly congruent across all categories 2 2 4 runoff the long term observed runoff data were obtained from grdc as the majority of basins suffer some proportion of missing data the simple method proposed by dai 2016 was used to fill data gaps correlations were firstly calculated between observed runoff and precipitation model simulated runoff and the palmer drought severity index whichever showed the highest correlation coefficient was then used to fill gaps in the observed runoff data using linear regression in total runoff data for 168 basins were available for the study period jan 2003 dec 2011 ozdogan et al 2010 sneeuw et al 2014 considering the data availability for all datasets the period of jan 2003 dec 2011 was selected for analysis in this study 2 3 methods 2 3 1 calculation of twsc the water balance equation in a given basin can be expressed as follows 1 d s d t t 1 t p t 1 t e t t 1 t r where s is total water storage d s d t is twsc for a specific period t p is precipitation et is actual evapotranspiration and r is runoff according to eq 1 it is clear that twsc is determined by changes in p et and r for comparison twsc was also calculated by water balance equation here twscp et r twsa refers to the residual storage at a given time with respect to the storage at a reference time rodell et al 2009 in addition to the grace based twsa the performance of gldas based twsa was also investigated in this study the gldas based twsa was calculated as the sum of the anomalies of individual components such as canopy water storage anomalies cwsa soil moisture storage anomalies smsa snow water equivalent anomalies swea and surface water storage anomalies swsa which were determined as the difference of canopy water storage cws soil moisture storage sms snow water equivalent swe and surface water storage sws and the corresponding the average of cws sms swe and sws for the period january 2003 to december 2011 respectively the difference of twsa at the two joint time is named as twsc moiwo et al 2012 2011 here the double difference derivation of grace based twsa and gldas based twsa were used to estimate twsc derived from grace and gldas based twsc at a monthly scale cm month long et al 2014 respectively as follows 2 t w s c d s d t d t w s a d t t w s a t 1 t w s a t 1 2 δ t 2 3 2 trend analysis as a common non parametric test the mann kendall rank based test is used here to detect trends for twsc time series humphrey et al 2016 this method proposed by mann 1945 and improved by kendall 1975 has frequently been used in trend analysis of hydrological and meteorological variables aziz and burn 2006 burn and elnur 2002 gocic and trajkovic 2013 the significance of twsc trends was evaluated at p 0 05 2 3 3 partial correlation analysis and autocorrelation test the response of twsc to p et and r was examined by partial correlation analysis which excludes the influence of other factors on correlations between two variables the significance of correlations was evaluated at p 0 05 before running the correlation analysis durbin watson statistics durbin and watson 1971 were used to test for temporal autocorrelation in the p et r and twsc time series and then the first order difference method was applied to eliminate autocorrelations anderson 1942 2 3 4 hierarchical partitioning analysis hp analysis proposed by chevan and sutherland 1991 was used here to quantify the relative contributions of p et and r on twsc compared to common methods for determining variable importance using a single model hp measures the importance of each independent variable with respect to the dependent variable as a percentage contribution to the goodness of fit of the multivariate linear regression model hence it is suggested to provide a robust assessment of variable importance and can effectively overcome the collinearity problem existing among two or more explanatory variables the theory of hp can be expressed by the following equation chevan and sutherland 1991 3 b 1 n r b b 1 n i b b 1 n j b where r is the goodness of fit between dependent and independent variables in regression analysis i and j are the independent and joint components of r respectively and n is the number of independent variables in regression analysis for any independent variable such as m rm im jm im refers to that part of the percentage of the degree of fitting of m to dependent variables whereas jm refers to the remaining percentage of the degree of fitting of m to other independent variables chevan and sutherland 1991 the hp analysis was carried out with r software as two p datasets and three et datasets were available hp analysis was performed between twsc and six different p et r combinations 2 3 5 estimation of uncertainties twsa errors in the jpl dataset can be attributed to measurement errors and leakage errors which have been provided in associated products errors in the csr dataset are considered to be the twsa residuals after the long term annual and semiannual trends have been removed from the original signal scanlon et al 2017 standard linear least squares regression was applied to decompose the long term annual and semiannual trends from the original signal details of which can be found in wahr et al 2006 and hirsch and slack 1984 the uncertainty in twsc is calculated from twsa according to the error propagation law in eq 1 rodell et al 2004 details about estimates of uncertainties can be found in wahr et al 2006 and wiese et al 2016 uncertainties in the three et datasets two p datasets and twsc data from two grace products were estimated as the standard deviations longuevergne et al 2010 pan et al 2017 yang et al 2015 3 results 3 1 response of twsc to precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff fig 2 shows the trend in twsa variations for the period of jan 2003 dec 2011 for 168 river basins a total of 49 basins p 0 05 shown significant increasing trends including the yangtze mississippi and yenisei basins etc in contrast significant decreases in twsa p 0 05 were observed in 42 basins such as the yellow river ganges and indus basins this pattern was similar to that reported by rodell et al 2018 long et al 2017 reager et al 2016 and scanlon et al 2016 etc in addition it was reasonably consistent with some regional scale investigations ahmed et al 2014 asoka et al 2017 tang et al 2013 then the responses of twsc to p et and r were determined using partial correlation analysis before this analysis the temporal auto correlation in the time series of twsc p et and r was first tested significant first order auto correlations were observed for all time series indicating potential impacts on the results of correlation analysis after eliminating auto correlations by the first order difference method partial correlations between twsc p et and r for the period jan 2003 dec 2011 were calculated basin by basin the distributions of correlation coefficients between twsc and p presented similar patterns with different p et r combinations figs 3 a s1 s3 consistent with syed et al 2008 a general positive relationship was observed between twsc and p for most basins most basins in low latitudes showed strong positive correlations including the amazon congo and nile basins etc weaker relationships were observed in mid latitude and high latitude basins the mean partial correlation coefficient of all twsc p combinations for all the basins was 0 523 0 024 significant negative correlations between twsc and et were shown in most mid and high latitude basins especially for the northern america figs 3b s1 s3 such as the mississippi and yenisei basins however in the lower latitude basins weak positive relationships were observed such as in the amazon basin and congo basin etc the average correlation coefficient between twsc and the three et datasets for the basins was 0 401 0 043 a general negative relationship between twsc and r was observed over most basins and strong negative relationships were identified in the northern high latitudes figs 3c s1 s3 interestingly we also found that negative correlation coefficients between twsc and r in basins of northern asia are larger than those in northern america according to the water balance equation eq 1 a negative relationship between twsc and r can be expected however positive relationships were also observed in some low latitude basins such as the congo basin murray basin indus basin and ganges basin although this phenomenon has been reported by previous studies frappart et al 2013 soni and syed 2015 few of them had provided the reasons we speculated this abnormal twsc r relationship should be induced by 1 human associated activities such as irrigation practices construction of channels and dams etc which disrupt water balance within basins 2 influences from other water fluxes such as snowmelt which cause the covariation of twsc and r 3 uncertainties caused by datasets for example pcru etjung r combination suggested a higher stronger positive relationship for twsc and r than that of pgpcc etmodis r combination to test the potential uncertainty of correlation analysis caused by the choice of lengths of time sequence we also performed the partial correlation analysis for the periods jan 2003 dec 2009 figs s4 s6 and table s1 and jan 2005 dec 2011 figs s7 s9 and table s1 although these periods differ comparable correlation coefficients and patterns were obtained for most of the basins confirming the basic relationships of twsc with p et and r established in this study 3 2 the relative contributions of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff to twsc based on the hp analysis the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc were determined for each basin for different p et r dataset combinations table 2 lists all values of averaged explained variance r2 for multivariate regression models of different p et r combinations as well as the corresponding independent contributions of p et and r to twsc in spite of the marked differences between the data sources the six models built from different p et r combinations present comparable values of r2 approximately 0 614 0 024 suggesting the relatively strong performance of models in explaining twsc the maximum r2 value 0 638 was given by the model built between twsc and pgpcc etjung r combination in addition the spatial distributions of r2 for each model show similar patterns figs 4 and s10 the higher values of r2 were concentrated in several low latitude basins such as the amazon nile parana yangtze and congo river basins whereas relatively low values of r2 were observed in high latitude basins such as the mississippi basin and lena basin etc in addition the r2 and the relative contribution of p et and r to gldas based twsc were also quantified figs s14 s17 the spatial pattern of the degree of explanations of p et and r to gldas based twsc fig s14 were similar to that of twsc derived from grace figs 4 and s10 but the averaged degree of explanation r2 0 631 0 05 was slightly higher than the later over global 168 basins this is not surprising because gldas based twsc is estimated strictly following the water balance equation and incorporates climate and vegetation information overlapping with datasets used in this study after differencing the r2 of grace based twsc and gldas based twsc fig s18 we also found that the r2 of gldas based twsc was underestimated in some basins such as the congo basin indus basin ganges basin and the northern of mississippi basin etc it may be related to the absence of ground water storage in gldas lsms scanlon et al 2019 syed et al 2008 or the uncertainties of gldas caused by deficits of lsms or uncertainties of climate forcing data syed et al 2008 for all 168 basins the average relative contributions of all p et r combination to grace based twsc were 42 6 2 81 43 2 2 7 and 14 2 1 9 respectively the similar spatial patterns were shown for different p et r combinations figs 5 s11 s13 taking pcru etmodis r as an example fig 5 we found that p has a larger contribution in low latitude basins especially in tropical basins such as the amazon and congo river basins in contrast a larger contribution of et was identified in mid and high latitudes such as for the mississippi mackenzie yenisei and lena river basins compared with p and et r has a smaller contribution to twsc a larger contribution of r was identified in mid and high latitudes than in low latitudes especially for the yenisei lena and ob basins an interesting phenomenon was that although larger contributions of et and r to twsc are observed in mid and high latitudes than in low latitudes the largest contributions of et are observed in northern america and in europe but for r in northern asia hp analysis was also performed for the periods jan 2003 dec 2009 table s2 figs s19 s22 and jan 2005 dec 2011 table s3 figs s23 s26 no apparent differences were observed either for the relative contribution of p et and r to twsc or in their spatial patterns compared with the results for the period jan 2003 dec 2011 suggesting few influences of the choice of study period on our results 3 3 the relative contributions of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff to twsc for different climatic regions we further investigated the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc in order to explore their impacts under different climate regions table s4 figs 6 and s27 all basins were classified into 5 group according their corresponding aridity index such as the arid basins semi arid basins sub humid basins humid basins in the mid and high latitudes more than 30 or 30 s and humid basins in the low latitudes 30 s to 30 n the largest r2 values of regression models between twsc and different p et r combinations were found for basins in sub humid regions indicating a high degree of explanation of p et and r to twsc in these regions the lowest r2 values are found in humid basins in mid and high latitudes except for humid regions in low latitudes where the relative contribution of p was lower than that of et the average relative contribution of p et and r can be arrayed as p et r et in humid regions was limited mainly by energy rather than by water conditions mcvicar et al 2012 rodell et al 2011 troy et al 2011 this may explain the observed larger contribution of et compared with p in humid basins in low latitudes with high temperature and solar radiation averaging all p et r combinations table s4 the largest contribution of p to twsc was observed in the humid basins of the middle and high latitude and the smallest contribution was found in arid basins et has the largest contribution to twsc in humid basins of the low latitudes but presents the lowest contribution in humid basins of the middle and high latitude the contribution from r is relatively small and larger value was observed in arid basins shown in the fig s28 was the r2 and the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc in individual basin for different climate areas respectively we found that the r2 and the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc for individual basin were generally consist with the average for different climate areas 3 4 relative contributions of precipitation and evapotranspiration to twsc in some typical basins to confirm the above findings we selected six river basins the amazon basin congo basin lena basin mississippi river basin yangtze basin and murray basin fig 1 to further investigate the relationship between twsc p et and r fig 7 a f shows the seasonal cycle of twsc p et and r averaged from all datasets in the six basins the water balance based twscp et r was also calculated and compared with grace based twsc we observed a general coherent seasonal cycle between these two twsc curves for all the selected basins suggesting a basic reliability of our result however there are also some discernable differences in the variation of twsc amplitude in some basins such as for the lena basin and murray basin etc the differences can be due to several aspects such as the influence of snowmelt in the lena basin dettinger and diaz 2000 hirschi et al 2006 velicogna et al 2012 the uncertainties in datasets used for the twscp et r calculation soni and syed 2015 syed et al 2009 etc in the amazon basin fig 7a according to hp analysis the relative contributions to grace based twsc were 77 7 2 79 for p 18 1 3 0 for r and 4 2 3 1 for et this can be confirmed by the higher consistency of the seasonal cycle of twsc and p the lower magnitudes of the seasonal cycle for r and the negligible seasonal change observed for et in the congo basin fig 7b the seasonal patterns of twsc p and et are similar but twsc seems to be driven mainly by p because of greater magnitude of p this is consistent with the result of the larger contribution of p to twsc 71 9 10 compared with those of et to twsc 16 4 4 8 or of r to twsc 11 7 5 3 in the lena basin fig 7c we observed an opposite seasonal cycle between twsc and p et r in light of previous investigations dettinger and diaz 2000 hirschi et al 2006 velicogna et al 2012 the season cycle of twsc in the lena basin is highly relied on the runoff peak in the may or june which was mostly related to the snowmelt and runoff the relative contributions of p et and r are 17 1 1 06 46 4 1 67 and 36 6 2 1 in this basin respectively for mississippi river basin fig 7d the lowest value for twsc corresponding to the highest value for et occurred in july implying a dominate influence of et on seasonal twsc this can be confirmed by a 84 3 1 1 contribution of et on twsc concluded by this study kebede et al 2014 study suggested that in this basin 70 of the yearly rainfall occurred before the growing season and groundwater extraction for irrigation is needed to meet the crop water need irrigation related et increase may cause the lower twsc in the summer in the yangtze basin fig 7e twsc is controlled mainly by p with a contribution of 69 0 1 2 in the murray basin figs 7f s29 the relative contributions of p et and r were 37 9 6 1 33 9 16 7 and 29 0 18 2 respectively the peak of grace based twsc occurred in june corresponding to the lowest et and a peak of p there seems to be no seasonal cycle of r this is because compared with p and et the annual r is very small 0 62 cm yr hirschi et al 2006 fig s29 the relative high contribution of r 29 0 18 2 may be caused by the uncertainty in datasets we found that different combinations of p et r datasets generate a wide range of values of r s contribution to twsc table s4 4 discussion and conclusions we comprehensively investigated the trends of twsa and the relationships of twsc with p et and r for the period of jan 2003 to dec 2011 for 168 major river basins in this study the spatial patterns of trends in twsa showed good agreement with investigations at global and regional scales ahmed et al 2014 hassan and jin 2016 mo et al 2016 scanlon et al 2017 consistent with the results of previous investigations the twsa showed the increased trend in the amazon basin chen et al 2010 in africa basins such as the zambezi and niger forootan et al 2014 hassan and jin 2016 ramillien et al 2014 and in australia basins such as the lake eyre and murray basins fasullo et al 2013 the twsa increases should be mainly attributed to the increases of precipitation han et al 2019 long et al 2017 reager et al 2016 in addition human induced surface water storage change is also found to promote tws long et al 2017 for example the water impoundment of the three gorges reservoir was suggested to increase tws in the central yangtze river basin long et al 2015 decreases in twsa were observed for 42 basins some substantial reductions in twsa correspond well with regional studies of the groundwater depletion due to the water demand through pumping exceed the water supply through recharge scanlon et al 2012 such as in the north china plain feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 and the indus basin in northern india chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 which indicated the strong impacts of anthropogenic activities furthermore the melting of continuous perennial snow and glacier due to climate warming is also an important driver of twsa decreases chen et al 2017 henn et al 2018 long et al 2017 for example chen et al 2017 suggested that the depletion of twsa for the period 2003 2014 in the upper brahmaputra river basin may be due to shrinking of the snow and glacier similar conditions were also found in some basins in the northern america such as the yukon basin and mackenzie river basin jacob et al 2012 long et al 2017 according to the water balance equation twsc should be determined by changes in p et and r disregarding any disturbances by human activities p as the only input flux to the terrestrial water storage shows a generally positive relationship to twsc the influence of p on twsc could be further attributed to large scale atmospheric circulation reager et al 2016 for example a robust positive twsc p relationship has been found in enso impacted areas fasullo et al 2013 sun et al 2016 such as the murray basin et and r act as a negative flux in the terrestrial water balance show a negative impact on twsc with the most robust impacts being found in mid and high latitude basins such as the mississippi lena and yenisei basins these findings are roughly consistent with the results of a global investigation performed by syed et al 2008 which explored the drivers of gldas based twsc their study suggested that twsc in high latitudes is forced by snowmelt runoff while p dominates twsc in the tropics and et drives twsc in mid latitude basins in contrast to their study we observed less positive relationships between twsc and et and r particularly in low latitudes which seems to be more reasonable according water balance equation implying a higher uncertainty of gldas based twsc than that of observed twsc simple correlation analysis could not represent the true contributions of hydrological fluxes to twsc hence more importantly we quantified the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc using multivariate regression models and hp analysis averaging the degree of explanation of 168 basins for all p et r combinations we found that p et and r explained more than 60 of twsc suggesting the dominant influence of the hydrological fluxes to twsc this was supported by reager et al 2016 which suggested that long term or large scale twsc is controlled mainly by natural factors in addition we considered that the remaining unexplained may be due to the influences of groundwater withdrawals return flow snowmelt and human activities döll et al 2012 furthermore we observed a contrasting pattern of the r2 between low and high latitude basins the higher values of r2 are concentrated in several low latitude basins such as the amazon nile parana yangtze and congo river basins whereas relatively low values of r2 are observed in high latitude basins the lower r2 in some high latitude basins such as yenisei basin and ob basin might be due to the influence of snowmelt on twsc troy et al 2011 in addition some basins such as the mississippi basin experienced strong human activities and the lower r2 could be attributed to the groundwater extraction which has not been reflected in the currently used water budget components kebede et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 furthermore we observed contrasting patterns in the contributions of p et and r to twsc between low and mid high latitude basins in low latitude basins especially the tropical basins p has a larger contribution to twsc compared with those of et and r whereas in mid high latitude basins et and r has a larger contribution compared with that of p this pattern is roughly consistent with previous investigations at basin scales for example in the tropical amazon basin we observed a dominant influence of p on twsc and lesser contributions of r and et in agreement with the results of crowley et al 2008 at the continental scale we observed that p dominated twsc in south america and africa as previously reported by liu et al 2006 and hassan et al 2016 respectively in particular our result suggests the largest relative contribution of et to twsc are mainly located in basins in the northern america such as the mississippi basin columbia basin mackenzie basin and yukon basin etc according to previous investigations milly and dunne 2001 neal et al 2002 walter et al 2004 in addition to climatological dimension et change in some basins strongly influenced by the human activities for example in the mississippi basin due to the inconformity for the period of rainfall and the crops production irrigation plays an important role to avoid the crops losses kebede et al 2014 irrigation practices through groundwater extraction promote the soil water content and thereby enhance the et ozdogan et al 2010 snipes 2005 this should be the main reason for the large contribution et to twsc in this basin in addition relative large contribution of r to twsc are mainly found the northern asia as reported by hirschi et al 2006 and zhang et al 2017 dettinger and diaz 2000 and hirschi et al 2006 referred that the runoff in the northern asia such as the lena basin yenisei basin and volga basin is mainly generated by the snowmelt the results of this study is essential for the understanding of the natural attributions of twsc and have implications for forecasting tws dynamics under future climate change it should be noted that uncertainties still exist first multi sourced datasets of p and et were used in this study although all p et r combinations showed similar capabilities for explaining global twsc apparent differences were identified at the scale of climatic regions and basins indicating the influences of uncertainties between different datasets the accuracy of products for et is questioned khan et al 2018 liaqat and choi 2017 second the grdc runoff data suffers from serious data missing in some basins the reconstructed runoff using a simple linear regression method should inevitably have some uncertainties in recent years satellite altimetry technique has been developed to retrieve surface water getirana and peters lidard 2013 papa et al 2010 sneeuw et al 2014 for example sneeuw et al 2014 estimated runoff using an empirical functional relation between water level estimated by satellite altimetry and the measured runoff at the gauge stations and suggested this satellite based method outperformed traditional hydrological and hydro meteorological approach methods therefore satellite altimetry can be applied to fill runoff data in our future studies third we found that p et and r explain only a small proportion of twsc in several high latitude basins implying the influences of snowmelt groundwater and permafrost thaw as reported in previous studies döll et al 2012 landerer et al 2010 syed et al 2008 lastly the lagged effects of p and et on twsc were also ignored for example the lagged response of twsc to changes in p in the amazon basin have been widely reported azarderakhsh et al 2011 these issues are to be considered in our future investigations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

6051,changes of global terrestrial water storage tws retrieved from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission have been extensively evaluated in previous studies however natural drivers and their relative contributions to global tws changes twsc are still poorly understood in this study based on two global precipitation p datasets three global evapotranspiration et datasets and one global runoff r dataset the responses of twsc to the three major water fluxes p et and r were comprehensively examined for 168 river basins in addition by using hierarchical partitioning hp analysis the corresponding relative contributions rc of p et and r to twsc were quantified the results showed that for the period jan 2003 dec 2011 significant increases in terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa were observed over 49 basins whereas 42 basins presented significant decreases in twsa a robust positive relationship between p and twsc was observed in low latitude basins but strong negative relationships of twsc with et and r were identified in mid and high latitude basins averaging the degree of explanation of 168 basins for all p et r combinations we found that three independent variables explained an average of 61 4 of twsc the corresponding rc of p et and r were 42 6 43 2 and 4 2 respectively in spatial terms a larger contribution of p to twsc was found in low latitude basins and larger contributions of et and r were identified for mid and high latitude basins the findings of this study were important for improving our understanding of global twsc responses to climate change keywords grace twsc precipitation evapotranspiration contribution 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws reflects all types of water stored on continents including surface water soil water glaciers and groundwater etc pokhrel et al 2012a tregoning et al 2012 yun et al 2017 variations in tws have large impacts on terrestrial ecosystems human beings and even the sea level deng and chen 2016 climate change and human activities have changed both the magnitude and spatial distribution of tws pokhrel et al 2012b tws monitoring and the investigation of its attributes are therefore crucial for water resource management and sustainable utilization observations made by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission have provided integrated and accurate measurements in global tws anomalies since april 2002 tapley et al 2004a b by this dataset global and regional tws changes twsc and its relationships with various climatic variables have been investigated for example based on grace data and model output for 30 basins felfelani et al 2017 investigated the component contribution ratios of snow water surface water and subsurface water to twsc asoka et al 2017 explored features of groundwater storage changes in india and highlighted the dominant influence of monsoon precipitation similar studies have also been conducted in africa to determine natural and anthropogenic influences on twsc ahmed et al 2014 strong anthropogenic influences tang et al 2013 and the impacts of climate extremes flood and drought on twsc have also been evaluated in depth khandu et al 2016 2015 leblanc et al 2009 long et al 2013 however a global examination of drivers and their contributions to twsc is still lacked precipitation p as the main input flux of terrestrial water together with evapotranspiration et and runoff r as two main output fluxes play key roles in the global water cycles oki and kanae 2006 thomas 2006 ignoring anthropogenic influences these three hydrological fluxes theoretically dominant global twsc rodell et al 2004 syed et al 2008 some studies have attempted to reveal their relationships with twsc at various scales syed et al 2008 evaluated the temporal and spatial characteristics of global land data assimilation system gldas based twsc and explored the relationship of p et and r on gldas based twsc they found that the positive correlation between p and twsc occurred in the low latitude and the relationships of et r and twsc were negative in the middle and high latitude respectively mo et al 2016 explored the temporal variation of grace based twsc in china and suggested that changes in p et and r contribute 46 41 and 32 to twsc from 2003 to 2013 respectively soni and syed 2015 evaluated the relationship of the hydrologic flux and twsc variation over the four river basins ganga godavari krishna and mahanadi basins in india they found that the p minus et played an important role in the twsc variation after considering the flux individually they found that p dominated the twsc over the basins currents studies either qualitatively investigated the relationships of twsc with hydrological fluxes at global scale or quantitatively determined their relationships at regional or basin scale few of these studies have quantified the relative contributions of hydrological fluxes to twsc at a global scale which is critical for understanding twsc under a changing climate the aims of this study are to examine the responses of twsc to precipitation p evapotranspiration et and runoff r in the global 168 major river basins and to quantify the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc in each basin based on hierarchical partitioning hp analysis to reduce the uncertainties associated with datasets two p datasets three et datasets and one observed r dataset were analyzed here as listed in table 1 the performances of different combinations of p et r datasets in explaining twsc were also evaluated and compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 study regions in this study 168 major river basins covering 66 106 km2 of global continents were selected here for analysis according to scanlon et al 2017 the criteria for basin selection are that 1 basin area is 40 000 km2 and 2 basin radius is 200 km the digital map of the 168 river basins was obtained from the global runoff data centre grdc http grdc bafg de fig 1 in addition following the aridity classification of the united nations environment programme the aridity of each basin was determined by calculating the ratio of 30 yr 1982 2011 mean p and mean potential evapotranspiration pet feng and fu 2013 fig 1 the p and pet datasets were obtained from the climate research union cru pet was calculated by the penman equation saylor 1992 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace data the newly released grace level 2 mascon solutions produced by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the center for space research csr at the university of texas were used here to estimate the monthly tws anomalies twsa the csr mascon solution calculated on equal area geodesic grids of about 120 km 1 at the equator is processed by constraining the original grace level 1 data through the tikhonov regularization method that effectively depresses the north south stripe errors save et al 2016 and is presented on 0 5 0 5 grids the jpl mascon data are constrained by both grace data and a priori information obtained from the near global geophysical models obtaining the same effect of suppressing corresponding errors watkins et al 2015 using downscaling factors calculated by the community land model clm ver 4 0 the coarse 3 3 jpl mascon data is then downscaled to 1 1 and resampled to 0 5 0 5 detailed descriptions of approaches to processing csr and jpl mascon products can be found in studies by watkins et al 2015 and save et al 2016 here the monthly twsa series from jan 2003 to dec 2011 was averaged from jpl mascon and csr mascon missing records for several months were replaced by averaging the values of adjacent months andrew et al 2017 long et al 2015 mo et al 2016 2 2 2 precipitation two monthly p datasets were used for analysis obtained from the climatic research unit cru http data ceda ac uk badc cru time series version 4 00 defined as pcru and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data gpcc html defined as pgpcc respectively the pcru dataset provides global 0 5 month by month precipitation data for the period 1901 2014 harris et al 2014 the 0 5 pgpcc dataset during 1901 2013 was produced by compiling monthly precipitation observations from more than 70 000 stations across the world schneider et al 2014 2 2 3 evapotranspiration in situ et observations can be obtained only from individual stations or regional studies therefore large scale et investigations still rely on estimations from satellite observations or simulations from land surface models in this study et of river basins was derived from three datasets 1 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis et product mod16a2 http files ntsg umt edu data ntsg products mod16 2 et estimations produced by jung et al 2009 based on in situ fluxnet observations https www bgcjena mpg de geodb projects filedetails php and 3 et products simulated by the noah vic clm and mosaic models with forcing by gldas 1 0 https hydro1 gesdisc eosdis nasa gov data gldas the three et products are identified using the following subscripts etmodis etjung and etgldas the etmodis product with a spatial resolution of 0 5 was estimated using the penman monteith equation mu et al 2011 with inputs from modis retrievals and provides global monthly et values from 2000 to 2014 this product has been widely used in research on land surface ecological and hydrological processes luus et al 2013 mishra et al 2015 the global 0 5 etjung product covering the period 1982 to 2011 was simulated through a machine learning method the model tree ensemble which is trained with global in situ fluxnet observations jung et al 2009 based on this dataset jung et al 2010 investigated the global trend and attributes of et gldas provides monthly et simulations from 1979 to present the global 1 etgldas data were averaged from outputs of noah vic clm and mosaic models covering the period 2003 to 2011 the accuracy of the etgldas has been validated by several studies for example khan et al 2018 evaluated the uncertainties in et based on gleam gldas and mod16 they found that the three products exhibited reasonable accuracy compared with in situ actual evapotranspiration within asia rodell et al 2004 compared global et datasets by classifying them into four categories 1 diagnostic datasets 2 lsm datasets 3 reanalysis datasets and 4 ipcc ar4 datasets the results revealed that the patterns of mean values are highly congruent across all categories 2 2 4 runoff the long term observed runoff data were obtained from grdc as the majority of basins suffer some proportion of missing data the simple method proposed by dai 2016 was used to fill data gaps correlations were firstly calculated between observed runoff and precipitation model simulated runoff and the palmer drought severity index whichever showed the highest correlation coefficient was then used to fill gaps in the observed runoff data using linear regression in total runoff data for 168 basins were available for the study period jan 2003 dec 2011 ozdogan et al 2010 sneeuw et al 2014 considering the data availability for all datasets the period of jan 2003 dec 2011 was selected for analysis in this study 2 3 methods 2 3 1 calculation of twsc the water balance equation in a given basin can be expressed as follows 1 d s d t t 1 t p t 1 t e t t 1 t r where s is total water storage d s d t is twsc for a specific period t p is precipitation et is actual evapotranspiration and r is runoff according to eq 1 it is clear that twsc is determined by changes in p et and r for comparison twsc was also calculated by water balance equation here twscp et r twsa refers to the residual storage at a given time with respect to the storage at a reference time rodell et al 2009 in addition to the grace based twsa the performance of gldas based twsa was also investigated in this study the gldas based twsa was calculated as the sum of the anomalies of individual components such as canopy water storage anomalies cwsa soil moisture storage anomalies smsa snow water equivalent anomalies swea and surface water storage anomalies swsa which were determined as the difference of canopy water storage cws soil moisture storage sms snow water equivalent swe and surface water storage sws and the corresponding the average of cws sms swe and sws for the period january 2003 to december 2011 respectively the difference of twsa at the two joint time is named as twsc moiwo et al 2012 2011 here the double difference derivation of grace based twsa and gldas based twsa were used to estimate twsc derived from grace and gldas based twsc at a monthly scale cm month long et al 2014 respectively as follows 2 t w s c d s d t d t w s a d t t w s a t 1 t w s a t 1 2 δ t 2 3 2 trend analysis as a common non parametric test the mann kendall rank based test is used here to detect trends for twsc time series humphrey et al 2016 this method proposed by mann 1945 and improved by kendall 1975 has frequently been used in trend analysis of hydrological and meteorological variables aziz and burn 2006 burn and elnur 2002 gocic and trajkovic 2013 the significance of twsc trends was evaluated at p 0 05 2 3 3 partial correlation analysis and autocorrelation test the response of twsc to p et and r was examined by partial correlation analysis which excludes the influence of other factors on correlations between two variables the significance of correlations was evaluated at p 0 05 before running the correlation analysis durbin watson statistics durbin and watson 1971 were used to test for temporal autocorrelation in the p et r and twsc time series and then the first order difference method was applied to eliminate autocorrelations anderson 1942 2 3 4 hierarchical partitioning analysis hp analysis proposed by chevan and sutherland 1991 was used here to quantify the relative contributions of p et and r on twsc compared to common methods for determining variable importance using a single model hp measures the importance of each independent variable with respect to the dependent variable as a percentage contribution to the goodness of fit of the multivariate linear regression model hence it is suggested to provide a robust assessment of variable importance and can effectively overcome the collinearity problem existing among two or more explanatory variables the theory of hp can be expressed by the following equation chevan and sutherland 1991 3 b 1 n r b b 1 n i b b 1 n j b where r is the goodness of fit between dependent and independent variables in regression analysis i and j are the independent and joint components of r respectively and n is the number of independent variables in regression analysis for any independent variable such as m rm im jm im refers to that part of the percentage of the degree of fitting of m to dependent variables whereas jm refers to the remaining percentage of the degree of fitting of m to other independent variables chevan and sutherland 1991 the hp analysis was carried out with r software as two p datasets and three et datasets were available hp analysis was performed between twsc and six different p et r combinations 2 3 5 estimation of uncertainties twsa errors in the jpl dataset can be attributed to measurement errors and leakage errors which have been provided in associated products errors in the csr dataset are considered to be the twsa residuals after the long term annual and semiannual trends have been removed from the original signal scanlon et al 2017 standard linear least squares regression was applied to decompose the long term annual and semiannual trends from the original signal details of which can be found in wahr et al 2006 and hirsch and slack 1984 the uncertainty in twsc is calculated from twsa according to the error propagation law in eq 1 rodell et al 2004 details about estimates of uncertainties can be found in wahr et al 2006 and wiese et al 2016 uncertainties in the three et datasets two p datasets and twsc data from two grace products were estimated as the standard deviations longuevergne et al 2010 pan et al 2017 yang et al 2015 3 results 3 1 response of twsc to precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff fig 2 shows the trend in twsa variations for the period of jan 2003 dec 2011 for 168 river basins a total of 49 basins p 0 05 shown significant increasing trends including the yangtze mississippi and yenisei basins etc in contrast significant decreases in twsa p 0 05 were observed in 42 basins such as the yellow river ganges and indus basins this pattern was similar to that reported by rodell et al 2018 long et al 2017 reager et al 2016 and scanlon et al 2016 etc in addition it was reasonably consistent with some regional scale investigations ahmed et al 2014 asoka et al 2017 tang et al 2013 then the responses of twsc to p et and r were determined using partial correlation analysis before this analysis the temporal auto correlation in the time series of twsc p et and r was first tested significant first order auto correlations were observed for all time series indicating potential impacts on the results of correlation analysis after eliminating auto correlations by the first order difference method partial correlations between twsc p et and r for the period jan 2003 dec 2011 were calculated basin by basin the distributions of correlation coefficients between twsc and p presented similar patterns with different p et r combinations figs 3 a s1 s3 consistent with syed et al 2008 a general positive relationship was observed between twsc and p for most basins most basins in low latitudes showed strong positive correlations including the amazon congo and nile basins etc weaker relationships were observed in mid latitude and high latitude basins the mean partial correlation coefficient of all twsc p combinations for all the basins was 0 523 0 024 significant negative correlations between twsc and et were shown in most mid and high latitude basins especially for the northern america figs 3b s1 s3 such as the mississippi and yenisei basins however in the lower latitude basins weak positive relationships were observed such as in the amazon basin and congo basin etc the average correlation coefficient between twsc and the three et datasets for the basins was 0 401 0 043 a general negative relationship between twsc and r was observed over most basins and strong negative relationships were identified in the northern high latitudes figs 3c s1 s3 interestingly we also found that negative correlation coefficients between twsc and r in basins of northern asia are larger than those in northern america according to the water balance equation eq 1 a negative relationship between twsc and r can be expected however positive relationships were also observed in some low latitude basins such as the congo basin murray basin indus basin and ganges basin although this phenomenon has been reported by previous studies frappart et al 2013 soni and syed 2015 few of them had provided the reasons we speculated this abnormal twsc r relationship should be induced by 1 human associated activities such as irrigation practices construction of channels and dams etc which disrupt water balance within basins 2 influences from other water fluxes such as snowmelt which cause the covariation of twsc and r 3 uncertainties caused by datasets for example pcru etjung r combination suggested a higher stronger positive relationship for twsc and r than that of pgpcc etmodis r combination to test the potential uncertainty of correlation analysis caused by the choice of lengths of time sequence we also performed the partial correlation analysis for the periods jan 2003 dec 2009 figs s4 s6 and table s1 and jan 2005 dec 2011 figs s7 s9 and table s1 although these periods differ comparable correlation coefficients and patterns were obtained for most of the basins confirming the basic relationships of twsc with p et and r established in this study 3 2 the relative contributions of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff to twsc based on the hp analysis the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc were determined for each basin for different p et r dataset combinations table 2 lists all values of averaged explained variance r2 for multivariate regression models of different p et r combinations as well as the corresponding independent contributions of p et and r to twsc in spite of the marked differences between the data sources the six models built from different p et r combinations present comparable values of r2 approximately 0 614 0 024 suggesting the relatively strong performance of models in explaining twsc the maximum r2 value 0 638 was given by the model built between twsc and pgpcc etjung r combination in addition the spatial distributions of r2 for each model show similar patterns figs 4 and s10 the higher values of r2 were concentrated in several low latitude basins such as the amazon nile parana yangtze and congo river basins whereas relatively low values of r2 were observed in high latitude basins such as the mississippi basin and lena basin etc in addition the r2 and the relative contribution of p et and r to gldas based twsc were also quantified figs s14 s17 the spatial pattern of the degree of explanations of p et and r to gldas based twsc fig s14 were similar to that of twsc derived from grace figs 4 and s10 but the averaged degree of explanation r2 0 631 0 05 was slightly higher than the later over global 168 basins this is not surprising because gldas based twsc is estimated strictly following the water balance equation and incorporates climate and vegetation information overlapping with datasets used in this study after differencing the r2 of grace based twsc and gldas based twsc fig s18 we also found that the r2 of gldas based twsc was underestimated in some basins such as the congo basin indus basin ganges basin and the northern of mississippi basin etc it may be related to the absence of ground water storage in gldas lsms scanlon et al 2019 syed et al 2008 or the uncertainties of gldas caused by deficits of lsms or uncertainties of climate forcing data syed et al 2008 for all 168 basins the average relative contributions of all p et r combination to grace based twsc were 42 6 2 81 43 2 2 7 and 14 2 1 9 respectively the similar spatial patterns were shown for different p et r combinations figs 5 s11 s13 taking pcru etmodis r as an example fig 5 we found that p has a larger contribution in low latitude basins especially in tropical basins such as the amazon and congo river basins in contrast a larger contribution of et was identified in mid and high latitudes such as for the mississippi mackenzie yenisei and lena river basins compared with p and et r has a smaller contribution to twsc a larger contribution of r was identified in mid and high latitudes than in low latitudes especially for the yenisei lena and ob basins an interesting phenomenon was that although larger contributions of et and r to twsc are observed in mid and high latitudes than in low latitudes the largest contributions of et are observed in northern america and in europe but for r in northern asia hp analysis was also performed for the periods jan 2003 dec 2009 table s2 figs s19 s22 and jan 2005 dec 2011 table s3 figs s23 s26 no apparent differences were observed either for the relative contribution of p et and r to twsc or in their spatial patterns compared with the results for the period jan 2003 dec 2011 suggesting few influences of the choice of study period on our results 3 3 the relative contributions of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff to twsc for different climatic regions we further investigated the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc in order to explore their impacts under different climate regions table s4 figs 6 and s27 all basins were classified into 5 group according their corresponding aridity index such as the arid basins semi arid basins sub humid basins humid basins in the mid and high latitudes more than 30 or 30 s and humid basins in the low latitudes 30 s to 30 n the largest r2 values of regression models between twsc and different p et r combinations were found for basins in sub humid regions indicating a high degree of explanation of p et and r to twsc in these regions the lowest r2 values are found in humid basins in mid and high latitudes except for humid regions in low latitudes where the relative contribution of p was lower than that of et the average relative contribution of p et and r can be arrayed as p et r et in humid regions was limited mainly by energy rather than by water conditions mcvicar et al 2012 rodell et al 2011 troy et al 2011 this may explain the observed larger contribution of et compared with p in humid basins in low latitudes with high temperature and solar radiation averaging all p et r combinations table s4 the largest contribution of p to twsc was observed in the humid basins of the middle and high latitude and the smallest contribution was found in arid basins et has the largest contribution to twsc in humid basins of the low latitudes but presents the lowest contribution in humid basins of the middle and high latitude the contribution from r is relatively small and larger value was observed in arid basins shown in the fig s28 was the r2 and the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc in individual basin for different climate areas respectively we found that the r2 and the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc for individual basin were generally consist with the average for different climate areas 3 4 relative contributions of precipitation and evapotranspiration to twsc in some typical basins to confirm the above findings we selected six river basins the amazon basin congo basin lena basin mississippi river basin yangtze basin and murray basin fig 1 to further investigate the relationship between twsc p et and r fig 7 a f shows the seasonal cycle of twsc p et and r averaged from all datasets in the six basins the water balance based twscp et r was also calculated and compared with grace based twsc we observed a general coherent seasonal cycle between these two twsc curves for all the selected basins suggesting a basic reliability of our result however there are also some discernable differences in the variation of twsc amplitude in some basins such as for the lena basin and murray basin etc the differences can be due to several aspects such as the influence of snowmelt in the lena basin dettinger and diaz 2000 hirschi et al 2006 velicogna et al 2012 the uncertainties in datasets used for the twscp et r calculation soni and syed 2015 syed et al 2009 etc in the amazon basin fig 7a according to hp analysis the relative contributions to grace based twsc were 77 7 2 79 for p 18 1 3 0 for r and 4 2 3 1 for et this can be confirmed by the higher consistency of the seasonal cycle of twsc and p the lower magnitudes of the seasonal cycle for r and the negligible seasonal change observed for et in the congo basin fig 7b the seasonal patterns of twsc p and et are similar but twsc seems to be driven mainly by p because of greater magnitude of p this is consistent with the result of the larger contribution of p to twsc 71 9 10 compared with those of et to twsc 16 4 4 8 or of r to twsc 11 7 5 3 in the lena basin fig 7c we observed an opposite seasonal cycle between twsc and p et r in light of previous investigations dettinger and diaz 2000 hirschi et al 2006 velicogna et al 2012 the season cycle of twsc in the lena basin is highly relied on the runoff peak in the may or june which was mostly related to the snowmelt and runoff the relative contributions of p et and r are 17 1 1 06 46 4 1 67 and 36 6 2 1 in this basin respectively for mississippi river basin fig 7d the lowest value for twsc corresponding to the highest value for et occurred in july implying a dominate influence of et on seasonal twsc this can be confirmed by a 84 3 1 1 contribution of et on twsc concluded by this study kebede et al 2014 study suggested that in this basin 70 of the yearly rainfall occurred before the growing season and groundwater extraction for irrigation is needed to meet the crop water need irrigation related et increase may cause the lower twsc in the summer in the yangtze basin fig 7e twsc is controlled mainly by p with a contribution of 69 0 1 2 in the murray basin figs 7f s29 the relative contributions of p et and r were 37 9 6 1 33 9 16 7 and 29 0 18 2 respectively the peak of grace based twsc occurred in june corresponding to the lowest et and a peak of p there seems to be no seasonal cycle of r this is because compared with p and et the annual r is very small 0 62 cm yr hirschi et al 2006 fig s29 the relative high contribution of r 29 0 18 2 may be caused by the uncertainty in datasets we found that different combinations of p et r datasets generate a wide range of values of r s contribution to twsc table s4 4 discussion and conclusions we comprehensively investigated the trends of twsa and the relationships of twsc with p et and r for the period of jan 2003 to dec 2011 for 168 major river basins in this study the spatial patterns of trends in twsa showed good agreement with investigations at global and regional scales ahmed et al 2014 hassan and jin 2016 mo et al 2016 scanlon et al 2017 consistent with the results of previous investigations the twsa showed the increased trend in the amazon basin chen et al 2010 in africa basins such as the zambezi and niger forootan et al 2014 hassan and jin 2016 ramillien et al 2014 and in australia basins such as the lake eyre and murray basins fasullo et al 2013 the twsa increases should be mainly attributed to the increases of precipitation han et al 2019 long et al 2017 reager et al 2016 in addition human induced surface water storage change is also found to promote tws long et al 2017 for example the water impoundment of the three gorges reservoir was suggested to increase tws in the central yangtze river basin long et al 2015 decreases in twsa were observed for 42 basins some substantial reductions in twsa correspond well with regional studies of the groundwater depletion due to the water demand through pumping exceed the water supply through recharge scanlon et al 2012 such as in the north china plain feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 and the indus basin in northern india chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 which indicated the strong impacts of anthropogenic activities furthermore the melting of continuous perennial snow and glacier due to climate warming is also an important driver of twsa decreases chen et al 2017 henn et al 2018 long et al 2017 for example chen et al 2017 suggested that the depletion of twsa for the period 2003 2014 in the upper brahmaputra river basin may be due to shrinking of the snow and glacier similar conditions were also found in some basins in the northern america such as the yukon basin and mackenzie river basin jacob et al 2012 long et al 2017 according to the water balance equation twsc should be determined by changes in p et and r disregarding any disturbances by human activities p as the only input flux to the terrestrial water storage shows a generally positive relationship to twsc the influence of p on twsc could be further attributed to large scale atmospheric circulation reager et al 2016 for example a robust positive twsc p relationship has been found in enso impacted areas fasullo et al 2013 sun et al 2016 such as the murray basin et and r act as a negative flux in the terrestrial water balance show a negative impact on twsc with the most robust impacts being found in mid and high latitude basins such as the mississippi lena and yenisei basins these findings are roughly consistent with the results of a global investigation performed by syed et al 2008 which explored the drivers of gldas based twsc their study suggested that twsc in high latitudes is forced by snowmelt runoff while p dominates twsc in the tropics and et drives twsc in mid latitude basins in contrast to their study we observed less positive relationships between twsc and et and r particularly in low latitudes which seems to be more reasonable according water balance equation implying a higher uncertainty of gldas based twsc than that of observed twsc simple correlation analysis could not represent the true contributions of hydrological fluxes to twsc hence more importantly we quantified the relative contributions of p et and r to twsc using multivariate regression models and hp analysis averaging the degree of explanation of 168 basins for all p et r combinations we found that p et and r explained more than 60 of twsc suggesting the dominant influence of the hydrological fluxes to twsc this was supported by reager et al 2016 which suggested that long term or large scale twsc is controlled mainly by natural factors in addition we considered that the remaining unexplained may be due to the influences of groundwater withdrawals return flow snowmelt and human activities döll et al 2012 furthermore we observed a contrasting pattern of the r2 between low and high latitude basins the higher values of r2 are concentrated in several low latitude basins such as the amazon nile parana yangtze and congo river basins whereas relatively low values of r2 are observed in high latitude basins the lower r2 in some high latitude basins such as yenisei basin and ob basin might be due to the influence of snowmelt on twsc troy et al 2011 in addition some basins such as the mississippi basin experienced strong human activities and the lower r2 could be attributed to the groundwater extraction which has not been reflected in the currently used water budget components kebede et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 furthermore we observed contrasting patterns in the contributions of p et and r to twsc between low and mid high latitude basins in low latitude basins especially the tropical basins p has a larger contribution to twsc compared with those of et and r whereas in mid high latitude basins et and r has a larger contribution compared with that of p this pattern is roughly consistent with previous investigations at basin scales for example in the tropical amazon basin we observed a dominant influence of p on twsc and lesser contributions of r and et in agreement with the results of crowley et al 2008 at the continental scale we observed that p dominated twsc in south america and africa as previously reported by liu et al 2006 and hassan et al 2016 respectively in particular our result suggests the largest relative contribution of et to twsc are mainly located in basins in the northern america such as the mississippi basin columbia basin mackenzie basin and yukon basin etc according to previous investigations milly and dunne 2001 neal et al 2002 walter et al 2004 in addition to climatological dimension et change in some basins strongly influenced by the human activities for example in the mississippi basin due to the inconformity for the period of rainfall and the crops production irrigation plays an important role to avoid the crops losses kebede et al 2014 irrigation practices through groundwater extraction promote the soil water content and thereby enhance the et ozdogan et al 2010 snipes 2005 this should be the main reason for the large contribution et to twsc in this basin in addition relative large contribution of r to twsc are mainly found the northern asia as reported by hirschi et al 2006 and zhang et al 2017 dettinger and diaz 2000 and hirschi et al 2006 referred that the runoff in the northern asia such as the lena basin yenisei basin and volga basin is mainly generated by the snowmelt the results of this study is essential for the understanding of the natural attributions of twsc and have implications for forecasting tws dynamics under future climate change it should be noted that uncertainties still exist first multi sourced datasets of p and et were used in this study although all p et r combinations showed similar capabilities for explaining global twsc apparent differences were identified at the scale of climatic regions and basins indicating the influences of uncertainties between different datasets the accuracy of products for et is questioned khan et al 2018 liaqat and choi 2017 second the grdc runoff data suffers from serious data missing in some basins the reconstructed runoff using a simple linear regression method should inevitably have some uncertainties in recent years satellite altimetry technique has been developed to retrieve surface water getirana and peters lidard 2013 papa et al 2010 sneeuw et al 2014 for example sneeuw et al 2014 estimated runoff using an empirical functional relation between water level estimated by satellite altimetry and the measured runoff at the gauge stations and suggested this satellite based method outperformed traditional hydrological and hydro meteorological approach methods therefore satellite altimetry can be applied to fill runoff data in our future studies third we found that p et and r explain only a small proportion of twsc in several high latitude basins implying the influences of snowmelt groundwater and permafrost thaw as reported in previous studies döll et al 2012 landerer et al 2010 syed et al 2008 lastly the lagged effects of p and et on twsc were also ignored for example the lagged response of twsc to changes in p in the amazon basin have been widely reported azarderakhsh et al 2011 these issues are to be considered in our future investigations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

ministry of education ocean university of china 238 songling road qingdao 266100 china this manuscript was handled by huaming guo editor in chief with the assistance of bibhash nath associate editor developing numeric nutrient criteria for estuaries and adjacent waters has been exceedingly complex due to the uniqueness of this ecosystem and its dynamic properties to control and improve water quality based on data from 1984 to 2014 a population distribution approach was applied to establish the numeric nutrient criteria for the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters based on the natural geographical characteristics currents effects and biological community features the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters are divided into four sea subareas the transitional zone segment i hangzhou bay segment ii the coastal zone outside of the estuary segment iii and zhoushan adjacent area segment iv the respective recommended criteria for dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and phosphate po4 p were 1 05 1 24 mg l and 0 03 0 036 mg l for estuary segments i and ii and approximately 0 2 mg l and 0 01 mg l for the adjacent water segments iii and iv the dissolved oxygen do criteria are similar for the four segments i e 6 7 mg l the chemical oxygen demand codmn criteria for segments iii and iv 0 56 0 59 mg l are much lower than those for segments i and ii 1 04 1 15 mg l the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp criteria for segments i and ii 1 56 1 85 mg l and 0 060 0 072 mg l respectively are much higher than those for segments iii and iv 0 27 0 29 mg l and 0 023 0 028 mg l respectively the proposed criteria were reasonable and reliable based on validation using nutrient algal bloom sensitivity and comparison with current sea water quality standards and previous studies keywords nutrient criteria population distribution approach nutrient algal bloom sensitivity yangtze river estuary 1 introduction eutrophication an enrichment of coastal waters by nutrients such as n and p is becoming increasingly serious worldwide leading to the frequent occurrence of undesirable harmful algae blooms habs and seriously impacting aquatic ecosystems and water uses anderson et al 2008 davidson et al 2014 glibert et al 2005 gowen et al 2012 howarth et al 2011 lewitus et al 2012 the chinese coastal waters which consist of mostly closed and semiclosed shelf sea are easily vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic perturbations resulting in serious cultural eutrophication especially in estuaries and bays liu et al 2013 qian et al 2018 strokal et al 2014 wang 2006 wang et al 2016 yin et al 2014 there are no available and suitable standard for estuaries in china which are located in a mixed zone of freshwater and seawater because sea water quality standards gb 3097 1997 and environment quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 are set for sea water and inland surface freshwater respectively nutrient criteria are defined as the maximum acceptable concentrations that could not threaten a particular designated beneficial use of the waterbody us epa 1998 the formulation and application of nutrient criteria are not only measures to effectively prevent water eutrophication but also scientific bases for the comprehensive monitoring evaluation and management of estuarine nutrients meng et al 2008 thus it is necessary and urgent to develop estuarine nutrient criteria providing scientific theories and methods for the establishment of the corresponding standards wu et al 2010 for developing numeric nutrient criteria the united states has released a series of peer reviewed technical guidance documents to address nitrogen phosphorus pollution in different water body types e g lakes and reservoirs rivers and streams estuarine and coastal marine waters and wetlands us epa 2000a b 2001 2008 three types of scientifically defensible approaches the reference condition approach mechanistic modeling and the stressor response analysis were recommended for setting regional numeric nutrient criteria hausmann et al 2016 heatherly 2014 us epa 2010 to control water eutrophication the european union also developed nutrient criteria strategies bouleau and pont 2015 poikāne et al 2010 solheim 2005 based on the defensible empirical nutrient criteria approaches some progress has been made in establishing region specific nutrient criteria for lakes in china huo et al 2012 huo et al 2015a b huo et al 2017 huo et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 however with regard to developing estuarine nutrient criteria few systematic studies have been conducted a population distribution approach was applied to build a reference state and establish nutrient criteria in estuaries and adjacent waters hu et al 2011 su et al 2016 zheng et al 2013a b because they are considered the most vital estuary classification and delineation as well as reference condition determination are specifically addressed meng et al 2008 on the basis of the segmentation of the jiulong river estuary liu et al 2018a used reference conditions statistical model analysis and cumulative frequency distributions to determine nutrient criteria according to the stress response relationship model of diatom biomass and nutrients yang et al 2016 developed the nutrient criteria for the daliaohe river estuary the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters have suffered from serious eutrophication for the past decades due to elevated riverine nutrients dai et al 2011 zhang et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 from 1963 to 2004 the nitrate and phosphate concentrations increased from 0 15 to 1 36 mg l and from 0 012 to 0 029 mg l respectively chai et al 2006 the frequency and area of red tide outbreaks are increasing significantly li et al 2014 liu et al 2013 wang 2006 for example red tides occurred 174 times from 1972 to 2009 25 instances of which were larger than 1000 km2 therefore to control and improve water quality and provide effective management measures it is urgent and crucial to establish effective nutrient criteria based on the data of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters from 1984 to 2014 the aims of this study were 1 to establish nutrient criteria by the population distribution approach and 2 to verify the nutrient criteria on the basis of nutrient algal bloom sensitivity this study forms a preliminary contribution to the nutrient monitoring evaluation and management of estuaries and coastal marine waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters are located at the junction of the east china sea and the yellow sea on the continental shelf at the western rim of the pacific ocean fig 1 a receiving 890 km3 of fresh water and 3 97 1011 kg of sediment annually from the yangtze river it is a mesotidal estuary with an average tidal amplitude of 2 8 m and a maximum of more than 5 m chai et al 2006 the yangtze river estuary and its adjacent sea area is a highly dynamic system mainly comprised of the yangtze river diluted water cdw as well as coastal currents fan and song 2014 morphology tidal amplitude salinity and circulation are natural factors that strongly influence the overall nutrient status of estuaries and coastal water systems based on the natural geographical characteristics the effects of currents and the features of different biological communities the yangtze river estuary is divided into four sea subareas the transitional zone segment i hangzhou bay segment ii the coastal zone outside of the estuary segment iii and zhoushan adjacent area segment iv fig 1a liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2003 given that the red tides occurred the most frequently in segments iii and iv 29 32 n 122 124 e liu et al 2013 tang 2009 this area was called the whole sea area the available numbers of data in different segments are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 2 data sources the recent data used in this study are derived from observations taken during 4 cruises august 2011 august 2013 february july 2014 from 2011 to 2014 in the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters fig 1b historical data were collected from unpublished survey data from 1984 to 2007 most surveys were carried out in the spring april summer july august and autumn november from 1984 to 2000 and during every season for each year after 2000 the sampling and analytical methods arestrictly based on standard methods gb 17378 4 2007 grasshoff et al 1983 1999 which ensured that the data were comparable throughout the study period the survey parameters included phosphate po4 p nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonia nh4 n dissolved oxygen do chlorophyll a chla and chemical oxygen demand codmn po4 p no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were measured using phosphate molybdenum the cadmium copper reduction method the standard pink azo dye method and the indophenol blue method after the water was filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane the detection limits for po4 p no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were 3 1 10 4 2 8 10 4 2 8 10 4 and 4 2 10 4 mg l respectively the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration was calculated as the sum of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured by alkaline potassium peroxodisulfate oxidation colorimetry grasshoff et al 1999 chla was extracted with acetone and analyzed with a fluorometric method and the detection limit was 0 01 µg l after the water was filtered through gf f filters which were precombusted at 450 c for 4 h do and codmn were measured using the winkler titration method and the potassium permanganate alkaline method respectively in particular the hangzhou bay data codmn data and do data of the transition zone were only from 1984 to 2007 the mean values of each nutrient measured at the stations in each of the four seasons were calculated and used to represent the annual mean nutrient concentrations tomake the data appear symmetrically distributed the ln log base e approximately 2 71828 transformation was applied to the values of din and chla of the yangtze river estuary adjacent waters the drawing software origin 8 5 was used for data analysis and figure creation 2 3 analytical approach the reference condition method is suitable for watersheds with minimal or unimpaired sites and reference sites in the upper 25th percentile are commonly used to develop nutrient criteria if reference sites are lacking the population distribution method can serve as an alternative to the reference distribution method the population distribution method does not involve the identification of reference sites and uses the entire population of a region to determine nutrient criteria one percentile from the lower 5th to 25th percentiles of the population sites has been commonly suggested as a threshold for criteria determination us epa 2000a moreover a criterion based on the lower 25th percentile which was the 25th percentile of the accumulative frequency of all the sampled streams was proposed for regions without minimally impacted systems and was expected to be a reasonably close approximation of the reference 75th percentile us epa 1998 due to the heavy input of waste loads from watersheds and human activities the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters have been seriously polluted liu et al 2013 wang 2006 therefore the lower 25th percentile of the population frequency distribution was used to develop the nutrient criteria 2 4 causal and response indicator variables in general the primary variables include the causal variables such as tn tp din and po4 p and the response variables including a measure of algal biomass e g chla for phytoplankton or macroalgal biomass ash free dry weight afdw and water clarity secchi depth sd with the addition of do and codmn as appropriate hu et al 2011 liu et al 2018a us epa 2001 zheng et al 2013a b increases in nutrient concentrations lead to the proliferation of phytoplankton which increases phytoplankton density and decreases sd and do the nutrient criteria technical guidance manual estuarine and coastal marine waters 2001 recommended that tn and tp were the principal causative agents while chla sd and do were

ministry of education ocean university of china 238 songling road qingdao 266100 china this manuscript was handled by huaming guo editor in chief with the assistance of bibhash nath associate editor developing numeric nutrient criteria for estuaries and adjacent waters has been exceedingly complex due to the uniqueness of this ecosystem and its dynamic properties to control and improve water quality based on data from 1984 to 2014 a population distribution approach was applied to establish the numeric nutrient criteria for the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters based on the natural geographical characteristics currents effects and biological community features the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters are divided into four sea subareas the transitional zone segment i hangzhou bay segment ii the coastal zone outside of the estuary segment iii and zhoushan adjacent area segment iv the respective recommended criteria for dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and phosphate po4 p were 1 05 1 24 mg l and 0 03 0 036 mg l for estuary segments i and ii and approximately 0 2 mg l and 0 01 mg l for the adjacent water segments iii and iv the dissolved oxygen do criteria are similar for the four segments i e 6 7 mg l the chemical oxygen demand codmn criteria for segments iii and iv 0 56 0 59 mg l are much lower than those for segments i and ii 1 04 1 15 mg l the total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp criteria for segments i and ii 1 56 1 85 mg l and 0 060 0 072 mg l respectively are much higher than those for segments iii and iv 0 27 0 29 mg l and 0 023 0 028 mg l respectively the proposed criteria were reasonable and reliable based on validation using nutrient algal bloom sensitivity and comparison with current sea water quality standards and previous studies keywords nutrient criteria population distribution approach nutrient algal bloom sensitivity yangtze river estuary 1 introduction eutrophication an enrichment of coastal waters by nutrients such as n and p is becoming increasingly serious worldwide leading to the frequent occurrence of undesirable harmful algae blooms habs and seriously impacting aquatic ecosystems and water uses anderson et al 2008 davidson et al 2014 glibert et al 2005 gowen et al 2012 howarth et al 2011 lewitus et al 2012 the chinese coastal waters which consist of mostly closed and semiclosed shelf sea are easily vulnerable to the effects of anthropogenic perturbations resulting in serious cultural eutrophication especially in estuaries and bays liu et al 2013 qian et al 2018 strokal et al 2014 wang 2006 wang et al 2016 yin et al 2014 there are no available and suitable standard for estuaries in china which are located in a mixed zone of freshwater and seawater because sea water quality standards gb 3097 1997 and environment quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 are set for sea water and inland surface freshwater respectively nutrient criteria are defined as the maximum acceptable concentrations that could not threaten a particular designated beneficial use of the waterbody us epa 1998 the formulation and application of nutrient criteria are not only measures to effectively prevent water eutrophication but also scientific bases for the comprehensive monitoring evaluation and management of estuarine nutrients meng et al 2008 thus it is necessary and urgent to develop estuarine nutrient criteria providing scientific theories and methods for the establishment of the corresponding standards wu et al 2010 for developing numeric nutrient criteria the united states has released a series of peer reviewed technical guidance documents to address nitrogen phosphorus pollution in different water body types e g lakes and reservoirs rivers and streams estuarine and coastal marine waters and wetlands us epa 2000a b 2001 2008 three types of scientifically defensible approaches the reference condition approach mechanistic modeling and the stressor response analysis were recommended for setting regional numeric nutrient criteria hausmann et al 2016 heatherly 2014 us epa 2010 to control water eutrophication the european union also developed nutrient criteria strategies bouleau and pont 2015 poikāne et al 2010 solheim 2005 based on the defensible empirical nutrient criteria approaches some progress has been made in establishing region specific nutrient criteria for lakes in china huo et al 2012 huo et al 2015a b huo et al 2017 huo et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 however with regard to developing estuarine nutrient criteria few systematic studies have been conducted a population distribution approach was applied to build a reference state and establish nutrient criteria in estuaries and adjacent waters hu et al 2011 su et al 2016 zheng et al 2013a b because they are considered the most vital estuary classification and delineation as well as reference condition determination are specifically addressed meng et al 2008 on the basis of the segmentation of the jiulong river estuary liu et al 2018a used reference conditions statistical model analysis and cumulative frequency distributions to determine nutrient criteria according to the stress response relationship model of diatom biomass and nutrients yang et al 2016 developed the nutrient criteria for the daliaohe river estuary the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters have suffered from serious eutrophication for the past decades due to elevated riverine nutrients dai et al 2011 zhang et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 from 1963 to 2004 the nitrate and phosphate concentrations increased from 0 15 to 1 36 mg l and from 0 012 to 0 029 mg l respectively chai et al 2006 the frequency and area of red tide outbreaks are increasing significantly li et al 2014 liu et al 2013 wang 2006 for example red tides occurred 174 times from 1972 to 2009 25 instances of which were larger than 1000 km2 therefore to control and improve water quality and provide effective management measures it is urgent and crucial to establish effective nutrient criteria based on the data of the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters from 1984 to 2014 the aims of this study were 1 to establish nutrient criteria by the population distribution approach and 2 to verify the nutrient criteria on the basis of nutrient algal bloom sensitivity this study forms a preliminary contribution to the nutrient monitoring evaluation and management of estuaries and coastal marine waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters are located at the junction of the east china sea and the yellow sea on the continental shelf at the western rim of the pacific ocean fig 1 a receiving 890 km3 of fresh water and 3 97 1011 kg of sediment annually from the yangtze river it is a mesotidal estuary with an average tidal amplitude of 2 8 m and a maximum of more than 5 m chai et al 2006 the yangtze river estuary and its adjacent sea area is a highly dynamic system mainly comprised of the yangtze river diluted water cdw as well as coastal currents fan and song 2014 morphology tidal amplitude salinity and circulation are natural factors that strongly influence the overall nutrient status of estuaries and coastal water systems based on the natural geographical characteristics the effects of currents and the features of different biological communities the yangtze river estuary is divided into four sea subareas the transitional zone segment i hangzhou bay segment ii the coastal zone outside of the estuary segment iii and zhoushan adjacent area segment iv fig 1a liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2003 given that the red tides occurred the most frequently in segments iii and iv 29 32 n 122 124 e liu et al 2013 tang 2009 this area was called the whole sea area the available numbers of data in different segments are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 2 data sources the recent data used in this study are derived from observations taken during 4 cruises august 2011 august 2013 february july 2014 from 2011 to 2014 in the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters fig 1b historical data were collected from unpublished survey data from 1984 to 2007 most surveys were carried out in the spring april summer july august and autumn november from 1984 to 2000 and during every season for each year after 2000 the sampling and analytical methods arestrictly based on standard methods gb 17378 4 2007 grasshoff et al 1983 1999 which ensured that the data were comparable throughout the study period the survey parameters included phosphate po4 p nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n ammonia nh4 n dissolved oxygen do chlorophyll a chla and chemical oxygen demand codmn po4 p no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were measured using phosphate molybdenum the cadmium copper reduction method the standard pink azo dye method and the indophenol blue method after the water was filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane the detection limits for po4 p no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were 3 1 10 4 2 8 10 4 2 8 10 4 and 4 2 10 4 mg l respectively the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration was calculated as the sum of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were measured by alkaline potassium peroxodisulfate oxidation colorimetry grasshoff et al 1999 chla was extracted with acetone and analyzed with a fluorometric method and the detection limit was 0 01 µg l after the water was filtered through gf f filters which were precombusted at 450 c for 4 h do and codmn were measured using the winkler titration method and the potassium permanganate alkaline method respectively in particular the hangzhou bay data codmn data and do data of the transition zone were only from 1984 to 2007 the mean values of each nutrient measured at the stations in each of the four seasons were calculated and used to represent the annual mean nutrient concentrations tomake the data appear symmetrically distributed the ln log base e approximately 2 71828 transformation was applied to the values of din and chla of the yangtze river estuary adjacent waters the drawing software origin 8 5 was used for data analysis and figure creation 2 3 analytical approach the reference condition method is suitable for watersheds with minimal or unimpaired sites and reference sites in the upper 25th percentile are commonly used to develop nutrient criteria if reference sites are lacking the population distribution method can serve as an alternative to the reference distribution method the population distribution method does not involve the identification of reference sites and uses the entire population of a region to determine nutrient criteria one percentile from the lower 5th to 25th percentiles of the population sites has been commonly suggested as a threshold for criteria determination us epa 2000a moreover a criterion based on the lower 25th percentile which was the 25th percentile of the accumulative frequency of all the sampled streams was proposed for regions without minimally impacted systems and was expected to be a reasonably close approximation of the reference 75th percentile us epa 1998 due to the heavy input of waste loads from watersheds and human activities the yangtze river estuary and adjacent waters have been seriously polluted liu et al 2013 wang 2006 therefore the lower 25th percentile of the population frequency distribution was used to develop the nutrient criteria 2 4 causal and response indicator variables in general the primary variables include the causal variables such as tn tp din and po4 p and the response variables including a measure of algal biomass e g chla for phytoplankton or macroalgal biomass ash free dry weight afdw and water clarity secchi depth sd with the addition of do and codmn as appropriate hu et al 2011 liu et al 2018a us epa 2001 zheng et al 2013a b increases in nutrient concentrations lead to the proliferation of phytoplankton which increases phytoplankton density and decreases sd and do the nutrient criteria technical guidance manual estuarine and coastal marine waters 2001 recommended that tn and tp were the principal causative agents while chla sd and do were

6053,rainfall events have been reported of great influence on concentration and flux of aquatic organic carbon but little is known in ditch water of peatlands in this work we chose a ditch located in a peatland of zoige basin in northeastern qinghai tibet plateau and studied the response of organic carbon in dissolved form doc and in particulate form poc to rainfall events with varying intensity organic carbon dynamics during four rainfall events were recorded in the growing season of 2016 during events evident but different trends in both poc and doc were observed poc steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations following the discharge peaks and followed by steep decrease while dilution effect on doc was observed different temporal patterns between poc and doc indicated that they were transported through different flow paths the dilution in doc was attributed to rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff rainwater directly fell into the ditch and mixed with ditch water and sampling uncertainties rainfall intensity had strong influence on organic carbon the higher rainfall intensity the higher fluctuation and higher maximum value as well as mean value of poc doc concentration the investigation of the response of organic carbon to rainfall events and the mechanisms responsible is important for assessing impacts on peatland ecosystem processes keywords aquatic organic carbon dilution effect drainage ditch organic carbon concentration rainfall events zoige basin 1 introduction aquatic organic carbon oc is imported from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as a result of the interaction between hydrological and biogeochemical processes in soils and in water hornberger et al 1994 stutter et al 2011 thus its dynamics reflects largely processes in the catchments and can be considered as an indicator of environmental changes hejzlar et al 2003 therefore study on aquatic oc is important to understand the responses of catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry to climate changes and human activities although land use change is the dominate control over aquatic oc export over the last century climate variations and extreme events e g flood and drought are primarily responsible for its short term interannual seasonal or even shorter period dynamics tian et al 2015 changes in rainfall events can reflect climate change and can induce extreme weather hence rainfall events are particularly important with respect to the study on aquatic oc previous studies on response of aquatic oc to rainfall events were mostly conducted in catchments of first or second order streams e g dhillon and inamdar 2014 and have provided several insights first rainfall events are major contributors to oc flux because they mobilize large amounts of oc into stream networks in some boreal catchments about 31 66 of the total annual oc export was observed during a single rainfall event hinton et al 1997 eimers et al 2008 short duration and intensive rainfall events occupy 24 of the time could account for even 50 of the annual oc flux buffam et al 2001 inamdar et al 2006 second in most cases oc concentration behaved in the similar manner as discharge i e first increases and then followed by decreases unimodal and they always reached peaks concurrently e g seybold and mcglynn 2018 third there are however certain distinct discrepancies between different catchments and between different rainfall events of the same catchment in some studies e g jeong et al 2012 at a given discharge oc was lower on the falling limb than on the rising limb creating a clockwise c q concentration discharge loop while in other cases e g oeurng et al 2011 an anticlockwise loop was observed because of the hysteresis effect as a result of initial pulse of dilute water from the upstream catchment eckard et al 2017 dilution trajectory in oc because of rapid runoff clark et al 2008 has been found in previous studies e g laudon et al 2004 making a bimodal curve of oc concentration i e first increases and then decreases because of dilution effect followed by increases again before decreases moreover components of oc response to rainfall events in different ways particulate organic carbon poc generally tends to peak earlier than dissolved organic carbon doc coynel et al 2005 new poc stocks can be continually mobilized by soil erosion while doc supply may not keep up with the rate of runoff increase dhillon and inamdar 2013 the above mentioned achievements suggest that both oc flux and concentration are sensitivity to rainfall events this is linked to the fact that carbon source areas and flow paths during stormflows differ from during baseflows galloway et al 2001 in well drained soils low flow passes through the lower mineral layers where oc is absorbed and high flow passes through the organic rich soil horizons following rainfall clark et al 2008 the transition of carbon source area and flow path is not only affected by precipitation but also by land use arvola et al 2004 microbial and vegetation productivity dinsmore et al 2013 antecedent hydrological conditions grieve 1991 and catchment physiography billett et al 2006 all of which are further under the influence of temperature worrall and burt 2004 topography musolff et al 2018 and hydrology clark et al 2007 this multi factor involved cause effect chain regulates oc concentration dynamically during rainfall events and perhaps can explain why at event scale oc behaves variously in different areas terrestrial aquatic linkage controls stream biogeochemistry butturini and sabater 2000 artificial drainage significantly changes soil stream connectivity and thus influences aquatic oc dynamics li et al 2018 however in terms of flux and concentration the sensitivity of aquatic oc to rainfall has not been discussed much in artificial drainage systems e g ditches while a lot of papers have been addressed natural streams typically ditch have straighter watercourse and more regular riverbed shape despite the differences in geometrical morphology both ditches and streams receive water and sediment and thus doc and poc from land through surface and subsurface flows dunn and mackay 1996 because i aquatic oc originates largely from terrestrial sources dawson et al 2002 ii surface and subsurface flows link land and ditches streams during rainfall events and iii morphological parameters were suggested to be less important in shaping aquatic oc butturini and sabater 2000 we assumed that oc in drainage ditch water is also sensitivity to rainfall events while ditch morphology may regulate the response of oc to precipitation zoige basin is situated at the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau qtp belongs to the yellow river source region yrsr and is the world s largest alpine peatland and currently stores about 0 48 pg of carbon accounting for 88 of the carbon stored in peatlands of the qtp xue et al 2014 about 1 392 ditches in zoige basin have been excavated since the 1960s and are now draining about 2 000 km2 of peatlands li et al 2018 oc in ditch water of zoige basin is vital for two more reasons first those ditches altered connectivity between peatlands and headwater streams first and second order streams wohl 2017 which are sources of sediments nutrients and biota for high order streams sidle et al 2000 second those ditches were linked with peat soils which yield much more oc than any other soil types arvola et al 2004 in this study we hypothesized that i oc in ditch water is sensitivity to rainfall events with respect to concentration and flux ii different components of oc i e doc and poc have different stormflow patterns to test the hypotheses we selected a typical ditch in zoige peatlands and based our study on field sampling of four rainfall events in 2016 we aimed to find out i response of oc to rainfall events of varying precipitation intensity ii temporal patterns of different components of oc within event based on these findings we further discussed i the role of ditch morphology plays in the response of oc in ditch water to rainfall events and ii differences in oc dynamics between the studied ditch and streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted in zoige basin belongs to the yrsr which located in the northeastern qtp fig 1 a with an average altitude exceeding 3 500 m this area is dominated by alpine climate i e meadow landscape mean annual air temperature 0 7 1 1 c and mean annual precipitation 649 mm mostly concentrated in the growing season may to october two paralleled meandering rivers white river and black river drain this region with the annual average discharge of 98 2 m3 s 1 accounted for 19 6 of the total discharge of the yrsr zoige basin does not have permanent snow so spring snowmelt summer rainfall and underground water are main sources of river water peat soils were formed since the early holocene and now cover over 17 of the area 2 142 km2 with an average storage of 97 649 g m 2 zhou et al 2017 and an average depth of 3 m xiang et al 2009 the peatlands are experiencing severe degradation induced by ditches drainage grazing and natural gully erosion li and gao 2019 because of artificial drainage water table has been declined from 20 40 cm before the 1950s to 15 cm xiang et al 2009 land degradation has also been contributed to succession in vegetation from marsh to meadow and eventually to desert and soil from peat soil to meadow soil and eventually to sandy soil soil organic carbon soc stocked in the 0 10 cm soil layer has been decreased by 16 32 luan et al 2014 and light fraction oc is transforming into heavy fraction oc huo et al 2013 the ditch system in zoige basin consists of over thousands of ditches most of which are in the middle white river and the upper and middle black river fig 1 a these ditches are homogeneous in physical features i e similar size in width loose peat soil banks barely aquatic life and severe headward erosion li et al 2018 they merge into headwater streams which flow into white river and black river and eventually flow into the yellow river mainstream the ditch we studied is located at the middle white river with a drainage area of 4 83 km2 fig 1 b it is 1 213 m in length and has a mean channel gradient of 0 67 the drainage area is wholly covered with peat soils and vegetation is dominated by carex muliensis and carex meyeriana this area is a rangeland for local residents grazing tibetan sheep and yak in the growing season the ditch has loose peat soil banks and the banks are very steep sometimes the slope can exceed 90 degrees fig 1 c the loose and steep banks expose themselves to a condition that are easily to be disturbed because of cattle trampling the ditch has suffered severe bank failure a large amount of bank soil masses was trampled into the ditch water and can be found along the ditch fig 1 c no invertebrates and aquatic vegetations were found in the ditch water 2 2 sampling and measurements here we define a duration of 6 h with no precipitation separates an individual rainfall event from the previous one the four rainfall events were in the growing season of 2016 table 1 these events captured a total precipitation of 83 mm accounting for 14 98 of the precipitation over the growing season in 2016 samples were collected i before rainfall events baseflow periods to establish the background of oc concentrations and ii during the four rainfall events stormflow periods to capture oc dynamics the sampling site was at the lower reach of the ditch about 400 m away from the outlet fig 1 b because this site was nearest to the road we could save time and energy to carry samples from the site to our car before the rainfall events physical and chemical properties of ditch water were measured temperature turbidity conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured by portable multi meter hach hq40d before and during the four rainfall events the ditch was sampled with a time interval of 1 8 h and about 0 5 h respectively at each of the sampling time 2 5 l water was collected in polyethylene wild mouth bottles while 100 ml water was collected in brown narrow mouth bottles the larger volumes were brought back to the hotel and injected through 47 mm glass fiber filter whatman gf f pre combusted in muffle furnace at 500 c for 4 h within 1 2 d the filter residues were then dried and sent to the lab for analysis of poc content using elemental analyzer vario el chns o the smaller volumes were also brought back to the hotel and adjusted to ph 2 by h2so4 analytically pure and then stored in car refrigerator at 18 c before doc analysis on toc analyzer shimadzu toc l in the lab within 7 d because damage happened in samples delivery from hotel to lab and limited to the inevitable logistical constraints the samples didn t cover the whole rainfall event of event i iii and iv for the same reason we have few parallel samples in the results section we used the mean value of parallel samples if any to draw the figures and did not discuss the possible deviations flow velocity was recorded by current meter global water 0 1 m s 1 accuracy hourly rainfall record was from the nearest meteorological station at waqie town about 5 km away from the sampling site 2 3 weibull distribution model since our samples did not cover the whole event of i iii and iv the missing data was extrapolated using an extended weibull distribution model 1 c t r α β â t r μ β α 1 â exp t r μ β α â q r â exp g b where c tr and qr are mean concentration of poc doc and mean discharge at the rth time interval respectively α is the shape factor and g and β are scale factors μ is the curve skewness related to discharge intensity and b is baseflow this is a semi analytical model which employs five variables and two of which were linked to key hydrological properties its effectivity has been proved in describing doc concentration dynamics in the chippewa river catchment usa qiao et al 2017 we made two modifications of the model first because the g parameter in eq 3 of qiao s article was relatively large in our work we replaced it with exp g while kept the same meaning second piecewise functions were employed parameters were calibrated on matlab mathworks matlab 2016b according to 2 var r 1 h i c t r c t r r 1 h i c t r c t r h i 2 h i where var is the variance h i is the number of time interval of the ith sub function c tr is the actual sampling data in the rth time interval the best parameters occurred following the minimum of var goodness of fit was tested by linear correlation 2 4 oc flux during the sampling periods rainwater was the main water source of zoige peatlands thus water depth of the ditch could be estimated according to its correlation with precipitation a linear regression model was expected to describe the relation between daily mean water depth and daily precipitation 3 d i k 1 â p i b 1 where di is the daily mean water depth m d 1 at the ith daily precipitation magnitude 0 1 mm resolution pi is the amount of the ith daily precipitation magnitude mm k1 and b1 are slope and intercept respectively thus the daily discharge of the ditch at the ith precipitation magnitude qi m3 d 1 was calculated by manning strickler formula 4 q i 1 n â w â d i â r i 2 3 â s 1 2 â 3600 â 24 where n 0 035 is the roughness coefficient li et al 2018 w and s are mean ditch width m and channel gradient of the ditch respectively ri is the hydraulic radius m of the ditch at the ith precipitation magnitude calculated as 5 r i w â d i 2 d i w discharge has been reported as probably the single most determinant for aquatic carbon export pastor et al 2003 and linear regression model has been used at catchment scale and shown great goodness of fitting e g hinton et al 1997 thus we bridged oc concentration and discharge with a linear regression model 6 c i k 2 â q i b 2 where ci is the daily mean oc concentration mg m 3 d 1 of the ditch at the ith precipitation magnitude k 2 and b 2 are slope and intercept respectively hence the total aquatic oc flux f mg during a certain period could be calculated 7 f i 1 m p i â q i â c i where m is the number of precipitation magnitudes pi is the frequency d of the ith precipitation magnitude 3 results 3 1 physical chemical properties of ditch water water temperature and conductivity in event ii iii and iv were higher than in event i table 2 turbidity and do were lower in event ii than in other events ph ranged from 7 47 to 8 01 slight alkalinity and no statistical differences f test α 0 05 were found between the four events demonstrating its temporal stability conductivity had the highest standard deviation std in all the four periods compared with other properties suggesting a large variation of in water ion concentration 3 2 oc dynamics before rainfall events a consistent level of both discharge and oc was found during pre stormflow periods fig 2 discharge was relatively low and within a narrow range of 0 016 0 021 m3 s 1 the median and mean of poc before the four events were 4 22 4 18 4 17 and 4 68 mg l 1 and 4 56 4 32 4 09 and 4 84 mg l 1 respectively the median and mean of doc before the four events were 31 66 30 85 36 07 and 32 17 mg l 1 and 32 38 30 86 35 10 and 33 16 mg l 1 respectively for both poc and doc the means were close to but slightly higher than the medians except for the period before event iii this suggested that positively skewed distribution could be found in both the two components the minimum and maximum of poc were observed before event ii 2 62 mg l 1 and event iv 6 91 mg l 1 respectively the minimum and maximum of doc were observed before event i 24 23 mg l 1 and event iii 42 52 mg l 1 respectively poc was of lower std 1 04 than doc but with more outliers interestingly all the outliers of poc a total of six were have a higher value than the maximums while the outlier of doc only one was lower than the minimum this suggested that poc was tend to lie above the range in which we expect them and doc was tend to lie below the range however no statistical differences f test α 0 05 in both poc and doc were found between the four pre event periods consequently the ratio of poc to doc was also within a narrow range of 0 12 0 15 demonstrating that nearly 90 of oc flux in ditch during baseflow was in dissolved form while only 10 was in particulate form 3 3 oc dynamics during rainfall events we observed rapid responses of discharge to precipitation fig 3 in four events with different rainfall intensities peaks of discharge were all coincided with peaks of precipitation indicating that rainfall immediately increased discharge with barely time delay the maximum discharge was recorded in event iv 21 7 mm rainfall in one hour increased discharge from 0 02 to 0 12 m3 s 1 during event i poc and doc ranged between 2 19 4 22 mg l 1 and 33 96 41 78 mg l 1 respectively adf augmented dickey fuller test showed no significant variation α 0 025 in poc and doc concentrations indicating that both poc and doc were not severely influenced by rainfall and maintained at a consistent level during event ii iii and iv both evident but different trends in poc and doc were found poc steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations in 0 1 h following the discharge peaks from 6 26 9 65 and 5 74 mg l 1 to 17 37 17 33 and 28 64 mg l 1 for event ii iii and iv respectively after reaching peaks poc steeply decreased to a range of 3 93 10 75 mg l 1 which was no statistical differences f test α 0 025 compared with concentrations before rising peaks of poc concentrations were 2 4 3 4 times their means over the entire rainfall events dilution trends in doc were observed at peak discharges during event ii iii and iv doc decreased from 37 62 36 49 and 39 08 mg l 1 to 30 33 24 96 and 19 64 mg l 1 respectively in 0 2 h with minimum concentrations following the discharge peaks after that doc concentrations steadily increased through the hydrograph recession and peaked in 3 5 h after the discharge peaks the maximum concentrations of doc were 55 83 67 43 and 63 77 mg l 1 for event ii iii and iv respectively and were 1 4 1 6 times their means over the entire rainfall events after reaching peaks doc gradually decreased through the long tailed recession curve of the hydrograph higher doc concentrations compared with before dilution trends lasted about 6 12 h peaks of discharge peaks of poc concentrations and minimums of doc concentrations were concurrent leading to staggered poc and doc peaks poc peaks were prior to doc peaks because the dilution effect on doc was not observed on poc in all samples except two in event iv concentrations of doc were all higher than poc suggesting that oc flux in ditch during stormflow was dominated by dissolved form in event iv two samples at the time of discharge peak showed higher poc than doc 28 64 and 22 77 mg l 1 versus 16 35 and 16 89 mg l 1 demonstrating that during that time export of poc transiently overwhelmed doc in event i both clockwise and anticlockwise c q loops were found in poc and doc implying that for both the two components concentrations at a given discharge on the rising limb of the hydrograph could either higher or lower than on the falling limb in event ii iii and iv anticlockwise doc c q loops and clockwise poc c q loops were observed this suggested that at a given discharge doc concentrations were usually higher on the falling limb while poc were higher on the rising limb 3 4 modeling event scale oc dynamics the weibull distribution eq 1 was applied to model dynamics of oc concentration during the four events and parameters were calibrated according to eq 2 table 3 because in event i no significant trend in poc was observed fig 3 a one function was able to describe its dynamics for the same reason doc in event i was modelled by two sub functions other events employed three sub functions to model poc and doc dynamics μ gave the interval of each sub function in event ii iii and iv for poc two values of μ were the time when poc began sharply increasing and the time when poc stopped decreasing thus the first and third sub functions modelled poc dynamics before and after its dramatically changes respectively and the second sub function modelled its dynamics during the changes for doc two values of μ were the time when doc stopped decreasing and the time when doc reached its peaks correspondingly the first and second sub function modelled its decreasing and increasing trend before peaks respectively and the third sub function modelled its gradually decreasing trend after peaks the goodness of fit tested by r squared correlation ranged between 0 11 and 0 87 fig 4 the goodness of fit in event i was relatively lower r2 of poc and doc were 0 11 and 0 38 respectively however r2 of both poc and doc in event ii iii and iv were all 0 7 suggesting that oc were well modeled by the weibull distribution inflection points were well matched up with actual trends implying that piecewise functions and the interval of each sub function μ successfully captured different trends of both poc and doc except for event iv where r2 of doc was slightly lower than poc r2 of doc were all higher in other events this indicated that doc dynamics were better captured than poc 4 discussion 4 1 model accuracy and sampling resolution the extended weibull distribution model first modified by qiao et al 2017 was further modified by employing piecewise functions in this work and examined by linear correlation qiao et al 2017 argued that the weibull distribution model has obvious improvement over linear regression approaches since the relationship between oc concentration and discharge was non linear we believed piecewise functions further gave the model more flexibility to describe more complicated oc dynamics for the following reason both our data fig 3 and previous studies e g dhillon and inamdar 2013 showed a dilution effect in doc this effect caused several decreasing and increasing trends and thus created a bimodal curve while other cases e g qiao et al 2017 with no dilution effect observed only have one increasing trend and one decreasing trend and thus a unimodal curve by parameter calibration the normal form of weibull distribution can generate a unimodal curve which is well fitted to sampled oc concentrations like in qiao et al 2017 but the model in its normal form cannot generate a bimodal curve to fit to oc dynamics with several decreasing or increasing trends this is the place where piecewise functions are needed in this study we separated different oc trends by determining several intervals μ and within each interval a sub function was developed to model oc trend therefore piecewise functions enabled the model to generate bimodal curves to fit to complicated oc trends furthermore we considered that piecewise functions of the weibull distribution can be applied to describe oc dynamics with multimodal curves the key is to separate the multimodal curve into several individual unimodal curves and model each unimodal curve with one sub function r2 modeled concentration against sampled concentration of poc and doc in event i was lower relative to event ii iii and iv fig 4 we believed this is associated with the nature of the model the weibull distribution as a continuous probability distribution was originally used in reliability engineering to predict product lifetime nelson and meeker 1978 products have certain lifetime through which they are continually worn out and the weibull distribution can predict this trend in event i however poc and doc demonstrated no significant trends throughout the event this is like a product have an eternal life therefore the model was not performed as well as in event ii iii and iv where evident trends were observed 4 2 different stormflow patterns between poc and doc 4 2 1 what is the difference difference in stormflow patterns of poc and doc was clearly represented in fig 3 where c q loops of poc were clockwise and bottom left to top right distributed and conversely loops of doc were anticlockwise and top left to bottom right distributed except event i this demonstrated that while the responses of poc to rainfall were rapid and caused sharp increases in poc concentrations hysteresis effects on doc occurred during storms and led to doc concentrations decreasing first dilution effect before rising and thus resulted in concentrations higher at a given discharge on the falling limb of the hydrograph than on the rising limb fig 5 further illustrated that increases in poc and decreases in doc happened concurrently as the ratio of poc to doc were much higher at discharge peaks than at any other time in fig 6 during every event except event i poc concentrations ranged more widely than doc e g in fig 6 b and f poc ranged between 100 and 400 times higher than concentration before event and doc ranged between 100 and 180 this suggested the sharper rise and fall in poc versus doc in fig 6 e f g and h low doc concentrations during stormflow 100 of the concentration before event were observed while the same condition in poc only occurred in event i fig 6 a this also proved that hysteresis effects on doc were not happened on poc 4 2 2 why the difference the stormflow pattern of poc we recorded i e quick rate of change both increase and decrease was in accordance with many previous studies e g oeurng et al 2011 pawson et al 2012 large storms not only increase the runoff mass exports of poc from catchments but also alter its sources rowland et al 2017 considering that the response times of poc to rainfall were very short fig 3 outside the riparian zone were not likely to responsible for poc peaks because particulate organic matters at a long distance from the ditch need more time to be mobilized before they can contribute to ditch poc concentration the clockwise c q loops fig 3 suggested that poc was moved with saturation overland flow dhillon and inamdar 2013 and the riparian soils were likely to be major contributors to ditch poc peaks we consider riverbed form of the ditch also played a role in poc supply for two reasons first the ditch had relatively steep banks composed of loose peat soils fig 1 c during the early stages of precipitation processes of soil erosion on the soil surface were controlled by soil detachment and loose soil materials were likely to be eroded due to raindrop impact romkens et al 2001 thus particulate organic matters were flushed out from ditch banks and transported by lateral flow into ditch water steep slope of ditch banks accelerated this process because of gravity during the latter stages of precipitation the soil surface was stabilized and loose soil materials were deposited and compacted romkens et al 2001 allowing soils to resist raindrop erosion and yield less poc the response of loose peat soils to precipitation was coincided with poc dynamics in ditch water in terms of time poc yield increasing at early stage and followed by decreasing and space near the ditch therefore it is a possible reason for stormflow pattern of poc second these loose peat soils were likely to suffer bank failure because of cattle trampling refer to section 2 1 soil masses in water were observed along the ditch fig 1 c during low flow periods ditch flow did not have the kinetic energy to flush poc out from these soil masses while during high flow periods precipitation enhanced ditch flow and enabled it to flush poc out this could explain the concurrent peaks of discharge and poc because kinetic energy is proportional to flow velocity there might exist a threshold of flow velocity reaching which triggers the flushing out effect hence the sharp decrease of poc in ditch water could be due to the flow velocity dropped down below the threshold except for the dilution effect at the early stage doc in ditch water first increased and followed by decreasing this pattern was also in accordance with many previous studies e g jung et al 2012 qiao et al 2017 the positive correlation between doc concentration and discharge fig 3 indicated that doc was mainly terrestrial originated precipitation induced large pulse releases of riparian dissolved organic matters e g dead or living sphagnum humified peat into the ditch raymond et al 2016 increment in doc concentration reflected the change in hydrological pathways implying that following rainfall water flows through organic rich soil horizons rather than through lower mineral horizons clark et al 2008 however some studies have argued that this flow path change is probably not important in peatlands because peat soils are typically permanently waterlogged thus flow at both high and low flows always through organic horizons evans et al 2002 clark et al 2007 this suggested that doc concentration may not increase with discharge which is contrary to our records fig 3 we believe this is because the peatland in our research is not permanently waterlogged since it is suffering severe degradation artificial drainage since the 1960 s has declined water table from 20 40 cm to 15 cm from the bottom xiang et al 2009 even in the growing seasons concentrating most of the precipitation the degraded peatlands in zoige basin are not waterlogged therefore in our study area rainfall events could raise water table and flush out doc rich pore water by changing flow path in our study the dilution effect caused a negative relationship between doc concentration and discharge fig 3 the response of doc to rainfall was quick fig 3 suggesting that processes inside the riparian zone were main contributors to the dilution effect because processes outside the riparian zone could not have rapid enough response in table 4 we listed several explanations and discussed whether they were responsible for the dilution effect we observed we consider rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff rainwater directly falls into the ditch and mixes with ditch water and sampling uncertainties collectively contributed to the dilution effect we observed see table 4 4 2 3 implications oc exported from terrestrial system to aquatic system can be viewed as a two stage process first produced in soil and then transported from soil to stream network evans et al 2002 therefore the different stormflow patterns between poc and doc can be attributed to the differences in i production ii transportation and iii the relation between production and transportation in terms of rate oc production has been detailedly discussed by hope et al 1994 and was not the focus of this study with respect to transportation in section 4 2 2 we have discussed that poc was mainly moved with saturation overland flow and doc was moved with subsurface runoff and diluted by infiltration excess runoff and direct rainfall which also can be viewed as a flow path this demonstrated that different flow paths control the movement of different oc components the reason why poc and doc have different flow paths lies in the difference in their nature by definition the distinction between the two generally made based on whether or not it passes through a 0 45 0 70 μm filter therefore poc is coupled and transported with sediment through overland flow while doc is coupled and transported with water through both overland and underground flow the laws governing the different kinds sediment and water of transportation are different for sediment only when water velocity becomes greater can it be put in motion hjulstrom 1955 this implies i in some less intensive rainfall events e g event i in fig 3 a poc export from land to water may not significant because the surface water does not have the kinetic energy to move particulate matters and ii in a rainfall event e g event ii iii and iv in fig 3 b c and d poc export may not last as long as doc as a result of decrease in runoff this explained why the increasing and decreasing trends of poc were steeper than doc and why high concentration durations of doc were longer than poc fig 3 in section 4 2 2 we argued that rainwater mixing with overland flow or ditch water can lead to the dilution in doc concentration this argument is linked implicitly to the fact that rainwater has much lower doc concentration than both ditch water and soil pore water otherwise the mixing process would cause increases in doc concentrations thus doc concentration in ditch water is a mixture of different end members we attributed the increasing trends in doc followed dilution effect to the flushing out of soil water which has much higher doc concentration than rainwater at the former stage rainwater with low concentration was the dominant end member and led to decrease in doc concentration at the latter stage soil water became the dominant end member and led to increase in doc concentration therefore changes in doc concentration is a result of changes in contribution of different end members and the trend of doc concentration depends on the dominant end member at the beginning of the stage if the doc concentration is lower than the dominant end member it will increase if not it will decrease 4 3 oc under different rainfall intensities the four events we studied represented four different rainfall intensities event iv iii ii i table 1 direct comparison of oc under different rainfall intensities is not appropriate because it does not consider the rainfall magnitude therefore we use figs 5 and 6 all data are dimensionless to discern the influence of rainfall intensity on oc fig 5 demonstrated the ratio of poc to doc throughout every of the four events the higher the ratio the higher contribution of poc to the total oc and of course the lower contribution of doc to the total oc the maximum 1 02 of the ratio was in event iv while the minimum 0 08 was in event i and ii the average ratio of the four events were 0 11 0 17 0 18 and 0 21 for event i ii iii and iv respectively the ratio reached 0 5 in event ii and iii twice and in event iv three times one of which reached 1 this suggested that as rainfall intensity became higher contribution of poc to the total oc also increased while contribution of doc decreased in other words increment in poc was larger than in doc as rainfall became more intensive this might be associated with the soil erosion process splash erosion is a type of soil erosion and can mobilize particulate organic matters e g plant litter raindrop size and fall velocity generally increase with rainfall intensity and are positivity related to splash erosion rate park et al 1983 hence heavier rainfall can cause higher splash erosion rate and then mobilize more poc into the ditch notably though poc increased with rainfall intensity it was still much lower than doc in most time ratio 1 fig 6 is the proportion of time occupied by different levels compared with the concentration before events of concentration in the four events poc concentration ranged between 60 120 100 400 100 400 and 100 500 in event i ii iii and iv respectively poc concentration between 80 100 140 160 180 200 and 200 300 occupied the largest proportion of time during event i ii iii and iv respectively doc concentration ranged between 80 140 80 180 60 180 and 60 200 in event i ii iii and iv respectively doc concentration between 120 140 120 140 100 120 and 140 160 occupied the largest proportion of time during event i ii iii and iv respectively this suggested that i both poc and doc tended to fluctuate in a wider range as rainfall became more intensive ii the upper limit of the level of concentration increased with rainfall intensity and iii following higher rainfall intensity higher concentration of poc and doc tended to occupy longer time in other words heavier rainfall led to both higher fluctuation and higher maximum as well as mean of oc concentration moreover the lower limits of doc in event iii and iv were lower than in event ii suggesting a more severe dilution effect in event iii and iv this further proved our argument that rainwater was responsible for the dilution effect because higher rainfall intensity brought into more rainwater poc and doc in event i did not show the same pattern as in event ii iii and iv fig 3 suggesting that the rainfall intensity in even i was not enough to trigger noticeable changes in oc reasons to this may be various rainfall intensity is apparently one of them and we deem antecedent hydrological conditions also played a role after long periods of dry weather rainfall goes foremost into recharging peatland water table without a strong response in runoff jager et al 2009 event i was at the beginning of the growing season table 1 followed the cold and dry non growing season hence in event i rainfall might first infiltrate into the soil rather than generate runoff and mobilize organic matters event ii iii and iv were at the middle of the growing season thus the water table in these events might higher than in event i allowing a strong response of runoff to rainfall we estimated the oc flux in the ditch under different rainfall magnitudes table 5 according to eqs 3 7 the linear correlation of daily mean water depth against daily precipitation eq 3 was shown in fig 7 a and the linear correlations of daily mean carbon concentration against daily mean discharge eq 6 were shown in fig 7 b and c all the three regressions were well fitted r2 0 70 because the growing season is different from the non growing season in terms of water table level and soc concentration in zoige basin pastor et al 2003 we only calculated the oc flux during the growing season in 2016 the reasons we did not estimate with our modified weibull distribution model were threefold first our in situ sampling did not cover the entire growing season thus lacking some of the parameters needed for the weibull distribution model second though these parameters could be estimated more uncertain parameters might introduce into larger residual third the linear regression was well fitted during the growing season 79 d did not have precipitation and they accounted for 32 of the total oc flux 105 d were recorded with different magnitudes of rainfall and they totally contributed to 68 of the flux higher rainfall magnitudes were associated with larger flux per d for example though precipitation 20 1 mm happened in only 4 d they accounted for 6 of the flux and had the largest flux per d 246 kg d 1 this further proved that rainfall events are a major contributor to oc flux oc is unidirectionally and ceaselessly exported from headwaters to large rivers and eventually to oceans breed et al 2004 allowing its flux to be a prominent component of both regional e g billett et al 2004 and global hope et al 1994 carbon budgets since rainfall events can mobilize a huge proportion of oc flux its potential role in regulating carbon budgets deserves continuous concern 4 4 comparison between the ditch and streams for two reasons we believe that the response of oc in ditch to rainfall events was similar to the response of oc in streams first the stormflow patterns of doc and poc in the ditch fig 3 have also been observed in streams and reasons to these patterns held both in streams and in the ditch we studied refer to section 4 2 2 moreover the dilution effect has been reported in streams and some reasons to it also held in our study table 4 second 105 d constituted 57 of the growing season with different magnitudes of rainfall contributed to 68 of the oc flux this was comparable with streams for example in some streams 36 50 of the annual doc export occurred during short duration high intensity rainfall events that occupied 4 24 of the time hinton et al 1997 buffam et al 2001 inamdar et al 2006 however there are two small but distinct differences first is about the dilution effect on doc in our study the dilution effect decreased doc concentration to a level that even lower than the concentration before rainfall events e g fig 6 g and h while in other cases studies on streams the dilution effect was not that strong for example fig 6 in dhillon and inamdar 2014 showed a slight dilution in doc in stream water due to a rainfall event 151 mm in 61 h maximum 5 min rainfall intensity 3 2 mm however the concentration of doc was only decreased from 10 to 8 mg l 1 by 20 and was still much higher than the concentration before the rainfall event 2 mg l 1 all values read from its fig 6 on the other hand in event iv 38 7 mm in 22 h maximum 5 min rainfall intensity 1 8 mm in our study doc concentration was decreased by 56 fig 3 d and was lower than the concentration before the event fig 6 h the more severe dilution effect we observed urged us to find more reasons to explain it because the reason that infiltration excess runoff caused reduction in doc concentration as a result of rainwater mixing with overland flow table 4 which has been used to explain the dilution effect in streams might not sound enough to explain the severe dilution effect observed in the ditch to the exclusion of others we found that two more reasons that rainwater directly falls into the ditch and mixes with ditch water and sampling uncertainties table 4 might work together with the first reason another difference is about the peaks of poc in our study peaks of poc concentrations were 2 4 3 4 times their means over the entire rainfall events refer to section 3 3 and at most 5 times the value before rainfall events fig 6 this is not comparable with other studies on streams we also take fig 6 in dhillon and inamdar 2014 as an example in their case poc was increased from 20 to 200 mg l 1 all values read from its fig 6 about ten times apparently rainfall intensity alone was not enough to explain the difference in the increment in poc between the ditch and streams in section 4 2 2 we argued that the riparian peat soils moved with saturation overland flow also is the reason responsible for increase in poc in streams and the ditch morphology riverbed form were contributors to poc peaks however even with the assist of ditch morphology the poc concentration in the ditch water was not increased as dramatic as in streams this suggested that there might exist differences in poc supply between the ditch and the stream poc transport might be similar since particulate matters are all moved with overland flow refer to section 4 2 3 we consider soil property was one of the reasons in our study area though under degradation soils were still with high moisture content in the study area of dhillon and inamdar 2014 soils were coarse loamy mixed mesic lithic dystrudepts with low moisture content because high moisture content results in compact soil which is more likely to resist the splash erosion of raindrop romkens et al 2001 more particulate matters could be mobilized in their study area and contribute to the poc in stream 5 conclusions we chose a typical ditch located in zoige basin and studied the response of oc in ditch water to four rainfall events with varying intensity during the events both evident but different trends in poc and doc were observed poc steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations and followed by rapid decreasing this pattern was because that poc was moved with saturation overland flow and the riparian soils were major contributors to ditch poc peaks also riverbed form loose bank soils and bank failure played a role at the first stage decreasing trends in doc were observed at peak discharges because of the dilution effect after that doc steadily increased through the hydrograph recession before gradual decreasing increment in doc concentration was because the change in hydrological pathway the dilution in doc was attributed to rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff rainwater directly fell into the ditch and mixed with ditch water and sampling uncertainties we investigated the response of oc to rainfall events of varying intensity the higher rainfall intensity the higher fluctuation and higher maximum value as well as mean value of oc concentration we compared the response of oc to rainfall events between the ditch we studied and streams the dilution effect in the ditch was more severe than in streams and poc increment in ditch was not as much as in streams although ditch morphology contributed to poc peaks it did not change the pattern of poc and was not able to diminish the difference between the ditch and streams artificial ditches represent the influence of human activity on peatland ecosystems but once they are in operation transport of water sediment and nutrients including oc in ditches is again controlled by natural processes therefore oc in ditch water bonds not only hydrological processes and biogeochemical processes but also human dimension and natural dimension investigating the response of oc to short term climate variations and extreme events and understanding the mechanisms responsible is important for assessing impacts on peatland ecosystem processes moreover because the special status of zoige basin in the qtp i e about 88 of the carbon in peatlands of the qtp is stored in zoige basin this study may offer a chance to estimate how organic carbon responses to climate variations under the interaction between human

6053,rainfall events have been reported of great influence on concentration and flux of aquatic organic carbon but little is known in ditch water of peatlands in this work we chose a ditch located in a peatland of zoige basin in northeastern qinghai tibet plateau and studied the response of organic carbon in dissolved form doc and in particulate form poc to rainfall events with varying intensity organic carbon dynamics during four rainfall events were recorded in the growing season of 2016 during events evident but different trends in both poc and doc were observed poc steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations following the discharge peaks and followed by steep decrease while dilution effect on doc was observed different temporal patterns between poc and doc indicated that they were transported through different flow paths the dilution in doc was attributed to rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff rainwater directly fell into the ditch and mixed with ditch water and sampling uncertainties rainfall intensity had strong influence on organic carbon the higher rainfall intensity the higher fluctuation and higher maximum value as well as mean value of poc doc concentration the investigation of the response of organic carbon to rainfall events and the mechanisms responsible is important for assessing impacts on peatland ecosystem processes keywords aquatic organic carbon dilution effect drainage ditch organic carbon concentration rainfall events zoige basin 1 introduction aquatic organic carbon oc is imported from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as a result of the interaction between hydrological and biogeochemical processes in soils and in water hornberger et al 1994 stutter et al 2011 thus its dynamics reflects largely processes in the catchments and can be considered as an indicator of environmental changes hejzlar et al 2003 therefore study on aquatic oc is important to understand the responses of catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry to climate changes and human activities although land use change is the dominate control over aquatic oc export over the last century climate variations and extreme events e g flood and drought are primarily responsible for its short term interannual seasonal or even shorter period dynamics tian et al 2015 changes in rainfall events can reflect climate change and can induce extreme weather hence rainfall events are particularly important with respect to the study on aquatic oc previous studies on response of aquatic oc to rainfall events were mostly conducted in catchments of first or second order streams e g dhillon and inamdar 2014 and have provided several insights first rainfall events are major contributors to oc flux because they mobilize large amounts of oc into stream networks in some boreal catchments about 31 66 of the total annual oc export was observed during a single rainfall event hinton et al 1997 eimers et al 2008 short duration and intensive rainfall events occupy 24 of the time could account for even 50 of the annual oc flux buffam et al 2001 inamdar et al 2006 second in most cases oc concentration behaved in the similar manner as discharge i e first increases and then followed by decreases unimodal and they always reached peaks concurrently e g seybold and mcglynn 2018 third there are however certain distinct discrepancies between different catchments and between different rainfall events of the same catchment in some studies e g jeong et al 2012 at a given discharge oc was lower on the falling limb than on the rising limb creating a clockwise c q concentration discharge loop while in other cases e g oeurng et al 2011 an anticlockwise loop was observed because of the hysteresis effect as a result of initial pulse of dilute water from the upstream catchment eckard et al 2017 dilution trajectory in oc because of rapid runoff clark et al 2008 has been found in previous studies e g laudon et al 2004 making a bimodal curve of oc concentration i e first increases and then decreases because of dilution effect followed by increases again before decreases moreover components of oc response to rainfall events in different ways particulate organic carbon poc generally tends to peak earlier than dissolved organic carbon doc coynel et al 2005 new poc stocks can be continually mobilized by soil erosion while doc supply may not keep up with the rate of runoff increase dhillon and inamdar 2013 the above mentioned achievements suggest that both oc flux and concentration are sensitivity to rainfall events this is linked to the fact that carbon source areas and flow paths during stormflows differ from during baseflows galloway et al 2001 in well drained soils low flow passes through the lower mineral layers where oc is absorbed and high flow passes through the organic rich soil horizons following rainfall clark et al 2008 the transition of carbon source area and flow path is not only affected by precipitation but also by land use arvola et al 2004 microbial and vegetation productivity dinsmore et al 2013 antecedent hydrological conditions grieve 1991 and catchment physiography billett et al 2006 all of which are further under the influence of temperature worrall and burt 2004 topography musolff et al 2018 and hydrology clark et al 2007 this multi factor involved cause effect chain regulates oc concentration dynamically during rainfall events and perhaps can explain why at event scale oc behaves variously in different areas terrestrial aquatic linkage controls stream biogeochemistry butturini and sabater 2000 artificial drainage significantly changes soil stream connectivity and thus influences aquatic oc dynamics li et al 2018 however in terms of flux and concentration the sensitivity of aquatic oc to rainfall has not been discussed much in artificial drainage systems e g ditches while a lot of papers have been addressed natural streams typically ditch have straighter watercourse and more regular riverbed shape despite the differences in geometrical morphology both ditches and streams receive water and sediment and thus doc and poc from land through surface and subsurface flows dunn and mackay 1996 because i aquatic oc originates largely from terrestrial sources dawson et al 2002 ii surface and subsurface flows link land and ditches streams during rainfall events and iii morphological parameters were suggested to be less important in shaping aquatic oc butturini and sabater 2000 we assumed that oc in drainage ditch water is also sensitivity to rainfall events while ditch morphology may regulate the response of oc to precipitation zoige basin is situated at the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau qtp belongs to the yellow river source region yrsr and is the world s largest alpine peatland and currently stores about 0 48 pg of carbon accounting for 88 of the carbon stored in peatlands of the qtp xue et al 2014 about 1 392 ditches in zoige basin have been excavated since the 1960s and are now draining about 2 000 km2 of peatlands li et al 2018 oc in ditch water of zoige basin is vital for two more reasons first those ditches altered connectivity between peatlands and headwater streams first and second order streams wohl 2017 which are sources of sediments nutrients and biota for high order streams sidle et al 2000 second those ditches were linked with peat soils which yield much more oc than any other soil types arvola et al 2004 in this study we hypothesized that i oc in ditch water is sensitivity to rainfall events with respect to concentration and flux ii different components of oc i e doc and poc have different stormflow patterns to test the hypotheses we selected a typical ditch in zoige peatlands and based our study on field sampling of four rainfall events in 2016 we aimed to find out i response of oc to rainfall events of varying precipitation intensity ii temporal patterns of different components of oc within event based on these findings we further discussed i the role of ditch morphology plays in the response of oc in ditch water to rainfall events and ii differences in oc dynamics between the studied ditch and streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study was conducted in zoige basin belongs to the yrsr which located in the northeastern qtp fig 1 a with an average altitude exceeding 3 500 m this area is dominated by alpine climate i e meadow landscape mean annual air temperature 0 7 1 1 c and mean annual precipitation 649 mm mostly concentrated in the growing season may to october two paralleled meandering rivers white river and black river drain this region with the annual average discharge of 98 2 m3 s 1 accounted for 19 6 of the total discharge of the yrsr zoige basin does not have permanent snow so spring snowmelt summer rainfall and underground water are main sources of river water peat soils were formed since the early holocene and now cover over 17 of the area 2 142 km2 with an average storage of 97 649 g m 2 zhou et al 2017 and an average depth of 3 m xiang et al 2009 the peatlands are experiencing severe degradation induced by ditches drainage grazing and natural gully erosion li and gao 2019 because of artificial drainage water table has been declined from 20 40 cm before the 1950s to 15 cm xiang et al 2009 land degradation has also been contributed to succession in vegetation from marsh to meadow and eventually to desert and soil from peat soil to meadow soil and eventually to sandy soil soil organic carbon soc stocked in the 0 10 cm soil layer has been decreased by 16 32 luan et al 2014 and light fraction oc is transforming into heavy fraction oc huo et al 2013 the ditch system in zoige basin consists of over thousands of ditches most of which are in the middle white river and the upper and middle black river fig 1 a these ditches are homogeneous in physical features i e similar size in width loose peat soil banks barely aquatic life and severe headward erosion li et al 2018 they merge into headwater streams which flow into white river and black river and eventually flow into the yellow river mainstream the ditch we studied is located at the middle white river with a drainage area of 4 83 km2 fig 1 b it is 1 213 m in length and has a mean channel gradient of 0 67 the drainage area is wholly covered with peat soils and vegetation is dominated by carex muliensis and carex meyeriana this area is a rangeland for local residents grazing tibetan sheep and yak in the growing season the ditch has loose peat soil banks and the banks are very steep sometimes the slope can exceed 90 degrees fig 1 c the loose and steep banks expose themselves to a condition that are easily to be disturbed because of cattle trampling the ditch has suffered severe bank failure a large amount of bank soil masses was trampled into the ditch water and can be found along the ditch fig 1 c no invertebrates and aquatic vegetations were found in the ditch water 2 2 sampling and measurements here we define a duration of 6 h with no precipitation separates an individual rainfall event from the previous one the four rainfall events were in the growing season of 2016 table 1 these events captured a total precipitation of 83 mm accounting for 14 98 of the precipitation over the growing season in 2016 samples were collected i before rainfall events baseflow periods to establish the background of oc concentrations and ii during the four rainfall events stormflow periods to capture oc dynamics the sampling site was at the lower reach of the ditch about 400 m away from the outlet fig 1 b because this site was nearest to the road we could save time and energy to carry samples from the site to our car before the rainfall events physical and chemical properties of ditch water were measured temperature turbidity conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured by portable multi meter hach hq40d before and during the four rainfall events the ditch was sampled with a time interval of 1 8 h and about 0 5 h respectively at each of the sampling time 2 5 l water was collected in polyethylene wild mouth bottles while 100 ml water was collected in brown narrow mouth bottles the larger volumes were brought back to the hotel and injected through 47 mm glass fiber filter whatman gf f pre combusted in muffle furnace at 500 c for 4 h within 1 2 d the filter residues were then dried and sent to the lab for analysis of poc content using elemental analyzer vario el chns o the smaller volumes were also brought back to the hotel and adjusted to ph 2 by h2so4 analytically pure and then stored in car refrigerator at 18 c before doc analysis on toc analyzer shimadzu toc l in the lab within 7 d because damage happened in samples delivery from hotel to lab and limited to the inevitable logistical constraints the samples didn t cover the whole rainfall event of event i iii and iv for the same reason we have few parallel samples in the results section we used the mean value of parallel samples if any to draw the figures and did not discuss the possible deviations flow velocity was recorded by current meter global water 0 1 m s 1 accuracy hourly rainfall record was from the nearest meteorological station at waqie town about 5 km away from the sampling site 2 3 weibull distribution model since our samples did not cover the whole event of i iii and iv the missing data was extrapolated using an extended weibull distribution model 1 c t r α β â t r μ β α 1 â exp t r μ β α â q r â exp g b where c tr and qr are mean concentration of poc doc and mean discharge at the rth time interval respectively α is the shape factor and g and β are scale factors μ is the curve skewness related to discharge intensity and b is baseflow this is a semi analytical model which employs five variables and two of which were linked to key hydrological properties its effectivity has been proved in describing doc concentration dynamics in the chippewa river catchment usa qiao et al 2017 we made two modifications of the model first because the g parameter in eq 3 of qiao s article was relatively large in our work we replaced it with exp g while kept the same meaning second piecewise functions were employed parameters were calibrated on matlab mathworks matlab 2016b according to 2 var r 1 h i c t r c t r r 1 h i c t r c t r h i 2 h i where var is the variance h i is the number of time interval of the ith sub function c tr is the actual sampling data in the rth time interval the best parameters occurred following the minimum of var goodness of fit was tested by linear correlation 2 4 oc flux during the sampling periods rainwater was the main water source of zoige peatlands thus water depth of the ditch could be estimated according to its correlation with precipitation a linear regression model was expected to describe the relation between daily mean water depth and daily precipitation 3 d i k 1 â p i b 1 where di is the daily mean water depth m d 1 at the ith daily precipitation magnitude 0 1 mm resolution pi is the amount of the ith daily precipitation magnitude mm k1 and b1 are slope and intercept respectively thus the daily discharge of the ditch at the ith precipitation magnitude qi m3 d 1 was calculated by manning strickler formula 4 q i 1 n â w â d i â r i 2 3 â s 1 2 â 3600 â 24 where n 0 035 is the roughness coefficient li et al 2018 w and s are mean ditch width m and channel

most determinant for aquatic carbon export pastor et al 2003 and linear regression model has been used at catchment scale and shown great goodness of fitting e g hinton et al 1997 thus we bridged oc concentration and discharge with a linear regression model 6 c i k 2 â q i b 2 where ci is the daily mean oc concentration mg m 3 d 1 of the ditch at the ith precipitation magnitude k 2 and b 2 are

frequency d of the ith precipitation magnitude 3 results 3 1 physical chemical properties of ditch water water temperature and conductivity in event ii iii and iv were higher than in event i table 2 turbidity and do were lower in event ii than in other events ph ranged from 7 47 to 8 01 slight alkalinity and no statistical differences f test α 0 05 were found between the four events demonstrating its temporal stability conductivity had the highest standard deviation std in all the four periods compared with other properties suggesting a large variation of in water ion concentration 3 2 oc dynamics before rainfall events a consistent level of both discharge and oc was found during pre stormflow periods fig 2 discharge was relatively low and within a narrow range of 0 016 0 021 m3 s 1 the median and mean of poc before the four events were 4 22 4 18 4 17 and 4 68 mg l 1 and 4 56 4 32 4 09 and 4 84 mg l 1 respectively the median and mean of doc before the four events were 31 66 30 85 36 07 and 32 17 mg l 1 and 32 38 30 86 35 10 and 33 16 mg l 1 respectively for both poc and doc the means were close to but slightly higher than the medians except for the period before event iii this suggested that positively skewed distribution could be found in both the two components the minimum and maximum of poc were observed before event ii 2 62 mg l 1 and event iv 6 91 mg l 1 respectively the minimum and maximum of doc were observed before event i 24 23 mg l 1 and event iii 42 52 mg l 1 respectively poc was of lower std 1 04 than doc but with more outliers interestingly all the outliers of poc a total of six were have a higher value than the maximums while the outlier of doc only one was lower than the minimum this suggested that poc was tend to lie above the range in which we expect them and doc was tend to lie below the range however no statistical differences f test α 0 05 in both poc and doc were found between the four pre event periods consequently the ratio of poc to doc was also within a narrow range of 0 12 0 15 demonstrating that nearly 90 of oc flux in ditch during baseflow was in dissolved form while only 10 was in particulate form 3 3 oc dynamics during rainfall events we observed rapid responses of discharge to precipitation fig 3 in four events with different rainfall intensities peaks of discharge were all coincided with peaks of precipitation indicating that rainfall immediately increased discharge with barely time delay the maximum discharge was recorded in event iv 21 7 mm rainfall in one hour increased discharge from 0 02 to 0 12 m3 s 1 during event i poc and doc ranged between 2 19 4 22 mg l 1 and 33 96 41 78 mg l 1 respectively adf augmented dickey fuller test showed no significant variation α 0 025 in poc and doc concentrations indicating that both poc and doc were not severely influenced by rainfall and maintained at a consistent level during event ii iii and iv both evident but different trends in poc and doc were found poc steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations in 0 1 h following the discharge peaks from 6 26 9 65 and 5 74 mg l 1 to 17 37 17 33 and 28 64 mg l 1 for event ii iii and iv respectively after reaching peaks poc steeply decreased to a range of 3 93 10 75 mg l 1 which was no statistical differences f test α 0 025 compared with concentrations before rising peaks of poc concentrations were 2 4 3 4 times their means over the entire rainfall events dilution trends in doc were observed at peak discharges during event ii iii and iv doc decreased from 37 62 36 49 and 39 08 mg l 1 to 30 33 24 96 and 19 64 mg l 1 respectively in 0 2 h with minimum concentrations following the discharge peaks after that doc concentrations steadily increased through the hydrograph recession and peaked in 3 5 h after the discharge peaks the maximum concentrations of doc were 55 83 67 43 and 63 77 mg l 1 for event ii iii and iv respectively and were 1 4 1 6 times their means over the entire rainfall events after reaching peaks doc gradually decreased through the long tailed recession curve of the hydrograph higher doc concentrations compared with before dilution trends lasted about 6 12 h peaks of discharge peaks of poc concentrations and minimums of doc concentrations were concurrent leading to staggered poc and doc peaks poc peaks were prior to doc peaks because the dilution effect on doc was not observed on poc in all samples except two in event iv concentrations of doc were all higher than poc suggesting that oc flux in ditch during stormflow was dominated by dissolved form in event iv two samples at the time of discharge peak showed higher poc than doc 28 64 and 22 77 mg l 1 versus 16 35 and 16 89 mg l 1 demonstrating that during that time export of poc transiently overwhelmed doc in event i both clockwise and anticlockwise c q loops were found in poc and doc implying that for both the two components concentrations at a given discharge on the rising limb of the hydrograph could either higher or lower than on the falling limb in event ii iii and iv anticlockwise doc c q loops and clockwise poc c q loops were observed this suggested that at a given discharge doc concentrations were usually higher on the falling limb while poc were higher on the rising limb 3 4 modeling event scale oc dynamics the weibull distribution eq 1 was applied to model dynamics of oc concentration during the four events and parameters were calibrated according to eq 2 table 3 because in event i no significant trend in poc was observed fig 3 a one function was able to describe its dynamics for the same reason doc in event i was modelled by two sub functions other events employed three sub functions to model poc and doc dynamics μ gave the interval of each sub function in event ii iii and iv for poc two values of μ were the time when poc began sharply increasing and the time when poc stopped decreasing thus the first and third sub functions modelled poc dynamics before and after its dramatically changes respectively and the second sub function modelled its dynamics during the changes for doc two values of μ were the time when doc stopped decreasing and the time when doc reached its peaks correspondingly the first and second sub function modelled its decreasing and increasing trend before peaks respectively and the third sub function modelled its gradually decreasing trend after peaks the goodness of fit tested by r squared correlation ranged between 0 11 and 0 87 fig 4 the goodness of fit in event i was relatively lower r2 of poc and doc were 0 11 and 0 38 respectively however r2 of both poc and doc in event ii iii and iv were all 0 7 suggesting that oc were well modeled by the weibull distribution inflection points were well matched up with actual trends implying that piecewise functions and the interval of each sub function μ successfully captured different trends of both poc and doc except for event iv where r2 of doc was slightly lower than poc r2 of doc were all higher in other events this indicated that doc dynamics were better captured than poc 4 discussion 4 1 model accuracy and sampling resolution the extended weibull distribution model first modified by qiao et al 2017 was further modified by employing piecewise functions in this work and examined by linear correlation qiao et al 2017 argued that the weibull distribution model has obvious improvement over linear regression approaches since the relationship between oc concentration and discharge was non linear we believed piecewise functions further gave the model more flexibility to describe more complicated oc dynamics for the following reason both our data fig 3 and previous studies e g dhillon and inamdar 2013 showed a dilution effect in doc this effect caused several decreasing and increasing trends and thus created a bimodal curve while other cases e g qiao et al 2017 with no dilution effect observed only have one increasing trend and one decreasing trend and thus a unimodal curve by parameter calibration the normal form of weibull distribution can generate a unimodal curve which is well fitted to sampled oc concentrations like in qiao et al 2017 but the model in its normal form cannot generate a bimodal curve to fit to oc dynamics with several decreasing or increasing trends this is the place where piecewise functions are needed in this study we separated different oc trends by determining several intervals μ and within each interval a sub function was developed to model oc trend therefore piecewise functions enabled the model to generate bimodal curves to fit to complicated oc trends furthermore we considered that piecewise functions of the weibull distribution can be applied to describe oc dynamics with multimodal curves the key is to separate the multimodal curve into several individual unimodal curves and model each unimodal curve with one sub function r2 modeled concentration against sampled concentration of poc and doc in event i was lower relative to event ii iii and iv fig 4 we believed this is associated with the nature of the model the weibull distribution as a continuous probability distribution was originally used in reliability engineering to predict product lifetime nelson and meeker 1978 products have certain lifetime through which they are continually worn out and the weibull distribution can predict this trend in event i however poc and doc demonstrated no significant trends throughout the event this is like a product have an eternal life therefore the model was not performed as well as in event ii iii and iv where evident trends were observed 4 2 different stormflow patterns between poc and doc 4 2 1 what is the difference difference in stormflow patterns of poc and doc was clearly represented in fig 3 where c q loops of poc were clockwise and bottom left to top right distributed and conversely loops of doc were anticlockwise and top left to bottom right distributed except event i this demonstrated that while the responses of poc to rainfall were rapid and caused sharp increases in poc concentrations hysteresis effects on doc occurred during storms and led to doc concentrations decreasing first dilution effect before rising and thus resulted in concentrations higher at a given discharge on the falling limb of the hydrograph than on the rising limb fig 5 further illustrated that increases in poc and decreases in doc happened concurrently as the ratio of poc to doc were much higher at discharge peaks than at any other time in fig 6 during every event except event i poc concentrations ranged more widely than doc e g in fig 6 b and f poc ranged between 100 and 400 times higher than concentration before event and doc ranged between 100 and 180 this suggested the sharper rise and fall in poc versus doc in fig 6 e f g and h low doc concentrations during stormflow 100 of the concentration before event were observed while the same condition in poc only occurred in event i fig 6 a this also proved that hysteresis effects on doc were not happened on poc 4 2 2 why the difference the stormflow pattern of poc we recorded i e quick rate of change both increase and decrease was in accordance with many previous studies e g oeurng et al 2011 pawson et al 2012 large storms not only increase the runoff mass exports of poc from catchments but also alter its sources rowland et al 2017 considering that the response times of poc to rainfall were very short fig 3 outside the riparian zone were not likely to responsible for poc peaks because particulate organic matters at a long distance from the ditch need more time to be mobilized before they can contribute to ditch poc concentration the clockwise c q loops fig 3 suggested that poc was moved with saturation overland flow dhillon and inamdar 2013 and the riparian soils were likely to be major contributors to ditch poc peaks we consider riverbed form of the ditch also played a role in poc supply for two reasons first the ditch had relatively steep banks composed of loose peat soils fig 1 c during the early stages of precipitation processes of soil erosion on the soil surface were controlled by soil detachment and loose soil materials were likely to be eroded due to raindrop impact romkens et al 2001 thus particulate organic matters were flushed out from ditch banks and transported by lateral flow into ditch water steep slope of ditch banks accelerated this process because of gravity during the latter stages of precipitation the soil surface was stabilized and loose soil materials were deposited and compacted romkens et al 2001 allowing soils to resist raindrop erosion and yield less poc the response of loose peat soils to precipitation was coincided with poc dynamics in ditch water in terms of time poc yield increasing at early stage and followed by decreasing and space near the ditch therefore it is a possible reason for stormflow pattern of poc second these loose peat soils were likely to suffer bank failure because of cattle trampling refer to section 2 1 soil masses in water were observed along the ditch fig 1 c during low flow periods ditch flow did not have the kinetic energy to flush poc out from these soil masses while during high flow periods precipitation enhanced ditch flow and enabled it to flush poc out this could explain the concurrent peaks of discharge and poc because kinetic energy is proportional to flow velocity there might exist a threshold of flow velocity reaching which triggers the flushing out effect hence the sharp decrease of poc in ditch water could be due to the flow velocity dropped down below the threshold except for the dilution effect at the early stage doc in ditch water first increased and followed by decreasing this pattern was also in accordance with many previous studies e g jung et al 2012 qiao et al 2017 the positive correlation between doc concentration and discharge fig 3 indicated that doc was mainly terrestrial originated precipitation induced large pulse releases of riparian dissolved organic matters e g dead or living sphagnum humified peat into the ditch raymond et al 2016 increment in doc concentration reflected the change in hydrological pathways implying that following rainfall water flows through organic rich soil horizons rather than through lower mineral horizons clark et al 2008 however some studies have argued that this flow path change is probably not important in peatlands because peat soils are typically permanently waterlogged thus flow at both high and low flows always through organic horizons evans et al 2002 clark et al 2007 this suggested that doc concentration may not increase with discharge which is contrary to our records fig 3 we believe this is because the peatland in our research is not permanently waterlogged since it is suffering severe degradation artificial drainage since the 1960 s has declined water table from 20 40 cm to 15 cm from the bottom xiang et al 2009 even in the growing seasons concentrating most of the precipitation the degraded peatlands in zoige basin are not waterlogged therefore in our study area rainfall events could raise water table and flush out doc rich pore water by changing flow path in our study the dilution effect caused a negative relationship between doc concentration and discharge fig 3 the response of doc to rainfall was quick fig 3 suggesting that processes inside the riparian zone were main contributors to the dilution effect because processes outside the riparian zone could not have rapid enough response in table 4 we listed several explanations and discussed whether they were responsible for the dilution effect we observed we consider rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff rainwater directly falls into the ditch and mixes with ditch water and sampling uncertainties collectively contributed to the dilution effect we observed see table 4 4 2 3 implications oc exported from terrestrial system to aquatic system can be viewed as a two stage process first produced in soil and then transported from soil to stream network evans et al 2002 therefore the different stormflow patterns between poc and doc can be attributed to the differences in i production ii transportation and iii the relation between production and transportation in terms of rate oc production has been detailedly discussed by hope et al 1994 and was not the focus of this study with respect to transportation in section 4 2 2 we have discussed that poc was mainly moved with saturation overland flow and doc was moved with subsurface runoff and diluted by infiltration excess runoff and direct rainfall which also can be viewed as a flow path this demonstrated that different flow paths control the movement of different oc components the reason why poc and doc have different flow paths lies in the difference in their nature by definition the distinction between the two generally made based on whether or not it passes through a 0 45 0 70 μm filter therefore poc is coupled and transported with sediment through overland flow while doc is coupled and transported with water through both overland and underground flow the laws governing the different kinds sediment and water of transportation are different for sediment only when water velocity becomes greater can it be put in motion hjulstrom 1955 this implies i in some less intensive rainfall events e g event i in fig 3 a poc export from land to water may not significant because the surface water does not have the kinetic energy to move particulate matters and ii in a rainfall event e g event ii iii and iv in fig 3 b c and d poc export may not last as long as doc as a result of decrease in runoff this explained why the increasing and decreasing trends of poc were steeper than doc and why high concentration durations of doc were longer than poc fig 3 in section 4 2 2 we argued that rainwater mixing with overland flow or ditch water can lead to the dilution in doc concentration this argument is linked implicitly to the fact that rainwater has much lower doc concentration than both ditch water and soil pore water otherwise the mixing process would cause increases in doc concentrations thus doc concentration in ditch water is a mixture of different end members we attributed the increasing trends in doc followed dilution effect to the flushing out of soil water which has much higher doc concentration than rainwater at the former stage rainwater with low concentration was the dominant end member and led to decrease in doc concentration at the latter stage soil water became the dominant end member and led to increase in doc concentration therefore changes in doc concentration is a result of changes in contribution of different end members and the trend of doc concentration depends on the dominant end member at the beginning of the stage if the doc concentration is lower than the dominant end member it will increase if not it will decrease 4 3 oc under different rainfall intensities the four events we studied represented four different rainfall intensities event iv iii ii i table 1 direct comparison of oc under different rainfall intensities is not appropriate because it does not consider the rainfall magnitude therefore we use figs 5 and 6 all data are dimensionless to discern the influence of rainfall intensity on oc fig 5 demonstrated the ratio of poc to doc throughout every of the four events the higher the ratio the higher contribution of poc to the total oc and of course the lower contribution of doc to the total oc the maximum 1 02 of the ratio was in event iv while the minimum 0 08 was in event i and ii the average ratio of the four events were 0 11 0 17 0 18 and 0 21 for event i ii iii and iv respectively the ratio reached 0 5 in event ii and iii twice and in event iv three times one of which reached 1 this suggested that as rainfall intensity became higher contribution of poc to the total oc also increased while contribution of doc decreased in other words increment in poc was larger than in doc as rainfall became more intensive this might be associated with the soil erosion process splash erosion is a type of soil erosion and can mobilize particulate organic matters e g plant litter raindrop size and fall velocity generally increase with rainfall intensity and are positivity related to splash erosion rate park et al 1983 hence heavier rainfall can cause higher splash erosion rate and then mobilize more poc into the ditch notably though poc increased with rainfall intensity it was still much lower than doc in most time ratio 1 fig 6 is the proportion of time occupied by different levels compared with the concentration before events of concentration in the four events poc concentration ranged between 60 120 100 400 100 400 and 100 500 in event i ii iii and iv respectively poc concentration between 80 100 140 160 180 200 and 200 300 occupied the largest proportion of time during event i ii iii and iv respectively doc concentration ranged between 80 140 80 180 60 180 and 60 200 in event i ii iii and iv respectively doc concentration between 120 140 120 140 100 120 and 140 160 occupied the largest proportion of time during event i ii iii and iv respectively this suggested that i both poc and doc tended to fluctuate in a wider range as rainfall became more intensive ii the upper limit of the level of concentration increased with rainfall intensity and iii following higher rainfall intensity higher concentration of poc and doc tended to occupy longer time in other words heavier rainfall led to both higher fluctuation and higher maximum as well as mean of oc concentration moreover the lower limits of doc in event iii and iv were lower than in event ii suggesting a more severe dilution effect in event iii and iv this further proved our argument that rainwater was responsible for the dilution effect because higher rainfall intensity brought into more rainwater poc and doc in event i did not show the same pattern as in event ii iii and iv fig 3 suggesting that the rainfall intensity in even i was not enough to trigger noticeable changes in oc reasons to this may be various rainfall intensity is apparently one of them and we deem antecedent hydrological conditions also played a role after long periods of dry weather rainfall goes foremost into recharging peatland water table without a strong response in runoff jager et al 2009 event i was at the beginning of the growing season table 1 followed the cold and dry non growing season hence in event i rainfall might first infiltrate into the soil rather than generate runoff and mobilize organic matters event ii iii and iv were at the middle of the growing season thus the water table in these events might higher than in event i allowing a strong response of runoff to rainfall we estimated the oc flux in the ditch under different rainfall magnitudes table 5 according to eqs 3 7 the linear correlation of daily mean water depth against daily precipitation eq 3 was shown in fig 7 a and the linear correlations of daily mean carbon concentration against daily mean discharge eq 6 were shown in fig 7 b and c all the three regressions were well fitted r2 0 70 because the growing season is different from the non growing season in terms of water table level and soc concentration in zoige basin pastor et al 2003 we only calculated the oc flux during the growing season in 2016 the reasons we did not estimate with our modified weibull distribution model were threefold first our in situ sampling did not cover the entire growing season thus lacking some of the parameters needed for the weibull distribution model second though these parameters could be estimated more uncertain parameters might introduce into larger residual third the linear regression was well fitted during the growing season 79 d did not have precipitation and they accounted for 32 of the total oc flux 105 d were recorded with different magnitudes of rainfall and they totally contributed to 68 of the flux higher rainfall magnitudes were associated with larger flux per d for example though precipitation 20 1 mm happened in only 4 d they accounted for 6 of the flux and had the largest flux per d 246 kg d 1 this further proved that rainfall events are a major contributor to oc flux oc is unidirectionally and ceaselessly exported from headwaters to large rivers and eventually to oceans breed et al 2004 allowing its flux to be a prominent component of both regional e g billett et al 2004 and global hope et al 1994 carbon budgets since rainfall events can mobilize a huge proportion of oc flux its potential role in regulating carbon budgets deserves continuous concern 4 4 comparison between the ditch and streams for two reasons we believe that the response of oc in ditch to rainfall events was similar to the response of oc in streams first the stormflow patterns of doc and poc in the ditch fig 3 have also been observed in streams and reasons to these patterns held both in streams and in the ditch we studied refer to section 4 2 2 moreover the dilution effect has been reported in streams and some reasons to it also held in our study table 4 second 105 d constituted 57 of the growing season with different magnitudes of rainfall contributed to 68 of the oc flux this was comparable with streams for example in some streams 36 50 of the annual doc export occurred during short duration high intensity rainfall events that occupied 4 24 of the time hinton et al 1997 buffam et al 2001 inamdar et al 2006 however there are two small but distinct differences first is about the dilution effect on doc in our study the dilution effect decreased doc concentration to a level that even lower than the concentration before rainfall events e g fig 6 g and h while in other cases studies on streams the dilution effect was not that strong for example fig 6 in dhillon and inamdar 2014 showed a slight dilution in doc in stream water due to a rainfall event 151 mm in 61 h maximum 5 min rainfall intensity 3 2 mm however the concentration of doc was only decreased from 10 to 8 mg l 1 by 20 and was still much higher than the concentration before the rainfall event 2 mg l 1 all values read from its fig 6 on the other hand in event iv 38 7 mm in 22 h maximum 5 min rainfall intensity 1 8 mm in our study doc concentration was decreased by 56 fig 3 d and was lower than the concentration before the event fig 6 h the more severe dilution effect we observed urged us to find more reasons to explain it because the reason that infiltration excess runoff caused reduction in doc concentration as a result of rainwater mixing with overland flow table 4 which has been used to explain the dilution effect in streams might not sound enough to explain the severe dilution effect observed in the ditch to the exclusion of others we found that two more reasons that rainwater directly falls into the ditch and mixes with ditch water and sampling uncertainties table 4 might work together with the first reason another difference is about the peaks of poc in our study peaks of poc concentrations were 2 4 3 4 times their means over the entire rainfall events refer to section 3 3 and at most 5 times the value before rainfall events fig 6 this is not comparable with other studies on streams we also take fig 6 in dhillon and inamdar 2014 as an example in their case poc was increased from 20 to 200 mg l 1 all values read from its fig 6 about ten times apparently rainfall intensity alone was not enough to explain the difference in the increment in poc between the ditch and streams in section 4 2 2 we argued that the riparian peat soils moved with saturation overland flow also is the reason responsible for increase in poc in streams and the ditch morphology riverbed form were contributors to poc peaks however even with the assist of ditch morphology the poc concentration in the ditch water was not increased as dramatic as in streams this suggested that there might exist differences in poc supply between the ditch and the stream poc transport might be similar since particulate matters are all moved with overland flow refer to section 4 2 3 we consider soil property was one of the reasons in our study area though under degradation soils were still with high moisture content in the study area of dhillon and inamdar 2014 soils were coarse loamy mixed mesic lithic dystrudepts with low moisture content because high moisture content results in compact soil which is more likely to resist the splash erosion of raindrop romkens et al 2001 more particulate matters could be mobilized in their study area and contribute to the poc in stream 5 conclusions we chose a typical ditch located in zoige basin and studied the response of oc in ditch water to four rainfall events with varying intensity during the events both evident but different trends in poc and doc were observed poc steeply increased through the rising limb of the hydrograph to maximum concentrations and followed by rapid decreasing this pattern was because that poc was moved with saturation overland flow and the riparian soils were major contributors to ditch poc peaks also riverbed form loose bank soils and bank failure played a role at the first stage decreasing trends in doc were observed at peak discharges because of the dilution effect after that doc steadily increased through the hydrograph recession before gradual decreasing increment in doc concentration was because the change in hydrological pathway the dilution in doc was attributed to rainwater mixing with overland flow induced by infiltration excess runoff rainwater directly fell into the ditch and mixed with ditch water and sampling uncertainties we investigated the response of oc to rainfall events of varying intensity the higher rainfall intensity the higher fluctuation and higher maximum value as well as mean value of oc concentration we compared the response of oc to rainfall events between the ditch we studied and streams the dilution effect in the ditch was more severe than in streams and poc increment in ditch was not as much as in streams although ditch morphology contributed to poc peaks it did not change the pattern of poc and was not able to diminish the difference between the ditch and streams artificial ditches represent the influence of human activity on peatland ecosystems but once they are in operation transport of water sediment and nutrients including oc in ditches is again controlled by natural processes therefore oc in ditch water bonds not only hydrological processes and biogeochemical processes but also human dimension and natural dimension investigating the response of oc to short term climate variations and extreme events and understanding the mechanisms responsible is important for assessing impacts on peatland ecosystem processes moreover because the special status of zoige basin in the qtp i e about 88 of the carbon in peatlands of the qtp is stored in zoige basin this study may offer a chance to estimate how organic carbon responses to climate variations under the interaction between human activities and natural processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

6054,with conventional water quality monitoring based on grab sampling usually carried out once a month it is quite challenging to obtain reliable sediment and nutrient loading estimates which is a pre requisite for testing of water quality models despite the growing availability of high frequency water quality monitoring data obtained by using modern sensors their use in the calibration of water quality models is still limited the main objective of this study is to evaluate six years of continuous high frequency water quality monitoring data set from a case study carried out in a medium sized boreal catchment in southern finland to be used as a source for the calibration and testing of the soil water assessment tool swat this objective is accomplished by developing a set of sub sampling scenarios focused on quantifying the effect of the sampling frequency 12 vs 26 samples per year and strategy regular vs flow proportional sampling on the model performance and output uncertainty the goodness of fit of the model calibrated against high frequency data benchmark evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency index for total suspended solids tss nitrate and total nitrogen no3 n and tn and total phosphorus tp daily loads ranged between 0 76 and 0 83 0 69 and 0 73 in validation period overall the model calibrated against low frequency data performed worse when evaluated against high frequency data and compared with the benchmark model for each of the studied water quality parameters the results show that increasing the sampling frequency from 12 to 26 samples per year leads to an improvement in the model performance particularly for tss and tp loads in contrast to the sampling frequency the evidence for the effect of the sampling strategy on the model performance was much weaker the model output uncertainty due to different realizations of sub sampling scenarios was high for four analysed output indices basin averaged long term average annual values of soil erosion rate denitrification rate no3 n yield and soluble p yield this study demonstrates that more attention should be paid to the calibration data as a source of uncertainty in model predictions it also provides evidence for either a wider adoption of modern sensors providing high frequency data or for increasing the grab sampling frequency to reduce the uncertainty of loading estimates particularly in rivers with flashy flow regime such as the vantaanjoki river keywords high frequency data sampling strategy sampling frequency water quality modelling model performance model uncertainty 1 introduction water quality deterioration and aquatic eutrophication caused by excessive nutrient load transported from landscapes to water bodies is one of the primary environmental issues worldwide there exist two fundamental approaches towards the assessment of water quality status one is through monitoring and the other is through modelling hydrological and water quality models hwqms are often used as a cost effective alternative to monitoring data sets for assessment of diffuse pollution river basin management and to set water resources policies guzman et al 2015 these two approaches have their pros and cons but are in fact complementary in nature as observations are indispensable for designing and evaluating better water quality models the current proliferation of models does not imply that they will ever fully replace water quality monitoring because on the ground calibration data will always be needed yet models can be useful in redesigning monitoring networks and sampling programmes bartley et al 2012 distinguished two broad categories of water quality monitoring 1 base flow sampling used for routine monitoring programmes and 2 event based sampling typically carried out by research groups and collected in short durations used for estimating soil and nutrient erosion rates and constituent load exports although it is not straightforward to include the principles of event based sampling into routine monitoring programmes there are countries that manage to deal with it in the baltic sea basin perspective helcom 2015 recommends that the riverine water sampling strategy used by monitoring agencies should be designed to cover the entire flow cycle i e low mean and high flow however it is usually problematic to capture high flow events whose duration typically varies between several hours in small streams to days or weeks in larger rivers helcom 2015 recommends that for a monitored river at least 12 samples should be collected annually to estimate the input loading a sampling strategy that appropriately reflects the expected river flow pattern is particularly important if only 12 samples are taken annually and there is a marked annual variation in the flow pattern if the number of taken samples is clearly higher and the flow pattern does not show significant annual variation the samples can be more evenly distributed over the year generally the bias can be decreased and precision improved with higher sampling frequency kronvang and bruhn 1996 the average number of samples taken annually per river in the baltic sea region bsr countries is presented in fig 1 it is very likely though that due to resource constraints similar frequencies of water quality monitoring programmes apply throughout europe audet et al 2014 johnes 2007 with water quality monitoring based on traditional grab sampling usually involving collection of a small volume of river water once or at best twice a month it is quite challenging to obtain reliable loading estimates the estimation of loads for a longer period of time such as a week month or year using such infrequent data is highly uncertain johnes 2007 lee et al 2016 williams et al 2015 skeffington et al 2015 pointed out that for many water quality parameters monthly sampling is unlikely to be able to assign a water body chemical status as imposed by the water framework directive class accurately indeed low frequency sampling is likely to miss many storm events and thus fail to disclose the close coupling between the hydrological and chemical dynamics kirchner et al 2004 as well as between hydrological and sediment dynamics gippel 1995 pavanelli and bigi 2005 these issues can be addressed by field deployable water quality analysers designed to measure concentrations of pollutants in freshwater systems that began to gain interest in the early 2000s bende michl and hairsine 2010 harmel et al 2018 automatic monitoring devices produce reliable high frequency water quality data provided that quality assurance is addressed according to rode et al 2016 some developed countries such as the united states or germany have already begun to transform their routine monitoring programmes thanks to deployment of automatic sensors a good example of a high frequency water quality monitoring network occurs in the agricultural state of iowa in the u s midwest it has been used for various nutrient research and to track progress towards reducing hypoxia in the gulf of mexico jones et al 2018 in finland stations for nutrient load estimations using automatic monitoring devices have been proposed for the major rivers discharging into the baltic sea lepistö et al 2018 the proposed observation network coordinated by finnish environmental governance is based on reviews of numerous existing research and development projects dealing with automatic monitoring there are two common types of sensor based techniques that are used in continuous water quality monitoring the first type used e g in obs 3 sensor downing 2006 works by emitting a near infrared light into the water and then measuring the light that bounces back from the suspended particles the other functioning principle used e g in s can sensor van den broeke et al 2006 is based on a continuous optical spectrum spanning from low ultraviolet to visible light the particles suspended in water weaken a light beam emitted by a lamp after contact with water the intensity of the light beam is measured by a detector over a range of wavelengths specific to different substances the cleaning systems of sensor lenses include mechanical wiper brushes and bursts of compressed air due to spatial large size of many catchments and economic high cost of water quality monitoring reasons the use of mathematical models is the only viable way to increase our understanding of the sources and rates of constituent generation at the catchment scale bartley et al 2012 hwqms were designed and are being applied to better understand biogeochemical processes at the catchment scale jiang et al 2014 dupas et al 2016 to assess the impacts of climate and or land use change on sediment and nutrient loads mehdi et al 2015 piniewski et al 2014 and to assess the effectiveness of best management practices in order to provide guidance for environmental decision making qiu et al 2018 haas et al 2017 as revealed by a recent comprehensive review of water quality and erosion models by fu et al 2019 the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is by far the most popular tool of this type worldwide the swat model is a semi distributed continuous time process based hwqm developed to simulate the quantity and quality of water resources arnold et al 1998 throughout the last two decades swat has been applied in numerous studies for assessment of different aspects of water resources across a broad range of scales from small catchment to continental gassman et al 2014 arnold et al 2012 piniewski et al 2019 despite their relatively low cost and wide spatial coverage the limitation of hwqms is their need to undergo calibration and validation high frequency sampling may improve the accuracy and precision of constituent load estimates by reducing the sample bias and uncertainty present in data derived from regression models that are affected by hysteresis effects sharifi et al 2017 however despite the increasing availability of high frequency water quality monitoring data their use in the calibration of hwqms is still very limited jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 given the fact that a meaningful calibration and validation of a continuous time model requires at least several years of observed data including both wet and dry periods arnold et al 2012 the uptake of high frequency data by the modelling community has been rather slow until recently but can be expected to grow fast in the near future due to increasing availability of such data we have searched for scientific literature through scholarly databases and identified nine fairly recent studies in which hwqms were calibrated against high frequency data and which discussed the value of using such data table 1 notably all these studies were carried out in developed countries although no studies from the united states were found and the modelling domains were small particularly in the uk and new zealand and medium sized catchments continental europe with two exceptions crockford et al 2017 woodward et al 2017 all studies applied semi distributed process based models most commonly swat four cases but also hydrological predictions for the environment hype lindström et al 2010 integrated catchment model of phosphorus dynamics inca p jackson blake et al 2016 and the water quality and nutrient load model system for finnish watersheds vemala huttunen et al 2016 there was some variability in the water quality parameters studied although different forms of n and p were studied more frequently than sediment selected excerpts from these papers quoted in table 1 highlight that high frequency data lead to reduced modelling uncertainty higher confidence in the model parameters and outputs and enable studying short term variations in water quality parameters under investigation the only contradictory finding was stated by woodward et al 2017 who claimed that the calibration of lumped conceptual streamflow generation eigenmodel streamgem woodward et al 2013 against the low resolution monthly data predicted similar dynamics to those observed in the high resolution daily data five out of nine studies performed a formal comparison between the calibration against high frequency and low frequency data jiang et al 2019 ullrich and volk 2010 jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 crockford et al 2017 woodward et al 2017 of these crockford et al 2017 applied an empirical source apportionment model which has different objectives from the remaining models and is less applicable here jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 used the daily tdp total dissolved phosphorus data set and a down sampled fortnightly data set for the calibration of the inca p model the down sampling was done by randomly selecting a start day within the first 14 day period of the daily time series followed by selecting every 14th data point thereafter jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 although the distribution of tdp concentrations in both data sets were quite similar the main difference being the lack of high values in the fortnightly time series the uncertainty of simulated concentrations was more than four times higher for the fortnightly than for daily data set 7 7 vs 1 8 μg srp p l 1 jiang et al 2019 used two alternative monitoring data sources daily based on sensor based in situ measurements and fortnightly based on grab sample analysis no3 n data sets for the calibration of the hype model they also concluded that increasing the measurement frequency from fortnightly to daily led to a fourfold reduction in the posterior parameter uncertainty ullrich and volk 2010 compared the results of the swat calibration against either daily composite no3 n loads or fortnightly and monthly loads they observed that the goodness of fit values deteriorate when moving from high frequency to low frequency data this analysis shows that a very limited number of studies explored the possibility of sub sampling high frequency monitoring data in order to use them as alternative scenarios for the model calibration and thus to gain insights into the hwqms performance and the output uncertainty existing studies focused on highlighting the role of the sampling frequency but did not analyse the role of sampling strategy e g regular vs flow proportional sampling they usually focused on a single water quality parameter and small catchments 100 km2 the average time series length of high frequency data was shorter than three years and did not go beyond five years in any of these studies to address all these gaps this study will 1 focus on both the role of sampling frequency and strategy 2 use a six year long uninterrupted time series of high frequency sensor based measurements of water quality parameters and 3 deal with a medium sized catchment the main objective of this study is to evaluate the high frequency water quality monitoring data set as a source for the calibration of swat in a case study in a medium sized boreal catchment in southern finland more specifically we aim 1 to perform the calibration and validation of the model against the unique high frequency data set of tss no3 n tn and tp loads 2 using the calibrated and validated model as the benchmark to develop sub sampling scenarios applied to this data set in order to evaluate the effect of sampling strategy and frequency on the model performance and simulation outputs as in the case of kämäri et al 2019 the study is carried out in a boreal catchment in southern finland called vantaanjoki but it essentially differs from the kämäri et al 2019 study by using another hwqm by dealing with sediment and phosphorus in addition to nitrogen and by having a clear focus on the effect of sampling frequency and strategy on the modelling process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the river vantaanjoki drains an area of 1 680 km2 that flows into the gulf of finland on the eastern side of the baltic sea fig 2 the monthly mean temperature in the area varies from 6 3 c in february to 17 1 c in july 1981 2010 pirinen et al 2012 the average annual precipitation in the study area is 660 mm the elevation in the catchment ranges between 0 and 150 m a s l with the highest elevations located in the north forests 57 including 1 peatland and agricultural crops and grass ley areas 24 are the dominant land uses according to the corine land cover 2012 classification härmä et al 2015 the southernmost part of the catchment including a large part of the helsinki metropolitan area is dominated by urban land use which occupies 17 of the total catchment area agricultural land is predominant in the middle part of the catchment often along the river vantaanjoki and its tributaries in the vantaanjoki catchment there are six major lakes which together with the river and its tributaries cover 2 of the catchment with water in terms of soil texture coarse and rocky soils as well as moraines are present in the northern part of the catchment versus clayey soils in the south according to an operational national scale nutrient loading model for finnish watersheds vemala huttunen et al 2016 the average annual nutrient loading from the vantaanjoki catchment into the gulf of finland consists of 60 metric tons of phosphorus p and 1 300 metric tons of nitrogen n in specific terms 0 37 kg p ha 1 and 7 9 kg n ha 1 according to vemala the primary source of nutrient and sediment loading is agriculture 2 2 swat model 2 2 1 model description swat is a process based semi distributed continuous time model that simulates the movement of water sediment nitrogen and phosphorus compounds within a catchment with a daily time step swat requires specific information on weather soil topography vegetation and land management and computes the processes associated with water and sediment movement plant growth nutrient cycling etc using this input data swat uses basic spatial units called hrus hydrological response units which are combinations of land use soil and slope within each sub basin both the land phase water balance components land erosion and nutrient fluxes are computed separately for each hru aggregated at the sub basin level and then routed through the river network to the main outlet in this study the hargreaves method for calculating potential evapotranspiration pet and the modified usda soil conservation service scs curve number method for estimating surface runoff were selected nrcs 2004 we selected an option in which retention parameter of the scs cn method varies with plant evapotranspiration and not with soil moisture as in the default and more popular option this method was successfully applied in several studies kannan et al 2008 schilling et al 2019 yen et al 2015 and it is expected to provide more reliable low flow estimates as compared to the soil moisture method yen et al 2015 soil erosion was simulated using the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams and berndt 1977 the model takes into account both natural sources of nutrient inputs organic matter mineralisation n fixation atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic sources e g fertilizer applications and point sources channel routing was modeled using the muskingum method the in stream component used in swat for nutrient transport calculations is adapted from the model qual2e that includes interactions of the nutrient cycles algae production and benthic oxygen demand 2 2 2 model setup for vantaanjoki the basic data sets required to develop the model input are land elevation topography soil type land use weather data and point sources the specific data used for the vantaanjoki catchment were i digital elevation model dem produced by the national land survey of finland and the finnish environment institute grid cell 10 m 10 m vertical resolution of land elevation 1 4 m ii land cover map corine land cover 2012 produced by the finnish environment institute scale 1 100000 grid cell 20 m 20 m iii soil map produced by the geological survey of finland scale 1 50000 grid cell 10 m 10 m iv weather data daily precipitation and daily maximum and minimum temperatures for three stations in the study area over the examination period produced by the finnish meteorological institute v point source emissions vahti database maintained by the finnish environmental administration the land use change in the relatively short modeling period 2011 2016 was not significant so the 2012 land use was considered appropriate for modelling in the process of automatic watershed delineation vantaanjoki catchment was divided into 51 sub basins fig 2 land use was grouped into seven main classes arable agrr grass and pasture hay forest frst residential urbn traffic and industry uidu wetlands wetl and water watr the soil map included five types of soil clay coarse moraine rock with 1 m layer of mineral or organic soil and peat the soil parameters were set for two to three layers for each soil type the slope based on dem was divided into three classes 0 2 2 7 and 7 such that the corresponding areas occupied by these classes are almost equal in the process of hru definition thresholds of 4 were set for land use soil type and slope which resulted in 1760 hrus by using this threshold we were able to reduce the number of hrus significantly by eliminating the smallest units whose contribution is small the swat model also requires management practices to be set on agricultural land the data were obtained from the statistics and databases of finnish agricultural and environmental authorities typical or several year average values for the vantaanjoki area were used in the case of the agrr class spring barley barl was chosen as the representative crop in our simulations barley was sown on 5 may i e 4 days after the tillage operation fertiliser application 69 kg n ha 1 and 12 kg p ha 1 took place on 6 may in the simulations barley was harvested on 20 august and the soil was tilled again on 20 september for hay 83 kg n ha 1 and 14 kg p ha 1 were applied on 2 july two grass harvests were set one on 1 july and the second on 20 august point source emissions kg day on average during the study period were given for those nine sub basins where the sources mostly municipal wastewater treatment plants are located the total loading from point sources was estimated as 148 tons n year and 2 96 tons p year which is below 5 of the total load generated in vantaanjoki 2 2 3 calibration and validation sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were conducted in swat calibration uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour 2008 using the sufi 2 algorithm sequential uncertainty fitting procedure version 2 abbaspour et al 2004 the sufi 2 is based on the assumption that parameters selected for the calibration have a uniform distribution and thus are expressed as ranges and runs an iterative process in order to capture as much of the observed data as possible within 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu of the model the kling gupta efficiency kge was used as an objective function gupta et al 2009 kge is a function of the linear regression coefficient between the measured and simulated variable correlation term the variability term defined as the ratio between simulated and measured standard deviation and the bias term defined as the ratio between simulated and measured mean the closer the kge is to 1 the better the goodness of fit additionally the percent bias pbias that measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be smaller or larger than their observed counterparts was also tracked positive values indicate model underestimation bias whereas the negative values indicate model over estimation bias the calibration was performed consecutively for discharge tss loads tn and no3 n loads and finally tp loads the daily discharge calibration was conducted for three gauging stations oulunkylä myllymäki and hanala for the period 2003 2008 fig 2 whereas validation was done for the period 2009 2016 while oulunkylä represents the outlet of the whole catchment myllymäki represents its western branch vantaanjoki proper where the pitkäkoski station with water quality monitoring is located and hanala its eastern branch river keravanjoki since the focus of this paper is on the role of water quality observational data for calibration of the swat model these data are described in detail in the following section 2 3 continuous water quality monitoring data an automatic water quality monitoring station was established at pitkäkoski fig 2 in the autumn of 2010 which captures roughly 75 of the total vantaanjoki catchment except for the river keravanjoki which is the eastern tributary the station is equipped with s can nitro lyser sensor www s can at products spectrometer probes which was used to measure no3 n turbidity and organic carbon the latter not used in this study with hourly time step the functioning principle of the s can sensor makes it possible to measure no3 n and carbon concentrations simultaneously with turbidity the measuring path length of the sensors was 5 mm the measuring range was for no3 n 0 1 50 mg l 1 and for turbidity 5 1000 ftu the measuring path and the window of the sensor were cleaned with compressed air before each measurement each cleaning lasted one second and was timed to two minutes before each measurement occasion on average once every two months the sensors were taken up from the river and cleaned manually the cleaning work never took more than 30 min i e it did not cause any breaks in 1 h resolution data recording the sensors were also checked and calibrated with ultra pure milli q water twice during the study period finally the raw data were converted into mg l 1 with a linear regression between the raw and grab sample based measurements table 2 site specific calibration is required because sensors are factory calibrated against standard solutions which are different fron natural water water level was measured with a pressure sensor by keller ag www keller druck com with 1 mm resolution the discharge was determined based on the water level and the site specific stage discharge curve established by the local water utility owning the property backup water supply facility of helsinki at pitkäkoski calibration of swat had to be performed on a daily time step thus mean daily concentrations were calculated based on hourly values and mean daily loads were calculated as a product of mean daily concentrations and mean daily flows the average standard deviation of average daily concentrations of tss no3 n tn and tp in the period 2011 2016 was equal to 32 28 7 1 59 0 73 2 17 1 and 0 078 0 045 mg l 1 respectively the fraction of no3 n in total n is thus constant and estimated as 73 the fraction of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp in tp was estimated as 15 based on grab sample measurements in the vantaanjoki river the six year monitoring data set was divided into two equal parts for the calibration 2011 2013 and validation 2014 2016 in the case of nitrogen the objective function was set as the arithmetic mean of kge for tn and no3 n loads 2 4 sub sampling scenarios in finland flow proportional or flow stratified sampling is a common approach used for water quality monitoring by respective agencies in this approach the aim is a balanced set of samples i e a set in which observations from both low and high flow periods are present in order to get a balanced set one has to take samples more frequently from high than from low flow periods because of shorter duration of these periods and the fact that most of annual load is transported at high streamflow the analysis of state monitoring data for the vantaanjoki river revealed that on average 26 3 water samples were taken per year in the period 2004 2013 there was a strong seasonal bias in dates with winter months being the least frequent only one sample per month spring months the most frequent up to five samplings in the month of april and typically two samplings in the summer and autumn months the total number of 26 samplings per year is rather high compared to some other finnish rivers and even more so when compared to other bsr countries the results of a 2012 questionnaire on monitored parameters monitoring frequency sampling and monitoring methodology in the helcom member countries showed that in finland out of 29 monitored rivers included in helcom reporting 20 had 13 samples taken per year and nine had 22 samples taken per year helcom 2015 in fact 12 samples per year was the most common frequency across all member states as indicated in this report analysis of aforementioned data and information sources leads to the conclusion that the sampling strategy i e even or seasonally weighted distribution of sampling dates as well as frequency are the most important factors differentiating water quality sampling design in the bsr hence in this study we have developed three different sub sampling scenarios applied to the high frequency monitoring data set 1 flow proportional sampling with 26 samples per year hereafter called fp 26 2 flow proportional sampling with 12 samples per year fp 12 3 regular sampling with 12 samples per year r 12 the sub sampling or down sampling process was conceptually similar as in jiang et al 2019 who sub sampled a fortnightly data set from the daily data set the three above scenarios are conceptually illustrated in fig 3 showing the occurrence of sampling dates on the flow hydrograph during an example three year period scenario fp 26 attempts to mimic the current situation of water quality monitoring in the vantaanjoki catchment as described above scenario fp 12 when compared with fp 26 will help investigate the role of sampling frequency in flow proportional sampling on model performance and modelling outputs in contrast scenario r 12 when compared to fp 12 will allow for an investigation into the role of sampling strategy assuming a fixed frequency of 12 samples per year table 3 shows the numbers of sampling dates assigned to each month of the year for three respective scenarios for both fp scenarios sampling dates within each month are randomly selected and six different realizations of this random selection were made in fp 26 the distribution is based on the real monitoring data described above and is skewed towards the months with the highest flows april with five sampling dates this approach is also conceptually the same as the seasonally weighted sampling in lee et al 2016 where the number of days sampled each season was correlated to the fraction of flow for that season in our study months are used instead of seasons though in fp 12 the same temporal pattern as in fp 26 is maintained however the frequency is lower in consequence in some months no sampling occurs in r 12 sampling dates were distributed evenly with equal one month intervals starting on the 5th 10th 15th 20th 25th and 30th of each month i e also six realizations were made in summary we generated 54 alternative time series of discrete daily loads of tss no3 n tn and tp for the time period 2011 2013 for three sub sampling scenarios each with six realizations each of the time series was applied independently as a sub sampled observational data set for the swat model calibration using sufi 2 after performing calibration on the sub sampled data set the results as with the benchmark model the best fit simulations were compared to the benchmark model for both the calibration and validation periods in order to evaluate the role of sampling frequency and strategy on the model performance cf section 3 3 3 results 3 1 sensitive parameters all the parameters used in the calibration using high frequency continuous data as well as their final ranges obtained using consecutive sufi 2 iterations and optimal best fit values are listed in tables 4 7 two parameters controlling surface runoff were among the most sensitive ones for discharge curve number condition ii cn2 and the weighting coefficient used to calculate retention coefficient for cn calculations in plant et method cncoef table 4 the final ranges and optimal values of these parameters indicated that the amount of surface runoff had to be increased within the calibration which is understandable given the high fraction of impermeable soils and flashy runoff another sensitive parameter controlling the groundwater delay time gw delay achieved very low values suggesting a fast reaction of aquifer recharge to water exiting the soil profile the most sensitive parameters in the tss load calibration accounted for both land erosion soil erodibility factor usle k and channel routing peak rate adjustment factor prf and channel erodibility factor ch cov1 table 5 the negative values of usle k multipliers suggest that the initial uncalibrated amount of soil erosion had to be reduced whereas the low values of prf and ch cov1 indicated the important role of channel deposition and the need to reduce the amount of channel bed and bank erosion relatively low calibrated values of one of the most sensitive parameters in the nitrogen calibration i e the denitrification exponential rate coefficient cdn suggest that the uncalibrated model was over estimating the magnitude of denitrification table 6 fairly low values of nperco n percolation coefficient suggest that the amount of nitrate exported with surface runoff had to be diminished finally high values of hlife ngw half life of nitrate in groundwater suggest that nitrate losses due to chemical and biological processes are relatively high two parameters exhibited the highest sensitivity for phosphorus table 7 erorgp p enrichment ratio for loading with sediment was pushed towards low values indicating a low p concentration transported with sediment compared to the concentration in the soil surface layer low values of psp phosphorus availability index led to an increase in p transport with surface runoff the majority of parameters that we used in the calibration process are parameters widely used by other researchers in similar studies as reported in a review by arnold et al 2012 the exceptions are channel roughness parameters ch n1 and ch n2 the average sub basin slope length slsubbsn and previously mentioned cncoef the vantaanjoki catchment has high contribution of surface runoff almost 40 and highly variable discharge which explains a relatively higher sensitivity of these four parameters in the case of sediment the only parameters that we used that were not reported in the study by arnold et al 2012 were two parameters controlling sediment trapping in lakes i e res nsed and res d50 table 5 again this is not surprising given that there are numerous lakes in the catchment cf fig 2 here we do not compare our n and p calibration parameters with those reported in arnold et al 2012 since their review contained a limited number of nutrient studies as opposed to hydrology and sediment 3 2 calibration and validation using high frequency data a very good fit was achieved for discharge simulations as shown in fig 4 a for the oulunkylä gauging station kge values were above 0 8 for all three gauges and both the calibration and validation periods table 8 pbias values were within 5 in each case which is a very low bias the model was able to capture the majority of flood and high flow events in a reasonable manner the only apparent problem was an under estimation of some of the low flow events which is related to the simplified representation of the groundwater flow contribution to streamflow in swat the highly variable streamflow regime of the vantaanjoki river and a high correlation between sediment concentration and flow lead to an extremely high variability of sediment loads as shown in fig 4b the highest in the calibration period daily tss load measured 1453 tons per day 20 april 2013 is more than 2 000 times higher than the minimum load measured during this period swat captures this variability quite well with kge values above 0 7 for both the calibration and validation periods table 8 in particular all large flood events carrying large amounts of sediment are well represented there exists a small negative bias of about 10 but it is again within the 15 range suggested by moriasi et al 2015 as good for the sediment calibration nitrate and total nitrogen loads exhibit slightly lower variability than sediment fig 4c for no3 n the kge values are still high table 8 and and the bias is very low within 5 range one of the flood events carrying large amounts of no3 n loading that occurred in the spring of 2012 was not very well captured over estimated by 50 and advanced by six days which is partly related to the fact that snow melted too quickly during this period in swat the results for three other large flood events were simulated more accurately both in terms of magnitude and timing in the case of tp loads the model performs better than tss and no3 n loads in the calibration period with kge equal to 0 83 but worse in the validation period kge equal to 0 69 this deterioration can be attributed to the much lower r 2 value for the latter 0 5 compared to 0 73 in the calibration the most problematic period was the winter and spring of 2015 which featured several independent moderate snow melt events that were not well captured by swat nevertheless the model can still be assessed as good according to the popular model evaluation guidelines moriasi et al 2015 taking into account that they were developed only for monthly temporal scale for nutrient loads 3 3 model performance in the sub sampling scenarios fig 5 shows that overall the model calibrated against low frequency data fp 26 fp 12 or r 12 performed worse when evaluated against the high frequency i e daily data and compared with the benchmark model for some realizations in the validation period kge values achieved for tss and tp loads were negligibly by up to 0 03 higher than the benchmark in contrast there were numerous realizations with kge values lower by at least 0 1 than the benchmark for both tss no3 n tn and tp loads in both the calibration and validation periods fig 5 also shows that different factors such as sampling frequency comparison of fp 12 and fp 26 sampling strategy comparison of fp 12 and r 12 and the random effect illustrated by six different realizations affected the results in a different way for three studied water quality parameters in the case of sediment the results demonstrate that in the fp 26 scenario the kge values achieved were nearly as good as the benchmark for both the calibration and validation periods significantly lower values achieved for fp 12 particularly in the calibration period suggest that sampling frequency has a great importance for the calibration of tss loads comparison between fp 12 and r 12 does not provide any consistent conclusion as the values for the latter were largely dependent on particular realizations of which some had extremely low performance and others outperformed the benchmark this may suggest that the effect of selection of specific sampling dates within the regular sampling scheme consisting of 12 samples per year is significant kge values achieved in the n compound calibration fig 5c d were less variable between particular sub sampling scenarios than for tss there was a small but visible difference between the fp 26 and fp 12 scenarios in both the calibration and validation periods suggesting that sampling frequency matters but not as much as for sediment the difference between the fp 12 and r 12 was less clear and in general fp 12 exhibited the largest variability in achieved kges in the case of tp fig 5e f the results achieved for fp 12 scenario were clearly worse than those obtained for fp 26 and r 12 scenarios in both the calibration and validation periods this shows that as in the case of sediment and nitrogen increasing frequency from 12 to 26 samples per year leads to an improvement of model predictions changing the strategy from regular to flow proportional leads in this particular case in which 12 samples per year are taken to a decrease in the kge for tp loads kge is a composite index consisting of three components correlation term bias term and variability term cf section 2 2 3 as shown in fig 6 most of the variability in kge could be attributed to pbias values this was particularly the case for tss for which all realizations of the r 12 and fp 12 scenarios with very low kge were caused by a significant over or under estimation bias whenever pbias was within the 25 range the corresponding kge values were mostly higher than 0 5 the patterns for nitrogen and phosphorus shown in fig 6 are weaker than those for sediment however there are also cases for which low kge values could be attributed to a significant under estimation of the observed loads 3 4 model output uncertainty under sub sampling scenarios in order to evaluate the uncertainty of selected model outputs due to changing of sampling frequency and or strategy we compared the values of four indices calculated based on the basin averaged long term average annual values of 1 soil erosion rate 2 denitrification rate 3 no3 n yield and 4 soluble p yield fig 7 overall the model uncertainty was largest for soil erosion smaller for denitrification and no3 n yield and lowest for soluble p yield the erosion rate under the fp 26 scenario was slightly higher than for the benchmark model whereas for fp 12 it was slightly lower the range in the simulated erosion values was very high for r 12 scenario for which in some realizations the simulated erosion rate was almost double of the benchmark in the case of denitrification both the magnitude and range were smaller for fp 26 than for two other scenarios in the case of n and p yields fig 7 c d the differences between particular scenarios were smaller than the internal variability i e the random effect related to selecting different realizations of sampling interestingly the median values did not depart much from the benchmark model estimation in these two cases 4 discussion in this study we explored the value of using continuous high frequency river water quality data as an observational data set for the calibration and validation of the swat model we found that the calibrated model was able to replicate observed values of tss no3 n tn and tp loads with kge values ranging between 0 69 and 0 83 and pbias not exceeding 11 in terms of absolute values the vantaanjoki river exhibits highly variable flow regime which was reflected in extremely high variability of daily loads of studied substances for example the ratio of the highest and the lowest values of tss loads in the analysed time series was more than 2 000 although the model was able to capture this variability quite well some individual events appeared to be problematic e g the over estimation of no3 n loads during the large spring 2012 flood event or failure to capture tp loadings well during several independent moderate snow melt events that occurred in the winter and spring of 2015 the performance values achieved for the benchmark model were higher than those obtained for a great majority of 108 realizations of three sub sampling scenarios mimicking the common use of low frequency grab sampling data these results are consistent with similar studies such as jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 and jiang et al 2019 jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 showed that the inca p model calibrated against a fortnightly total dissolved phosphorus tdp data set performed markedly poorer than the model calibrated against the high frequency data set a similar conclusion also referring to a comparison of daily and fortnightly data sets was provided by jiang et al 2019 for nitrates simulated using the hype model it is noteworthy that kämäri et al 2019 applied the same data set but shorter by one year as the one used in this study for validation of no3 n loads in vantaanjoki catchment using the process based operational nutrient loading model vemala however they used a different calibration approach since the water quality part of the field scale model icecream model tattari et al 2004 was first calibrated for the small 24 km2 sub catchment lepsämänjoki using similar high frequency measurements and fine resolution local input data the calibrated parameters of the water quality sub model were then distributed over the entire vantaanjoki catchment and the model was validated using data from the pitkäkoski station the hydrological sub model of vemala was calibrated for the entire vantaanjoki catchment related to all available discharge observation points comparison of the goodness of fit between swat and vemala is not straightforward since kämäri et al 2019 used the nash sutcliffe efficiency and not kge as the objective function however achieved model performance for no3 n and tn loads looks slightly better than in our case nse ranging between 0 85 and 0 87 for vemala compared to kge ranging between 0 72 and 0 76 for swat this can be partly explained by a close to perfect simulation of the daily discharge by vemala with nse values approaching 1 which was accomplished by a comprehensive multi objective calibration approach as described in kämäri et al 2019 the kge values achieved by swat were below 0 9 which was still assessed as very good though furthermore vemala has a long history of application as an operational nutrient loading model in finland so it can be treated as a benchmark the second objective of our study was to investigate the effect of the sampling frequency and strategy on model performance and model output uncertainty the results revealed that increasing the flow proportional sampling frequency from 12 to 26 grab samples per year leads to a visible improvement in model performance for all studied variables six realizations carried out within each sub sampling scenario show that in all of the analysed cases the range variability of kge values was higher for fp 12 than for fp 26 scenario it was also shown that low kge values are usually associated with high percent bias this suggests that in the case of low sampling frequency production of a biased observational data set is more likely and that the model would thus inherit the bias when evaluated against the high frequency data set evidence for the influence of sampling strategy regular vs flow proportional sampling with 12 grab samples per year is weaker than in the case of sampling frequency for example for tss loads the results differ between the calibration and validation periods for nitrogen the difference in magnitude of kge is small although fp 12 is associated with a slightly higher range than r 12 only for tp loads there is a meaningful difference between regular and flow proportional sampling designs in favour of the former it might be that if only 12 samples per year are taken from a river with highly variable flows and loads the flow proportional sampling does not improve the reliability of the loading figures this study showed that there is remarkable uncertainty in the selected model outputs due to different random realizations of particular sub sampling scenarios in the case of two indices average soil erosion rate and average denitrification a higher frequency sampling fp 26 was associated with a lower range of predictions than in two other scenarios fp 12 and r 12 however for two other indices no3 n and soluble p yield the uncertainty ranges were similar for three sub sampling scenarios thus the evidence for lower model output uncertainty caused by higher frequency of observations is only limited previous studies such as those listed in table 1 did not analyse the effect of the sampling frequency and strategy in a comparable way as we did in the present study thus it is probably the first one that explores the value of a high frequency data set in such a comprehensive way nevertheless the approach is not free from limitations one of them is equifinality here we used only one best parameter set to characterize each realization of a given scenario however there are other parameter sets that could lead to similar values of the objective function strong correlations between calibrated parameters leading to model over parametrization and a lack of identifiability of parameters were also pointed out by jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 the second limitation is a rather simplified representation of the sub sampling scenarios in particular of the flow proportional sampling in our approach we relied on a variable frequency of samplings across months months with high flows were sampled more frequently and months with low flows less frequently this was based on the analysis of historical sampling dates in finnish rivers however selection of a particular date within a month was random which in the real world is not the case samplings would be most likely carried out during week days and date selection could potentially be informed by weather or flow forecasts to detect and capture a high flow event a similar problem occurs for the regular sampling scenario in which we assumed that samplings are taken on the 5th 10th etc of each month skeffington et al 2015 applied more sophisticated sub sampling scenarios better replicating real sampling programmes however their study did not involve any time demanding modelling which allowed the authors to use 1 000 implementations of each strategy compared to only the six realizations used in our study nevertheless none of the identified modelling studies from table 1 actually used more than one realization we argue that future studies should attempt to develop more robust scenario designs by improving the realism and increasing the number of random realizations the conclusions from this case study are applicable to similar snow dominated catchments with highly variable streamflow and water quality situated in the boreal region the growing availability of high frequency sensor based monitoring data of sufficient length at least several years calls for a more thorough assessment focused on understanding how the effect of sampling frequency and strategy on the model performance and uncertainty depends on basic catchment characteristics influencing water quality 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the six year continuous high frequency water quality monitoring data set consisting of tss no3 n tn and tp observations as a source for calibration of the swat model in a case study conducted in a medium sized boreal catchment in southern finland to this end we first calibrated and validated the model against this unique data set concluding that the model performance quantified using kge and pbias indices for all of the studied variables is good in the second step we developed a set of sub sampling scenarios mimicking commonly applied grab sampling designs in order to quantify the effect of the sampling frequency 12 vs 26 samples per year and strategy regular vs flow proportional sampling on the model performance and model output uncertainty overall the model calibrated against low frequency data performed worse when evaluated against high frequency data and compared with the benchmark model for each of the studied water quality parameters increasing the sampling frequency from 12 to 26 samples per year led to an improvement in the model performance as quantified by kge particularly for tss and tp loads several of the lowest kge values were usually associated with high over or under estimation bias thus suggesting that the main reason for lower swat performance was the bias in observed loading estimates which was then inherited by the model in contrast to the sampling frequency no strong evidence for the effect of sampling strategy on the model performance was found it should be noted though that this effect was evaluated only for a constant number of 12 grab samples per year and that the effect may be masked by a simplified representation of sampling scenario designs this study corroborates earlier studies demonstrating the value of high frequency data as a calibration source for hwqms we also showed that in the absence of high frequency data increasing the grab sampling frequency from 12 to 26 samples per year should lead to a visible improvement in predictions of sediment and nutrient loads the findings from this study demonstrate that more attention should be paid to the calibration data as a source of uncertainty in model predictions from the water quality management perspective this study provides evidence for either a wider adoption of modern sensors providing high frequency data or for increasing the grab sampling frequency to reduce the uncertainty of loading estimates particularly in rivers with flashy flow regime such as the

6054,with conventional water quality monitoring based on grab sampling usually carried out once a month it is quite challenging to obtain reliable sediment and nutrient loading estimates which is a pre requisite for testing of water quality models despite the growing availability of high frequency water quality monitoring data obtained by using modern sensors their use in the calibration of water quality models is still limited the main objective of this study is to evaluate six years of continuous high frequency water quality monitoring data set from a case study carried out in a medium sized boreal catchment in southern finland to be used as a source for the calibration and testing of the soil water assessment tool swat this objective is accomplished by developing a set of sub sampling scenarios focused on quantifying the effect of the sampling frequency 12 vs 26 samples per year and strategy regular vs flow proportional sampling on the model performance and output uncertainty the goodness of fit of the model calibrated against high frequency data benchmark evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency index for total suspended solids tss nitrate and total nitrogen no3 n and tn and total phosphorus tp daily loads ranged between 0 76 and 0 83 0 69 and 0 73 in validation period overall the model calibrated against low frequency data performed worse when evaluated against high frequency data and compared with the benchmark model for each of the studied water quality parameters the results show that increasing the sampling frequency from 12 to 26 samples per year leads to an improvement in the model performance particularly for tss and tp loads in contrast to the sampling frequency the evidence for the effect of the sampling strategy on the model performance was much weaker the model output uncertainty due to different realizations of sub sampling scenarios was high for four analysed output indices basin averaged long term average annual values of soil erosion rate denitrification rate no3 n yield and soluble p yield this study demonstrates that more attention should be paid to the calibration data as a source of uncertainty in model predictions it also provides evidence for either a wider adoption of modern sensors providing high frequency data or for increasing the grab sampling frequency to reduce the uncertainty of loading estimates particularly in rivers with flashy flow regime such as the vantaanjoki river keywords high frequency data sampling strategy sampling frequency water quality modelling model performance model uncertainty 1 introduction water quality deterioration and aquatic eutrophication caused by excessive nutrient load transported from landscapes to water bodies is one of the primary environmental issues worldwide there exist two fundamental approaches towards the assessment of water quality status one is through monitoring and the other is through modelling hydrological and water quality models hwqms are often used as a cost effective alternative to monitoring data sets for assessment of diffuse pollution river basin management and to set water resources policies guzman et al 2015 these two approaches have their pros and cons but are in fact complementary in nature as observations are indispensable for designing and evaluating better water quality models the current proliferation of models does not imply that they will ever fully replace water quality monitoring because on the ground calibration data will always be needed yet models can be useful in redesigning monitoring networks and sampling programmes bartley et al 2012 distinguished two broad categories of water quality monitoring 1 base flow sampling used for routine monitoring programmes and 2 event based sampling typically carried out by research groups and collected in short durations used for estimating soil and nutrient erosion rates and constituent load exports although it is not straightforward to include the principles of event based sampling into routine monitoring programmes there are countries that manage to deal with it in the baltic sea basin perspective helcom 2015 recommends that the riverine water sampling strategy used by monitoring agencies should be designed to cover the entire flow cycle i e low mean and high flow however it is usually problematic to capture high flow events whose duration typically varies between several hours in small streams to days or weeks in larger rivers helcom 2015 recommends that for a monitored river at least 12 samples should be collected annually to estimate the input loading a sampling strategy that appropriately reflects the expected river flow pattern is particularly important if only 12 samples are taken annually and there is a marked annual variation in the flow pattern if the number of taken samples is clearly higher and the flow pattern does not show significant annual variation the samples can be more evenly distributed over the year generally the bias can be decreased and precision improved with higher sampling frequency kronvang and bruhn 1996 the average number of samples taken annually per river in the baltic sea region bsr countries is presented in fig 1 it is very likely though that due to resource constraints similar frequencies of water quality monitoring programmes apply throughout europe audet et al 2014 johnes 2007 with water quality monitoring based on traditional grab sampling usually involving collection of a small volume of river water once or at best twice a month it is quite challenging to obtain reliable loading estimates the estimation of loads for a longer period of time such as a week month or year using such infrequent data is highly uncertain johnes 2007 lee et al 2016 williams et al 2015 skeffington et al 2015 pointed out that for many water quality parameters monthly sampling is unlikely to be able to assign a water body chemical status as imposed by the water framework directive class accurately indeed low frequency sampling is likely to miss many storm events and thus fail to disclose the close coupling between the hydrological and chemical dynamics kirchner et al 2004 as well as between hydrological and sediment dynamics gippel 1995 pavanelli and bigi 2005 these issues can be addressed by field deployable water quality analysers designed to measure concentrations of pollutants in freshwater systems that began to gain interest in the early 2000s bende michl and hairsine 2010 harmel et al 2018 automatic monitoring devices produce reliable high frequency water quality data provided that quality assurance is addressed according to rode et al 2016 some developed countries such as the united states or germany have already begun to transform their routine monitoring programmes thanks to deployment of automatic sensors a good example of a high frequency water quality monitoring network occurs in the agricultural state of iowa in the u s midwest it has been used for various nutrient research and to track progress towards reducing hypoxia in the gulf of mexico jones et al 2018 in finland stations for nutrient load estimations using automatic monitoring devices have been proposed for the major rivers discharging into the baltic sea lepistö et al 2018 the proposed observation network coordinated by finnish environmental governance is based on reviews of numerous existing research and development projects dealing with automatic monitoring there are two common types of sensor based techniques that are used in continuous water quality monitoring the first type used e g in obs 3 sensor downing 2006 works by emitting a near infrared light into the water and then measuring the light that bounces back from the suspended particles the other functioning principle used e g in s can sensor van den broeke et al 2006 is based on a continuous optical spectrum spanning from low ultraviolet to visible light the particles suspended in water weaken a light beam emitted by a lamp after contact with water the intensity of the light beam is measured by a detector over a range of wavelengths specific to different substances the cleaning systems of sensor lenses include mechanical wiper brushes and bursts of compressed air due to spatial large size of many catchments and economic high cost of water quality monitoring reasons the use of mathematical models is the only viable way to increase our understanding of the sources and rates of constituent generation at the catchment scale bartley et al 2012 hwqms were designed and are being applied to better understand biogeochemical processes at the catchment scale jiang et al 2014 dupas et al 2016 to assess the impacts of climate and or land use change on sediment and nutrient loads mehdi et al 2015 piniewski et al 2014 and to assess the effectiveness of best management practices in order to provide guidance for environmental decision making qiu et al 2018 haas et al 2017 as revealed by a recent comprehensive review of water quality and erosion models by fu et al 2019 the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is by far the most popular tool of this type worldwide the swat model is a semi distributed continuous time process based hwqm developed to simulate the quantity and quality of water resources arnold et al 1998 throughout the last two decades swat has been applied in numerous studies for assessment of different aspects of water resources across a broad range of scales from small catchment to continental gassman et al 2014 arnold et al 2012 piniewski et al 2019 despite their relatively low cost and wide spatial coverage the limitation of hwqms is their need to undergo calibration and validation high frequency sampling may improve the accuracy and precision of constituent load estimates by reducing the sample bias and uncertainty present in data derived from regression models that are affected by hysteresis effects sharifi et al 2017 however despite the increasing availability of high frequency water quality monitoring data their use in the calibration of hwqms is still very limited jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 given the fact that a meaningful calibration and validation of a continuous time model requires at least several years of observed data including both wet and dry periods arnold et al 2012 the uptake of high frequency data by the modelling community has been rather slow until recently but can be expected to grow fast in the near future due to increasing availability of such data we have searched for scientific literature through scholarly databases and identified nine fairly recent studies in which hwqms were calibrated against high frequency data and which discussed the value of using such data table 1 notably all these studies were carried out in developed countries although no studies from the united states were found and the modelling domains were small particularly in the uk and new zealand and medium sized catchments continental europe with two exceptions crockford et al 2017 woodward et al 2017 all studies applied semi distributed process based models most commonly swat four cases but also hydrological predictions for the environment hype lindström et al 2010 integrated catchment model of phosphorus dynamics inca p jackson blake et al 2016 and the water quality and nutrient load model system for finnish watersheds vemala huttunen et al 2016 there was some variability in the water quality parameters studied although different forms of n and p were studied more frequently than sediment selected excerpts from these papers quoted in table 1 highlight that high frequency data lead to reduced modelling uncertainty higher confidence in the model parameters and outputs and enable studying short term variations in water quality parameters under investigation the only contradictory finding was stated by woodward et al 2017 who claimed that the calibration of lumped conceptual streamflow generation eigenmodel streamgem woodward et al 2013 against the low resolution monthly data predicted similar dynamics to those observed in the high resolution daily data five out of nine studies performed a formal comparison between the calibration against high frequency and low frequency data jiang et al 2019 ullrich and volk 2010 jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 crockford et al 2017 woodward et al 2017 of these crockford et al 2017 applied an empirical source apportionment model which has different objectives from the remaining models and is less applicable here jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 used the daily tdp total dissolved phosphorus data set and a down sampled fortnightly data set for the calibration of the inca p model the down sampling was done by randomly selecting a start day within the first 14 day period of the daily time series followed by selecting every 14th data point thereafter jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 although the distribution of tdp concentrations in both data sets were quite similar the main difference being the lack of high values in the fortnightly time series the uncertainty of simulated concentrations was more than four times higher for the fortnightly than for daily data set 7 7 vs 1 8 μg srp p l 1 jiang et al 2019 used two alternative monitoring data sources daily based on sensor based in situ measurements and fortnightly based on grab sample analysis no3 n data sets for the calibration of the hype model they also concluded that increasing the measurement frequency from fortnightly to daily led to a fourfold reduction in the posterior parameter uncertainty ullrich and volk 2010 compared the results of the swat calibration against either daily composite no3 n loads or fortnightly and monthly loads they observed that the goodness of fit values deteriorate when moving from high frequency to low frequency data this analysis shows that a very limited number of studies explored the possibility of sub sampling high frequency monitoring data in order to use them as alternative scenarios for the model calibration and thus to gain insights into the hwqms performance and the output uncertainty existing studies focused on highlighting the role of the sampling frequency but did not analyse the role of sampling strategy e g regular vs flow proportional sampling they usually focused on a single water quality parameter and small catchments 100 km2 the average time series length of high frequency data was shorter than three years and did not go beyond five years in any of these studies to address all these gaps this study will 1 focus on both the role of sampling frequency and strategy 2 use a six year long uninterrupted time series of high frequency sensor based measurements of water quality parameters and 3 deal with a medium sized catchment the main objective of this study is to evaluate the high frequency water quality monitoring data set as a source for the calibration of swat in a case study in a medium sized boreal catchment in southern finland more specifically we aim 1 to perform the calibration and validation of the model against the unique high frequency data set of tss no3 n tn and tp loads 2 using the calibrated and validated model as the benchmark to develop sub sampling scenarios applied to this data set in order to evaluate the effect of sampling strategy and frequency on the model performance and simulation outputs as in the case of kämäri et al 2019 the study is carried out in a boreal catchment in southern finland called vantaanjoki but it essentially differs from the kämäri et al 2019 study by using another hwqm by dealing with sediment and phosphorus in addition to nitrogen and by having a clear focus on the effect of sampling frequency and strategy on the modelling process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the river vantaanjoki drains an area of 1 680 km2 that flows into the gulf of finland on the eastern side of the baltic sea fig 2 the monthly mean temperature in the area varies from 6 3 c in february to 17 1 c in july 1981 2010 pirinen et al 2012 the average annual precipitation in the study area is 660 mm the elevation in the catchment ranges between 0 and 150 m a s l with the highest elevations located in the north forests 57 including 1 peatland and agricultural crops and grass ley areas 24 are the dominant land uses according to the corine land cover 2012 classification härmä et al 2015 the southernmost part of the catchment including a large part of the helsinki metropolitan area is dominated by urban land use which occupies 17 of the total catchment area agricultural land is predominant in the middle part of the catchment often along the river vantaanjoki and its tributaries in the vantaanjoki catchment there are six major lakes which together with the river and its tributaries cover 2 of the catchment with water in terms of soil texture coarse and rocky soils as well as moraines are present in the northern part of the catchment versus clayey soils in the south according to an operational national scale nutrient loading model for finnish watersheds vemala huttunen et al 2016 the average annual nutrient loading from the vantaanjoki catchment into the gulf of finland consists of 60 metric tons of phosphorus p and 1 300 metric tons of nitrogen n in specific terms 0 37 kg p ha 1 and 7 9 kg n ha 1 according to vemala the primary source of nutrient and sediment loading is agriculture 2 2 swat model 2 2 1 model description swat is a process based semi distributed continuous time model that simulates the movement of water sediment nitrogen and phosphorus compounds within a catchment with a daily time step swat requires specific information on weather soil topography vegetation and land management and computes the processes associated with water and sediment movement plant growth nutrient cycling etc using this input data swat uses basic spatial units called hrus hydrological response units which are combinations of land use soil and slope within each sub basin both the land phase water balance components land erosion and nutrient fluxes are computed separately for each hru aggregated at the sub basin level and then routed through the river network to the main outlet in this study the hargreaves method for calculating potential evapotranspiration pet and the modified usda soil conservation service scs curve number method for estimating surface runoff were selected nrcs 2004 we selected an option in which retention parameter of the scs cn method varies with plant evapotranspiration and not with soil moisture as in the default and more popular option this method was successfully applied in several studies kannan et al 2008 schilling et al 2019 yen et al 2015 and it is expected to provide more reliable low flow estimates as compared to the soil moisture method yen et al 2015 soil erosion was simulated using the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams and berndt 1977 the model takes into account both natural sources of nutrient inputs organic matter mineralisation n fixation atmospheric deposition and anthropogenic sources e g fertilizer applications and point sources channel routing was modeled using the muskingum method the in stream component used in swat for nutrient transport calculations is adapted from the model qual2e that includes interactions of the nutrient cycles algae production and benthic oxygen demand 2 2 2 model setup for vantaanjoki the basic data sets required to develop the model input are land elevation topography soil type land use weather data and point sources the specific data used for the vantaanjoki catchment were i digital elevation model dem produced by the national land survey of finland and the finnish environment institute grid cell 10 m 10 m vertical resolution of land elevation 1 4 m ii land cover map corine land cover 2012 produced by the finnish environment institute scale 1 100000 grid cell 20 m 20 m iii soil map produced by the geological survey of finland scale 1 50000 grid cell 10 m 10 m iv weather data daily precipitation and daily maximum and minimum temperatures for three stations in the study area over the examination period produced by the finnish meteorological institute v point source emissions vahti database maintained by the finnish environmental administration the land use change in the relatively short modeling period 2011 2016 was not significant so the 2012 land use was considered appropriate for modelling in the process of automatic watershed delineation vantaanjoki catchment was divided into 51 sub basins fig 2 land use was grouped into seven main classes arable agrr grass and pasture hay forest frst residential urbn traffic and industry uidu wetlands wetl and water watr the soil map included five types of soil clay coarse moraine rock with 1 m layer of mineral or organic soil and peat the soil parameters were set for two to three layers for each soil type the slope based on dem was divided into three classes 0 2 2 7 and 7 such that the corresponding areas occupied by these classes are almost equal in the process of hru definition thresholds of 4 were set for land use soil type and slope which resulted in 1760 hrus by using this threshold we were able to reduce the number of hrus significantly by eliminating the smallest units whose contribution is small the swat model also requires management practices to be set on agricultural land the data were obtained from the statistics and databases of finnish agricultural and environmental authorities typical or several year average values for the vantaanjoki area were used in the case of the agrr class spring barley barl was chosen as the representative crop in our simulations barley was sown on 5 may i e 4 days after the tillage operation fertiliser application 69 kg n ha 1 and 12 kg p ha 1 took place on 6 may in the simulations barley was harvested on 20 august and the soil was tilled again on 20 september for hay 83 kg n ha 1 and 14 kg p ha 1 were applied on 2 july two grass harvests were set one on 1 july and the second on 20 august point source emissions kg day on average during the study period were given for those nine sub basins where the sources mostly municipal wastewater treatment plants are located the total loading from point sources was estimated as 148 tons n year and 2 96 tons p year which is below 5 of the total load generated in vantaanjoki 2 2 3 calibration and validation sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were conducted in swat calibration uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour 2008 using the sufi 2 algorithm sequential uncertainty fitting procedure version 2 abbaspour et al 2004 the sufi 2 is based on the assumption that parameters selected for the calibration have a uniform distribution and thus are expressed as ranges and runs an iterative process in order to capture as much of the observed data as possible within 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu of the model the kling gupta efficiency kge was used as an objective function gupta et al 2009 kge is a function of the linear regression coefficient between the measured and simulated variable correlation term the variability term defined as the ratio between simulated and measured standard deviation and the bias term defined as the ratio between simulated and measured mean the closer the kge is to 1 the better the goodness of fit additionally the percent bias pbias that measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be smaller or larger than their observed counterparts was also tracked positive values indicate model underestimation bias whereas the negative values indicate model over estimation bias the calibration was performed consecutively for discharge tss loads tn and no3 n loads and finally tp loads the daily discharge calibration was conducted for three gauging stations oulunkylä myllymäki and hanala for the period 2003 2008 fig 2 whereas validation was done for the period 2009 2016 while oulunkylä represents the outlet of the whole catchment myllymäki represents its western branch vantaanjoki proper where the pitkäkoski station with water quality monitoring is located and hanala its eastern branch river keravanjoki since the focus of this paper is on the role of water quality observational data for calibration of the swat model these data are described in detail in the following section 2 3 continuous water quality monitoring data an automatic water quality monitoring station was established at pitkäkoski fig 2 in the autumn of 2010 which captures roughly 75 of the total vantaanjoki catchment except for the river keravanjoki which is the eastern tributary the station is equipped with s can nitro lyser sensor www s can at products spectrometer probes which was used to measure no3 n turbidity and organic carbon the latter not used in this study with hourly time step the functioning principle of the s can sensor makes it possible to measure no3 n and carbon concentrations simultaneously with turbidity the measuring path length of the sensors was 5 mm the measuring range was for no3 n 0 1 50 mg l 1 and for turbidity 5 1000 ftu the measuring path and the window of the sensor were cleaned with compressed air before each measurement each cleaning lasted one second and was timed to two minutes before each measurement occasion on average once every two months the sensors were taken up from the river and cleaned manually the cleaning work never took more than 30 min i e it did not cause any breaks in 1 h resolution data recording the sensors were also checked and calibrated with ultra pure milli q water twice during the study period finally the raw data were converted into mg l 1 with a linear regression between the raw and grab sample based measurements table 2 site specific calibration is required because sensors are factory calibrated against standard solutions which are different fron natural water water level was measured with a pressure sensor by keller ag www keller druck com with 1 mm resolution the discharge was determined based on the water level and the site specific stage discharge curve established by the local water utility owning the property backup water supply facility of helsinki at pitkäkoski calibration of swat had to be performed on a daily time step thus mean daily concentrations were calculated based on hourly values and mean daily loads were calculated as a product of mean daily concentrations and mean daily flows the average standard deviation of average daily concentrations of tss no3 n tn and tp in the period 2011 2016 was equal to 32 28 7 1 59 0 73 2 17 1 and 0 078 0 045 mg l 1 respectively the fraction of no3 n in total n is thus constant and estimated as 73 the fraction of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp in tp was estimated as 15 based on grab sample measurements in the vantaanjoki river the six year monitoring data set was divided into two equal parts for the calibration 2011 2013 and validation 2014 2016 in the case of nitrogen the objective function was set as the arithmetic mean of kge for tn and no3 n loads 2 4 sub sampling scenarios in finland flow proportional or flow stratified sampling is a common approach used for water quality monitoring by respective agencies in this approach the aim is a balanced set of samples i e a set in which observations from both low and high flow periods are present in order to get a balanced set one has to take samples more frequently from high than from low flow periods because of shorter duration of these periods and the fact that most of annual load is transported at high streamflow the analysis of state monitoring data for the vantaanjoki river revealed that on average 26 3 water samples were taken per year in the period 2004 2013 there was a strong seasonal bias in dates with winter months being the least frequent only one sample per month spring months the most frequent up to five samplings in the month of april and typically two samplings in the summer and autumn months the total number of 26 samplings per year is rather high compared to some other finnish rivers and even more so when compared to other bsr countries the results of a 2012 questionnaire on monitored parameters monitoring frequency sampling and monitoring methodology in the helcom member countries showed that in finland out of 29 monitored rivers included in helcom reporting 20 had 13 samples taken per year and nine had 22 samples taken per year helcom 2015 in fact 12 samples per year was the most common frequency across all member states as indicated in this report analysis of aforementioned data and information sources leads to the conclusion that the sampling strategy i e even or seasonally weighted distribution of sampling dates as well as frequency are the most important factors differentiating water quality sampling design in the bsr hence in this study we have developed three different sub sampling scenarios applied to the high frequency monitoring data set 1 flow proportional sampling with 26 samples per year hereafter called fp 26 2 flow proportional sampling with 12 samples per year fp 12 3 regular sampling with 12 samples per year r 12 the sub sampling or down sampling process was conceptually similar as in jiang et al 2019 who sub sampled a fortnightly data set from the daily data set the three above scenarios are conceptually illustrated in fig 3 showing the occurrence of sampling dates on the flow hydrograph during an example three year period scenario fp 26 attempts to mimic the current situation of water quality monitoring in the vantaanjoki catchment as described above scenario fp 12 when compared with fp 26 will help investigate the role of sampling frequency in flow proportional sampling on model performance and modelling outputs in contrast scenario r 12 when compared to fp 12 will allow for an investigation into the role of sampling strategy assuming a fixed frequency of 12 samples per year table 3 shows the numbers of sampling dates assigned to each month of the year for three respective scenarios for both fp scenarios sampling dates within each month are randomly selected and six different realizations of this random selection were made in fp 26 the distribution is based on the real monitoring data described above and is skewed towards the months with the highest flows april with five sampling dates this approach is also conceptually the same as the seasonally weighted sampling in lee et al 2016 where the number of days sampled each season was correlated to the fraction of flow for that season in our study months are used instead of seasons though in fp 12 the same temporal pattern as in fp 26 is maintained however the frequency is lower in consequence in some months no sampling occurs in r 12 sampling dates were distributed evenly with equal one month intervals starting on the 5th 10th 15th 20th 25th and 30th of each month i e also six realizations were made in summary we generated 54 alternative time series of discrete daily loads of tss no3 n tn and tp for the time period 2011 2013 for three sub sampling scenarios each with six realizations each of the time series was applied independently as a sub sampled observational data set for the swat model calibration using sufi 2 after performing calibration on the sub sampled data set the results as with the benchmark model the best fit simulations were compared to the benchmark model for both the calibration and validation periods in order to evaluate the role of sampling frequency and strategy on the model performance cf section 3 3 3 results 3 1 sensitive parameters all the parameters used in the calibration using high frequency continuous data as well as their final ranges obtained using consecutive sufi 2 iterations and optimal best fit values are listed in tables 4 7 two parameters controlling surface runoff were among the most sensitive ones for discharge curve number condition ii cn2 and the weighting coefficient used to calculate retention coefficient for cn calculations in plant et method cncoef table 4 the final ranges and optimal values of these parameters indicated that the amount of surface runoff had to be increased within the calibration which is understandable given the high fraction of impermeable soils and flashy runoff another sensitive parameter controlling the groundwater delay time gw delay achieved very low values suggesting a fast reaction of aquifer recharge to water exiting the soil profile the most sensitive parameters in the tss load calibration accounted for both land erosion soil erodibility factor usle k and channel routing peak rate adjustment factor prf and channel erodibility factor ch cov1 table 5 the negative values of usle k multipliers suggest that the initial uncalibrated amount of soil erosion had to be reduced whereas the low values of prf and ch cov1 indicated the important role of channel deposition and the need to reduce the amount of channel bed and bank erosion relatively low calibrated values of one of the most sensitive parameters in the nitrogen calibration i e the denitrification exponential rate coefficient cdn suggest that the uncalibrated model was over estimating the magnitude of denitrification table 6 fairly low values of nperco n percolation coefficient suggest that the amount of nitrate exported with surface runoff had to be diminished finally high values of hlife ngw half life of nitrate in groundwater suggest that nitrate losses due to chemical and biological processes are relatively high two parameters exhibited the highest sensitivity for phosphorus table 7 erorgp p enrichment ratio for loading with sediment was pushed towards low values indicating a low p concentration transported with sediment compared to the concentration in the soil surface layer low values of psp phosphorus availability index led to an increase in p transport with surface runoff the majority of parameters that we used in the calibration process are parameters widely used by other researchers in similar studies as reported in a review by arnold et al 2012 the exceptions are channel roughness parameters ch n1 and ch n2 the average sub basin slope length slsubbsn and previously mentioned cncoef the vantaanjoki catchment has high contribution of surface runoff almost 40 and highly variable discharge which explains a relatively higher sensitivity of these four parameters in the case of sediment the only parameters that we used that were not reported in the study by arnold et al 2012 were two parameters controlling sediment trapping in lakes i e res nsed and res d50 table 5 again this is not surprising given that there are numerous lakes in the catchment cf fig 2 here we do not compare our n and p calibration parameters with those reported in arnold et al 2012 since their review contained a limited number of nutrient studies as opposed to hydrology and sediment 3 2 calibration and validation using high frequency data a very good fit was achieved for discharge simulations as shown in fig 4 a for the oulunkylä gauging station kge values were above 0 8 for all three gauges and both the calibration and validation periods table 8 pbias values were within 5 in each case which is a very low bias the model was able to capture the majority of flood and high flow events in a reasonable manner the only apparent problem was an under estimation of some of the low flow events which is related to the simplified representation of the groundwater flow contribution to streamflow in swat the highly variable streamflow regime of the vantaanjoki river and a high correlation between sediment concentration and flow lead to an extremely high variability of sediment loads as shown in fig 4b the highest in the calibration period daily tss load measured 1453 tons per day 20 april 2013 is more than 2 000 times higher than the minimum load measured during this period swat captures this variability quite well with kge values above 0 7 for both the calibration and validation periods table 8 in particular all large flood events carrying large amounts of sediment are well represented there exists a small negative bias of about 10 but it is again within the 15 range suggested by moriasi et al 2015 as good for the sediment calibration nitrate and total nitrogen loads exhibit slightly lower variability than sediment fig 4c for no3 n the kge values are still high table 8 and and the bias is very low within 5 range one of the flood events carrying large amounts of no3 n loading that occurred in the spring of 2012 was not very well captured over estimated by 50 and advanced by six days which is partly related to the fact that snow melted too quickly during this period in swat the results for three other large flood events were simulated more accurately both in terms of magnitude and timing in the case of tp loads the model performs better than tss and no3 n loads in the calibration period with kge equal to 0 83 but worse in the validation period kge equal to 0 69 this deterioration can be attributed to the much lower r 2 value for the latter 0 5 compared to 0 73 in the calibration the most problematic period was the winter and spring of 2015 which featured several independent moderate snow melt events that were not well captured by swat nevertheless the model can still be assessed as good according to the popular model evaluation guidelines moriasi et al 2015 taking into account that they were developed only for monthly temporal scale for nutrient loads 3 3 model performance in the sub sampling scenarios fig 5 shows that overall the model calibrated against low frequency data fp 26 fp 12 or r 12 performed worse when evaluated against the high frequency i e daily data and compared with the benchmark model for some realizations in the validation period kge values achieved for tss and tp loads were negligibly by up to 0 03 higher than the benchmark in contrast there were numerous realizations with kge values lower by at least 0 1 than the benchmark for both tss no3 n tn and tp loads in both the calibration and validation periods fig 5 also shows that different factors such as sampling frequency comparison of fp 12 and fp 26 sampling strategy comparison of fp 12 and r 12 and the random effect illustrated by six different realizations affected the results in a different way for three studied water quality parameters in the case of sediment the results demonstrate that in the fp 26 scenario the kge values achieved were nearly as good as the benchmark for both the calibration and validation periods significantly lower values achieved for fp 12 particularly in the calibration period suggest that sampling frequency has a great importance for the calibration of tss loads comparison between fp 12 and r 12 does not provide any consistent conclusion as the values for the latter were largely dependent on particular realizations of which some had extremely low performance and others outperformed the benchmark this may suggest that the effect of selection of specific sampling dates within the regular sampling scheme consisting of 12 samples per year is significant kge values achieved in the n compound calibration fig 5c d were less variable between particular sub sampling scenarios than for tss there was a small but visible difference between the fp 26 and fp 12 scenarios in both the calibration and validation periods suggesting that sampling frequency matters but not as much as for sediment the difference between the fp 12 and r 12 was less clear and in general fp 12 exhibited the largest variability in achieved kges in the case of tp fig 5e f the results achieved for fp 12 scenario were clearly worse than those obtained for fp 26 and r 12 scenarios in both the calibration and validation periods this shows that as in the case of sediment and nitrogen increasing frequency from 12 to 26 samples per year leads to an improvement of model predictions changing the strategy from regular to flow proportional leads in this particular case in which 12 samples per year are taken to a decrease in the kge for tp loads kge is a composite index consisting of three components correlation term bias term and variability term cf section 2 2 3 as shown in fig 6 most of the variability in kge could be attributed to pbias values this was particularly the case for tss for which all realizations of the r 12 and fp 12 scenarios with very low kge were caused by a significant over or under estimation bias whenever pbias was within the 25 range the corresponding kge values were mostly higher than 0 5 the patterns for nitrogen and phosphorus shown in fig 6 are weaker than those for sediment however there are also cases for which low kge values could be attributed to a significant under estimation of the observed loads 3 4 model output uncertainty under sub sampling scenarios in order to evaluate the uncertainty of selected model outputs due to changing of sampling frequency and or strategy we compared the values of four indices calculated based on the basin averaged long term average annual values of 1 soil erosion rate 2 denitrification rate 3 no3 n yield and 4 soluble p yield fig 7 overall the model uncertainty was largest for soil erosion smaller for denitrification and no3 n yield and lowest for soluble p yield the erosion rate under the fp 26 scenario was slightly higher than for the benchmark model whereas for fp 12 it was slightly lower the range in the simulated erosion values was very high for r 12 scenario for which in some realizations the simulated erosion rate was almost double of the benchmark in the case of denitrification both the magnitude and range were smaller for fp 26 than for two other scenarios in the case of n and p yields fig 7 c d the differences between particular scenarios were smaller than the internal variability i e the random effect related to selecting different realizations of sampling interestingly the median values did not depart much from the benchmark model estimation in these two cases 4 discussion in this study we explored the value of using continuous high frequency river water quality data as an observational data set for the calibration and validation of the swat model we found that the calibrated model was able to replicate observed values of tss no3 n tn and tp loads with kge values ranging between 0 69 and 0 83 and pbias not exceeding 11 in terms of absolute values the vantaanjoki river exhibits highly variable flow regime which was reflected in extremely high variability of daily loads of studied substances for example the ratio of the highest and the lowest values of tss loads in the analysed time series was more than 2 000 although the model was able to capture this variability quite well some individual events appeared to be problematic e g the over estimation of no3 n loads during the large spring 2012 flood event or failure to capture tp loadings well during several independent moderate snow melt events that occurred in the winter and spring of 2015 the performance values achieved for the benchmark model were higher than those obtained for a great majority of 108 realizations of three sub sampling scenarios mimicking the common use of low frequency grab sampling data these results are consistent with similar studies such as jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 and jiang et al 2019 jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 showed that the inca p model calibrated against a fortnightly total dissolved phosphorus tdp data set performed markedly poorer than the model calibrated against the high frequency data set a similar conclusion also referring to a comparison of daily and fortnightly data sets was provided by jiang et al 2019 for nitrates simulated using the hype model it is noteworthy that kämäri et al 2019 applied the same data set but shorter by one year as the one used in this study for validation of no3 n loads in vantaanjoki catchment using the process based operational nutrient loading model vemala however they used a different calibration approach since the water quality part of the field scale model icecream model tattari et al 2004 was first calibrated for the small 24 km2 sub catchment lepsämänjoki using similar high frequency measurements and fine resolution local input data the calibrated parameters of the water quality sub model were then distributed over the entire vantaanjoki catchment and the model was validated using data from the pitkäkoski station the hydrological sub model of vemala was calibrated for the entire vantaanjoki catchment related to all available discharge observation points comparison of the goodness of fit between swat and vemala is not straightforward since kämäri et al 2019 used the nash sutcliffe efficiency and not kge as the objective function however achieved model performance for no3 n and tn loads looks slightly better than in our case nse ranging between 0 85 and 0 87 for vemala compared to kge ranging between 0 72 and 0 76 for swat this can be partly explained by a close to perfect simulation of the daily discharge by vemala with nse values approaching 1 which was accomplished by a comprehensive multi objective calibration approach as described in kämäri et al 2019 the kge values achieved by swat were below 0 9 which was still assessed as very good though furthermore vemala has a long history of application as an operational nutrient loading model in finland so it can be treated as a benchmark the second objective of our study was to investigate the effect of the sampling frequency and strategy on model performance and model output uncertainty the results revealed that increasing the flow proportional sampling frequency from 12 to 26 grab samples per year leads to a visible improvement in model performance for all studied variables six realizations carried out within each sub sampling scenario show that in all of the analysed cases the range variability of kge values was higher for fp 12 than for fp 26 scenario it was also shown that low kge values are usually associated with high percent bias this suggests that in the case of low sampling frequency production of a biased observational data set is more likely and that the model would thus inherit the bias when evaluated against the high frequency data set evidence for the influence of sampling strategy regular vs flow proportional sampling with 12 grab samples per year is weaker than in the case of sampling frequency for example for tss loads the results differ between the calibration and validation periods for nitrogen the difference in magnitude of kge is small although fp 12 is associated with a slightly higher range than r 12 only for tp loads there is a meaningful difference between regular and flow proportional sampling designs in favour of the former it might be that if only 12 samples per year are taken from a river with highly variable flows and loads the flow proportional sampling does not improve the reliability of the loading figures this study showed that there is remarkable uncertainty in the selected model outputs due to different random realizations of particular sub sampling scenarios in the case of two indices average soil erosion rate and average denitrification a higher frequency sampling fp 26 was associated with a lower range of predictions than in two other scenarios fp 12 and r 12 however for two other indices no3 n and soluble p yield the uncertainty ranges were similar for three sub sampling scenarios thus the evidence for lower model output uncertainty caused by higher frequency of observations is only limited previous studies such as those listed in table 1 did not analyse the effect of the sampling frequency and strategy in a comparable way as we did in the present study thus it is probably the first one that explores the value of a high frequency data set in such a comprehensive way nevertheless the approach is not free from limitations one of them is equifinality here we used only one best parameter set to characterize each realization of a given scenario however there are other parameter sets that could lead to similar values of the objective function strong correlations between calibrated parameters leading to model over parametrization and a lack of identifiability of parameters were also pointed out by jackson blake and starrfelt 2015 the second limitation is a rather simplified representation of the sub sampling scenarios in particular of the flow proportional sampling in our approach we relied on a variable frequency of samplings across months months with high flows were sampled more frequently and months with low flows less frequently this was based on the analysis of historical sampling dates in finnish rivers however selection of a particular date within a month was random which in the real world is not the case samplings would be most likely carried out during week days and date selection could potentially be informed by weather or flow forecasts to detect and capture a high flow event a similar problem occurs for the regular sampling scenario in which we assumed that samplings are taken on the 5th 10th etc of each month skeffington et al 2015 applied more sophisticated sub sampling scenarios better replicating real sampling programmes however their study did not involve any time demanding modelling which allowed the authors to use 1 000 implementations of each strategy compared to only the six realizations used in our study nevertheless none of the identified modelling studies from table 1 actually used more than one realization we argue that future studies should attempt to develop more robust scenario designs by improving the realism and increasing the number of random realizations the conclusions from this case study are applicable to similar snow dominated catchments with highly variable streamflow and water quality situated in the boreal region the growing availability of high frequency sensor based monitoring data of sufficient length at least several years calls for a more thorough assessment focused on understanding how the effect of sampling frequency and strategy on the model performance and uncertainty depends on basic catchment characteristics influencing water quality 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the six year continuous high frequency water quality monitoring data set consisting of tss no3 n tn and tp observations as a source for calibration of the swat model in a case study conducted in a medium sized boreal catchment in southern finland to this end we first calibrated and validated the model against this unique data set concluding that the model performance quantified using kge and pbias indices for all of the studied variables is good in the second step we developed a set of sub sampling scenarios mimicking commonly applied grab sampling designs in order to quantify the effect of the sampling frequency 12 vs 26 samples per year and strategy regular vs flow proportional sampling on the model performance and model output uncertainty overall the model calibrated against low frequency data performed worse when evaluated against high frequency data and compared with the benchmark model for each of the studied water quality parameters increasing the sampling frequency from 12 to 26 samples per year led to an improvement in the model performance as quantified by kge particularly for tss and tp loads several of the lowest kge values were usually associated with high over or under estimation bias thus suggesting that the main reason for lower swat performance was the bias in observed loading estimates which was then inherited by the model in contrast to the sampling frequency no strong evidence for the effect of sampling strategy on the model performance was found it should be noted though that this effect was evaluated only for a constant number of 12 grab samples per year and that the effect may be masked by a simplified representation of sampling scenario designs this study corroborates earlier studies demonstrating the value of high frequency data as a calibration source for hwqms we also showed that in the absence of high frequency data increasing the grab sampling frequency from 12 to 26 samples per year should lead to a visible improvement in predictions of sediment and nutrient loads the findings from this study demonstrate that more attention should be paid to the calibration data as a source of uncertainty in model predictions from the water quality management perspective this study provides evidence for either a wider adoption of modern sensors providing high frequency data or for increasing the grab sampling frequency to reduce the uncertainty of loading estimates particularly in rivers with flashy flow regime such as the
