11055,previous studies have focused on drought duration intensity and frequency without explicitly investigating the timing of droughts such as the drought onset and demise as well as their transition periods which is of importance for agricultural production furthermore large discrepancies exist for those studies using a single variable based drought index in this study a nonparametric multivariate standardized drought index nmsdi that combines information about precipitation and streamflow was applied to investigate the spatial and temporal features of the drought structure in china subsequently the relationships between el niño southern oscillation enso events and nmsdi variations were examined the results indicate that the nmsdi exhibited comparable performance when compared to the corresponding standardized precipitation index and standardized streamflow index and importantly it is more sensitive to capturing the onset persistence and termination of droughts the preferred season of drought onset is in summer with drought demise occurring in winter the average drought duration in china is nearly 6 months which is longer than the transition periods of drought onset 3 months and demise 3 months enso events have a strong influence on drought variations with the effects depending on climate zones across china our results on the timing of droughts have important implications for drought mitigation and adaptation in china which is helpful for agricultural production under the context of climate warming keywords nonparametric method drought onset transition periods preferred season cross wavelet analysis 1 introduction drought is a random natural hazard which is caused by water deficits and has far reaching impacts on agriculture society the economy and ecosystems wilhite 2005 hoerling 2012 huang et al 2016a huang and leng 2016b xiao et al 2016 fang et al 2018 2019a a number of studies have been conducted that investigated droughts at the regional and global scales wang et al 2011a huang et al 2014a b yu et al 2017 however previous studies have mainly focused on the changes in drought frequency duration and intensity based on various drought indicators sadri and burn 2012 hao and aghakouchak 2013 liu et al 2018 to date few studies have investigated the drought structure in terms of drought onset persistence and demise a drought starts slowly but ends quickly after a few strong rain events mo 2011 fang et al 2017 understanding the timing of drought onset could be helpful for early drought warning indeed if the precursors of drought can be identified meteorologists can use this information to improve drought predictions which is of great value for local water resource management and drought mitigation drought indicators are effective tools that allow us to quantify climate anomalies in terms of their severity duration frequency and spatial extent wilhite et al 2000 huang et al 2017 numerous different indices have been proposed to assess droughts such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 soil moisture drought index smdi hollinger et al 1993 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 1995 and vegetation condition index vci liu and kogan 1996 etc however all of these indicators can consider only one particular aspect of drought i e agricultural meteorological or hydrological drought with respect to the deficits of precipitation soil moisture and streamflow respectively mishra and singh 2010 hence the performance of a drought index based on various single variables will vary in identifying the drought characteristics a meteorological drought may quickly begin and abruptly end with the subsequent hydrologic drought occurring within some time delay heim 2002 therefore the precipitation deficit is a good variable for capturing the drought onset whereas the streamflow deficit is better for detecting the drought duration the discrepancies between the physical bases of drought related variables make it hard to develop a successful drought characterization and prediction tool on the basis of one individual variable or index such as precipitation or streamflow recently a few indicators that account for multiple variables have been developed for example svoboda et al 2002 proposed an objective blend of drought indicators obdi based on the linear weighted average of several drought indicators keyantash and dracup 2004 developed an aggregated drought index adi considering all physical types of drought related variables such as evapotranspiration precipitation streamflow soil moisture reservoir storage and snow water content based on principal component analysis pca nevertheless the application of pca has several shortcomings such as the linearity assumption of data transformation which cannot be always satisfied in practice currently some bivariate drought indicators have been constructed based on copulas to quantify the joint behaviour of different drought types kao and govindaraju 2010 proposed a joint drought index jdi via copula for jointly considering precipitation and streamflow hao and aghakouchak 2013 developed a multivariate standardized drought index msdi through copula to obtain the joint probabilities of soil moisture content and precipitation however copulas as a parametric technique rely heavily on the assumption that samples must follow a specific probability density function pdf huang et al 2014b in reality there is no globally accepted parametric distribution for meteorological and hydrologic variables smakhtin 2001 and the use of parametric distribution tends to result in the large deviation of low or high quantiles sharma 2000 in addition since copulas have various families choosing an appropriate copula function to fit a joint distribution is very difficult huang et al 2014a hao and aghakouchak 2014 proposed a nonparametric multivariate multi index drought monitoring framework which was evaluated against u s drought monitor usdm data and the frequently used standardized indices for characterizing drought the results indicate that this framework has a better performance of drought detection compared to individual drought indices china is a drought prone country in east asia where monthly annual and inter annual changes in precipitation and temperature are noticeable ma and fu 2003 dai et al 2004 huang et al 2014 fang et al 2019b lu et al 2019 as estimated by the ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2011 extreme droughts occurred every 2 years on average during 1990 2007 the average grain loss related to these droughts was approximately 39 2 billion kilograms annually which accounted for nearly 1 47 of china s gross domestic product mwrc 2011 during the past decade droughts have frequently occurred in all areas of china and led to serious social economic and ecological consequences wang et al 2012 for instance the recent winter drought that attacked northeast china during 2008 2009 caused more than 10 million people to suffer from water shortages and caused total economic losses of more than 2 3 billion wang et al 2011b moreover el niño and the southern oscillation enso modify the general flow of the atmosphere which could cause extreme weather in china such as drought trenberth and david 2001 huang et al 2016c liu et al 2017 2019 meng et al 2019 therefore it is very necessary to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of the drought structure in china along with exploring the correlation between drought variations and enso events across china in this study we use an integrated drought index based on precipitation and streamflow in order to investigate drought structure from a comprehensive perspective specifically the objectives of this study are to 1 combine the information of precipitation and streamflow using a nonparametric method to comprehensively and effectively depict drought conditions 2 investigate the spatial and temporal features of drought structure in terms of drought onset persistence and recovery in china 3 determine whether droughts across china have a preferred season to start or end and determine the precursors of drought onset or demise 4 explore the association between drought variations and enso events which may have a great effect on precipitation and runoff variations in china chen et al 2014 2 data and study area 2 1 study area to systematically research the characteristics of drought structure in china the whole country was partitioned into ten sub zones based on the major basin boundaries in china which are the songhua river sr the liaohe river lr the northwest inland rivers nwr the haihe river hr the yellow river yr the yangtze river yzr the huaihe river hhr the southeast rivers ser the southwest rivers swr and the pearl river pr fig 1 the map of the 10 river basins is obtained from the lake watershed

dataguid 232298618420224 docid 194 2 2 data the reconstructed monthly runoff data spanning from 1953 2012 were derived from the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 meteorological forcing e g wind speed temperature and precipitation data for driving the vic model were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma and were interpolated into 0 25 six parameters i e the second and third soil layer depths d2 d3 the infiltration parameter b and the three parameters in the baseflow scheme dm ds ws that govern the hydrological process were calibrated against the observed streamflow of the ten major river basins of china the model calibration and validation have been conducted in previous studies and the details can be found in zhang et al 2014 specifically three parameters governing the hydrological process are calibrated dm the maximum velocity that can occur in the deepest soil layer ds the fraction of dm where nonlinear base flow begins and ws the fraction of the maximum soil moisture of the deepest soil layer where nonlinear base flow occurs the multi objective complex evolution of the university of arizona mocom ua yapo et al 1998 was used as the optimization algorithm to find the optimal parameter set based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency and the relative error it is shown that the calibrated model simulated runoff well compared with observations for the major river basins in china zhang et al 2014 we note that the calibrated model has been widely used in drought monitoring drought index construction and the assessment of climate change impacts of drought in china leng et al 2015 2016 huang et al 2015 in addition in order to reveal the possible correlation between droughts and enso events in china the nino 3 4 index derived from the noaa earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov psd data correlation nina34 data is selected to characterize enso phases since it can represent the average equatorial sea surface temperature anomalies across the pacific from about the dateline to the south american coast which is usually adopted to represent enso stages in previous studies barnston et al 1997 trenberth and david 2001 xiao et al 2015 huang et al 2016c zhang et al 2017 hao et al 2019 3 methodologies 3 1 nonparametric multivariate standardized drought index nmsdi in calculating spi the two parameter distribution is frequently used to fit the frequency distribution of precipitation the cumulative gamma probability is then transformed into the cumulative distribution function cdf of the standard normal distribution the spi value can be obtained by calculating the inverse of the standard normal distribution huang et al 2014b likewise the computation of ssfi is similar to that of spi li et al 2013 because parametric approaches have some drawbacks in developing drought indicators the empirical probability which is distribution free can substitute for them to construct a nonparametric standardized index the empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 was applied to calculate the marginal probability of precipitation or other variables 1 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where n denotes the sample size i is the rank of the non zero precipitation series from smallest to largest and p x i represents the corresponding empirical probability the outputs of eq 1 can be transformed into a standardized index si as follows 2 s i ϕ p where ϕ 1 represents the inverse of the standard normal distribution function and p is the probability acquired from eq 1 the detailed computational process of nmsdi can be found in farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 in addition their corresponding 1 month spi and ssfi series were computed and compared with nmsdi in order to examine the performance of the constructed nmsdi 3 2 drought onset and termination for a particular area a drought event is identified when the nmsdi index is less than a given threshold for a duration t which is defined as a time period of more than 3 months the onset month to is the first month when the indicator is below the threshold the termination month tt is the first month when the indicator is above the threshold the threshold for drought onset is selected as 0 8 for the nmsdi index mo 2011 to guarantee that the area fully recovers from drought the threshold for drought recovery is defined as 0 2 mo 2011 the number of months when nmsdi is below zero before the onset of drought is taken as the transition period resulting in the drought onset no if the mean onset transition period is long water resource managers can use this information to mitigate the adverse impact of drought during the transition period likewise the transition period resulting in the drought termination nt is determined by counting the months where nmsdi is above the threshold before the recovery to the termination month tt the drought duration td is defined as the number of months between the onset month and termination month the drought onset transition period duration and termination transition period are critical components of droughts revealing their spatial and temporal characteristics helps to further understand drought mechanisms thereby improving the capability of drought mitigation 3 3 the modified mann kendall mmk trend test method the initial mann kendall mk trend test method recommended by the world meteorological organization is a nonparametric technique to test the trend of a time series of interest nevertheless the mk test results are expected to be affected by the persistence of hydro meteorological series hamed and rao 1998 provided a modified mann kendall mmk trend test by taking into account the lag i autocorrelation to overcome the persistence daufresne 2009 showed that the mmk test method is robust in capturing the trends of hydro meteorological series the detailed procedures of the mmk can be found in huang et al 2014a 3 4 the cross wavelet analysis the cross wavelet analysis is a new technique that is coupled with the wavelet transform and the cross spectrum analysis it can preferably capture the interrelationship between two time series in the time frequency field thus fully revealing their detailed correlations torrence and compo 1998 we therefore utilized the cross wavelet analysis to examine the detailed correlations between enso events and the nmsdi series in this study the cross wavelet transformation of two specific time series xn and yn can be expressed as w x y w x w y where represents their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w x y the complex argument arg w x y can be regarded as the local relative phase between xn and yn in the time frequency field the detailed process can be found in hao et al 2012 and the relevant codes can be freely downloaded from the following website http www pol ac uk home research waveletcoherence 4 results 4 1 the performance of the constructed nmsdi for sub zone 6 the yangtze river basin the nmsdi series has a good performance compared with the corresponding spi and ssfi series that cover 1953 2012 and their correlation coefficients are as high as 0 95 and 0 94 respectively indicating the high reliability of nmsdi the nmsdi spi and ssfi series covering 2003 2012 for sub zone 6 were also plotted and presented in fig 2 fig 2 indicates that the change pattern of nmsdi is similar to those of spi and ssfi implying that the constructed nmsdi can comprehensively reflect the changes in spi and ssfi thereby reflecting the joint features of meteorological and hydrological droughts the middle and downstream regions of the yangtze river experienced a severe drought in 2011 sun and yang 2012 which was captured by the three drought indices the areas covered by the black oval shown in fig 2 further indicating the reliability of the constructed nmsdi the areas covered by the black rectangular boxes indicates that the nmsdi captures drought onset similar to spi and determines drought duration and termination similar to ssfi nmsdi appears to underestimate the drought status compared with spi and ssfi fig 2 the actual drought conditions of a specific watershed should include the water deficit information of manifold factors such as precipitation runoff soil moisture and groundwater all of these factors can influence the real drought conditions of a given watershed the deficits of precipitation and runoff can equally impact the nmsdi proposed in this study since nmsdi is evaluated using joint probability functions between precipitation and runoff it can comprehensively reflect the deficit information of precipitation and runoff nmsdi is obtained by computing the inverse of the standard normal distribution function based on the cumulative probability of the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 this is similar to spi and ssfi which are only based on the cumulative probability of precipitation or runoff respectively thus from a numerical value perspective nmsdi seems to underestimate drought status over time compared with spi and ssfi due to its combination of deficit information of precipitation and runoff however since nmsdi combines information about precipitation and runoff it is more effective for characterizing real drought conditions in a specific watershed than spi and ssfi nmsdi is combined with the precipitation and streamflow information thus it is more sensitive and effective in identifying the onset persistence and recovery of droughts nmsdi can fully reflect realistic drought conditions in a region of interest and it can be an effective tool for drought monitoring and prediction the variations of nmsdi spi and ssfi in other sub zones for the entire period exhibited similar characteristics as sub zone 6 the relevant figures are omitted due to space limitations given the reliability and effectiveness of nmsdi in characterizing drought it was utilized in this study to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought structure in china 4 2 preferred season for drought onset and recovery for the relevant departments understanding the preferred seasons of drought onset and demise is conductive to drought preparedness and water management fig 3 shows that the ratios of the number of drought onsets to the total number of drought events have noticeable seasonal variability ranging from 4 3 to 45 2 in the four seasons overall droughts occurring in summer have the highest frequency whilst those occurring in autumn have the lowest frequency generally the frequency of drought onsets occurring in spring and summer is higher than those occurring in autumn and winter china is mainly an agricultural country and the development of agriculture and the economy largely hinges on the availability of water resources in spring and summer the agricultural sectors in china require large amounts of water for crop growth hence the high probability of drought onset occurring in these seasons exerts huge negative impacts on local agricultural production specially western china and eastern china have a higher frequency of drought onsets than other regions of china the ratios of the number of drought demises to the total number of drought events range from 8 7 to 45 8 in the four seasons in china fig 4 on the seasonal scale it can be easily found that drought demises occurring in winter have the highest frequency whilst those occurring in autumn have the lowest frequency on the spatial scale the middle and east regions of china have a relatively higher frequency of drought demise than other parts 4 3 spatial characteristics of drought structure in china in each sub zone the drought structure in terms of the drought onset termination transition period and drought duration was determined based on the nmsdi series spanning 1953 2012 the spatial distribution of the average drought onset transition period in china is presented in fig 5 the average drought onset transition period in each subzone ranges from 2 to 4 months with a mean value of nearly 3 months it can be seen from fig 5 that subzone 1 the songhua river basin and subzone 9 the southwest rivers basin have the shortest drought onset transition periods whereas the yangtze river basin subzone 6 has the longest drought onset transition period fig 6 indicates that the average drought termination period of each sub basin varies from 2 to 3 months generally the relatively long drought termination transition period more than 3 months is mainly concentrated in the yellow and yangtze river basins the middle portions of china with the rest of china experiencing a relatively short drought termination transition period overall on average the drought termination transition period is slightly shorter than the drought onset transition period in china the drought duration of each subzone varies from 5 to 6 months fig 7 the northwest rivers basin subzone 3 and the southwest rivers basin subzone 9 have the longest drought durations whilst the liaohe river basin subzone 2 and the yellow river basin subzone 5 have the shortest drought durations among the three components of drought structure drought duration is longer than the drought onset and termination transition period 4 4 temporal changes in the drought structure in china in addition to the spatial features of drought structure in china their temporal variations were studied through the mmk trend test method outlined in section 3 3 the trends of drought duration onset and demise transition period in each sub zone are shown in table 1 table 1 indicates that the changes in drought structure of china in terms of drought duration onset and termination transition period in china were stable and exhibited no obvious change trend the exception is the pearl river basin and the haihe basin which had a statically decreasing drought onset transition period and increasing drought termination transition period respectively 4 5 the correlations between enso events and the nmsdi series in china china can be classified into three major climatic regions humid region transition region sub humid and semi arid region and arid region unesco 1979 the northwest river basin subzone 3 the haihe river basin subzone 4 and the pearling river basin subzone 10 are located within the typical arid region transition region and humid region respectively and were selected to investigate the detailed correlations between enso events and the nmsdi series across different climate zones it is shown in fig 8 a that enso events have a statistically negative correlation with the nmsdi series in the northwest rivers basin with a 42 64 month signal during 1954 1960 an 18 34 month signal during 1963 1975 a 16 40 month signal during 1993 2000 and a 15 34 month signal during 2004 2012 this suggests that the arid region in china is dominated by a significantly negative relationship between enso events and nmsdi series fig 8b indicates that enso events have an obviously negative linkage with the nmsdi series in the haihe river basin with a 15 34 month signal during 1959 1973 a 16 31 month signal during 1970 1975 and a 12 40 month signal during 1994 2000 additionally enso events have a slightly positive correlation with the nmsdi series in this basin with an 8 16 month signal during 1989 1994 and a 9 15 month signal during 2000 2011 hence the transition region in china is mainly characterized by a strongly negative relationship and a slightly positive link between enso events and the nmsdi series during different time periods in general fig 8 shows that enso events have a significantly negative correlation with the nmsdi series with an 18 40 month signal during 1961 1976 an 11 16 month signal during 1997 2002 and a 10 32 month signal during 2006 2012 in addition enso events have a noticeably negative linkage with the nmsdi series with an 8 28 month signal during 1979 1985 a 9 27 month signal during 1988 1997 and a 32 58 month signal during 1994 2002 overall the humid region in china is dominated by strongly positive and negative linkages between enso events and the nmsdi series during different time periods generally enso events have a strong impact on droughts in china with a signal ranging from 16 to 64 months which is consistent with enso periodicity of 2 7 years dash et al 2013 the detailed correlations between enso events and the nmsdi series vary in different climate zones in china the arid region is mainly dominated by a statistically negative linkage between enso events and the nmsdi series whilst the transition region mainly features a strongly negative linkage and a slightly positive correlation between enso events and the nmsdi series in various time periods the humid region is characterized by significantly positive and negative linkages between enso events and the nmsdi series during different time periods 5 discussion 5 1 possible causes of some results of this study the drought onset transition period in the pearl river basin was found to be decreasing significantly table 1 this might be related to the frequent occurrence of flash droughts due to their rapid onsets previous study wang et al 2016 have investigated the trend and variability of flash droughts in the china over the period of 1979 2010 and the results showed that there are increasing trends for ﬂash droughts over various regions in china especially in southern china which corresponds well to the pearl river basin as found in section 4 5 the cross wavelet transforms between the niño 3 4 index and the nmsdi showed that the niño 3 4 index have a significantly correlation with the nmsdi series in time domain and frequency domain fig 8 furthermore we analyzed the correlation from the perspective of drought events through comparing the detected drought events and enso phases of each month during 1953 2012 fig 9 results shows that enso phases el niño la niña have a strong impact on drought events in china taking the pearl river basin as an example table 2 the drought in 1970 was mainly affected by el niño which occurred in august 1969 and ended in january 1970 comparing with enso phases the 2003 2004 drought was mainly affected by el niño which occurred in june 2002 and ended in february 2003 similarly the drought events of other regions were also strongly influenced by enso phases for the sake of space limit other examples in other regions are omitted thus enso events including el niño and la niña exert strong impacts on the drought of some parts of china in terms of drought indicator and events the onset of drought were higher during spring and summer in china which was closely related to el niño and la niña elizabeth et al 2018 ma et al 2018 fig 9 shows that the onset of el niño and la niña mostly occurred in spring and summer el niño occurred in the tropical pacific weakens the subtropical high in the northwestern pacific and the east asian summer monsoon resulting in insufficient water vapor transport to china which eventually leads to drought as for la niña it weakens the transport capacity of the two water vapor routes from the southeast and southwest and directly cause drought wang et al 2017 dai and wigley 2000 in addition the duration of the el niño or la niña generally lasts for more than six months which may control the drought duration of five or six months in china 5 2 the contribution of some results of this study the changes in the onset and termination transition period in humid and semi humid regions indicated the hazard of drought was increasing and coping with drought was more difficult than before as the drought hazard was increasing in humid and semi humid regions where people are less aware and less prepared its adverse impacts on agriculture and social economy are much more severe as a result crops should be considered for better drought tolerance when seeding and the relevant departments should attach great importance to drought preparedness meanwhile the change in drought structure should also be considered in the operation and management of major reservoirs in the basin so as to better cope with drought in dry season in addition enso events are usually prior to the onset of the drought and show a closely correlation with the drought structure in china therefore they can be used as an input factor of early drought warning system for enhancing the accuracy in drought prediction 6 conclusions this study primarily uses a nonparametric multivariate standardized drought indicator that couples precipitation and streamflow information is distribution free and can overcome the shortcomings of previous parametric methods in addition the cross wavelet analysis was adopted to examine the correlations between enso events and droughts in china the major conclusions are as follows 1 the nmsdi series has a high correlation coefficient with corresponding spi and ssfi series indicating that the nonparametric method can reliably characterize wet and dry conditions generally it is more sensitive and reliably captures the onset persistence and demise of droughts its drought identification results are more reliable than those of spi and ssfi because it combines the information from both precipitation and streamflow data therefore nmsdi is a comprehensive and effective index that is coupled with meteorological and hydrological drought features for drought monitoring and prediction 2 in china the preferred season of drought onset occurs in summer whereas that of drought termination is winter drought onsets occurring in spring and summer have significant impacts on local agricultural development in north china 3 the average drought onset transition period in china is nearly 3 months which is nearly equal to drought termination transition period meanwhile the average drought duration is approximately 6 months which is far longer than the drought onset and demise transition periods overall the drought structure in terms of its drought duration onset and termination period in china is stable and has no noticeable change trends except in the pearl river basin and the haihe basin 4 the linkages between enso events and the nmsdi series differ in various climate zones in china the arid region is mainly dominated by a statistically negative linkage whilst the transition region is characterized by a noticeably negative linkage and a slightly positive correlation in different periods for the humid region significantly positive and negative linkages are found in different periods acknowledgements this research was supported by the

regional and global scales wang et al 2011a huang et al 2014a b yu et al 2017 however previous studies have mainly focused on the changes in drought frequency duration and intensity based on various

are effective tools that allow us to quantify climate anomalies in terms of their severity duration frequency and spatial extent wilhite et al 2000 huang et al 2017 numerous different indices have been proposed to assess droughts such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 soil moisture drought index smdi hollinger et al 1993 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 1995 and vegetation condition index vci liu and kogan 1996 etc however all of these indicators can consider only one particular aspect of drought i e agricultural meteorological or hydrological drought with respect to the deficits of precipitation soil moisture and streamflow respectively mishra and singh 2010 hence the performance of a drought index based on various single variables will vary in identifying the drought characteristics a meteorological drought may quickly begin and abruptly end with the subsequent hydrologic drought occurring within some time delay heim 2002 therefore the precipitation deficit is a good variable for capturing the drought onset whereas the streamflow deficit is better for detecting the drought duration the discrepancies between the physical bases of drought related variables make it hard to develop a successful drought characterization and prediction tool on the basis of one individual variable or index such as precipitation or streamflow recently a few indicators that account for multiple variables have been developed for example svoboda et al 2002 proposed an objective blend of drought indicators obdi based on the linear weighted average of several drought indicators keyantash and dracup 2004 developed an aggregated drought index adi considering all physical types of drought

2012 for instance the recent winter drought that attacked northeast china during 2008 2009 caused more than 10 million people to suffer from water shortages and caused total economic losses of more than 2 3 billion wang et al 2011b moreover el niño and the southern oscillation enso modify the general flow of the atmosphere which could cause extreme weather in china such as drought trenberth and david 2001 huang et al 2016c liu et al 2017 2019 meng et al 2019 therefore it is very necessary to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics of the drought structure in china along with exploring the correlation between drought variations and enso events across china in this study we use an integrated drought index based on precipitation and streamflow in order to investigate drought structure from a comprehensive perspective specifically the objectives of this study are to 1 combine the information of precipitation and streamflow using a nonparametric method to comprehensively and effectively depict drought conditions 2 investigate the spatial and temporal features of drought structure in terms of drought onset persistence and recovery in china 3 determine whether droughts across china have a preferred season to start or end and determine the precursors of drought onset or demise 4 explore the association between drought variations and enso events which may have a great effect on precipitation and runoff variations in china chen et al 2014 2 data and study area 2 1 study area to systematically research the characteristics of drought structure in china the whole country was partitioned into ten sub zones based on the major basin boundaries in china which are the songhua river sr the liaohe river lr the northwest inland rivers nwr the haihe river hr the yellow river yr the yangtze river yzr the huaihe river hhr the southeast rivers ser the southwest rivers swr and the pearl river pr fig 1 the map of the 10 river basins is obtained from the lake watershed

forcing e g wind speed temperature and precipitation data for driving the vic model were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma and were interpolated into 0 25 six parameters i e the second and third soil layer depths d2 d3 the infiltration parameter b and the three parameters in the baseflow scheme dm ds ws that govern the hydrological process were calibrated against the observed streamflow of the ten major river basins of china the model calibration and validation have been conducted in previous studies and the details can be found in zhang et al 2014 specifically three parameters governing the hydrological process are calibrated dm the maximum velocity that can occur in the deepest soil layer ds the fraction of dm where nonlinear base flow begins and ws the fraction of the maximum soil moisture of the deepest soil layer where nonlinear base flow occurs the multi objective complex evolution of the university of arizona mocom ua yapo et al 1998 was used as the optimization algorithm to find the optimal parameter set based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency and the relative error it is shown that the calibrated model simulated runoff well compared with observations for the major river basins in china zhang et al 2014 we note that the calibrated model has been widely used in drought monitoring drought index construction and the assessment of climate change impacts of drought in china leng et al 2015 2016 huang et al 2015 in addition in order to reveal the possible correlation between droughts and enso events in china the nino 3 4 index derived from the noaa earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov psd data correlation nina34 data is selected to characterize enso phases since it can represent the average equatorial sea surface temperature anomalies across the pacific from about the dateline to the south american coast which is usually adopted to represent enso stages in previous studies barnston et al 1997 trenberth and david 2001 xiao et al 2015 huang et al 2016c zhang et al 2017 hao et al 2019 3 methodologies 3 1 nonparametric multivariate standardized drought index nmsdi in calculating spi the two parameter distribution is frequently used to fit the frequency distribution of precipitation the cumulative gamma probability is then transformed into the cumulative distribution function cdf of the standard normal distribution the spi value can be obtained by calculating the inverse of the standard normal distribution huang et al 2014b likewise the computation of ssfi is similar to that of spi li et al 2013 because parametric approaches have some drawbacks in developing drought indicators the empirical probability which is distribution free can substitute for them to construct a nonparametric standardized index the empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 was applied to calculate the marginal probability of precipitation or other variables 1 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where n denotes the sample size i is the rank of the non zero precipitation series from smallest to largest and p x i represents the corresponding empirical probability the outputs of eq 1 can be transformed into a standardized index si as follows 2 s i ϕ p where ϕ 1 represents the inverse of the standard normal distribution function and p is the probability acquired from eq 1 the detailed computational process of nmsdi can be found in farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 in addition their corresponding 1 month spi and ssfi series were computed and compared with nmsdi in order to examine the performance of the constructed nmsdi 3 2 drought onset and termination for a particular area a drought event is identified when the nmsdi index is less than a given threshold for a duration t which is defined as a time period of more than 3 months the onset month to is the first month when the indicator is below the threshold the termination month tt is the first month when the indicator is above the threshold the threshold for drought onset is selected as 0 8 for the nmsdi index mo 2011 to guarantee that the area fully recovers from drought the threshold for drought recovery is defined as 0 2 mo 2011 the number of months when nmsdi is below zero before the onset of drought is taken as the transition period resulting in the drought onset no if the mean onset transition period is long water resource managers can use this information to mitigate the adverse impact of drought during the transition period likewise the transition period resulting in the drought termination nt is determined by counting the months where nmsdi is above the threshold before the recovery to the termination month tt the drought duration td is defined as the number of months between the onset month and termination month the drought onset transition period duration and termination transition period are critical components of droughts revealing their spatial and temporal characteristics helps to further understand drought mechanisms thereby improving the capability of drought mitigation 3 3 the modified mann kendall mmk trend test method the initial mann kendall mk trend test method recommended by the world meteorological organization is a nonparametric technique to test the trend of a time series of interest nevertheless the mk test results are expected to be affected by the persistence of hydro meteorological series hamed and rao 1998 provided a modified mann kendall mmk trend test by taking into account the lag i autocorrelation to overcome the persistence daufresne 2009 showed that the mmk test method is robust in capturing the trends of hydro meteorological series the detailed procedures of the mmk can be found in huang et al 2014a 3 4 the cross wavelet analysis the cross wavelet analysis is a new technique that is coupled with the wavelet transform and the cross spectrum analysis it can preferably capture the interrelationship between two time series in the time frequency field thus fully revealing their detailed correlations torrence and compo 1998 we therefore utilized the cross wavelet analysis to examine the detailed correlations between enso events and the nmsdi series in this study the cross wavelet transformation of two specific time series xn and yn can be expressed as w x y w x w y where represents their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w x y the complex argument arg w x y can be regarded as the local relative phase between xn and yn in the time frequency field the detailed process can be found in hao et al 2012 and the relevant codes can be freely downloaded from the following website http www pol ac uk home research waveletcoherence 4 results 4 1 the performance of the constructed nmsdi for sub zone 6 the yangtze river basin the nmsdi series has a good performance compared with the corresponding spi and ssfi series that cover 1953 2012 and their correlation coefficients are as high as 0 95 and 0 94 respectively indicating the high reliability of nmsdi the nmsdi spi and ssfi series covering 2003 2012 for sub zone 6 were also plotted and presented in fig 2 fig 2 indicates that the change pattern of nmsdi is similar to those of spi and ssfi implying that the constructed nmsdi can comprehensively reflect the changes in spi and ssfi thereby reflecting the joint features of meteorological and hydrological droughts the middle and downstream regions of the yangtze river experienced a severe drought in 2011 sun and yang 2012 which was captured by the three drought indices the areas covered by the black oval shown in fig 2 further indicating the reliability of the constructed nmsdi the areas covered by the black rectangular boxes indicates that the nmsdi captures drought onset similar to spi and determines drought duration and termination similar to ssfi nmsdi appears to underestimate the drought status compared with spi and ssfi fig 2 the actual drought conditions of a specific watershed should include the water deficit information of manifold factors such as precipitation runoff soil moisture and groundwater all of these factors can influence the real drought conditions of a given watershed the deficits of precipitation and runoff can equally impact the nmsdi proposed in this study since nmsdi is evaluated using joint probability functions between precipitation and runoff it can comprehensively reflect the deficit information of precipitation and runoff nmsdi is obtained by computing the inverse of the standard normal distribution function based on the cumulative probability of the joint distribution of precipitation and runoff farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 this is similar to spi and ssfi which are only based on the cumulative probability of precipitation or runoff respectively thus from a numerical value perspective nmsdi seems to underestimate drought status over time compared with spi and ssfi due to its combination of deficit information of precipitation and runoff however since nmsdi combines information about precipitation and runoff it is more effective for characterizing real drought conditions in a specific watershed than spi and ssfi nmsdi is combined with the precipitation and streamflow information thus it is more sensitive and effective in identifying the onset persistence and recovery of droughts nmsdi can fully reflect realistic drought conditions in a region of interest and it can be an effective tool for drought monitoring and prediction the variations of nmsdi spi and ssfi in other sub zones for the entire period exhibited similar characteristics as sub zone 6 the relevant figures are omitted due to space limitations given the reliability and effectiveness of nmsdi in characterizing drought it was utilized in this study to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought structure in china 4 2 preferred season for drought onset and recovery for the relevant departments understanding the preferred seasons of drought onset and demise is conductive to drought preparedness and water management fig 3 shows that the ratios of the number of drought onsets to the total number of drought events have noticeable seasonal variability ranging from 4 3 to 45 2 in the four seasons overall droughts occurring in summer have the highest frequency whilst those occurring in autumn have the lowest frequency generally the frequency of drought onsets occurring in spring and summer is higher than those occurring in autumn and winter china is mainly an agricultural country and the development of agriculture and the economy largely hinges on the availability of water resources in spring and summer the agricultural sectors in china require large amounts of water for crop growth hence the high probability of drought onset occurring in these seasons exerts huge negative impacts on local agricultural production specially western china and eastern china have a higher frequency of drought onsets than other regions of china the ratios of the number of drought demises to the total number of drought events range from 8 7 to 45 8 in the four seasons in china fig 4 on the seasonal scale it can be easily found that drought demises occurring in winter have the highest frequency whilst those occurring in autumn have the lowest frequency on the spatial scale the middle and east regions of china have a relatively higher frequency of drought demise than other parts 4 3 spatial characteristics of drought structure in china in each sub zone the drought structure in terms of the drought onset termination transition period and drought duration was determined based on the nmsdi series spanning 1953 2012 the spatial distribution of the average drought onset transition period in china is presented in fig 5 the average drought onset transition period in each subzone ranges from 2 to 4 months with a mean value of nearly 3 months it can be seen from fig 5 that subzone 1 the songhua river basin and subzone 9 the southwest rivers basin have the shortest drought onset transition periods whereas the yangtze river basin subzone 6 has the longest drought onset transition period fig 6 indicates that the average drought termination period of each sub basin varies from 2 to 3 months generally the relatively long drought termination transition period more than 3 months is mainly concentrated in the yellow and yangtze river basins the middle portions of china with the rest of china experiencing a relatively short drought termination transition period overall on average the drought termination transition period is slightly shorter than the drought onset transition period in china the drought duration of each subzone varies from 5 to 6 months fig 7 the northwest rivers basin subzone 3 and the southwest rivers basin subzone 9 have the longest drought durations whilst the liaohe river basin subzone 2 and the yellow river basin subzone 5 have the shortest drought durations among the three components of drought structure drought duration is longer than the drought onset and termination transition period 4 4 temporal changes in the drought structure in china in addition to the spatial features of drought structure in china their temporal variations were studied through the mmk trend test method outlined in section 3 3 the trends of drought duration onset and demise transition period in each sub zone are shown in table 1 table 1 indicates that the changes in drought structure of china in terms of drought duration onset and termination transition period in china were stable and exhibited no obvious change trend the exception is the pearl river basin and the haihe basin which had a statically decreasing drought onset transition period and increasing drought termination transition period respectively 4 5 the correlations between enso events and the nmsdi series in china china can be classified into three major climatic regions humid region transition region sub humid and semi arid region and arid region unesco 1979 the northwest river basin subzone 3 the haihe river basin subzone 4 and the pearling river basin subzone 10 are located within the typical arid region transition region and humid region respectively and were selected to investigate the detailed correlations between enso events and the nmsdi series across different climate zones it is shown in fig 8 a that enso events have a statistically negative correlation with the nmsdi series in the northwest rivers basin with a 42 64 month signal during 1954 1960 an 18 34 month signal during 1963 1975 a 16 40 month signal during 1993 2000 and a 15 34 month signal during 2004 2012 this suggests that the arid region in china is dominated by a significantly negative relationship between enso events and nmsdi series fig 8b indicates that enso events have an obviously negative linkage with the nmsdi series in the haihe river basin with a 15 34 month signal during 1959 1973 a 16 31 month signal during 1970 1975 and a 12 40 month signal during 1994 2000 additionally enso events have a slightly positive correlation with the nmsdi series in this basin with an 8 16 month signal during 1989 1994 and a 9 15 month signal during 2000 2011 hence the transition region in china is mainly characterized by a strongly negative relationship and a slightly positive link between enso events and the nmsdi series during different time periods in general fig 8 shows that enso events have a significantly negative correlation with the nmsdi series with an 18 40 month signal during 1961 1976 an 11 16 month signal during 1997 2002 and a 10 32 month signal during 2006 2012 in addition enso events have a noticeably negative linkage with the nmsdi series with an 8 28 month signal during 1979 1985 a 9 27 month signal during 1988 1997 and a 32 58 month signal during 1994 2002 overall the humid region in china is dominated by strongly positive and negative linkages between enso events and the nmsdi series during different time periods generally enso events have a strong impact on droughts in china with a signal ranging from 16 to 64 months which is consistent with enso periodicity of 2 7 years dash et al 2013 the detailed correlations between enso events and the nmsdi series vary in different climate zones in china the arid region is mainly dominated by a statistically negative linkage between enso events and the nmsdi series whilst the transition region mainly features a strongly negative linkage and a slightly positive correlation between enso events and the nmsdi series in various time periods the humid region is characterized by significantly positive and negative linkages between enso events and the nmsdi series during different time periods 5 discussion 5 1 possible causes of some results of this study the drought onset transition period in the pearl river basin was found to be decreasing significantly table 1 this might be related to the frequent occurrence of flash droughts due to their rapid onsets previous study wang et al 2016 have investigated the trend and variability of flash droughts in the china over the period of 1979 2010 and the results showed that there are increasing trends for ﬂash droughts over various regions in china especially in southern china which corresponds well to the pearl river basin as found in section 4 5 the cross wavelet transforms between the niño 3 4 index and the nmsdi showed that the niño 3 4 index have a significantly correlation with the nmsdi series in time domain and frequency domain fig 8 furthermore we analyzed the correlation from the perspective of drought events through comparing the detected drought events and enso phases of each month during 1953 2012 fig 9 results shows that enso phases el niño la niña have a strong impact on drought events in china taking the pearl river basin as an example table 2 the drought in 1970 was mainly affected by el niño which occurred in august 1969 and ended in january 1970 comparing with enso phases the 2003 2004 drought was mainly affected by el niño which occurred in june 2002 and ended in february 2003 similarly the drought events of other regions were also strongly influenced by enso phases for the sake of space limit other examples in other regions are omitted thus enso events including el niño and la niña exert strong impacts on the drought of some parts of china in terms of drought indicator and events the onset of drought were higher during spring and summer in china which was closely related to el niño and la niña elizabeth et al 2018 ma et al 2018 fig 9 shows that the onset of el niño and la niña mostly occurred in spring and summer el niño occurred in the tropical pacific weakens the subtropical high in the northwestern pacific and the east asian summer monsoon resulting in insufficient water vapor transport to china which eventually leads to drought as for la niña it weakens the transport capacity of the two water vapor routes from the southeast and southwest and directly cause drought wang et al 2017 dai and wigley 2000 in addition the duration of the el niño or la niña generally lasts for more than six months which may control the drought duration of five or six months in china 5 2 the contribution of some results of this study the changes in the onset and termination transition period in humid and semi humid regions indicated the hazard of drought was increasing and coping with drought was more difficult than before as the drought hazard was increasing in humid and semi humid regions where people are less aware and less prepared its adverse impacts on agriculture and social economy are much more severe as a result crops should be considered for better drought tolerance when seeding and the relevant departments should attach great importance to drought preparedness meanwhile the change in drought structure should also be considered in the operation and management of major reservoirs in the basin so as to better cope with drought in dry season in addition enso events are usually prior to the onset of the drought and show a closely correlation with the drought structure in china therefore they can be used as an input factor of early drought warning system for enhancing the accuracy in drought prediction 6 conclusions this study primarily uses a nonparametric multivariate standardized drought indicator that couples precipitation and streamflow information is distribution free and can overcome the shortcomings of previous parametric methods in addition the cross wavelet analysis was adopted to examine the correlations between enso events and droughts in china the major conclusions are as follows 1 the nmsdi series has a high correlation coefficient with corresponding spi and ssfi series indicating that the nonparametric method can reliably characterize wet and dry conditions generally it is more sensitive and reliably captures the onset persistence and demise of droughts its drought identification results are more reliable than those of spi and ssfi because it combines the information from both precipitation and streamflow data therefore nmsdi is a comprehensive and effective index that is coupled with meteorological and hydrological drought features for drought monitoring and prediction 2 in china the preferred season of drought onset occurs in summer whereas that of drought termination is winter drought onsets occurring in spring and summer have significant impacts on local agricultural development in north china 3 the average drought onset transition period in china is nearly 3 months which is nearly equal to drought termination transition period meanwhile the average drought duration is approximately 6 months which is far longer than the drought onset and demise transition periods overall the drought structure in terms of its drought duration onset and termination period in china is stable and has no noticeable change trends except in the pearl river basin and the haihe basin 4 the linkages between enso events and the nmsdi series differ in various climate zones in china the arid region is mainly dominated by a statistically negative linkage whilst the transition region is characterized by a noticeably negative linkage and a slightly positive correlation in different periods for the humid region significantly positive and negative linkages are found in different periods acknowledgements this research was supported by the

11056,phillyrea angustifolia is an evergreen shrub of interest for urban landscape design as well as for use in revegetation projects in mediterranean areas which are characterized by an acute scarcity of water the effect of different levels of water deficit on several physiological ornamental and morphological parameters of phillyrea angustifolia plants was studied to evaluate their adaptability to xerogarden and or landscape conditions nursery grown plants were subjected to three irrigation treatments a control watered to container capacity and two deficit irrigation treatments of 60 and 40 of the amount of water supplied in the control treatment moderate and severe deficit irrigation after 23 months plant height was significantly inhibited by both water deficit treatments although plant compactness foliar area in relation to plant height was not affected plants under severe deficit irrigation increased their root to shoot ratio and water use efficiency which are positive aspects for hardening plants exposed to both deficit irrigation treatments exhibited slight dehydration throughout the experiment especially in spring as indicated by the lower leaf water potential and relative water content the tolerance of p angustifolia to drought was mainly related to adjust osmotic and regulated stomatal closure it is concluded that both deficit irrigation treatments can be used successfully in p angustifolia plant production to reduce water consumption while maintaining good overall quality moderate deficit irrigation is specially recommended for gardening purposes since this treatment produced plants with of visual quality severe deficit irrigation is more suitable for landscaping purposes as an effective nursery technique to produce plants

production losses in agriculture and imposing strong limitations to the establishment and management of green spaces in cityscapes toscano et al 2019 water scarcity is very common in many areas of the world and together with increased industrialization rapid population growth and climate change have resulted in important water resource problems especially in urban environments lea cox and ross 2001 nazemi rafi et al 2019a water conservation in cityscapes is of great importance as a considerable fraction of municipal water resources in urban areas nearly 25 is used for irrigation of municipal landscapes and gardens in urban communities zollinger et al 2006 welsh et al 2007 sun et al 2012 in this context managing global water resources is one of the most pressing challenges of the twenty first century and there is a considerable pressure in agriculture to produce crops more efficiently by reducing water use fulcher et al 2016 caser et al 2017 the same applies to irrigated urban landscapes cirillo et al 2013 therefore in order to mitigate water demand conflicts managers are seekingto achieve significant long and short term conservation strategies brown et al 2004 nazemi rafi et al 2019a for example by using precision landscape irrigation kjelgren et al 2000 reclaimed water hilaire et al 2008 gómez bellot et al 2013 native and drought tolerant plant species lockett et al 2002 applying deficit irrigation strategies mansour et al 2017 sánchez blanco et al 2019 and identifying the varying water needs involved in the developmental stages stabler and martin 2000 álvarez et al 2013 surprisingly relatively little research has quantified irrigation requirements of ornamental plants although they constitute a major part of horticultural production and such knowledge would offer great possibilities for water conservation in landscaping henson et al 2006 moreover the determination of the minimum watering level for acceptable ornamental quality has not been much investigated cameron et al 2006 ornamental native plants and particularly shrubs are widely used in revegetation and xerogardening projects in mediterranean regions because of their potential adaptation to adverse environmental conditions such as drought and salinity which represent the strongest limiting factors for plant growth and survival vilagrosa et al 2010 álvarez et al 2012 2018 nazemi rafi et al 2019b several ornamental plants particularly shrub and bush species have evolved particular combinations of structural and physiological traits to cope with drought salinity and high solar irradiation stresses tattini et al 2002 2005 2006 therefore they provide interesting models for study because they not only provide relevant additional information on general stress tolerance mechanisms in plants but also furnish know how on their adaptability for use in landscaping and urban greening acosta motos et al 2014 2017 cassaniti et al 2009 cirillo et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 carillo et al 2019 phillyrea angustifolia l is a member of the oleaceae family and an evergreen sclerophylluos largely distributed through dry warm areas of the mediterranean basin gucci et al 1997 tattini et al 2006 most phillyrea show some degree of tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought peñuelas et al 1998 filella et al 1998 mira et al 2017 they are also known for their high salt tolerance tattini and traversi 2008 tattini et al 2002 2006 gugliuzza et al 2013a it is for these reasons that phillyrea species is currently being investigated for their potential to restore vegetation in dry land areas of the mediterranean basin which may suffer from drought during the warm summer season in this sense the effect of severe summer drought conditions produced by withholding irrigation on the physiological and morphological parameters of field grown p angustifolia plants and its drought avoidance strategies have been well established by peñuelas et al 2004 and by vilagrosa et al 2014 moreover the prolonged water stress resulting from low rainfall and high temperatures in summer in the mediterranean ecosystem may alter the plant s physiological and morphological behaviour being summer drought considered the most critical factor for the establishment of seedlings after transplanting sánchez blanco et al 2014 thus transplantation from a nursery to the landscape or xerogarden creates a stressful transition period which is critical to the establishment performance and survival of these plants franco et al 2006 in this sense earlier studies indicated the need to harden plants to reduce the problems associated with drought franco et al 2001 2011 bañón et al 2004 fernandez et al 2006 numerous studies in ornamental plants have pointed to the importance of factors such as the degree of water stress imposed and the timing and duration of the same on each species navarro et al 2009 álvarez et al 2009 2013 thus a desirable level of deficit irrigation during the hardening phase may result in stocky stress resistant seedlings but if the water restriction is too severe the effects may be negative and plants will die the goal of seedling pre conditioning is to produce sturdy plants that have a high level of photosynthetic reserves and adequate morphological characteristics enabling rapid establishment and resumption of growth once in the landscape franco et al 2006 although the general effects of withholding irrigation during the summer period on the growth and survival of p angustifolia have been studied peñuelas et al 2004 further work is required to quantify its physiological responses to water management in the nursery to optimize the production of high quality plants for all this increasing our understanding of the morphological and physiological shoot and root responses of plants to water management in the nursery is critical for optimising the production of high quality plants gugliuzza et al 2013b tested the influence of different water regimes on p angustilofia over a period of 3 months and found it to be relatively tolerant to water deficit mainly due to decreased growth reduction and a good performance which could make this drought tolerant ornamental shrub an interesting plant material for the establishment and management of urban green spaces under water limited conditions providing different solutions to cityscapes of semi arid mediterranean environments however while drought tolerant species have developed mechanisms such as efficient stomatal control linked to conservative use of water resources and increased the water uptake through deep root systems allowing plants to alleviate the harmful effect of water stress and grow during stressful conditions this does not necessarily mean that the plants require little water for high visual quality cameron et al 1999 álvarez et al 2012 2018 sánchez blanco et al 2002 augé et al 2003 in ornamental plants production destined for use in gardening quality depends strongly on visual quality suitable aesthetic appearance and plant fitness nazemi rafi et al 2019a stabler and martin 2000 unlike in revegetation projects where other features are considered of interest such as the structure of the root system or biomass partitioning the short term response in terms of growth to deficit irrigation during the warm summer season in p angustifolia have been well described in previous studies fernandez et al 2004 2006 gugliuzza et al 2013b bit little is known about its physiological and ornamental responses to different levels of deficit irrigation this is important beause in urban gardening projects unlike in most revegetation projects plants are usually watered and fertilized as needed or at least partially watered to maintain an acceptable appearance further work is needed to characterize and quantify the responses in terms of ornamental traits to water shortage this knowledge is critical for optimizing sustainable high quality production without compromising the economic value of the crop cameron et al 2006 franco et al 2006 caser et al 2017 moreover it is well known that plant response to water stress depends not only on the intensity of deficit treatment but also on the time of exposure to the stress álvarez and sánchez blanco 2013 álvarez et al 2018 hence carryover effects from year to year need to be assessed when deficit irrigation is used in long lived species as the interaction of both parameters will determine the physiological and molecular changes that take place mirás avalos et al 2016 since the growing season also seems to affect the response of shrubs to abiotic stresses valdez aguilar et al 2011 álvarez et al 2013 the present research was carried out during two growing seasons 24 months using different deficit irrigation levels in order to evaluate the sustainability of the strategies considered as well as to identify the most appropriate deficit irrigation strategy for each situation which would contribute to better water management in the mediterranean area based on these considerations the aim of this work was to study the long term effects on p angustifolia plants in response to water deficit which may occur during the nursery phase or gardening conditions the drought tolerance of phillyrea angustifolia was compared in terms of growth ornamental traits water relations gas exchange and partitioning between organs to ascertain the changes that take place in plants exposed to different levels of deficit irrigation during the nursery phase and whether these changes confer stress resistance to the plant for gardening and or revegetation purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions rooted cuttings of 1 year old

deficit irrigation sdi one drip nozzle delivering 2 l h 1 per plant was connected to two spaghetti tubes one on each side of every pot and the duration of each irrigation episode was used to vary the amount of water applied which depended on the treatment and on weather conditions all the plants were irrigated daily using tap water where the electrical conductivity of the water ranged between 0 8

chlorophyll meter in 20 plants per treatment the rate of passive ion leakage from stress sensitive plant tissue can be used as a measure of alterations in membrane permeability in our case ion leakage was estimated at the end of the experiment with five replicates per treatment in mature leaves according to the method described by lafuente et al 1991 the substrate water content was periodically

means were separated with duncan s multiple range test statistical comparisons were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 plant water relations gas exchange parameters and osmotic adjustment the volumetric water content of the substrate at midday reflected the different irrigation treatments and the climatic conditions it was highest in the control plants and decreased proportionally with the deficit level imposed with respect to the control fig 1 this pattern was reflected in the seasonal values of the leaf water potential at midday ψl which decreased in the water deficit treatments especially in the sdi plants in which values of 2 2 mpa were reached in april fig 2 a leaf water potential at midday ψl decreased in all irrigation regimes as the evaporative demand of the atmosphere increased showing maximum values in winter and minimum values in spring when environmental conditions became stressful 16 19 months after transplanting at this time both deficit irrigation plants had lower ψl values than the control after this period the ψl values gradually increased in all treatments despite the fact that this period coincided with summer 19 23 months after transplanting at the end of the experiment september the end of summer 23 months after transplanting ψl remained lower in sdi plants than in the control and mdi plants rwc values showed a similar behaviour to that observed for ψl with sdi plants having the lowest values especially in spring march fig 2b this was followed by an increase in the values of rwc for water deficit treatments until the end of the summer when significant differences with the control were only observed in sdi 23 months after transplanting no pronounced differences in rwc were observed between control and mdi during most of the experimental period although mdi affected rwc during spring march when lower values were observed in the mdi treatment compared with the control fig 2b in general the plants subjected to both water deficit treatments showed lower stomatal conductance than the control especially in the case of severe water stress fig 3 a such reductions with respect to the control plants were also observed in the pn levels in both water stress treatments fig 3b the seasonal pattern of gs consisted of a spring depression in all treatments as the evaporative demand of the atmosphere increased 15 18 months regardless of the amount of water applied all the plants had very low values of below 50 μmmol m 2s 1 at the end of spring 18 months although plants of the sdi treatment also reached very low gs values during the previous 3 months these lower values of gs and pn recorded in spring were followed by a marked increase in all irrigation treatments until the end of summer at the end of the experiment september plants from both deficit irrigation treatments had similar gs values to control plants and even higher pn values than the control plants meaning that intrinsic water use efficiency pn gs increased in the deficit irrigation plants at this time leaf osmotic potential values at full turgor ψ100s decreased in all deficit irrigation treatments which was indicative of the osmotic adjustment that occurred due to deficit irrigation the difference between the values obtained in the control and stressed plants were taken as an estimate of this adjustment 0 76 and 0 70 mpa for mdi and sdi respectively fig 2c the chlorophyll fluorescence values fv fm did not change in any of the treatments during the experiment remaining at around 0 75 0 80 fig 4 a membrane damage assessed by ion leakage was not affected by the water availability conditions of the substrate table 1 3 2 plant growth and ornamental parameters water deficit affected the growth and size of the phillyrea angustifolia plants table 1 plants submitted to severe deficit irrigation sdi showed a reduction in biomass production at the end of the experimental period although no significant differences were observed between moderate deficit irrigation mdi and control treatments table 1 at the end of the experiment sdi plants showed reduced leaf dry weight dw compared with the control whereas the stem and root dw were not affected by the water availability conditions in the substrate plants submitted to severe deficit irrigation treatment showed an increase in the root to shoot ratio and the specific leaf area sla at the end of the experimental period while these parameters were not modified in plant submitted to mdi succulence did not change in any of the treatments the irrigation regime also affected plant height and differences between treatments were evident throughout the experimental period in this respect plant height was significantly reduced by both water deficit treatments 21 months after application of the deficit irrigation onwards fig 5 a with reductions of 18 and 21 for mdi and sdi respectively compared with the control at the end of the experiment water deficit also led to a decrease in the relative growth rate as a function of plant height rgr during spring the reductions being more marked in the severe deficit irrigation and in the second growth season 15 18 months after transplanting fig 5b in both deficit irrigation treatments plant height and leaf area were reduced to a similar extent compared with the control with the result that compactness was not modified in these plants table 1 water deficit led to an increase in water use efficiency wue in all parts of the plant leaf stem and root but this increase was only significant in roots of the severe water deficit plants fig 6 no differences in the leaf colour parameters lightness chroma and hue angle were observed in mdi compared with the control fig 7 the higher hº and rcc values and lower c values recorded in the leaves of the plants submitted to sdi at the end of the experiment confirmed the darker and less vivid green colour of the foliage compared with control plants figs 7b c and 4 b 4 discussion common responses in species exposed to saline or drought stress are an increase in osmotic adjustment and changes in cell wall elasticity which result in the turgor loss point being reached at a lower leaf water potential and at a lower relative water content navarro et al 2009 suárez 2011 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 in our assay at the end of the experimental period p angustifolia plants exposed to water stress showed osmotic adjustment as a tolerance mechanism to drought in order to maintain turgor facilitating the continued uptake of water from the soil similar results have also been reported in many other ornamental species such as callistemon a woody plant álvarez et al 2011 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 or in geranium and carnation herbaceous plants sánchez blanco et al 2009 álvarez et al 2009 however álvarez et al 2018 found that pistacia lentiscus plants did not show osmotic adjustment in the face of water stress and in this case turgor maintenance was associated with increases in cell wall elasticity decreases in ε tissues more elastic long periods of water stress can produce significant modifications in the morphofunctional characteristics of plants as if a preconditioning process had occurred during the experiment rubio et al 2001 previous studies in pistacia lentiscus showed that this species is very sensitive to preconditioning and one of the modifications related to this process acclimation is the higher elasticity of cell membranes álvarez et al 2018 the maintenance of turgor through the passive concentration of solutes increased solute concentration as a result of reduced cell volume under drought stress is an advantageous mechanism in arid environments to avoid energetic costs a result of the synthesis of organic solutes evans et al 1992 sucre and suárez 2011 acosta motos et al 2017 under water stress increased succulence may dilute organic ion concentration increasing the cost of osmotic adjustment flowers and yeo 1986 sucre and suárez 2011 which did not occur in our assay as succulence was not affected by either water stress level as regards water status plants exposed to deficit irrigation exhibited slight dehydration throughout the experiment especially in spring as indicated by the lower ψl and rwc due to the low availability of the substrate water remorini and massai 2003 the increasing evaporative demand during spring decreased the leaf water potential and the lowest ψl values for c mdi and sdi plants were reached in april between 1 1 and 2 2 mpa the diurnal course in ψl reflected the stress conditions and even the watered plants were mildly stressed which may have been the consequence of high air temperature and irradiance producing low ψl and stomatal conductance at midday bacelar et al 2007 gratani et al 2013 however as water stress progressed over time a process of acclimation to drought could have occurred in these plants which was reflected in the subsequent recovery that occurred in p angustifolia during summer 19 23 months after transplanting with values of ψl and rwc that were higher than those previously obtained these changes together with the osmotic adjustment reached at the end of the experiment allowed deficit irrigation plants to maintain relatively high net photosynthetic rates and a high photosystem ii status and these plants only showed slight growth reduction suggesting that acclimation to drought thorough changes in water relations vilagrosa et al 2003 sucre and suárez 2011 in addition as indicated in the results pn gs and wue was higher in p angustifolia plants growing in severe deficit irrigation conditions sdi a response that has been observed in numerous ornamental plants cameron et al 2006 jaleel et al 2008 mugnai et al 2009 álvarez et al 2009 2012 2018 unlike in agriculture improving wue in the urban landscape does not necessarily mean improving the overall yield or growth the ultimate goal is rather to achieve a more efficient use of water accompanied by suitable aesthetic appearance and plant fitness stabler and martin 2000 our estimation of higher wue under lower irrigation conditions agreed with those of nazemi rafi et al 2019a who observed althae rosea and rudbeckia hirta ornamental herbaceous plants under deficit irrigation had higher thickness better light interception chaves et al 2002 the presence of trichomes dunkić et al 2001 and decreased leaf area lazaridou and koutroubas 2004 huang et al 2005 which may have led to a better water saving and an improvement in wue therefore wue could be considered as an index of the ability of the plant species to save water under dry conditions fang et al 2010 plant functioning and gas exchange attributes were affected by water deprivation as lower pn and gs values were observed under di treatments especially in spring when environmental conditions were more stressful this indicates that p angustifolia plants regulated their transpiration when subjected to water constraints ruiz sánchez et al 2010 which is a common response of cultivated and ornamental plants grown in mediterranean climates grant et al 2012 toscano et al 2019 photosynthetic reductions are strongly associated to stomatal closure and consequent decreases of intracellular co2 morales et al 2008 in addition the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence rates supports the idea that stomatal factors were the main factor responsible for the decline in photosynthesis observed in our experiment in this sense the absence of any change or difference in the fv fm ratio in p angustifolia during the experiment suggests that severe drought did not cause damage to leaf tissue or at least it was not irreversible indicating that the maximal psii primary photochemistry was not permanently affected by the stressful conditions experienced by the plants in a similar way peñuelas et al 2004 observed that p angustifolia leaves can avoid damage to the photosynthetic apparatus by changing pigment and antioxidant levels in response to drought induced oxidative stress and the dissipation of excess excitation energy seems to afford protection to the photosynthetic apparatus in drought stressed p angustifolia plants thus this species did not suffer from photoinhibitory damage to its photosynthetic apparatus as indicated by the absence of significant changes in fv fm and mda levels at least at the drought stress levels tested by peñuelas rwcs above 50 although it may occur later when stress is more severe in the present study this level of stress was not reached for plants at any sampling time during the experiment and rwc values were always higher than 70 moreover the increases in leaf rcc in p angustifolia plants subjected to water stress during the experimental period suggest that there was no oxidative damage in this sense chloroplasts in mediterranean species under drought and high light conditions have been shown to possess several strategies to avoid photoinhibitory processes e g mechanisms to consume the reducing power generated by psii flexas and medrano 2002 demmig adams and adams 2006 these results agree with those of vilagrosa et al 2010 who reported high resistance at chloroplast level for p lentiscus under drought conditions additionally our data about the unchanged not decreased leaf chlorophyll content in drought stressed plants are consistent with the previous study of peñuelas et al 2004 in p angustifolia who reported that this species is able to activate several mechanisms of photo and antioxidant protection to withstand drought stress during the mediterranean summer in addition when the drought is not extremely severe these mechanisms are able to protect the tissues from lipid peroxidation and to allow the maintenance of high photosynthetic rates if meteorological conditions are adequate drought is one of the most important environmental stresses limiting plant establishment and growth cregg 2002 fang et al 2010 ali et al 2017 while the prime effect of water stress in agricultural crops is yield reduction the most important drought stress effects in ornamental plants are negative effects on their visual quality and decorative effect cirillo et al 2014 caser et al 2017 nazemi rafi et al 2019a responses to drought stress have been widely reported in different ornamental species and one of the consequences of exposing plants to a reduced water supply in terms of plant growth is the lower biomass accumulation the production of smaller leaves and reductions in size and or quality sánchez blanco et al 2002 franco et al 2006 andrew et al 2013 the different levels of irrigation applied in our assay led to substantial differences in the growth of p angustifolia plants while moderate water stress produced no significant changes in plant development with the exception of plant height a greater water deficit clearly reduced the aerial growth parameters this finding may be important for growers because ornamental plants are often exposed to drought treatments during nursery production to reduce excessive vigour and promote a more compact habit without applying growth retardants however it goes without saying that it is first necessary to know the severity of the water stress to which a species can be exposed to maintain healthy growth without reducing quality henson et al 2006 cirillo et al 2017 although by the end of experiment water stress had inhibited the size of p angustifolia such a reduction was only noticeable long after the beginning of the treatments confirming that the duration of the stress is also an important factor the highest drought stress level clearly induced the lowest growth rates especially during spring when the evaporative demand of the atmosphere increased similar to other woody perennials in arid zones p angustifolia is slow growing even with an optimal water supply and nutrient availability mean rgr was lower than 0 01 d 1 for our control plants as previously reported for phillyrea latifolia tattini et al 2002 in our conditions deficit irrigation did not increase the relationship between leaf area and plant height however importantly it did not decreased either so that the ornamental value of the plants was maintained in this study visual appeal was mainly affected by the severe deficit irrigation treatment which leds to plants with lower leaf growth and leaves of a less intense color which would have decreased the commercial value of these plants destined for decorative purposes the response of species to stresses in terms of growth is the ultimate expression of several interacting physiological and biochemical parameters and has often been used to characterise salt or water deficit tolerance sidari et al 2008 cassaniti et al 2009 however the absence of reductions in growth during stress does not necessarily guarantee adequate aesthetic values nazemi rafi et al 2019a as high visual quality also depends on other characteristics such as foliage colour or the absence of symptoms of necrosis moreover aesthetically and commercially an increase in foliage size in relation to plant height gives the plant a compactness and architectural equilibrium that are much appreciated by customers álvarez et al 2013 deficit irrigation has the potential to improve crop quality by promoting a more compact habit as previously reported for other ornamental species álvarez et al 2009 as regards biomass partitioning drought exposed plants in our study reduced their aerial growth more than root growth resulting in an increased root to shoot ratio although this only occurred in sdi plants confirming the importance of the severity of the water stress these responses have been described in several ornamental species by jaleel et al 2008 in catharanthus roseus by henson et al 2006 and by hassanein and dorion 2006 in p hortorum by andersson 2001 in pelargonium zonale by andersson 2011 in i walleriana and petunia x hybrid and by nazemi rafi et al 2019a in althaea rosea nevertheless this ratio is not always increased by drought stress álvarez et al 2018 reported that the root to shoot ratio in pistacia lentiscus was not affected under drought conditions and navarro et al 2009 mentioned that severe water deficit similar to that used in our trial significantly reduced the root to shoot ratio in myrtus plants the attractiveness and commercial value of ornamental plants destined for use in gardens is associated with visual appeal such as high intensity and duration of flowering adequate development leaves of intense colour and an acceptable relationship between plant height and leaf area álvarez et al 2013 carillo et al 2019 however when plants are used for landscaping and revegetation purposes the nursery industry values plants with a high root to shoot ratio increased water use efficiency and an improved root system franco et al 2006 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 this last aspect is an important factor for successful transplanting and establishment in the field since root anatomy and structure may be decisive for plant survival bañón et al 2004 the slight inhibition of leaf growth as a result of the severe water deficit is seen as an adaptation because it allows plants to avoid large water losses by lowering transpiration and delaying the onset of more severe stress de herralde et al 1998 ruiz sánchez et al 2000 bañón et al 2006 in this sense severe deficit irrigation in nursery conditions would improve resistance to water deficit situations when plants grow in field conditions after transplanting franco et al 2006 this was confirmed by the increased root to shoot ratio and the proportion of plant biomass invested in leaf area sla as a result of the severe water deficit which confer and advantage in resource uptake efficiency by increasing the absorption surface per unit of tissue biomass and may be decisive for plant survival de la riva et al 2016 álvarez et al 2018 despite being a morphological trait sla is widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning not only for the prediction of drought tolerance but also for competitive effects in landscape planting as it is highly correlated with processes such as photosynthetic capacity potential growth rate chemical composition and resistance to herbivory nazemi rafi et al 2019a in our conditions the highest water use efficiency of production wue estimated as dry weight per unit of water used together with an increased root to shoot ratio could promote a more rapid establishment in landscape conditions 5 conclusion in conclusion our results showed that using deficit irrigation in p angustifolia under mediterranean conditions is a viable irrigation management strategy forsaving water without compromising the overall quality of the ornamental plants the tolerance of p angustifolia to drought was related to a slight osmotic adjustment and an effective mechanism of stomatal control the results show that p angustifolia is highly resistant to water stress but the morphological and physiological responses differed between both deficit irrigation levels in this sense moderate deficit irrigation mdi involvingreductions of 40 of the water supplied did not affect aesthetic features biomass accumulation compactness and leaf color in p angustifolia plants which may be of interest for optimizing sustainable high quality production however reductions of 60 of the water applied severe deficit irrigation sdi inhibited plant growth but was accompanied by an increased root to shoot and water use efficiency which are positive aspects that would allow the plants to overcome the transplant shock that can occur later in landscaping projects based on its observed behaviour p angustifolia can be regarded as an interesting ornamental species for gardening and landscaping projects in arid areas acknowledgements this work was

11056,phillyrea angustifolia is an evergreen shrub of interest for urban landscape design as well as for use in revegetation projects in mediterranean areas which are characterized by an acute scarcity of water the effect of different levels of water deficit on several physiological ornamental and morphological parameters of phillyrea angustifolia plants was studied to evaluate their adaptability to xerogarden and or landscape conditions nursery grown plants were subjected to three irrigation treatments a control watered to container capacity and two deficit irrigation treatments of 60 and 40 of the amount of water supplied in the control treatment moderate and severe deficit irrigation after 23 months plant height was significantly inhibited by both water deficit treatments although plant compactness foliar area in relation to plant height was not affected plants under severe deficit irrigation increased their root to shoot ratio and water use efficiency which are positive aspects for hardening plants exposed to both deficit irrigation treatments exhibited slight dehydration throughout the experiment especially in spring as indicated by the lower leaf water potential and relative water content the tolerance of p angustifolia to drought was mainly related to adjust osmotic and regulated stomatal closure it is concluded that both deficit irrigation treatments can be used successfully in p angustifolia plant production to reduce water consumption while maintaining good overall quality moderate deficit irrigation is specially recommended for

production losses in agriculture and imposing strong limitations to the establishment and management of green spaces in cityscapes toscano et al 2019 water scarcity is very common in many areas of the world and together with increased industrialization rapid population growth and climate change have resulted in important water resource problems especially in urban environments lea cox and ross 2001 nazemi rafi et al 2019a water conservation in cityscapes is of great importance as a considerable fraction of municipal water resources in urban areas nearly 25 is used for irrigation of municipal landscapes and gardens in urban communities zollinger et al 2006 welsh et al 2007 sun et al 2012 in this context managing global water resources is one of the most pressing challenges of the twenty first century and there is a considerable pressure in agriculture to produce crops more efficiently by reducing water use fulcher et al 2016 caser et al 2017 the same applies to irrigated urban landscapes cirillo et al 2013 therefore in order to mitigate water demand conflicts managers are seekingto achieve significant long and short term conservation strategies brown et al 2004 nazemi rafi et al 2019a for example by using precision landscape irrigation kjelgren et al 2000 reclaimed water hilaire et al 2008 gómez bellot et al 2013 native and drought tolerant plant species lockett et al 2002 applying deficit irrigation strategies mansour et al 2017 sánchez blanco et al 2019 and identifying the varying water needs involved in the developmental stages stabler and martin 2000 álvarez et al 2013 surprisingly relatively little research has quantified irrigation requirements of ornamental plants although they constitute a major part of horticultural production and such knowledge would offer great possibilities for water conservation in landscaping henson et al 2006 moreover the determination of the minimum watering level for acceptable ornamental quality has not been much investigated cameron et al 2006 ornamental native plants and particularly shrubs are widely used in revegetation and xerogardening projects in mediterranean regions because of their potential adaptation to adverse environmental conditions such as drought and salinity which represent the strongest limiting factors for plant growth and survival vilagrosa et al 2010 álvarez et al 2012 2018 nazemi rafi et al 2019b several ornamental plants particularly shrub and bush species have evolved particular combinations of structural and physiological traits to cope with drought salinity and high solar irradiation stresses tattini et al 2002 2005 2006 therefore they provide interesting models for study because they not only provide relevant additional information on general stress tolerance mechanisms in plants but also furnish know how on their adaptability for use in landscaping and urban greening acosta motos et al 2014 2017 cassaniti et al 2009 cirillo et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 carillo et al 2019 phillyrea angustifolia l is a member of the oleaceae family and an evergreen sclerophylluos largely distributed through dry warm areas of the mediterranean basin gucci et al 1997 tattini et al 2006 most phillyrea show some degree of tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought peñuelas et al 1998 filella et al 1998 mira et al 2017 they are also known for their high salt tolerance tattini and traversi 2008 tattini et al 2002 2006 gugliuzza et al 2013a it is for these reasons that phillyrea species is currently being investigated for their potential to restore vegetation in dry land areas of the mediterranean basin which may suffer from drought during the warm summer season in this sense the effect of severe summer drought conditions produced by withholding irrigation on the physiological and morphological parameters of field grown p angustifolia plants and its drought avoidance strategies have been well established by peñuelas et al 2004 and by vilagrosa et al 2014 moreover the prolonged water stress resulting from low rainfall and high temperatures in summer in the mediterranean ecosystem may alter the plant s physiological and morphological behaviour being summer drought considered the most critical factor for the establishment of seedlings after transplanting sánchez blanco et al 2014 thus transplantation from a nursery to the landscape or xerogarden creates a stressful transition period which is critical to the establishment performance and survival of these plants franco et al 2006 in this sense earlier studies indicated the need to harden plants to reduce the problems associated with drought franco et al 2001 2011 bañón et al 2004 fernandez et al 2006 numerous studies in ornamental plants have pointed to the importance of factors such as the degree of water stress imposed and the timing and duration of the same on each species navarro et al 2009 álvarez et al 2009 2013 thus a desirable level of deficit irrigation during the hardening phase may result in stocky stress resistant seedlings but if the water restriction is too severe the effects may be negative and plants will die the goal of seedling pre conditioning is to produce sturdy plants that have a high level of photosynthetic reserves and adequate morphological characteristics enabling rapid establishment and resumption of growth once in the landscape franco et al 2006 although the general effects of withholding irrigation during the summer period on the growth and survival of p angustifolia have been studied peñuelas et al 2004 further work is required to quantify its physiological responses to water management in the nursery to optimize the production of high quality plants for all this increasing our understanding of the morphological and physiological shoot and root responses of plants to water management in the nursery is critical for optimising the production of high quality plants gugliuzza et al 2013b tested the influence of different water regimes on p angustilofia over a period of 3 months and found it to be relatively tolerant to water deficit mainly due to decreased growth reduction and a good performance which could make this drought tolerant ornamental shrub an interesting plant material for the establishment and management of urban green spaces under water limited conditions providing different solutions to cityscapes of semi arid mediterranean environments however while drought tolerant species have developed mechanisms such as efficient stomatal control linked to conservative use of water resources and increased the water uptake through deep root systems allowing plants to alleviate the harmful effect of water stress and grow during stressful conditions this does not necessarily mean that the plants require little water for high visual quality cameron et al 1999 álvarez et al 2012 2018 sánchez blanco et al 2002 augé et al 2003 in ornamental plants production destined for use in gardening quality depends strongly on visual quality suitable aesthetic appearance and plant fitness nazemi rafi et al 2019a stabler and martin 2000 unlike in revegetation projects where other features are considered of interest such as the structure of the root system or biomass partitioning the short term response in terms of growth to deficit irrigation during the warm summer season in p angustifolia have been well described in previous studies fernandez et al 2004 2006 gugliuzza et al 2013b bit little is known about its physiological and ornamental responses to different levels of deficit irrigation this is important beause in urban gardening projects unlike in most revegetation projects plants are usually watered and fertilized as needed or at least partially watered to maintain an acceptable appearance further work is needed to characterize and quantify the responses in terms of ornamental traits to water shortage this knowledge is critical for optimizing sustainable high quality production without compromising the economic value of the crop cameron et al 2006 franco et al 2006 caser et al 2017 moreover it is well known that plant response to water stress depends not only on the intensity of deficit treatment but also on the time of exposure to the stress álvarez and sánchez blanco 2013 álvarez et al 2018 hence carryover effects from year to year need to be assessed when deficit irrigation is used in long lived species as the interaction of both parameters will determine the physiological and molecular changes that take place mirás avalos et al 2016 since the growing season also seems to affect the response of shrubs to abiotic stresses valdez aguilar et al 2011 álvarez et al 2013 the present research was carried out during two growing seasons 24 months using different deficit irrigation levels in order to evaluate the sustainability of the strategies considered as well as to identify the most appropriate deficit irrigation strategy for each situation which would contribute to better water management in the mediterranean area based on these considerations the aim of this work was to study the long term effects on p angustifolia plants in response to water deficit which may occur during the nursery phase or gardening conditions the drought tolerance of phillyrea angustifolia was compared in terms of growth ornamental traits water relations gas exchange and partitioning between organs to ascertain the changes that take place in plants exposed to different levels of deficit irrigation during the nursery phase and whether these changes confer stress resistance to the plant for gardening and or revegetation purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions rooted cuttings of 1 year old

deficit irrigation sdi one drip nozzle delivering 2 l h 1 per plant was connected to two spaghetti tubes one on each side of every pot and the duration of each irrigation episode was used to vary the amount of water applied which depended on the treatment and on weather conditions all the plants were irrigated daily using tap water where the electrical conductivity of the water ranged between 0 8 and 1 0 ds m 1 2 3 growth and plant water measurements at the beginning and at the end of the treatment period eight plants per treatment were separated into leaves stem and roots before being oven

a minolta cr 10 colorimeter which provided the colour coordinates lightness l chroma c and hue angle hº mcguire 1992 using eight leaves for each treatment and rcc was measured with a minolta spad 502 chlorophyll meter in 20 plants per treatment the rate of passive ion leakage from stress sensitive plant tissue can be used as a measure of alterations in membrane permeability in our case ion leakage was estimated at the end of the experiment with five replicates per treatment in mature leaves according to the method described by lafuente et al 1991 the substrate water content was periodically determined using time domain reflectometry tdr equipment tektronic model 1502b in ten plants per treatment throughout the experimental period changes in leaf water potential ψl relative water content rwc stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthetic rate pn were determined in seven plants per treatment in mature leaves at midday ψl was estimated according to the method described by scholander et al 1965 using a pressure chamber soil moisture equipment co santa barbara ca usa for which leaves were placed in the chamber within 20 s of collection and pressurised at a rate of 0 02 mpa s 1 turner 1988 while the rwc of leaves was calculated according to barrs 1968 leaf osmotic potential at full turgor ψ100s was measured in five plants per treatment using excised leaves with their petioles placed in distilled water overnight to reach full saturation leaves from the ψ100s measurements were then frozen in liquid nitrogen 196 c and stored at 30 c after thawing the osmotic potential was measured in the extracted sap using a wescor 5520 vapour pressure osmometer wescor logan ut usa according to gucci et al 1991 gas exchange parameters gs pn were determined using a gas exchange system

means were separated with duncan s multiple range test statistical comparisons were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 plant water relations gas exchange parameters and osmotic adjustment the volumetric water content of the substrate at midday reflected the different irrigation treatments and the climatic conditions it was highest in the control plants and decreased proportionally with the deficit level imposed with respect to the control fig 1 this pattern was reflected in the seasonal values of the leaf water potential at midday ψl which decreased in the water deficit treatments especially in the sdi plants in which values of 2 2 mpa were reached in april fig 2 a leaf water potential at midday ψl decreased in all irrigation regimes as the evaporative demand of the atmosphere increased showing maximum values in winter and minimum values in spring when environmental conditions became stressful 16 19 months after transplanting at this time both deficit irrigation plants had lower ψl values than the control after this period the ψl values gradually increased in all treatments despite the fact that this period coincided with summer 19 23 months after transplanting at the end of the experiment september the end of summer 23 months after transplanting ψl remained lower in sdi plants than in the control and mdi plants rwc values showed a similar behaviour to that observed for ψl with sdi plants having the lowest values especially in spring march fig 2b this was followed by an increase in the values of rwc for water deficit treatments until the end of the summer when significant differences with the control were only observed in sdi 23 months after transplanting no pronounced differences in rwc were observed between control and mdi during most of the experimental period although mdi affected rwc during spring march when lower values were observed in the mdi treatment compared with the control fig 2b in general the plants subjected to both water deficit treatments showed lower stomatal conductance than the control especially in the case of severe water stress fig 3 a such reductions with respect to the control plants were also observed in the pn levels in both water stress treatments fig 3b the seasonal pattern of gs consisted of a spring depression in all treatments as the evaporative demand of the atmosphere increased 15 18 months regardless of the amount of water applied all the plants had very low values of below 50 μmmol m 2s 1 at the end of spring 18 months although plants of the sdi treatment also reached very low gs values during the previous 3 months these lower values of gs and pn recorded in spring were followed by a marked increase in all irrigation treatments until the end of summer at the end of the experiment september plants from both deficit irrigation treatments had similar gs values to control plants and even higher pn values than the control plants meaning that intrinsic water use efficiency pn gs increased in the deficit irrigation plants at this time leaf osmotic potential values at full turgor ψ100s decreased in all deficit irrigation treatments which was indicative of the osmotic adjustment that occurred due to deficit irrigation the difference between the values obtained in the control and stressed plants were taken as an estimate of this adjustment 0 76 and 0 70 mpa for mdi and sdi respectively fig 2c the chlorophyll fluorescence values fv fm did not change in any of the treatments during the experiment remaining at around 0 75 0 80 fig 4 a membrane damage assessed by ion leakage was not affected by the water availability conditions of the substrate table 1 3 2 plant growth and ornamental parameters water deficit affected the growth and size of the phillyrea angustifolia plants table 1 plants submitted to severe deficit irrigation sdi showed a reduction in biomass production at the end of the experimental period although no significant differences were observed between moderate deficit irrigation mdi and control treatments table 1 at the end of the experiment sdi plants showed reduced leaf dry weight dw compared with the control whereas the stem and root dw were not affected by the water availability conditions in the substrate plants submitted to severe deficit irrigation treatment showed an increase in the root to shoot ratio and the specific leaf area sla at the end of the experimental period while these parameters were not modified in plant submitted to mdi succulence did not change in any of the treatments the irrigation regime also affected plant height and differences between treatments were evident throughout the experimental period in this respect plant height was significantly reduced by both water deficit treatments 21 months after application of the deficit irrigation onwards fig 5 a with reductions of 18 and 21 for mdi and sdi respectively compared with the control at the end of the experiment water deficit also led to a decrease in the relative growth rate as a function of plant height rgr during spring the reductions being more marked in the severe deficit irrigation and in the second growth season 15 18 months after transplanting fig 5b in both deficit irrigation treatments plant height and leaf area were reduced to a similar extent compared with the control with the result that compactness was not modified in these plants table 1 water deficit led to an increase in water use efficiency wue in all parts of the plant leaf stem and root but this increase was only significant in roots of the severe water deficit plants fig 6 no differences in the leaf colour parameters lightness chroma and hue angle were observed in mdi compared with the control fig 7 the higher hº and rcc values and lower c values recorded in the leaves of the plants submitted to sdi at the end of the experiment confirmed the darker and less vivid green colour of the foliage compared with control plants figs 7b c and 4 b 4 discussion common responses in species exposed to saline or drought stress are an increase in osmotic adjustment and changes in cell wall elasticity which result in the turgor loss point being reached at a lower leaf water potential and at a lower relative water content navarro et al 2009 suárez 2011 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 in our assay at the end of the experimental period p angustifolia plants exposed to water stress showed osmotic adjustment as a tolerance mechanism to drought in order to maintain turgor facilitating the continued uptake of water from the soil similar results have also been reported in many other ornamental species such as callistemon a woody plant álvarez et al 2011 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 or in geranium and carnation herbaceous plants sánchez blanco et al 2009 álvarez et al 2009 however álvarez et al 2018 found that pistacia lentiscus plants did not show osmotic adjustment in the face of water stress and in this case turgor maintenance was associated with increases in cell wall elasticity decreases in ε tissues more elastic long periods of water stress can produce significant modifications in the morphofunctional characteristics of plants as if a preconditioning process had occurred during the experiment rubio et al 2001 previous studies in pistacia lentiscus showed that this species is very sensitive to preconditioning and one of the modifications related to this process acclimation is the higher elasticity of cell membranes álvarez et al 2018 the maintenance of turgor through the passive concentration of solutes increased solute concentration as a result of reduced cell volume under drought stress is an advantageous mechanism in arid environments to avoid energetic costs a result of the synthesis of organic solutes evans et al 1992 sucre and suárez 2011 acosta motos et al 2017 under water stress increased succulence may dilute organic ion concentration increasing the cost of osmotic adjustment flowers and yeo 1986 sucre and suárez 2011 which did not occur in our assay as succulence was not affected by either water stress level as regards water status plants exposed to deficit irrigation exhibited slight dehydration throughout the experiment especially in spring as indicated by the lower ψl and rwc due to the low availability of the substrate water remorini and massai 2003 the increasing evaporative demand during spring decreased the leaf water potential and the lowest ψl values for c mdi and sdi plants were reached in april between 1 1 and 2 2 mpa the diurnal course in ψl reflected the stress conditions and even the watered plants were mildly stressed which may have been the consequence of high air temperature and irradiance producing low ψl and stomatal conductance at midday bacelar et al 2007 gratani et al 2013 however as water stress progressed over time a process of acclimation to drought could have occurred in these plants which was reflected in the subsequent recovery that occurred in p angustifolia during summer 19 23 months after transplanting with values of ψl and rwc that were higher than those previously obtained these changes together with the osmotic adjustment reached at the end of the experiment allowed deficit irrigation plants to maintain relatively high net photosynthetic rates and a high photosystem ii status and these plants only showed slight growth reduction suggesting that acclimation to drought thorough changes in water relations vilagrosa et al 2003 sucre and suárez 2011 in addition as indicated in the results pn gs and wue was higher in p angustifolia plants growing in severe deficit irrigation conditions sdi a response that has been observed in numerous ornamental plants cameron et al 2006 jaleel et al 2008 mugnai et al 2009 álvarez et al 2009 2012 2018 unlike in agriculture improving wue in the urban landscape does not necessarily mean improving the overall yield or growth the ultimate goal is rather to achieve a more efficient use of water accompanied by suitable aesthetic appearance and plant fitness stabler and martin 2000 our estimation of higher wue under lower irrigation conditions agreed with those of nazemi rafi et al 2019a who observed althae rosea and rudbeckia hirta ornamental herbaceous plants under deficit irrigation had higher thickness better light interception chaves et al 2002 the presence of trichomes dunkić et al 2001 and decreased leaf area lazaridou and koutroubas 2004 huang et al 2005 which may have led to a better water saving and an improvement in wue therefore wue could be considered as an index of the ability of the plant species to save water under dry conditions fang et al 2010 plant functioning and gas exchange attributes were affected by water deprivation as lower pn and gs values were observed under di treatments especially in spring when environmental conditions were more stressful this indicates that p angustifolia plants regulated their transpiration when subjected to water constraints ruiz sánchez et al 2010 which is a common response of cultivated and ornamental plants grown in mediterranean climates grant et al 2012 toscano et al 2019 photosynthetic reductions are strongly associated to stomatal closure and consequent decreases of intracellular co2 morales et al 2008 in addition the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence rates supports the idea that stomatal factors were the main factor responsible for the decline in photosynthesis observed in our experiment in this sense the absence of any change or difference in the fv fm ratio in p angustifolia during the experiment suggests that severe drought did not cause damage to leaf tissue or at least it was not irreversible indicating that the maximal psii primary photochemistry was not permanently affected by the stressful conditions experienced by the plants in a similar way peñuelas et al 2004 observed that p angustifolia leaves can avoid damage to the photosynthetic apparatus by changing pigment and antioxidant levels in response to drought induced oxidative stress and the dissipation of excess excitation energy seems to afford protection to the photosynthetic apparatus in drought stressed p angustifolia plants thus this species did not suffer from photoinhibitory damage to its photosynthetic apparatus as indicated by the absence of significant changes in fv fm and mda levels at least at the drought stress levels tested by peñuelas rwcs above 50 although it may occur later when stress is more severe in the present study this level of stress was not reached for plants at any sampling time during the experiment and rwc values were always higher than 70 moreover the increases in leaf rcc in p angustifolia plants subjected to water stress during the experimental period suggest that there was no oxidative damage in this sense chloroplasts in mediterranean species under drought and high light conditions have been shown to possess several strategies to avoid photoinhibitory processes e g mechanisms to consume the reducing power generated by psii flexas and medrano 2002 demmig adams and adams 2006 these results agree with those of vilagrosa et al 2010 who reported high resistance at chloroplast level for p lentiscus under drought conditions additionally our data about the unchanged not decreased leaf chlorophyll content in drought stressed plants are consistent with the previous study of peñuelas et al 2004 in p angustifolia who reported that this species is able to activate several mechanisms of photo and antioxidant protection to withstand drought stress during the mediterranean summer in addition when the drought is not extremely severe these mechanisms are able to protect the tissues from lipid peroxidation and to allow the maintenance of high photosynthetic rates if meteorological conditions are adequate drought is one of the most important environmental stresses limiting plant establishment and growth cregg 2002 fang et al 2010 ali et al 2017 while the prime effect of water stress in agricultural crops is yield reduction the most important drought stress effects in ornamental plants are negative effects on their visual quality and decorative effect cirillo et al 2014 caser et al 2017 nazemi rafi et al 2019a responses to drought stress have been widely reported in different ornamental species and one of the consequences of exposing plants to a reduced water supply in terms of plant growth is the lower biomass accumulation the production of smaller leaves and reductions in size and or quality sánchez blanco et al 2002 franco et al 2006 andrew et al 2013 the different levels of irrigation applied in our assay led to substantial differences in the growth of p angustifolia plants while moderate water stress produced no significant changes in plant development with the exception of plant height a greater water deficit clearly reduced the aerial growth parameters this finding may be important for growers because ornamental plants are often exposed to drought treatments during nursery production to reduce excessive vigour and promote a more compact habit without applying growth retardants however it goes without saying that it is first necessary to know the severity of the water stress to which a species can be exposed to maintain healthy growth without reducing quality henson et al 2006 cirillo et al 2017 although by the end of experiment water stress had inhibited the size of p angustifolia such a reduction was only noticeable long after the beginning of the treatments confirming that the duration of the stress is also an important factor the highest drought stress level clearly induced the lowest growth rates especially during spring when the evaporative demand of the atmosphere increased similar to other woody perennials in arid zones p angustifolia is slow growing even with an optimal water supply and nutrient availability mean rgr was lower than 0 01 d 1 for our control plants as previously reported for phillyrea latifolia tattini et al 2002 in our conditions deficit irrigation did not increase the relationship between leaf area and plant height however importantly it did not decreased either so that the ornamental value of the plants was maintained in this study visual appeal was mainly affected by the severe deficit irrigation treatment which leds to plants with lower leaf growth and leaves of a less intense color which would have decreased the commercial value of these plants destined for decorative purposes the response of species to stresses in terms of growth is the ultimate expression of several interacting physiological and biochemical parameters and has often been used to characterise salt or water deficit tolerance sidari et al 2008 cassaniti et al 2009 however the absence of reductions in growth during stress does not necessarily guarantee adequate aesthetic values nazemi rafi et al 2019a as high visual quality also depends on other characteristics such as foliage colour or the absence of symptoms of necrosis moreover aesthetically and commercially an increase in foliage size in relation to plant height gives the plant a compactness and architectural equilibrium that are much appreciated by customers álvarez et al 2013 deficit irrigation has the potential to improve crop quality by promoting a more compact habit as previously reported for other ornamental species álvarez et al 2009 as regards biomass partitioning drought exposed plants in our study reduced their aerial growth more than root growth resulting in an increased root to shoot ratio although this only occurred in sdi plants confirming the importance of the severity of the water stress these responses have been described in several ornamental species by jaleel et al 2008 in catharanthus roseus by henson et al 2006 and by hassanein and dorion 2006 in p hortorum by andersson 2001 in pelargonium zonale by andersson 2011 in i walleriana and petunia x hybrid and by nazemi rafi et al 2019a in althaea rosea nevertheless this ratio is not always increased by drought stress álvarez et al 2018 reported that the root to shoot ratio in pistacia lentiscus was not affected under drought conditions and navarro et al 2009 mentioned that severe water deficit similar to that used in our trial significantly reduced the root to shoot ratio in myrtus plants the attractiveness and commercial value of ornamental plants destined for use in gardens is associated with visual appeal such as high intensity and duration of flowering adequate development leaves of intense colour and an acceptable relationship between plant height and leaf area álvarez et al 2013 carillo et al 2019 however when plants are used for landscaping and revegetation purposes the nursery industry values plants with a high root to shoot ratio increased water use efficiency and an improved root system franco et al 2006 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 this last aspect is an important factor for successful transplanting and establishment in the field since root anatomy and structure may be decisive for plant survival bañón et al 2004 the slight inhibition of leaf growth as a result of the severe water deficit is seen as an adaptation because it allows plants to avoid large water losses by lowering transpiration and delaying the onset of more severe stress de herralde et al 1998 ruiz sánchez et al 2000 bañón et al 2006 in this sense severe deficit irrigation in nursery conditions would improve resistance to water deficit situations when plants grow in field conditions after transplanting franco et al 2006 this was confirmed by the increased root to shoot ratio and the proportion of plant biomass invested in leaf area sla as a result of the severe water deficit which confer and advantage in resource uptake efficiency by increasing the absorption surface per unit of tissue biomass and may be decisive for plant survival de la riva et al 2016 álvarez et al 2018 despite being a morphological trait sla is widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning not only for the prediction of drought tolerance but also for competitive effects in landscape planting as it is highly correlated with processes such as photosynthetic capacity potential growth rate chemical composition and resistance to herbivory nazemi rafi et al 2019a in our conditions the highest water use efficiency of production wue estimated as dry weight per unit of water used together with an increased root to shoot ratio could promote a more rapid establishment in landscape conditions 5 conclusion in conclusion our results showed that using deficit irrigation in p angustifolia under mediterranean conditions is a viable irrigation management strategy forsaving water without compromising the overall quality of the ornamental plants the tolerance of p angustifolia to drought was related to a slight osmotic adjustment and an effective mechanism of stomatal control the results show that p angustifolia is highly resistant to water stress but the morphological and physiological responses differed between both deficit irrigation levels in this sense moderate deficit irrigation mdi involvingreductions of 40 of the water supplied did not affect aesthetic features biomass accumulation compactness and leaf color in p angustifolia plants which may be of interest for optimizing sustainable high quality production however reductions of 60 of the water applied severe deficit irrigation sdi inhibited plant growth but was accompanied by an increased root to shoot and water use efficiency which are positive aspects that would allow the plants to overcome the transplant shock that can occur later in landscaping projects based on its observed behaviour p angustifolia can be regarded as an interesting ornamental species for gardening and landscaping projects in arid areas acknowledgements this work was

11057,to evaluate the response of tall fescue festuca arundinacea to the reclamation of severely saline coastal soil with different levels of treated wastewater effluent a field experiment was conducted in 2015 2016 the treated effluent was saline ec 4 2 6 9 ds m and five treatments of irrigation water were blended with treated effluent 0 25 50 75 and 100 and fresh groundwater the saline soil contained a gravel sand layer imbedded at depth of 60 cm to cut off the capillary porosity irrigation were applied by micro sprinkler and the irrigation management was divided into salt leaching stage including enhanced salt leaching and water salt regulation and normal irrigation stage the result indicated that during these stages the leaf chlorophyll content increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased because the main stress was from fertility rather than salinity during the normal irrigation stage the leaf proline content increased to 1759 0 1970 7 2388 8 2699 7 and 2820 3 μmol g in the rainless season after which it decreased to 485 8 486 0 515 9 513 8 and 561 5 μmol g in the rainy season treated effluent had no significant effect on the root amount of tall fescue but led to greater root distribution in the shallow layer except for the 100 treatment because of the induced increase in surface soil salinity during salt leaching stage soil salinity did not clearly affect the yield of tall fescue the yield generally increased as the treated effluent percentage increased because of the fertility value while during dry season of normal irrigation stage the accumulated soil salinity decreased the yield overall the reclamation method using treated effluent is feasible for tall fescue based on the method the appropriate percentage of treated effluent of total applied water including irrigation and rainfall was below 70 80 keywords reclamation method soil salinity water quality 1 introduction there is over 10 000 km2 of saline soil along the coast of the north of yangtze river in china which borders on the pacific ocean yu and chen 1999 these regions are well developed and experiencing rapid economic growth coastal saline soil is usually very saline soil salt content 0 5 2 0 with a shallow saline groundwater 1 2 m depth 10 30 g l wang et al 1993 which significantly affects the growth of many plants traditional reclamation methods such as applying gypsum combining surface irrigation and water drainage technologies have not effectively improved saline soil therefore replacing saline soil with non saline soil is the most popular and effective method of treating such soil in bohai bay moreover tall fescue festuca arundinacea is the most widely used turf species in the research region because of its moderate tolerant salt resistance maas and hoffman 1977 for saline soil it is essential to maintain a net downward movement of soil water to allow salinity leaching asano and pettygrove 1987 oster 1994 läuchli and epstein 1990 in the last decade a method of reclamation of saline soil using drip irrigation has been reported chen et al 2015 li et al 2015a 2015b 2015c sun et al 2013 2017 in this method drip irrigation based on the soil matric potential smp was employed to manage the soil salinity in a coastal saline soil after a gravel sand layer was embedded under the root zone soil upon application of this method surface soil salt was leached out within several days with continuous irrigation after which the salt above the gravel sand layer was leached by controlling the smp at 5kpa after salt leaching freshwater irrigation was applied when the smp reached a target value of 20 kpa or 35 kpa chen et al 2015 li et al 2015b to ensure the plant roots grew deeper and broader based on this method the survival rate was up to 90 for about 30 species of landscape plants li et al 2015b moreover a reclamation method of micro sprinkler irrigation was also shown to be useful for coastal saline soil by chu et al 2014 the freshwater supply of the bohai gulf region is 660 m3 per capita and the over exploitation of deep groundwater has led to a decrease in the water table at a rate of 0 65 1 39 m y in the trial region sun 2007 additionally about 3 9 billion m3 of treated effluent were produced in coastal cities of the bohai gulf region in 2015 li 2016 liu 2016 wei 2016 wu and peng 2016 with a reuse rate of only 8 3 li 2016 when using treated effluent for irrigation some water quality factors such as the salinity level and nutrient content need to be considered oster 1994 especially salinity if the treated effluent is to be applied in coastal regions based on the reclamation method described above a study was conducted using micro sprinkler irrigation of severely saline soil with treated effluent li et al 2019 in that study the irrigation management was divided into three stages enhanced salt leaching continuous irrigation water salt regulation irrigation based on the smp at 5 kpa and normal irrigation the first two stages were salt leaching stage during which time the soil ece in the 0 60 cm soil layer decreased from 38 29 ds m to 1 42 3 16 ds m after 4 months the observed ece in the normal irrigation stage changed slightly showing a close relationship with the precipitation salt and some specific chemical elements may cause plant damage al hamaiedeh and bino 2010 asano and pettygrove 1987 toze 2006 or even foliar damage when using sprinkler irrigation shalhevet 1994 grattan 1990 if excessive amounts of salt accumulate to toxic levels in a plant older transpiring leaves it will reduce the photosynthetic leaf area to a level that cannot sustain growth munns 2002 salinity reduces the ability of plants to take up water and causes reductions in growth rates plant response to salinity varies depending on its growth stage variety and rootstock maas 1990 under saline conditions some plants could enhance salinity tolerance by decreasing transporting rate of na and cl to leaves compartmentalizing these ions in vacuoles munns 2002 increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes meloni et al 2003 or regulating photosynthetic efficiency tang et al 2018 the nutrient content of treated effluent such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium could provide fertilizer value to plants lubello et al 2004 asano and pettygrove 1987 toze 2006 nitrogen fertilization thomas and thorne 1975 and phosphorus fertilization peterson et al 1993 could increase the chlorophyll content having the opposite effect of salinity wang 2010 although the level of soil fertility may alleviate deleterious effects of salinity stress on plant yildirim et al 2009 it does not influence the tolerance of plants to salinity berstein et al 1974 shalhevet 1994 treated effluent irrigation with staged managements has been proved to be an effective reclamation method in saline coastal soil li et al 2019 however when the tall fescue was planted the soil salinity was severe as the saline soil was reclaimed using treated effluent the soil water salinity and nutrient condition were also changed therefore the present study was conducted to test the physiological and growth response of tall fescue to the process that severely saline soil was being reclaimed and to the level of treated effluent under different irrigation managements moreover an appropriate percentage of treated effluent for use as irrigation water for tall fescue was identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from 2015 to 2016 at the industrial zone 39 03 n 118 48 e caofeidian district tangshan china located at the northern portion of the bohai gulf which borders the pacific ocean the annual precipitation in the study area is about 552 2 mm most of which occurs from july to september the spring and early summer are generally dry the study soil is sandy loam developed in sea reclamation land with an initial soil bulk density of 1 69 g cm3 the field soil is severely saline soil with an average ece at 0 60 cm of 38 3 ds m in which chlorine and sodium are the main ions the soil organic matter content was 11 4 g kg total n was 0 24 g kg available phosphorus was 8 1 mg kg available potassium was 464 mg kg and ph was 7 68 saturated soil extracts the saline groundwater table was 0 8 1 2 m below the surface 2 2 experimental design there were five treatments of irrigation water quality which consisted of freshwater blended with the following percentages of treated effluent 0 gg1 25 gg2 50 gg3 75 gg4 and 100 gg5 each treatment was in a completely randomized block design consisting of three replications each plot was 9 0 by 6 0 m containing six inserted micro sprinklers beijing luckrain plastic industry ltd china 3 0 m apart the micro sprinkler had a flow rate of 120 l h at a 0 2 mpa operating pressure with a wetted diameter of 3 1 m soil treatment before laying turf was as follows the soil was removed to a depth of about 60 cm depth and a 15 cm thick gravel sand layer was added fig 1 the gravel sand layer was to cut off the capillary rise to prevent upward movement of saline groundwater into the root zone soil after that the removed saline soil was backfilled and the average soil bulk density was decreased to 1 55 g cm3 meanwhile a drain was located at the lower side of the field to remove the leaching water treated effluent was obtained from the caofeidian district sewage treatment plant and the quality met the first grade national standard for wastewater discharge sepa and gaqsiq 2003 freshwater was pumped from a deep well located at the experimental site as tables 1 and 2 show the salt concentration nutrient concentration cod and sar of the treated effluent was higher than that of the freshwater but the ph was not in fact the quality of the treated effluent varied with electrical conductivity ec of 4 21 6 89 ds m the number of fecal coliforms in the treated effluent was 130 1700 cfu l and the heavy metals levels of the irrigation water were generally suitable for irrigation except for se ayers and westcot 1985 the irrigation management started as the tall fescue turf was laid in early july of 2015 the irrigation management was divided into three stages enhanced salt leaching stage water salt regulation stage and normal irrigation stage in which the first two stages were salt leaching stage the enhanced salt leaching stage was to provide a suitable soil condition for the recovery of tall fescue in a short time the soil salinity was leached with continuous irrigation until the ece of the 0 10 cm layer was below or close to 6 ds m the water salt regulation stage was to leach salt out the soil above the gravel sand layer by ensuring a net downward movement of water asano and pettygrove 1987 the irrigation was applied when the smp at a depth of 0 2 m reached the target value of 5 kpa chen et al 2015 li et al 2015a 2015b the normal irrigation stage was to maintain soil health and ensure the normal growth of tall fescue during the stage the smp was controlled below 20 kpa apart from a period that was controlled below 10 kpa in the rainless season april to may 2016 in addition n p2o5 and k2o fertilizer were applied at rates of 20 g m2 5 g m2 and 10 g m2 respectively during early october 2015 and july 2016 2 3 observation and measurements soil sampling was conducted in mid july september and early november 2015 as well as late may early july and early november 2016 soil samples were obtained horizontally apart at 0 50 100 and 150 cm from the micro sprinkler and vertically apart at 10 cm from topsoil to the gravel sand layer the soil ece and inorganic nitrogen nmin including nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were examined based on extracts of saturated soil while the available phosphorus was extracted by 0 5 mol l nahco3 the ece was determined using a conductivity meter dds 307 rex shanghai china while the content of nmin and available phosphorus were measured by spectrophotometry bao 2000 in this experiment the average ece and nmin within the soil profile was calculated as follows 1 e c e t o r n m i n t j k n m e c e t j k o r n m i n t j k s j k j k n m s j

their contents were measured by spectrophotometry zhao et al 2002 chen and wang 2006 root sampling was conducted in october 2016 from the top to the gravel sand layer at representative points with a stainless steel auger 10 cm diameter with the soil samples divided into 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 cm roots were placed in nylon net bags with a mesh size of 0 15 mm then shaken in water until soil was no longer present on the material at which point they were dried at 60 for 24 h after which the roots were weighed 2 4 statistical procedures data were analyzed using ibm spss statistics ver 19 0 ibm co armonk ny usa the differences in the yield of tall fescue leaf free proline content leaf chlorophyll content and root dry mass among treatments were compared using the least significant difference test at a significance level of 0 05 the figures were generated using sigma plot 10 0 systat software inc chicago il usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation and irrigation fig 2 and table 3 show the precipitation and irrigation amount for each treatment during the study period the enhanced salt leaching stage lasted for 10 d during which time there was no rain and about 10 20 mm of irrigation water was applied each day table 2 during the water salt regulation stage irrigation was applied based on the smp which was controlled at well above 5 kpa there was a total precipitation of 394 9 mm and a total irrigation water of 300 390 mm for the five treatments table 2 during the normal irrigation stage the irrigation was applied at the control smp value of 20 kpa or at 10 kpa in the rainless season april to may 2016 the total precipitation was 539 2 mm which mainly occurred in mid late june and late july to early september fig 2 and the irrigation amount ranged from 280 to 400 mm for treatments gg1 gg5 table 3 3 2 response of the physiology of tall fescue to treated effluent irrigation 3 2 1 leaf chlorophyll content fig 3 shows the leaf chlorophyll content of tall fescue when irrigated with different levels of treated effluent in general the observed chlorophyll content ranged from 1 25 to 2 24 mg g fw fresh weight during the study period the lowest content 1 18 1 56 mg g fw was found in late may and july of 2016 when there was no fertilizer the highest leaf chlorophyll content was observed in october of 2015 about ten days after fertilization when it was 2 13 2 24 mg g fw these results may agree with previous findings showing that fertility increased chlorophyll content thomas and thorne 1975 peterson et al 1993 or that fertility alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress on the chlorophyll a and b contents akram and ashraf 2011 salinity has been reported to decrease the contents of chlorophyll akram and ashraf 2011 li et al 2018 meloni et al 2003 sahin et al 2018 tang et al 2018 wang 2010 while some other reports found that high salinity increased chloroplast density per unit leaf area because leaves became smaller and thicker munns and tester 2008 tall fescue has a salt tolerance threshold of 3 9 ds m with a slope of 5 3 per ds m maas and hoffman 1977 in this study during the rainless season of march may of 2016 the soil salinity increased from 0 98 1 63 1 76 2 05 and 2 28 ds m to 1 32 2 82 3 35 3 34 and 4 44 ds m for gg1 gg5 fig 5 respectively while the accumulated soil salinity was then reduced to 1 53 2 96 ds m july of 2016 by subsequent precipitation fig 5 when compared to the chlorophyll contents in may 2016 the average content in july of 2016 changed less showing an average decrease of 0 03 mg g fw these results suggested that the main limitation of the increase in tall fescue s chlorophyll content observed in this study was not salinity rather the leaf chlorophyll content showed an increasing linear relationship with the increasing percentage of treated effluent fig 4 this was likely because the treated effluent contained 5 3 mg l more total nitrogen content and 2 fold more total phosphorus than freshwater table 1 these results further indicated that the leaf chlorophyll content was likely to be affected by nutrient level when irrigated with different levels of treated effluent no matter which irrigation management stages tall fescue was in 3 2 2 leaf proline content as an osmolyte in plants proline plays an important role in influencing stress tolerance induced by osmotic stress such as drought and soil salinity delauney and verma 1993 szabados and savouré 2010 many plants accumulate proline to high levels in response to osmotic stress fougere et al 1991 sahin et al 2018 szabados and savouré 2010 proline accumulation can protect subcellular structures and macromolecules protect protein integrity enhance the activities of different enzymes mishra and dubey 2006 szabados and savouré 2010 and reduce oxidative stress alia et al 1997 hong et al 2000 fig 6 shows the leaf proline content of tall fescue when irrigated with different levels of treated effluent the highest content was found in may 2016 when the levels were 3 6 5 3 and 1 7 2 5 times greater than those observed for gg1 gg5 in early june 2016 and september 2016 respectively during may 2016 the smp was controlled at 10 kpa and the proline content increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased p 0 01 fig 7 with significant differences being observed between gg5 or gg4 and gg2 or gg1 p 0 05 fig 6 these results were similar to those observed in other studies wang 2010 paudel et al 2016 and were likely caused by salinity and may water content during early july of 2016 when the soil salinity was partly leached by precipitation the proline content of the gg1 gg5 treatments decreased from 1759 0 1970 7 2388 8 2699 7 and 2820 3 μg g dw dry weight to 485 8 486 0 515 9 513 8 and 561 5 μg g dw respectively at the end of the rainy season in late september of 2016 the leaf proline content increased to 884 8 1478 5 μg g dw fig 6 these results suggested that in the normal irrigation stage the proline content decreased as the stress from salinity or and drought decreased 3 3 root growth and distribution table 4 shows the root dry mass of tall fescue for each treatment in october 2016 the total root dry mass of tall fescue ranged from 1 17 to 1 34 kg m2 with no significant differences between treatments however it decreased by 10 69 7 63 2 29 and 0 76 respectively in response to irrigation with 25 50 75 and 100 treated effluent instead of freshwater the result shown in the present study that 25 and 50 treated effluent decrease the root mass of 7 11 while 75 and 100 treated effluent seemed to had less effect on the root mass of tall fescue paudel et al 2016 found that treated wastewater ec 1 93 ds m decreased root growth of ruby red grapefruit salt tolerance of 1 8 ds m maas and hoffman 1977 by 20 with sandy loam soil while hoffman et al 1983 reported that irrigation water salinity ec 4 ds m had no significant effect on total root mass of tall fescue although there was no significant difference the nutrient level of treated effluent may influence the root of tall fescue at some degree a high level of treated effluent contained high p ca concentration and other nutrients adequate ca concentration under saline conditions can increase root length cramer et al 1986 kent and läuchli 1985 and p fertility could cause carax coriacea roots to become thicker powell 1974 but some other reports showed that the application of different levels of k and p may not alter root weight of sunflower plants akram and ashraf 2011 the root of tall fescue under saline condition was reported to be exponentially distributed at a depth of 120 cm hoffman et al 1983 in this experiment very few roots were found below the gravel sand layer because of the severely saline condition as shown in table 4 about 82 89 of the roots were concentrated in the 0 20 cm layer while only about 7 13 and 2 7 of the roots were found in the layers of 20 40 cm and 40 cm respectively the root percentage at 0 20 cm increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased to 75 similar results were reported by hoffman et al 1983 who found that higher water salinity 4 vs 1 ds m increased the root density in the shallow parts of the soil profile with a corresponding reduction in the deep profile however for the gg5 treatment the root percentage of the shallow soil decreased which was probably a result of the salt distribution in the profile as shown in fig 8 the shallow salinity of gg5 was obviously higher than that of deep soil which may cause a relatively large percentage of root growth in the deep low salinity layers 3 4 response of the yield of tall fescue to treated effluent irrigation as shown in table 5 the total yield of tall fescue increased by 7 54 17 65 33 36 and 47 21 respectively in response to irrigation with 25 50 75 and 100 treated effluent instead of freshwater during the study period the concentration of inorganic nitrogen and available phosphorus in the 0 40 cm soil layer was 1 90 4 77 mg l and 4 11 7 43 mg kg respectively indicating poor soil fertility table 6 therefore the treated effluent could promote the plant growth because of its relatively higher nutrient content toze 2006 which was similar to the results of previous studies al lahham et al 2003 al nakshabandi et al 1997 chakrabarti 1995 lubello et al 2004 among different sampling times the yield of tall fescue generally increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased table 5 however the yield may also have been affected by climate and soil conditions such as precipitation and soil salinity the first cutting occurred in september 2015 of the water salt regulation stage about 70 d after the tall fescue was recovered in mid july and the yield followed the order of gg5 gg4 gg3 gg1 gg2 during the growing period a total of 390 mm of precipitation and 210 290 mm of irrigation water was applied resulting in a rapid decrease in salinity from 9 01 12 00 ds m in mid july 2015 to 2 67 5 16 ds m in september 2015 at 0 40 cm multiple linear regression analysis table 7 showed that the irrigation water quality significantly affected the biomass of tall fescue p 0 01 but the effect of the weighted soil salinity was not statistically significant p 0 05 these results may indicate that during the water salt regulation stage the nutrients in irrigation water led to an increase in the yield of tall fescue while the higher soil salinity did not clearly affect plant growth however treated effluent also had a negative effect on soil salinity and plant growth during the normal irrigation stage in the early june 2016 sampling the soil salinity increased fig 5 and the yield followed the order of gg4 gg5 gg1 gg2 gg3 table 6 regression analysis during the growing period revealed a negative correlation between the yield of tall fescue and soil ece p 0 01 as well as a positive correlation with the percentage of treated effluent p 0 01 table 7 these findings indicated that when the soil salinity accumulated during the dry season of the normal irrigation stage either irrigation water quality or soil salinity could clearly affect plant growth however the nutrients of treated effluent promoted the plant growth while the accumulated salinity decreased the yield or delayed the time required to revive the tall fescue precipitation can dilute the salinity of treated effluent leach soil salinity and decrease salt damage to plants so its effect on tall fescue should be considered to find an appropriate proportion of treated effluent to total applied water including irrigation and rainfall for tall fescue rainfall was also seen as a kind of freshwater ec 0 1 ds m in the present study a higher relative yield often represented a better visual appeal as shown in fig 9 the relative yield of tall fescue did not increase as the percentage of treated effluent increased until the percentage of treated effluent in the total amount of applied water was below 70 80 this is because at low percentage of treated effluent the fertility not the salinity primarily limited the growth of tall fescue however once salinity severely limited growth the yield decreased even when more nutrients were applied berstein et al 1974 and the decrease may have been correlated with the plant s tolerance and the duration of exposure shalhevet 1994 therefore when irrigating with treated effluent of 4 2 6 9 ds m on tall fescue the proportion of treated effluent to total applied water could be below 70 80 i e the percentage of treated effluent of irrigation water could be or above 70 80 depending on precipitation 4 conclusions the response of tall fescue showed that treated effluent and staged irrigation managements including salt leaching stage and normal irrigation stage could be used for tall fescue turf planting in severely coastal saline soil in different irrigation management stage the leaf chlorophyll content increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased while during the normal irrigation stage the proline content was found to increase as the salinity stress increased treated effluent had no significant effect on the root biomass of tall fescue but influenced the root distribution in the soil profile a higher percentage of treated effluent led to shallow roots but the shallow saline soil of the 100 treated effluent treatment increased the root distribution in the deep layer the nutrients of irrigation water increased the yield of tall fescue while during the dry season of the normal irrigation stage the accumulated soil salinity significantly decreased the yield however during the water salt regulation stage soil salinity did not clearly affect the yield because the water was applied frequently for the coastal treated effluent of 4 2 6 9 ds m its appropriate percentage of total applied water including irrigation and rainfall for tall fescue was below 70 80 therefore in the costal saline soil of the bohai bay region it is suggested that 100 treated effluent be used to irrigate tall fescue during the rainy season july september and that 75 treated effluent be used during the rainless season acknowledgements this

11057,to evaluate the response of tall fescue festuca arundinacea to the reclamation of severely saline coastal soil with different levels of treated wastewater effluent a field experiment was conducted in 2015 2016 the treated effluent was saline ec 4 2 6 9 ds m and five treatments of irrigation water were blended with treated effluent 0 25 50 75 and 100 and fresh groundwater the saline soil contained a gravel sand layer imbedded at depth of 60 cm to cut off the capillary porosity irrigation were applied by micro sprinkler and the irrigation management was divided into salt leaching stage including enhanced salt leaching and water salt regulation and normal irrigation stage the result indicated that during these stages the leaf chlorophyll content increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased because the main stress was from fertility rather than salinity during the normal irrigation stage the leaf proline content increased to 1759 0 1970 7 2388 8 2699 7 and 2820 3 μmol g in the rainless season after which it decreased to 485 8 486 0 515 9 513 8 and 561 5 μmol g in the rainy season treated effluent had no significant effect on the root amount of tall fescue but led to greater root distribution in the shallow layer except for the 100 treatment because of the induced increase in surface soil salinity during salt leaching stage soil salinity did not clearly affect the yield of tall fescue the yield generally increased as the treated effluent percentage increased because of the fertility value while during dry season of normal irrigation stage the accumulated soil salinity decreased the yield overall the reclamation method using treated effluent is feasible for tall fescue based on the method the appropriate percentage of treated effluent of total applied water including irrigation and rainfall was below 70 80 keywords reclamation method soil salinity water quality 1 introduction there is over 10 000 km2 of saline soil along the coast of the north of yangtze river in china which borders on the pacific ocean yu and chen 1999 these regions are well developed and experiencing rapid economic growth coastal saline soil is usually very saline soil salt content 0 5 2 0 with a shallow saline groundwater 1 2 m depth 10 30 g l wang et al 1993 which significantly affects the growth of many plants traditional reclamation methods such as applying gypsum combining surface irrigation and water drainage technologies have not effectively improved saline soil therefore replacing saline soil with non saline soil is the most popular and effective method of treating such soil in bohai bay moreover tall fescue festuca arundinacea is the most widely used turf species in the research region because of its moderate tolerant salt resistance maas and hoffman 1977 for saline soil it is essential to maintain a net downward movement of soil water to allow salinity leaching asano and pettygrove 1987 oster 1994 läuchli and epstein 1990 in the last decade a method of reclamation of saline soil using drip irrigation has been reported chen et al 2015 li et al 2015a 2015b 2015c sun et al 2013 2017 in this method drip irrigation based on the soil matric potential smp was employed to manage the soil salinity in a coastal saline soil after a gravel sand layer was embedded under the root zone soil upon application of this method surface soil salt was leached out within several days with continuous irrigation after which the salt above the gravel sand layer was leached by controlling the smp at 5kpa after salt leaching freshwater irrigation was applied when the smp reached a target value of 20 kpa or 35 kpa chen et al 2015 li et al 2015b to ensure the plant roots grew deeper and broader based on this method the survival rate was up to 90 for about 30 species of landscape plants li et al 2015b moreover a reclamation method of micro sprinkler irrigation was also shown to be useful for coastal saline soil by chu et al 2014 the freshwater supply of the bohai gulf region is 660 m3 per capita and the over exploitation of deep groundwater has led to a decrease in the water table at a rate of 0 65 1 39 m y in the trial region sun 2007 additionally about 3 9 billion m3 of treated effluent were produced in coastal cities of the bohai gulf region in 2015 li 2016 liu 2016 wei 2016 wu and peng 2016 with a reuse rate of only 8 3 li 2016 when using treated effluent for irrigation some water quality factors such as the salinity level and nutrient content need to be considered oster 1994 especially salinity if the treated effluent is to be applied in coastal regions based on the reclamation method described above a study was conducted using micro sprinkler irrigation of severely saline soil with treated effluent li et al 2019 in that study the irrigation management was divided into three stages enhanced salt leaching continuous irrigation water salt regulation irrigation based on the smp at 5 kpa and normal irrigation the first two stages were salt leaching stage during which time the soil ece in the 0 60 cm soil layer decreased from 38 29 ds m to 1 42 3 16 ds m after 4 months the observed ece in the normal irrigation stage changed slightly showing a close relationship with the precipitation salt and some specific chemical elements may cause plant damage al hamaiedeh and bino 2010 asano and pettygrove 1987 toze 2006 or even foliar damage when using sprinkler irrigation shalhevet 1994 grattan 1990 if excessive amounts of salt accumulate to toxic levels in a plant older transpiring leaves it will reduce the photosynthetic leaf area to a level that cannot sustain growth munns 2002 salinity reduces the ability of plants to take up water and causes reductions in growth rates plant response to salinity varies depending on its growth stage variety and rootstock maas 1990 under saline conditions some plants could enhance salinity tolerance by decreasing transporting rate of na and cl to leaves compartmentalizing these ions in vacuoles munns 2002 increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes meloni et al 2003 or regulating photosynthetic efficiency tang et al 2018 the nutrient content of treated effluent such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium could provide fertilizer value to plants lubello et al 2004 asano and pettygrove 1987 toze 2006 nitrogen fertilization thomas and thorne 1975 and phosphorus fertilization peterson et al 1993 could increase the chlorophyll content having the opposite effect of salinity wang 2010 although the level of soil fertility may alleviate deleterious effects of salinity stress on plant yildirim et al 2009 it does not influence the tolerance of plants to salinity berstein et al 1974 shalhevet 1994 treated effluent irrigation with staged managements has been proved to be an effective reclamation method in saline coastal soil li et al 2019 however when the tall fescue was planted the soil salinity was severe as the saline soil was reclaimed using treated effluent the soil water salinity and nutrient condition were also changed therefore the present study was conducted to test the physiological and growth response of tall fescue to the process that severely saline soil was being reclaimed and to the level of treated effluent under different irrigation managements moreover an appropriate percentage of treated effluent for use as irrigation water for tall fescue was identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from 2015 to 2016 at the industrial zone 39 03 n 118 48 e caofeidian district tangshan china located at the northern portion of the bohai gulf which borders the pacific ocean the annual precipitation in the study area is about 552 2 mm most of which occurs from july to september the spring and early summer are generally dry the study soil is sandy loam developed in sea reclamation land with an initial soil bulk density of 1 69 g cm3 the field soil is severely saline soil with an average ece at 0 60 cm of 38 3 ds m in which chlorine and sodium are the main ions the soil organic matter content was 11 4 g kg total n was 0 24 g kg available phosphorus was 8 1 mg kg available potassium was 464 mg kg and ph was 7 68 saturated soil extracts the saline groundwater table was 0 8 1 2 m below the surface 2 2 experimental design there were five treatments of irrigation water quality which consisted of freshwater blended with the following percentages of treated effluent 0 gg1 25 gg2 50 gg3 75 gg4 and 100 gg5 each treatment was in a completely randomized block design consisting of three replications each plot was 9 0 by 6 0 m containing six inserted micro sprinklers beijing luckrain plastic industry ltd china 3 0 m apart the micro sprinkler had a flow rate of 120 l h at a 0 2 mpa operating pressure with a wetted diameter of 3 1 m soil treatment before laying turf was as follows the soil was removed to a depth of about 60 cm depth and a 15 cm thick gravel sand layer was added fig 1 the gravel sand layer was to cut off the capillary rise to prevent upward movement of saline groundwater into the root zone soil after that the removed saline soil was backfilled and the average soil bulk density was decreased to 1 55 g cm3 meanwhile a drain was located at the lower side of the field to remove the leaching water treated effluent was obtained from the caofeidian district sewage treatment plant and the quality met the first grade national standard for wastewater discharge sepa and gaqsiq 2003 freshwater was pumped from a deep well located at the experimental site as tables 1 and 2 show the salt concentration nutrient concentration cod and sar of the treated effluent was higher than that of the freshwater but the ph was not in fact the quality of the treated effluent varied with electrical conductivity ec of 4 21 6 89 ds m the number of fecal coliforms in the treated effluent was 130 1700 cfu l and the heavy metals levels of the irrigation water were generally suitable for irrigation except for se ayers and westcot 1985 the irrigation management started as the tall fescue turf was laid in early july of 2015 the irrigation management was divided into three stages enhanced salt leaching stage water salt regulation stage and normal irrigation stage in which the first two stages were salt leaching stage the enhanced salt leaching stage was to provide a suitable soil condition for the recovery of tall fescue in a short time the soil salinity was leached with continuous irrigation until the ece of the 0 10 cm layer was below or close to 6 ds m the water salt regulation stage was to leach salt out the soil above the gravel sand layer by ensuring a net downward movement of water asano and pettygrove 1987 the irrigation was applied when the smp at a depth of 0 2 m reached the target value of 5 kpa chen et al 2015 li et al 2015a 2015b the normal irrigation stage was to maintain soil health and ensure the normal growth of tall fescue during the stage the smp was controlled below 20 kpa apart from a period that was controlled below 10 kpa in the rainless season april to may 2016 in addition n p2o5 and k2o fertilizer were applied at rates of 20 g m2 5 g m2 and 10 g m2 respectively during early october 2015 and july 2016 2 3 observation and measurements soil sampling was conducted in mid july september and early november 2015 as well as late may early july and early november 2016 soil samples were obtained horizontally apart at 0 50 100 and 150 cm from the micro sprinkler and vertically apart at 10 cm from topsoil to the gravel sand layer the soil ece and inorganic nitrogen nmin including nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were examined based on extracts of saturated soil while the available phosphorus was extracted by 0 5 mol l nahco3 the ece was determined using a conductivity meter dds 307 rex shanghai china while the content of nmin and available phosphorus were measured by

g fw these results may agree with previous findings showing that fertility increased chlorophyll content thomas and thorne 1975 peterson et al 1993 or that fertility alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress on the chlorophyll a and b contents akram and ashraf 2011 salinity has been reported to decrease the contents of chlorophyll akram and ashraf 2011 li et al 2018 meloni et al 2003 sahin et al 2018 tang et al 2018 wang 2010 while some other reports found that high salinity increased chloroplast density per unit leaf area because leaves became smaller and thicker munns and tester 2008 tall fescue has a salt tolerance threshold of 3 9 ds m with a slope of 5 3 per ds m maas and hoffman 1977 in this study during the rainless season of march may of 2016 the soil salinity increased from 0 98 1 63 1 76 2 05 and 2 28 ds m to 1 32 2 82 3 35 3 34 and 4 44 ds m for gg1 gg5 fig 5 respectively while the accumulated soil salinity was then reduced to 1 53 2 96 ds m july of 2016 by subsequent precipitation fig 5 when compared to the chlorophyll contents in may 2016 the average content in july of 2016 changed less showing an average decrease of 0 03 mg g fw these results suggested that the main limitation of the increase in tall fescue s chlorophyll content observed in this study was not salinity rather the leaf chlorophyll content showed an increasing linear relationship with the increasing percentage of treated effluent fig 4 this was likely because the treated effluent contained 5 3 mg l more total nitrogen content and 2 fold more total phosphorus than freshwater table 1 these results further indicated that the leaf chlorophyll content was likely to be affected by nutrient level when irrigated with different levels of treated effluent no matter which irrigation management stages tall fescue was in 3 2 2 leaf proline content as an osmolyte in plants proline plays an important role in influencing stress tolerance induced by osmotic stress such as drought and soil salinity delauney and verma 1993 szabados and savouré 2010 many plants accumulate proline to high levels in response to osmotic stress fougere et al 1991 sahin et al 2018 szabados and savouré 2010 proline accumulation can protect subcellular structures and macromolecules protect protein integrity enhance the activities of different enzymes mishra and dubey 2006 szabados and savouré 2010 and reduce oxidative stress alia et al 1997 hong et al 2000 fig 6 shows the leaf proline content of tall fescue when irrigated with different levels of treated effluent the highest content was found in may 2016 when the levels were 3 6 5 3 and 1 7 2 5 times greater than those observed for gg1 gg5 in early june 2016 and september 2016 respectively during may 2016 the smp was controlled at 10 kpa and the proline content increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased p 0 01 fig 7 with significant differences being observed between gg5 or gg4 and gg2 or gg1 p 0 05 fig 6 these results were similar to those observed in other studies wang 2010 paudel et al 2016 and were likely caused by salinity and may water content during early july of 2016 when the soil salinity was partly leached by precipitation the proline content of the gg1 gg5 treatments decreased from 1759 0 1970 7 2388 8 2699 7 and 2820 3 μg g dw dry weight to 485 8 486 0 515 9 513 8 and 561 5 μg g dw respectively at the end of the rainy season in late september of 2016 the leaf proline content increased to 884 8 1478 5 μg g dw fig 6 these results suggested that in the normal irrigation stage the proline content decreased as the stress from salinity or and drought decreased 3 3 root growth and distribution table 4 shows the root dry mass of tall fescue for each treatment in october 2016 the total root dry mass of tall fescue ranged from 1 17 to 1 34 kg m2 with no significant differences between treatments however it decreased by 10 69 7 63 2 29 and 0 76 respectively in response to irrigation with 25 50 75 and 100 treated effluent instead of freshwater the result shown in the present study that 25 and 50 treated effluent decrease the root mass of 7 11 while 75 and 100 treated effluent seemed to had less effect on the root mass of tall fescue paudel et al 2016 found that treated wastewater ec 1 93 ds m decreased root growth of ruby red grapefruit salt tolerance of 1 8 ds m maas and hoffman 1977 by 20 with sandy loam soil while hoffman et al 1983 reported that irrigation water salinity ec 4 ds m had no significant effect on total root mass of tall fescue although there was no significant difference the nutrient level of treated effluent may influence the root of tall fescue at some degree a high level of treated effluent contained high p ca concentration and other nutrients adequate ca concentration under saline conditions can increase root length cramer et al 1986 kent and läuchli 1985 and p fertility could cause carax coriacea roots to become thicker powell 1974 but some other reports showed that the application of different levels of k and p may not alter root weight of sunflower plants akram and ashraf 2011 the root of tall fescue under saline condition was reported to be exponentially distributed at a depth of 120 cm hoffman et al 1983 in this experiment very few roots were found below the gravel sand layer because of the severely saline condition as shown in table 4 about 82 89 of the roots were concentrated in the 0 20 cm layer while only about 7 13 and 2 7 of the roots were found in the layers of 20 40 cm and 40 cm respectively the root percentage at 0 20 cm increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased to 75 similar results were reported by hoffman et al 1983 who found that higher water salinity 4 vs 1 ds m increased the root density in the shallow parts of the soil profile with a corresponding reduction in the deep profile however for the gg5 treatment the root percentage of the shallow soil decreased which was probably a result of the salt distribution in the profile as shown in fig 8 the shallow salinity of gg5 was obviously higher than that of deep soil which may cause a relatively large percentage of root growth in the deep low salinity layers 3 4 response of the yield of tall fescue to treated effluent irrigation as shown in table 5 the total yield of tall fescue increased by 7 54 17 65 33 36 and 47 21 respectively in response to irrigation with 25 50 75 and 100 treated effluent instead of freshwater during the study period the concentration of inorganic nitrogen and available phosphorus in the 0 40 cm soil layer was 1 90 4 77 mg l and 4 11 7 43 mg kg respectively indicating poor soil fertility table 6 therefore the treated effluent could promote the plant growth because of its relatively higher nutrient content toze 2006 which was similar to the results of previous studies al lahham et al 2003 al nakshabandi et al 1997 chakrabarti 1995 lubello et al 2004 among different sampling times the yield of tall fescue generally increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased table 5 however the yield may also have been affected by climate and soil conditions such as precipitation and soil salinity the first cutting occurred in september 2015 of the water salt regulation stage about 70 d after the tall fescue was recovered in mid july and the yield followed the order of gg5 gg4 gg3 gg1 gg2 during the growing period a total of 390 mm of precipitation and 210 290 mm of irrigation water was applied resulting in a rapid decrease in salinity from 9 01 12 00 ds m in mid july 2015 to 2 67 5 16 ds m in september 2015 at 0 40 cm multiple linear regression analysis table 7 showed that the irrigation water quality significantly affected the biomass of tall fescue p 0 01 but the effect of the weighted soil salinity was not statistically significant p 0 05 these results may indicate that during the water salt regulation stage the nutrients in irrigation water led to an increase in the yield of tall fescue while the higher soil salinity did not clearly affect plant growth however treated effluent also had a negative effect on soil salinity and plant growth during the normal irrigation stage in the early june 2016 sampling the soil salinity increased fig 5 and the yield followed the order of gg4 gg5 gg1 gg2 gg3 table 6 regression analysis during the growing period revealed a negative correlation between the yield of tall fescue and soil ece p 0 01 as well as a positive correlation with the percentage of treated effluent p 0 01 table 7 these findings indicated that when the soil salinity accumulated during the dry season of the normal irrigation stage either irrigation water quality or soil salinity could clearly affect plant growth however the nutrients of treated effluent promoted the plant growth while the accumulated salinity decreased the yield or delayed the time required to revive the tall fescue precipitation can dilute the salinity of treated effluent leach soil salinity and decrease salt damage to plants so its effect on tall fescue should be considered to find an appropriate proportion of treated effluent to total applied water including irrigation and rainfall for tall fescue rainfall was also seen as a kind of freshwater ec 0 1 ds m in the present study a higher relative yield often represented a better visual appeal as shown in fig 9 the relative yield of tall fescue did not increase as the percentage of treated effluent increased until the percentage of treated effluent in the total amount of applied water was below 70 80 this is because at low percentage of treated effluent the fertility not the salinity primarily limited the growth of tall fescue however once salinity severely limited growth the yield decreased even when more nutrients were applied berstein et al 1974 and the decrease may have been correlated with the plant s tolerance and the duration of exposure shalhevet 1994 therefore when irrigating with treated effluent of 4 2 6 9 ds m on tall fescue the proportion of treated effluent to total applied water could be below 70 80 i e the percentage of treated effluent of irrigation water could be or above 70 80 depending on precipitation 4 conclusions the response of tall fescue showed that treated effluent and staged irrigation managements including salt leaching stage and normal irrigation stage could be used for tall fescue turf planting in severely coastal saline soil in different irrigation management stage the leaf chlorophyll content increased as the percentage of treated effluent increased while during the normal irrigation stage the proline content was found to increase as the salinity stress increased treated effluent had no significant effect on the root biomass of tall fescue but influenced the root distribution in the soil profile a higher percentage of treated effluent led to shallow roots but the shallow saline soil of the 100 treated effluent treatment increased the root distribution in the deep layer the nutrients of irrigation water increased the yield of tall fescue while during the dry season of the normal irrigation stage the accumulated soil salinity significantly decreased the yield however during the water salt regulation stage soil salinity did not clearly affect the yield because the water was applied frequently for the coastal treated effluent of 4 2 6 9 ds m its appropriate percentage of total applied water including irrigation and rainfall for tall fescue was below 70 80 therefore in the costal saline soil of the bohai bay region it is suggested that 100 treated effluent be used to irrigate tall fescue during the rainy season july september and that 75 treated effluent be used during the rainless season acknowledgements this

11058,ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rfpfm a rainwater harvesting system is receiving increasing attention worldwide however its usefulness in semi humid regions with irrigation capabilities remains unclear in addition the optimal ridge to furrow ratios and nitrogen n application rates are unknown in this study we investigated five different planting patterns i e rain fed flat planting ck

1 in winter wheat over two years rfpfm practices led to increased soil temperature in the ridges at the seedling stage and the retention of more water in the furrows throughout the two growing seasons the improved hydrothermal characteristics of rfpfm plots led to early and stable seedling establishment resulting in higher grain yields water use efficiency wue and net revenues grain yields were

alleviate drought stress in dry years 150 mm precipitation to increase grain yields wue and net economic benefits technological advancements such as innovative mechanization to reduce extensive labor costs are required to boost the adoption of rfpfm practices fully exploit its economic and social benefits and prioritize environmental sustainability keywords ridge furrow mulching system ridge to furrow ratio grain yield water use efficiency net revenue 1 introduction agricultural production is frequently limited by the severe shortage of water resources in arid semi arid and semi humid regions of the world stewart 2005 li and wang 2006 li et al 2015 water availability for irrigation from canals and groundwater has been severely restricted due to accelerated industrialization and urbanization döll et al 2009 irrigation water scarcity has become a major concern limiting the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in light of ongoing global climate change zhou et al 2010 wu and ma 2018 wu et al 2018 increasing food production per unit of water utilization is the key strategy to ensure sustainability of agricultural production for future food security in dry semi humid areas wu and ma 2015 increasing water use efficiency wue through water saving technologies to use precipitation efficiently instead of relying on irrigation water is gaining attention worldwide as a measure to ensure water sustainability and food production li et al 2016 the ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rfpfm system is one of the most widely applied water saving practices in arid and semi arid areas gan et al 2013 hu et al 2014 in this system mulched ridges are employed in the rainwater harvesting zone such that rainwater flows to the bare furrows where crops are planted and infiltrates deep into the soil gan et al 2013 li et al 2016 the benefits of reducing soil evaporation improving soil hydrothermal conditions and enhancing grain yields and wue in arid and semi arid regions have been reported liu et al 2014 eldoma et al 2016 li et al 2017b recently several studies have indicated that rfpfm practices could also be implemented effectively in dry semi humid areas that have conditions similar to semi arid regions and frequently experience drought stresses although the best ridge to furrow ratio remains unknown li et al 2016 2017a these studies indicated that rfpfm practices led to yields and wue being higher by 37 and 28 respectively in a double winter wheat summer maize cropping system than with traditional flat planting the effect of rfpfm practices on crop production largely depends on precipitation during the crop growth period ren et al 2009 ye and liu 2012 this is because low levels of rainfall may not produce sufficient runoff to infiltrate deeply into the soil and escape evaporation boers et al 1986 previous studies have suggested that rfpfm supplemental irrigation rfpfm si planting could be applied to increase attainable yields wu et al 2015 wei et al 2018 reported that rfpfm si alleviated drought stress during key growth periods of winter wheat and increased yields by 18 and 11 over those from rain fed flat planting and rfpfm respectively in a semi arid area therefore it is important to investigate whether supplemental irrigation could further increase the yield potential and wue of winter wheat with rfpfm practices in dry semi humid areas with available irrigation water in the rfpfm system selecting an appropriate ridge to furrow ratio is critically important for improving the runoff efficiency of precipitation and thereby increasing wue and crop productivity gan et al 2013 different ridge to furrow ratios change the micro topographic heterogeneity which in turn alters the characteristics of the crests and solar radiation partitioning on the land surface li et al 2017b the optimum ridge to furrow ratio has been investigated previously for maize oat potato and alfalfa li and gong 2002 wang et al 2008 2015a wang et al 2015b eldoma et al 2016 li et al 2017b 2019 the results of these studies generally suggest that increasing the ridge to furrow ratio enhances grain yields owing to improved soil hydrothermal conditions for instance li et al 2017b indicated that a ridge to furrow width of 70 40 cm was appropriate for increasing maize yields and wue in semi arid areas while li and gong 2002 recommended a ridge to furrow width of 120 60 cm for maize production another aspect to be considered in the system set up is that using rfpfm systems with wide ridges requires greater land use for the ridges which increases construction labor costs and the need for plastic mulching films this may decrease the net economic return of the rfpfm system in china plastic mulch films low density polyethylene are not completely removed from fields after use leaving remnants that persist in the soil for decades increased use of plastic film materials increases white pollution in the agricultural soil and environment janette and tim 2006 in chinese fields with long term use of plastic film mulches the estimated accumulation of residual plastics was approximately 100 kg ha 1 or even higher thus investigating the optimum ridge to furrow ratio for improving grain yields wue and net economic returns is important nitrogen n is the most significant yield limiting factor affecting crop productivity lea and morotögaudry 2001 appropriate n fertilizer applications can maximize grain yields and wue under the rfpfm system deng et al 2006 liu et al 2014 li et al 2015 nevertheless previous studies showed that increasing n application does not always increase the yield and wue in rfpfm practices and may even have a negative effect when precipitation is severely limited and irrigation water is not available liu et al 2014 li et al 2015 grain yield responses to different n fertilizer rates depend considerably on the soil water availability precipitation amounts and their distribution during the crop growth period huang et al 2003 albrizio et al 2010 sun et al 2012 the guanzhong plain area is a typical dry semi humid area in northwest china which contributes approximately 60 of the total cereal production in the shaanxi province li et al 2016 the main crop is winter wheat which relies intensively on traditional irrigation based on our previous survey in this region inappropriate irrigation regimes and excessive n application rates during winter wheat production had significantly increased agricultural water and n fertilizer inputs and therefore resulted in decreased resource use efficiency these practices have also led to increasing production costs and major environmental problems fang et al 2006 wu and ma 2015 therefore water saving and high yielding technologies suitable for this region need to be developed and the environmental impact of agriculture must be reduced dramatically to meet future food security and sustainability requirements in this study we aimed to 1 investigate the effect of different ridge to furrow ratios on soil hydrothermal properties based on micro topographic heterogeneity 2 compare grain yields wue and net economic returns between conventional flat planting and rfpfm practices with different ridge to furrow ratios n fertilizer rates and supplemental irrigation and 3 validate the practicability and suitability of rfpfm practices with appropriate ridge to furrow ratios and n rates in dry semi humid areas for winter wheat production in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and field management the field experiment was conducted during 2014 2015 yr1 and 2015 2016 yr2 in the same field at the sanyuan experimental station shaanxi province china 108 52ʹe 34 36ʹn at the beginning of the field experiment the topsoil 0 20 cm contained 8 47 g kg 1 organic carbon 1 14 g kg 1 total nitrogen 20 24 mg kg 1 available phosphorus and 243 20 mg kg 1 available potassium the annual precipitation in 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 was 402 450 539 505 and 184 mm respectively the daily maximum minimum air temperatures and precipitation during the crop growth period are shown in fig 1 total precipitation during the growing season in yr1 and yr2 was 204 and 133 mm respectively the field experiment was arranged in a spilt plot design in both years the main plots were planted in five patterns a conventional rain fed flat planting without mulch with 30 cm row spacing ck b three rfpfm practices with varying ridge to furrow ratios including 20 40 cm rfpfm20 30 30 cm rfpfm30 and 40 20 cm rfpfm40 as shown in fig 2 a and c rfpfm si planting with a ridge to furrow ratio of 30 30 cm all five planting patterns had the same planting density the sub plots had two n application rates 75 and 225 kg n ha 1 each plot was 6 m long and 4 m wide with an area of 24 m2 there were three replicates for all treatments nitrogen fertilizer urea was split applied by hand 0 125 and 185 days after sowing das the n splitting pattern was 40 30 30 the other basal fertilizers phosphorus and potassium were applied at rates of 50 kg p ha 1 and 30 kg k ha 1 both broadcasted and incorporated before ploughing alternating ridges and furrows were then constructed artificially in each plot mulching was applied to cover the ridges by using 0 008 mm thick plastic films in rfpfm and rfpfm si practices before sowing all furrows were kept uncovered double bunds 0 8 m wide were set between the main plots to prevent water and nutrient movement between the main plots for rfpfm si irrigation water of 50 and 230 mm at 90 and 219 das in yr1 respectively and 55 55 and 55 mm at 84 148 and 188 das in yr2 respectively was applied to flood the field when the soil moisture at a 12 cm depth was 70 field capacity according to li et al 2016 no irrigation was applied to ck and the three rfpfm conditions during the entire growing season the winter wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 was sown by hand at a density of 150 kg ha 1 in each plot on october 13 2014 and october 14 2015 the winter wheat plants were harvested on june 10 2015 and may 29 2016 the experiment followed the locally recommended management practices for winter wheat production insects pathogens and weeds were controlled to protect the crops 2 2 measurements and calculations 2 2 1 soil temperature and moisture soil temperature at soil depths of 5 and 10 cm was recorded at 10 a m using a set of digital thermometers shenyang huashengchang mechanical and electrical equipment co ltd shenyang china soil volumetric water content svwc at soil depths of 7 6 and 12 cm was measured by using time domain reflectometry fieldscout tdr 300 soil moisture meter spectrum technologies inc aurora illinois usa the soil temperature and svwc in the furrows and adjacent ridges were recorded simultaneously once a week from sowing to harvesting 2 2 2 grain yield yield components and water use efficiency at physiological maturity six rows in the center of each plot 1 m long each were harvested to determine the grain yield based on a standard moisture content of 0 12 g h2o g 1 fresh weight the spike number per m2 kernel number per spike and 1000 kernel weight was determined within a 0 6 m long row sampling in each plot the harvest index hi was calculated as the total seed weight divided by the aboveground biomass before sowing and after harvesting gravimetric water content to a depth of 200 cm with an increment of 20 cm was determined by drying the soil at 105 c to a constant weight for the three rfpfm practices and rfpfm si soil cores were sampled from the middle of the furrows and ridges soil bulk densities from 0 to 200 cm at 20 cm intervals previously reported by li et al 2016 were listed as 1 05 1 26 1 26 1 29 1 19 1 15 1 17 1 19 1 38 and 1 34 g cm 3 for each soil layer respectively total soil water storage sws from 0 to 200 cm was calculated as follows 1 s w s i 1 n ρ i θ i h i where n is the number of soil layers ρi g cm 3 is the soil bulk density θi g g 1 is the gravimetric water content and hi mm is the soil layer thickness in soil layer i evapotranspiration et for the entire winter wheat growing season was determined as follows 2 e t p s w d i where p mm is the total precipitation during the crop growing season swd soil water depletion mm is the difference in sws from 0 to 200 cm between the harvesting and sowing stage and i mm is the total irrigation amount deep percolation and runoff were not considered in this experimental field of loamy clay soil because of its good water holding capacity the wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as the grain yield kg ha 1 divided by et mm 2 2 3 cost benefit analysis net revenue was calculated as the output minus the input value in the present economic evaluation system the input value consisted of the cost of materials including wheat seeds fertilizer plastic film herbicide pesticide and irrigational water labor including land preparation construction of ridges and furrows plastic film mulching fertilizer application sowing herbicide and pesticide spraying irrigating harvesting and removal of plastic film and machinery application including tillage harvesting and irrigation systems the output referred to the value of the wheat grain 2 3 data analysis the effects of the planting pattern n application rate and their interactions with grain yield yield components soil temperature and moisture et and wue were performed using variance analysis in statistix 8 0 analytical software tallahassee fl usa the mean values among the different treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd0 05 soil temperature and moisture were compared between different planting patterns rather than between n rates because n treatment did not show consistent and significant effects in both years figures were generated using sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc san jose usa 3 results 3 1 changes in soil temperature seasonal changes in soil temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm soil depths are presented in fig 3 the soil temperatures at both soil depths in all planting patterns showed a similar seasonal dynamic as the air temperature across both years which decreased gradually after sowing reached its minimum value at approximately 100 das and then increased until maturity no significant difference in daily soil temperature was observed between different planting patterns during most of the growth period across both years fig 3 as depicted in the inset graphs of fig 3 the average soil temperatures across the seedling stages in both rfpfm and rfpfm si practices were much higher than in ck whereas we observed exactly the opposite during the reproductive stage compared with that of ck the two year average soil temperature across the two n rates for rfpfm and rfpfm si was 0 58 c and 0 68 c higher at the 5 cm and 0 47 c and 0 36 c higher at the 10 cm soil depth during the seedling stage respectively however this value was 0 48 c and 1 52 c lower at the 5 cm and 0 34 c and 1 15 c lower at the 10 cm soil depth during the reproductive stage respectively 3 2 changes in soil moisture the dynamic changes in soil moisture at soil depths of 7 6 and 12 cm in all planting patterns across both years are displayed in fig 4 ck exhibited similar seasonal changes in svwc as the three rfpfm practices in both years especially in dry yr2 that depended on daily precipitation the seasonal changes in svwc in rfpfm si were more affected by the irrigation applied the three rfpfm practices increased svwc at the 7 6 cm soil depth during 50 150 das in yr1 over that of ck fig 4a whereas rfpfm si showed a higher svwc than ck and the three rfpfm treatments during most of the growth period p 0 05 svwc differences between the furrows and adjacent ridges were observed in the rfpfm practices and rfpfm si fig 5 in general the svwc difference between a furrow and ridge was larger in normal yr1 than in dry yr2 compared to that of ck the three rfpfm practices led to higher soil moisture content in the furrows than in the ridges furthermore soil moisture in the furrow in the three rfpfm practices increased significantly with increasing ridge width rfpfm si had the highest soil moisture of the three rfpfm practices in both furrows and ridges the two year mean svwc of the furrows for the two n rates for rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si were 9 19 3 26 8 and 52 0 higher at the 7 6 cm soil depth and 6 6 9 9 15 2 and 41 7 higher at the 12 cm soil depth than ck respectively 3 3 grain yields and wue grain yields revealed substantial differences between the different planting patterns table 1 rfpfm si achieved the highest grain yield followed by rfpfm and ck the grain yields from the three rfpfm practices increased with increasing ridge width rfpfm40 attained 94 of the yield of rfpfm si in yr1 but only 69 in dry yr2 due to limited precipitation high grain yield was associated with high spike number in yr1 and with high hi grain number per spikes grain weight and spike numbers in yr2 the two year average grain yield for the rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si treatments were 28 3 37 2 55 6 and 100 4 higher than that for ck respectively interactions between planting patterns and n rates had no consistent effect on grain yields and yield components over the two years table 1 considerably higher grain yields in all planting patterns were observed under higher n rates compared with those under low n rates in yr1 but not in yr2 high n rates increased the grain yield in rfpfm si in yr2 p 0 05 the best fitting regression curves of grain yields plotted against water supply precipitation plus irrigation showed that grain yield increased with increasing total water supply under both n rates regardless of the planting pattern fig 6 a the grain yield difference between the two n rates produced a quadratic curve and the greatest difference was observed when the total water supply reached 355 mm fig 6b compared to that in ck et was significantly higher in the three rfpfm practices p 0 05 which resulted in a higher swd within the 0 200 cm soil depth across both years table 2 fig 7 the average wue across the two n rates for rfpfm20 rfpfm30 and rfpfm40 was increased by 8 5 18 3 and 24 4 in yr1 and by 36 7 38 3 and 56 6 in yr2 respectively compared to that for ck in yr1 the wue was significantly lower in rfpfm si than in ck and the three rfpfm practices this change was not observed in dry yr2 a high n application failed to produce a consistently high wue regardless of the planting patterns during the two years 3 4 cost benefit analysis rfpfm practices increased net revenues over both years while rfpfm si only increased the net revenue in yr2 compared to that of ck table 3 for the three rfpfm practices net revenue averaged across the two n rates increased with increasing ridge width for both years rfpfm40 generated significantly higher net revenues than ck under both n rates with average increases of 21 5 and 152 8 in yr1 and yr2 respectively for both years different n application rates had no consistent effect on the net economic benefit table 3 for example net revenue under the high n rate was 37 3 higher than that under the low n rate in yr1 while conversely it was 32 1 lower in yr2 with limited precipitation regardless of the planting pattern the net revenue difference between the two n rates also showed a parabolic relationship with the total water supply which peaked at a water supply of 355 mm fig 6c this implied that a high n rate could boost net revenues more than a low n rate when the total water supply was between 162 549 mm 4 discussion rfpfm practices increased the soil temperature in mulched ridges during the early growth stage and enhanced soil moisture in the furrows throughout the growing season as compared to that of ck the favorable soil hydrothermal conditions with rfpfm promoted rapid seed germination and stable seedling establishment in this study thus seedlings emerged 2 5 days earlier under rfpfm and rfpfm si practices than under ck these results were also in agreement with previous reports li et al 1999 2016 ren et al 2017 li et al 2004 indicated that increasing soil temperature of the topsoil during the late growth stage with plastic film mulching is not advantageous for crop growth and may even reduce the photosynthesis rate and shorten the grain filling period owing to accelerated senescence of root tissue in the present study mulching practices failed to increase soil temperature during the reproductive growth stage and even decreased soil temperatures by 0 34 c and 1 15 c at the 10 cm soil depth in the rfpfm and rfpfm si practices respectively from that in ck these decreasing temperatures can be explained by the overshadowing effect under rfpfm and rfpfm si practices as indicated in our previous study li et al 2016 it is understood that ck practices with small crop canopies generally maintain a high light transmission ratio and therefore most of the solar radiation would reach the soil surface and increase the topsoil temperature with ck rather than with rfpfm or rfpfm si it can be argued that improved hydrothermal conditions enhance root development improve water and nutrient absorption and thereby promote overall crop growth under rfpfm and rfpfm si practices an optimum ridge to furrow ratio in the rfpfm practices is important for improving the runoff efficiency of precipitation wue and grain yields since it alters micro topographic heterogeneity by changing the crest characteristics of the soil surface and solar radiation partitioning on the land surface jiang and li 2015 the present study demonstrated that grain yields and wue increased with increasing ridge width and that rfpfm40 with the greatest ridge width achieved the highest yield and wue among the three rfpfm practices furthermore supplemental irrigation could improve soil moisture in both ridge and furrow soils and prevent drought stress for crops under rfpfm si practice therefore rfpfm si exhibited the highest grain yield among all of the treatments in both years table 1 notably the grain yield was higher in yr1 than in yr2 regardless of the planting patterns and n rates owing to the higher precipitation during the crop growing season in yr1 204 mm compared with that in yr2 133 mm under dry yr2 with limited precipitation the grain yields were 39 3 46 0 74 7 and 154 9 higher in rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si respectively than in ck whereas they were 17 3 28 3 36 5 and 45 9 higher in yr1 with normal precipitation this implies that plastic film mulching and supplemental irrigation had considerable influence in increasing the yields under dry conditions these findings are in agreement with previous reports ren et al 2009 hergert et al 2016 mo et al 2017 grain yields consist of yield components including grain number per spike spike number per m2 and grain weight overall the rfpfm and rfpfm si practices exhibited significantly higher grain yields than ck across both years which were mainly attributed to the increase in grain number per spike and the spike number per m2 the correlation analysis also suggested that improved hydrothermal conditions under rfpfm and rfpfm si practices contributed to the higher spike numbers and the development of additional spikelets rather than grain weight and hi this finding was supported by the significant correlation between soil moisture in the furrows and grain number per spike r 0 94 in yr2 and spike numbers per m2 r 0 74 and 0 84 in the two respective years increasing wue has been a key objective which can be realized by reducing et and enhancing grain yields simultaneously li et al 2016 rfpfm practices were usually known to reduce soil evaporation however in the present study the reserved soil moisture from evaporation in the rfpfm system was insufficient to meet the increased crop transpiration thereby inducing a significantly higher et than that with ck li et al 2008 reported that plastic film mulching increased the crop coefficient i e kc the ratio of actual et to reference et0 during the mid and late crop growing seasons thereby increasing the total et despite increasing et in the three rfpfm practices they still obtained significantly higher wue than that of ck in both years because of the higher yields achieved this indicates that rfpfm practices have a greater influence on improving grain yields than on improving et rfpfm si had a significantly higher total et than the three rfpfm practices and ck i e 478 mm vs 290 mm in the rfpfm practices averaged across two years this could be attributed to the irrigation water supplied to the rfpfm si plot that increased non beneficial soil evaporation qiu et al 2008 gao et al 2014 also suggested that supplemental irrigation could increase the soil evaporation coefficient hence rfpfm increased wue by 21 2 over that of the rfpfm si practice because of a decrease in et by 39 3 p 0 05 while sustaining a comparable grain yield in yr1 with normal precipitation when the precipitation became severely limited in dry yr2 rfpfm40 rather than the other two rfpfm practices was found to increase wue significantly by 20 4 over that of rfpfm si it should be noted that the yield and wue increases in the rfpfm practices were related to increasing water consumption in the deep soils as shown in fig 7 the swd in the three rfpfm practices at the 100 160 cm layer in yr1 and at the 120 180 cm layer in yr2 was much larger than that in ck this result has also been reported previously li et al 1999 2016 mo et al 2017 however the field soils could receive certain amounts of rainfall during the fallow period from july to september which could mitigate the water deficit to some extent as demonstrated in this study the three rfpfm practices and ck had similar sws at sowing in yr2 although the sws at harvesting in yr1 was significantly lower in the rfpfm than in the ck plot table 2 in this study swd was not assessed over a long term this aspect deserves further investigation to verify the long term effect of the rfpfm practice as a sustainable water saving method in dry semi humid regions it is well documented that the interactions between water and n applications could play different roles in grain yields and wue performance which depend on varying water levels li et al 2016 in yr1 with normal precipitation n application rates produced significant and positive effects on the grain yields and wue accompanied by an increased spike number per area p 0 05 table 1 this implies that n application improved the nutritional effectiveness and water availability simultaneously and such complementary effects could be referred to as synergistic functions as reported in other studies li et al 2009 2016 however no significant positive n response was observed in yr2 with limited precipitation which might be attributed to the drought stress that occurred when the n topdressing was applied under high n rates this interaction could even result in a negative effect on grain yields and wue li et al 2009 this is called an antagonistic effect and commonly occurs under severe drought stress conditions when increased n application is inadvisable as it could exacerbate drought stress rudnick and irmak 2014 our best fitting quadratic curve between seasonal water supply and grain yields under the two n rates demonstrated that increasing the n rate from 75 to 225 kg n ha 1 maximized grain yields when the seasonal precipitation was 355 mm fig 6b in contrast it could decrease grain yields if the seasonal precipitation was less than 150 mm this specific synergistic and antagonistic interaction between n and water status implies that the n application should be adjusted according to site specific precipitation regimes to obtain better grain yields wue and n use efficiencies debaeke and aboudrare 2004 haefele et al 2008 sun et al 2012 li et al 2016 net economic benefit is an important factor when considering whether a new technique can be widely applied by local farmers adoption of water saving technologies can aid in increasing crop productivity and thereby the profitability of producers mo et al 2016 2017 in the economic evaluation system of the present study the expenditures for constructing the furrows and ridges covering with plastic film and implementing irrigation led to input costs that were 47 2 52 2 57 2 and 153 9 higher for rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si respectively than for ck in addition rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si practices resulted in 28 3 37 2 55 6 and 100 4 higher output respectively compared to that with ck which averaged across both years because of a considerable increase in grain yield the highest net revenue was achieved under rfpfm40 with the widest ridge regardless of n rates across both years rfpfm40 could be recommended as an economically optimal practice for winter wheat production and for improving the livelihood of farmers during dry years with limited precipitation such as when the total seasonal water supply is below 162 mm high n is not recommended because it could decrease net revenue due to the yield penalty during that time however supplemental irrigation leads to better economic income in the dry year we are expecting to implement further technological innovations such as thorough mechanization for the construction of furrows and ridges to reduce the extensive labor costs associated with rfpfm practices these will aid in enhancing the dissemination of rfpfm practices within chinese farming communities thus the advantages of rfpfm s productive innovations could be extensively exploited in china and many other countries 5 conclusions in this study rfpfm practices increased the soil temperature in the mulched ridges during the vegetative stage and preserved more water in the furrows throughout the growing season the improved hydrothermal conditions based on micro topographic heterogeneity in the rfpfm plots promoted earlier and stable seedling establishment and thereby improved grain yields wue and net economic revenues different ridge to furrow ratios resulted in varying micro topographical characteristics demonstrating that hydrothermal features grain yields wue and net revenues were generally improved with an increase in the ridge to furrow ratio rfpfm40 with the widest ridge is highly recommended as a promising water saving and economical practice for winter wheat production in this dry semi humid area supplemental irrigation could be applied in dry years with limited precipitation to alleviate drought stress in contrast in normal years seasonal rainfall more than 162 mm high n application rates could be considered in rfpfm practices to further increase grain yields wue and net economic revenues in this region advanced technological innovations such as thorough mechanization to reduce extensive labor costs are required to boost the spread of rfpfm practices gan et al 2013 and to fully exploit their advantages in

11058,ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rfpfm a rainwater harvesting system is receiving increasing attention worldwide however its usefulness in semi humid regions with irrigation capabilities remains unclear in addition the optimal ridge to furrow ratios and nitrogen n application rates are unknown in this study we investigated five different planting patterns i e rain fed flat planting ck rfpfm practices with three different ridge to furrow ratios 20 40 rfpfm20 30 30 rfpfm30 and 40 20 rfpfm40 and rfpfm plus supplemental irrigation rfpfm si under two n application rates 75 and 225 kg ha 1 in winter wheat over two years rfpfm practices led to increased soil temperature in the ridges at the seedling stage and the retention of more water in the furrows throughout the two growing seasons the improved hydrothermal characteristics of rfpfm plots led to early and stable seedling establishment resulting in higher grain yields water use efficiency wue and net revenues grain yields were higher with rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si practices than with ck by 28 3 37 2 55 6 and 100 4 respectively averaged for both n rates over the two years additionally wue was higher by 22 6 28 3 40 5 and 9 3 respectively increased ridge to furrow ratios affected micro topography as evidenced by improvements in hydrothermal features grain yields wue and net revenues overall we recommend rfpfm40 the widest ridge as a promising water saving and economical practice for winter wheat production in dry semi humid areas supplemental irrigation could be considered in rfpfm practices to alleviate drought stress in dry years 150 mm precipitation to increase grain yields wue and net economic benefits technological advancements such as innovative mechanization to reduce extensive labor costs are required to boost the adoption of rfpfm practices fully exploit its economic and social benefits and prioritize environmental sustainability keywords ridge furrow mulching system ridge to furrow ratio grain yield water use efficiency net revenue 1 introduction agricultural production is frequently limited by the severe shortage of water resources in arid semi arid and semi humid regions of the world stewart 2005 li and wang 2006 li et al 2015 water availability for irrigation from canals and groundwater has been severely restricted due to accelerated industrialization and urbanization döll et al 2009 irrigation water scarcity has become a major concern limiting the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in light of ongoing global climate change zhou et al 2010 wu and ma 2018 wu et al 2018 increasing food production per unit of water utilization is the key strategy to ensure sustainability of agricultural production for future food security in dry semi humid areas wu and ma 2015 increasing water use efficiency wue through water saving technologies to use precipitation efficiently instead of relying on irrigation water is gaining attention worldwide as a measure to ensure water sustainability and food production li et al 2016 the ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rfpfm system is one of the most widely applied water saving practices in arid and semi arid areas gan et al 2013 hu et al 2014 in this system mulched ridges are employed in the rainwater harvesting zone such that rainwater flows to the bare furrows where crops are planted and infiltrates deep into the soil gan et al 2013 li et al 2016 the benefits of reducing soil evaporation improving soil hydrothermal conditions and enhancing grain yields and wue in arid and semi arid regions have been reported liu et al 2014 eldoma et al 2016 li et al 2017b recently several studies have indicated that rfpfm practices could also be implemented effectively in dry semi humid areas that have conditions similar to semi arid regions and frequently experience drought stresses although the best ridge to furrow ratio remains unknown li et al 2016 2017a these studies indicated that rfpfm practices led to yields and wue being higher by 37 and 28 respectively in a double winter wheat summer maize cropping system than with traditional flat planting the effect of rfpfm practices on crop production largely depends on precipitation during the crop growth period ren et al 2009 ye and liu 2012 this is because low levels of rainfall may not produce sufficient runoff to infiltrate deeply into the soil and escape evaporation boers et al 1986 previous studies have suggested that rfpfm supplemental irrigation rfpfm si planting could be applied to increase attainable yields wu et al 2015 wei et al 2018 reported that rfpfm si alleviated drought stress during key growth periods of winter wheat and increased yields by 18 and 11 over those from rain fed flat planting and rfpfm respectively in a semi arid area therefore it is important to investigate whether supplemental irrigation could further increase the yield potential and wue of winter wheat with rfpfm practices in dry semi humid areas with available irrigation water in the rfpfm system selecting an appropriate ridge to furrow ratio is critically important for improving the runoff efficiency of precipitation and thereby increasing wue and crop productivity gan et al 2013 different ridge to furrow ratios change the micro topographic heterogeneity which in turn alters the characteristics of the crests and solar radiation partitioning on the land surface li et al 2017b the optimum ridge to furrow ratio has been investigated previously for maize oat potato and alfalfa li and gong 2002 wang et al 2008 2015a wang et al 2015b eldoma et al 2016 li et al 2017b 2019 the results of these studies generally suggest that increasing the ridge to furrow ratio enhances grain yields owing to improved soil hydrothermal conditions for instance li et al 2017b indicated that a ridge to furrow width of 70 40 cm was appropriate for increasing maize yields and wue in semi arid areas while li and gong 2002 recommended a ridge to furrow width of 120 60 cm for maize production another aspect to be considered in the system set up is that using rfpfm systems with wide ridges requires greater land use for the ridges which increases construction labor costs and the need for plastic mulching films this may decrease the net economic return of the rfpfm system in china plastic mulch films low density polyethylene are not completely removed from fields after use leaving remnants that persist in the soil for decades increased use of plastic film materials increases white pollution in the agricultural soil and environment janette and tim 2006 in chinese fields with long term use of plastic film mulches the estimated accumulation of residual plastics was approximately 100 kg ha 1 or even higher thus investigating the optimum ridge to furrow ratio for improving grain yields wue and net economic returns is important nitrogen n is the most significant yield limiting factor affecting crop productivity lea and morotögaudry 2001 appropriate n fertilizer applications can maximize grain yields and wue under the rfpfm system deng et al 2006 liu et al 2014 li et al 2015 nevertheless previous studies showed that increasing n application does not always increase the yield and wue in rfpfm practices and may even have a negative effect when precipitation is severely limited and irrigation water is not available liu et al 2014 li et al 2015 grain yield responses to different n fertilizer rates depend considerably on the soil water availability precipitation amounts and their distribution during the crop growth period huang et al 2003 albrizio et al 2010 sun et al 2012 the guanzhong plain area is a typical dry semi humid area in northwest china which contributes approximately 60 of the total cereal production in the shaanxi province li et al 2016 the main crop is winter wheat which relies intensively on traditional irrigation based on our previous survey in this region inappropriate irrigation regimes and excessive n application rates during winter wheat production had significantly increased agricultural water and n fertilizer inputs and therefore resulted in decreased resource use efficiency these practices have also led to increasing production costs and major environmental problems fang et al 2006 wu and ma 2015 therefore water saving and high yielding technologies suitable for this region need to be developed and the environmental impact of agriculture must be reduced dramatically to meet future food security and sustainability requirements in this study we aimed to 1 investigate the effect of different ridge to furrow ratios on soil hydrothermal properties based on micro topographic heterogeneity 2 compare grain yields wue and net economic returns between conventional flat planting and rfpfm practices with different ridge to furrow ratios n fertilizer rates and supplemental irrigation and 3 validate the practicability and suitability of rfpfm practices with appropriate ridge to furrow ratios and n rates in dry semi humid areas for winter wheat production in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and field management the field experiment was conducted during 2014 2015 yr1 and 2015 2016 yr2 in the same field at the sanyuan experimental station shaanxi province china 108 52ʹe 34 36ʹn at the beginning of the field experiment the topsoil 0 20 cm contained 8 47 g kg 1 organic carbon 1 14 g kg 1 total nitrogen 20 24 mg kg 1 available phosphorus and 243 20 mg kg 1 available potassium the annual precipitation in 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 was 402 450 539 505 and 184 mm respectively the daily maximum minimum air temperatures and precipitation during the crop growth period are shown in fig 1 total precipitation during the growing season in yr1 and yr2 was 204 and 133 mm respectively the field experiment was arranged in a spilt plot design in both years the main plots were planted in five patterns a conventional rain fed flat planting without mulch with 30 cm row spacing ck b three rfpfm practices with varying ridge to furrow ratios including 20 40 cm rfpfm20 30 30 cm rfpfm30 and 40 20 cm rfpfm40 as shown in fig 2 a and c rfpfm si planting with a ridge to furrow ratio of 30 30 cm all five planting patterns had the same planting density the sub plots had two n application rates 75 and 225 kg n ha 1 each plot was 6 m long and 4 m wide with an area of 24 m2 there were three replicates for all treatments nitrogen fertilizer urea was split applied by hand 0 125 and 185 days after sowing das the n splitting pattern was 40 30 30 the other basal fertilizers phosphorus and potassium were applied at rates of 50 kg p ha 1 and 30 kg k ha 1 both broadcasted and incorporated before ploughing alternating ridges and furrows were then constructed artificially in each plot mulching was applied to cover the ridges by using 0 008 mm thick plastic films in rfpfm and rfpfm si practices before sowing all furrows were kept uncovered double bunds 0 8 m wide were set between the main plots to prevent water and nutrient movement between the main plots for rfpfm si irrigation water of 50 and 230 mm at 90 and 219 das in yr1 respectively and 55 55 and 55 mm at 84 148 and 188 das in yr2 respectively was applied to flood the field when the soil moisture at a 12 cm depth was 70 field capacity according to li et al 2016 no irrigation was applied to ck and the three rfpfm conditions during the entire growing season the winter wheat cultivar xiaoyan 22 was sown by hand at a density of 150 kg ha 1 in each plot on october 13 2014 and october 14 2015 the winter wheat plants were harvested on june 10 2015 and may 29 2016 the experiment followed the locally recommended management practices for winter wheat production insects pathogens and weeds were controlled to protect the crops 2 2 measurements and calculations 2 2 1 soil temperature and moisture soil temperature at soil depths of 5 and 10 cm was recorded at 10 a m using a set of digital thermometers shenyang huashengchang mechanical and electrical equipment co ltd shenyang china soil volumetric water content svwc at soil depths of 7 6 and 12 cm was measured by using time domain reflectometry fieldscout tdr 300 soil moisture meter spectrum technologies inc aurora illinois usa the soil temperature and svwc in the furrows and adjacent ridges were recorded simultaneously once a week from sowing to harvesting 2 2 2 grain yield yield components and water use efficiency at physiological maturity six rows in the center of each plot 1 m long each were harvested to determine the grain yield based on a standard moisture content of 0 12 g h2o g 1 fresh weight the spike number per m2 kernel number per spike and 1000 kernel weight was determined within a 0 6 m long row sampling in each plot the harvest index hi was calculated as the total seed weight divided by the aboveground biomass before sowing and after harvesting gravimetric water content to a depth of 200 cm with an increment of 20 cm was determined by drying the soil at 105 c to a constant weight for the three rfpfm practices and rfpfm si soil cores were sampled from the middle of the furrows and ridges soil bulk densities from 0 to 200 cm at 20 cm intervals previously reported by li et al 2016 were listed as 1 05 1 26 1 26 1 29 1 19 1 15 1 17 1 19 1 38 and 1 34 g cm 3 for each soil layer respectively total soil water storage sws from 0 to 200 cm was calculated as follows 1 s w s i 1 n ρ i θ i h i where n is the number of soil layers ρi g cm 3 is the soil bulk density θi g g 1 is the gravimetric water content and hi mm is the soil layer thickness in soil layer i evapotranspiration et for the entire winter wheat growing season was determined as follows 2 e t p s w d i where p mm is the total precipitation during the crop growing season swd soil water depletion mm is the difference in sws from 0 to 200 cm between the harvesting and sowing stage and i mm is the total irrigation amount deep percolation and runoff were not considered in this experimental field of loamy clay soil because of its good water holding capacity the wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as the grain yield kg ha 1 divided by et mm 2 2 3 cost benefit analysis net revenue was calculated as the output minus the input value in the present economic evaluation system the input value consisted of the cost of materials including wheat seeds fertilizer plastic film herbicide pesticide and irrigational water labor including land preparation construction of ridges and furrows plastic film mulching fertilizer application sowing herbicide and pesticide spraying irrigating harvesting and removal of plastic film and machinery application including tillage harvesting and irrigation systems the output referred to the value of the wheat grain 2 3 data analysis the effects of the planting pattern n application rate and their interactions with grain yield yield components soil temperature and moisture et and wue were performed using variance analysis in statistix 8 0 analytical software tallahassee fl usa the mean values among the different treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd0 05 soil temperature and moisture were compared between different planting patterns rather than between n rates because n treatment did not show consistent and significant effects in both years figures were generated using sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc san jose usa 3 results 3 1 changes in soil temperature seasonal changes in soil temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm soil depths are presented in fig 3 the soil temperatures at both soil depths in all planting patterns showed a similar seasonal dynamic as the air temperature across both years which decreased gradually after sowing reached its minimum value at approximately 100 das and then increased until maturity no significant difference in daily soil temperature was observed between different planting patterns during most of the growth period across both years fig 3 as depicted in the inset graphs of fig 3 the average soil temperatures across the seedling stages in both rfpfm and rfpfm si practices were much higher than in ck whereas we observed exactly the opposite during the reproductive stage compared with that of ck the two year average soil temperature across the two n rates for rfpfm and rfpfm si was 0 58 c and 0 68 c higher at the 5 cm and 0 47 c and 0 36 c higher at the 10 cm soil depth during the seedling stage respectively however this value was 0 48 c and 1 52 c lower at the 5 cm and 0 34 c and 1 15 c lower at the 10 cm soil depth during the reproductive stage respectively 3 2 changes in soil moisture the dynamic changes in soil moisture at soil depths of 7 6 and 12 cm in all planting patterns across both years are displayed in fig 4 ck exhibited similar seasonal changes in svwc as the three rfpfm practices in both years especially in dry yr2 that depended on daily precipitation the seasonal changes in svwc in rfpfm si were more affected by the irrigation applied the three rfpfm practices increased svwc at the 7 6 cm soil depth during 50 150 das in yr1 over that of ck fig 4a whereas rfpfm si showed a higher svwc than ck and the three rfpfm treatments during most of the growth period p 0 05 svwc differences between the furrows and adjacent ridges were observed in the rfpfm practices and rfpfm si fig 5 in general the svwc difference between a furrow and ridge was larger in normal yr1 than in dry yr2 compared to that of ck the three rfpfm practices led to higher soil moisture content in the furrows than in the ridges furthermore soil moisture in the furrow in the three rfpfm practices increased significantly with increasing ridge width rfpfm si had the highest soil moisture of the three rfpfm practices in both furrows and ridges the two year mean svwc of the furrows for the two n rates for rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si were 9 19 3 26 8 and 52 0 higher at the 7 6 cm soil depth and 6 6 9 9 15 2 and 41 7 higher at the 12 cm soil depth than ck respectively 3 3 grain yields and wue grain yields revealed substantial differences between the different planting patterns table 1 rfpfm si achieved the highest grain yield followed by rfpfm and ck the grain yields from the three rfpfm practices increased with increasing ridge width rfpfm40 attained 94 of the yield of rfpfm si in yr1 but only 69 in dry yr2 due to limited precipitation high grain yield was associated with high spike number in yr1 and with high hi grain number per spikes grain weight and spike numbers in yr2 the two year average grain yield for the rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si treatments were 28 3 37 2 55 6 and 100 4 higher than that for ck respectively interactions between planting patterns and n rates had no consistent effect on grain yields and yield components over the two years table 1 considerably higher grain yields in all planting patterns were observed under higher n rates compared with those under low n rates in yr1 but not in yr2 high n rates increased the grain yield in rfpfm si in yr2 p 0 05 the best fitting regression curves of grain yields plotted against water supply precipitation plus irrigation showed that grain yield increased with increasing total water supply under both n rates regardless of the planting pattern fig 6 a the grain yield difference between the two n rates produced a quadratic curve and the greatest difference was observed when the total water supply reached 355 mm fig 6b compared to that in ck et was significantly higher in the three rfpfm practices p 0 05 which resulted in a higher swd within the 0 200 cm soil depth across both years table 2 fig 7 the average wue across the two n rates for rfpfm20 rfpfm30 and rfpfm40 was increased by 8 5 18 3 and 24 4 in yr1 and by 36 7 38 3 and 56 6 in yr2 respectively compared to that for ck in yr1 the wue was significantly lower in rfpfm si than in ck and the three rfpfm practices this change was not observed in dry yr2 a high n application failed to produce a consistently high wue regardless of the planting patterns during the two years 3 4 cost benefit analysis rfpfm practices increased net revenues over both years while rfpfm si only increased the net revenue in yr2 compared to that of ck table 3 for the three rfpfm practices net revenue averaged across the two n rates increased with increasing ridge width for both years rfpfm40 generated significantly higher net revenues than ck under both n rates with average increases of 21 5 and 152 8 in yr1 and yr2 respectively for both years different n application rates had no consistent effect on the net economic benefit table 3 for example net revenue under the high n rate was 37 3 higher than that under the low n rate in yr1 while conversely it was 32 1 lower in yr2 with limited precipitation regardless of the planting pattern the net revenue difference between the two n rates also showed a parabolic relationship with the total water supply which peaked at a water supply of 355 mm fig 6c this implied that a high n rate could boost net revenues more than a low n rate when the total water supply was between 162 549 mm 4 discussion rfpfm practices increased the soil temperature in mulched ridges during the early growth stage and enhanced soil moisture in the furrows throughout the growing season as compared to that of ck the favorable soil hydrothermal conditions with rfpfm promoted rapid seed germination and stable seedling establishment in this study thus seedlings emerged 2 5 days earlier under rfpfm and rfpfm si practices than under ck these results were also in agreement with previous reports li et al 1999 2016 ren et al 2017 li et al 2004 indicated that increasing soil temperature of the topsoil during the late growth stage with plastic film mulching is not advantageous for crop growth and may even reduce the photosynthesis rate and shorten the grain filling period owing to accelerated senescence of root tissue in the present study mulching practices failed to increase soil temperature during the reproductive growth stage and even decreased soil temperatures by 0 34 c and 1 15 c at the 10 cm soil depth in the rfpfm and rfpfm si practices respectively from that in ck these decreasing temperatures can be explained by the overshadowing effect under rfpfm and rfpfm si practices as indicated in our previous study li et al 2016 it is understood that ck practices with small crop canopies generally maintain a high light transmission ratio and therefore most of the solar radiation would reach the soil surface and increase the topsoil temperature with ck rather than with rfpfm or rfpfm si it can be argued that improved hydrothermal conditions enhance root development improve water and nutrient absorption and thereby promote overall crop growth under rfpfm and rfpfm si practices an optimum ridge to furrow ratio in the rfpfm practices is important for improving the runoff efficiency of precipitation wue and grain yields since it alters micro topographic heterogeneity by changing the crest characteristics of the soil surface and solar radiation partitioning on the land surface jiang and li 2015 the present study demonstrated that grain yields and wue increased with increasing ridge width and that rfpfm40 with the greatest ridge width achieved the highest yield and wue among the three rfpfm practices furthermore supplemental irrigation could improve soil moisture in both ridge and furrow soils and prevent drought stress for crops under rfpfm si practice therefore rfpfm si exhibited the highest grain yield among all of the treatments in both years table 1 notably the grain yield was higher in yr1 than in yr2 regardless of the planting patterns and n rates owing to the higher precipitation during the crop growing season in yr1 204 mm compared with that in yr2 133 mm under dry yr2 with limited precipitation the grain yields were 39 3 46 0 74 7 and 154 9 higher in rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si respectively than in ck whereas they were 17 3 28 3 36 5 and 45 9 higher in yr1 with normal precipitation this implies that plastic film mulching and supplemental irrigation had considerable influence in increasing the yields under dry conditions these findings are in agreement with previous reports ren et al 2009 hergert et al 2016 mo et al 2017 grain yields consist of yield components including grain number per spike spike number per m2 and grain weight overall the rfpfm and rfpfm si practices exhibited significantly higher grain yields than ck across both years which were mainly attributed to the increase in grain number per spike and the spike number per m2 the correlation analysis also suggested that improved hydrothermal conditions under rfpfm and rfpfm si practices contributed to the higher spike numbers and the development of additional spikelets rather than grain weight and hi this finding was supported by the significant correlation between soil moisture in the furrows and grain number per spike r 0 94 in yr2 and spike numbers per m2 r 0 74 and 0 84 in the two respective years increasing wue has been a key objective which can be realized by reducing et and enhancing grain yields simultaneously li et al 2016 rfpfm practices were usually known to reduce soil evaporation however in the present study the reserved soil moisture from evaporation in the rfpfm system was insufficient to meet the increased crop transpiration thereby inducing a significantly higher et than that with ck li et al 2008 reported that plastic film mulching increased the crop coefficient i e kc the ratio of actual et to reference et0 during the mid and late crop growing seasons thereby increasing the total et despite increasing et in the three rfpfm practices they still obtained significantly higher wue than that of ck in both years because of the higher yields achieved this indicates that rfpfm practices have a greater influence on improving grain yields than on improving et rfpfm si had a significantly higher total et than the three rfpfm practices and ck i e 478 mm vs 290 mm in the rfpfm practices averaged across two years this could be attributed to the irrigation water supplied to the rfpfm si plot that increased non beneficial soil evaporation qiu et al 2008 gao et al 2014 also suggested that supplemental irrigation could increase the soil evaporation coefficient hence rfpfm increased wue by 21 2 over that of the rfpfm si practice because of a decrease in et by 39 3 p 0 05 while sustaining a comparable grain yield in yr1 with normal precipitation when the precipitation became severely limited in dry yr2 rfpfm40 rather than the other two rfpfm practices was found to increase wue significantly by 20 4 over that of rfpfm si it should be noted that the yield and wue increases in the rfpfm practices were related to increasing water consumption in the deep soils as shown in fig 7 the swd in the three rfpfm practices at the 100 160 cm layer in yr1 and at the 120 180 cm layer in yr2 was much larger than that in ck this result has also been reported previously li et al 1999 2016 mo et al 2017 however the field soils could receive certain amounts of rainfall during the fallow period from july to september which could mitigate the water deficit to some extent as demonstrated in this study the three rfpfm practices and ck had similar sws at sowing in yr2 although the sws at harvesting in yr1 was significantly lower in the rfpfm than in the ck plot table 2 in this study swd was not assessed over a long term this aspect deserves further investigation to verify the long term effect of the rfpfm practice as a sustainable water saving method in dry semi humid regions it is well documented that the interactions between water and n applications could play different roles in grain yields and wue performance which depend on varying water levels li et al 2016 in yr1 with normal precipitation n application rates produced significant and positive effects on the grain yields and wue accompanied by an increased spike number per area p 0 05 table 1 this implies that n application improved the nutritional effectiveness and water availability simultaneously and such complementary effects could be referred to as synergistic functions as reported in other studies li et al 2009 2016 however no significant positive n response was observed in yr2 with limited precipitation which might be attributed to the drought stress that occurred when the n topdressing was applied under high n rates this interaction could even result in a negative effect on grain yields and wue li et al 2009 this is called an antagonistic effect and commonly occurs under severe drought stress conditions when increased n application is inadvisable as it could exacerbate drought stress rudnick and irmak 2014 our best fitting quadratic curve between seasonal water supply and grain yields under the two n rates demonstrated that increasing the n rate from 75 to 225 kg n ha 1 maximized grain yields when the seasonal precipitation was 355 mm fig 6b in contrast it could decrease grain yields if the seasonal precipitation was less than 150 mm this specific synergistic and antagonistic interaction between n and water status implies that the n application should be adjusted according to site specific precipitation regimes to obtain better grain yields wue and n use efficiencies debaeke and aboudrare 2004 haefele et al 2008 sun et al 2012 li et al 2016 net economic benefit is an important factor when considering whether a new technique can be widely applied by local farmers adoption of water saving technologies can aid in increasing crop productivity and thereby the profitability of producers mo et al 2016 2017 in the economic evaluation system of the present study the expenditures for constructing the furrows and ridges covering with plastic film and implementing irrigation led to input costs that were 47 2 52 2 57 2 and 153 9 higher for rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si respectively than for ck in addition rfpfm20 rfpfm30 rfpfm40 and rfpfm si practices resulted in 28 3 37 2 55 6 and 100 4 higher output respectively compared to that with ck which averaged across both years because of a considerable increase in grain yield the highest net revenue was achieved under rfpfm40 with the widest ridge regardless of n rates across both years rfpfm40 could be recommended as an economically optimal practice for winter wheat production and for improving the livelihood of farmers during dry years with limited precipitation such as when the total seasonal water supply is below 162 mm high n is not recommended because it could decrease net revenue due to the yield penalty during that time however supplemental irrigation leads to better economic income in the dry year we are expecting to implement further technological innovations such as thorough mechanization for the construction of furrows and ridges to reduce the extensive labor costs associated with rfpfm practices these will aid in enhancing the dissemination of rfpfm practices within chinese farming communities thus the advantages of rfpfm s productive innovations could be extensively exploited in china and many other countries 5 conclusions in this study rfpfm practices increased the soil temperature in the mulched ridges during the vegetative stage and preserved more water in the furrows throughout the growing season the improved hydrothermal conditions based on micro topographic heterogeneity in the rfpfm plots promoted earlier and stable seedling establishment and thereby improved grain yields wue and net economic revenues different ridge to furrow ratios resulted in varying micro topographical characteristics demonstrating that hydrothermal features grain yields wue and net revenues were generally improved with an increase in the ridge to furrow ratio rfpfm40 with the widest ridge is highly recommended as a promising water saving and economical practice for winter wheat production in this dry semi humid area supplemental irrigation could be applied in dry years with limited precipitation to alleviate drought stress in contrast in normal years seasonal rainfall more than 162 mm high n application rates could be considered in rfpfm practices to further increase grain yields wue and net economic revenues in this region advanced technological innovations such as thorough mechanization to reduce extensive labor costs are required to boost the spread of rfpfm practices gan et al 2013 and to fully exploit their advantages in

11059,improving the accuracy of single crop coefficient kc for major crops at regional scales would significantly result in optimizing the consumption of agriculture water in this study a new approach is applied to generate kc curves from satellite images based on the priestley taylor equation the equation mainly consists of shortwave radiation and thermal terms therefore in order to meet the equation s requirements the landsat optical data was considered as the essential satellite based input of the approach yet thermal data was obtained from the modis imagery which was primarily downscaled using the tsharp algorithm to fit the 30 m spatial resolution of landsat therefore in this study the method is referred to as the multisensor data fusion for potential evapotranspiration calculation msdf et the kc trends were first evaluated for annual crops forage maize sugar beet wheat and barley in two different regions the qazvin and tehran karaj plains using field observation data of leaf area index lai the method was then applied to the major crops in 31 selected plains with three different climatic conditions in iran climatic conditions were categorized into cold north west region arid central region and warm and humid south west region eventually crop water requirements cwr in different regions were compared considering long term air temperature wind and relative humidity rh variations evaluation of the method in the qazvin and tehran karaj plains showed promising results the kc trend varied according to the lai and temperature variability crop growth duration and especially kc curves were successfully extracted using remotely sensed data in the studied areas cwr in the zone with higher values of air temperature notably in warm seasons was higher in comparison with other climatic zones also lengths of the growing seasons were shorter in conclusion surface and groundwater resources management would be improved as the result of taking satellite data into account for kc and subsequently cwr calculations keywords crop coefficient different climatic conditions landsat modis msdf et method 1 introduction coping with water scarcity has been always a big challenge in arid and semi arid climates in many countries such as iran in addition to poor quality of water used in agriculture the continuous decrease of surface and groundwater level has raised political cultural socio economic concerns agriculture is the largest water user in iran therefore broadening our knowledge on the amount of water required for agriculture sector would be essential in better management of water resources the magnitude of water evapotranspired can be determined through manifold of measurement techniques including lysimeters bowen ratio eddy covariance water balance scintillometry sap flow and remote sensing allen et al 2011 yet conducting such field experiments are costly and time consuming hence allen et al 1998 in no 56 of journal series of food and agriculture organization fao 56 proposed a simplified method for estimation of crop water requirements cwr under optimum conditions of soil and water without any salinity stress diseases and pests etc however in this study we refer to it as potential evapotranspiration etp by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 and single crop coefficient kc 1 et p k c et 0 kc values change along the growing season of a crop with regard to fluctuations in vegetation cover and are representative of crop growth curve according to fao 56 the curve is built by making use of parameters such as crop growth duration table 11 in fao 56 and three values of initial crop coefficient kc ini middle crop coefficient kc mid and terminal crop coefficient kc end obtained from the table 12 of fao 56 designing efficient irrigation systems appropriate water allocation plans and also the proper use of the water balance equations are solely achieved using accurate estimations of kc curves because of its empirical nature utilization of fao 56 values are considered inaccurate in different climatic regions under different soil and water management and will eventually lead to unrealistic estimates of cwr jagtap and jones 1989 neale et al 1990 allen et al 1998 mentioned that these values are to be used as general guide and more accurate ones must be extracted considering field surveys or by the means of remote sensing kc calculation based on satellite data can be categorized into two main approaches 1 spectral vegetation indices svis and 2 energy balance equation previous efforts in different regions of the world showed linear and almost linear relationships between vegetative surface leaf area index lai and canopy cover cc and satellite based svis gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 nguy robertson and gitelson 2015 mokhtari et al 2018a the conditions of vegetation cover directly affect the amount of radiation reflected from surface and consequently result in svis variations but in addition to lai and cc etp is influenced by several environmental and meteorological parameters therefore calculating kc merely from svis would cause errors mokhtari et al 2018b crop variables physical soil characteristics soil moisture content and weather conditions exert uncertainties on svi based kc values choudhury et al 1994 hence all being said kc curves can be ameliorated by taking advantage of satellite imagery associated with energy balance equation and meteorological data for one thing optical thermal satellite imagery provide us with nothing but energy reflected or emitted from the surface on the other hand priestley and taylor 1972 developed an equation a derivative of the penman monteith equation based merely on energy absorbed by the surface parodi and gabriel 2002 calculated etp using satellite images in ahas algorithm ahas derived etp is based on the priestley taylor equation mokhtari et al 2018b found that the energy balance equation for kc calculation could result in more realistic values satellite based energy balance equations have also proved to be useful in actual evapotranspiration eta estimation against measured data bastiaanssen et al 1998 pioneered the calculation of eta using net energy flux over vegetation cover obtained from satellite images sebal algorithm satellite based eta was evaluated against lysimeter data in several previous studies and presented as a practical approach on a large scale paul et al 2013 bansouleh et al 2015 jaber et al 2016 lian and huang 2016 barker et al 2017 generally widely examination of previous studies kc calculation based on energy balance equation has been barely paid attention to let alone its use in different climatic conditions all methods of energy balance equation require hourly meteorological measurements which many regions in developing countries suffer from the dearth of such data therefore the average of satellite based nighttime and daytime land surface temperatures lsts as the 24 hour lst sun and kafatos 2007 used in radiation calculation can be of great help in direct estimation of etp many satellite imagery including noaa and modis are provided with such data with low spatial resolution however lst sharpening is required prior to taking into practice the combination of coarse lst and images with higher spatial resolution such as landsat series lst has shown a promising relationship with svis therefore kustas et al 2003 presented the tsharp algorithm for the purpose of downscaling modis lst 1000 m to landsat spatial resolution 30 m and proved to be accurate in agricultural areas agam et al 2007a validating kc directly one would face myriad of difficulties yet we know that kc has a strong relationship with crop parameters such as lai and cc heilman et al 1982 moran et al 1995 accordingly čereković et al 2010 presented an equation based on this relationship for kc calculation as a function of lai sumner and jacobs 2005 also found that the vegetation coefficients are a simple function of lai kc is also relatively dependent on wind speed relative humidity and temperature differences in disparate climatic regions allen et al 1998 which can also be taken into consideration the main objective of this study was to investigate the application of a remote sensing based method for improving kc curves in 31 selected plains in iran under three different climatic conditions first the method was validated in two research farms in the qazvin and karaj tehran plains and then after the determination of sowing and harvesting dates the method was applied on major crops in the climatic zones the method was based on etp from the priestley taylor equation and et0 from the penman monteith equation etp was obtained using the landsat 7 etm and 8 oli imagery combined with modis thermal data and meteorological data as input which in this research we refer to the method as the multi sensor data fusion for evapotranspiration calculation msdf et also we modified the tsharp algorithm in order to better achieve daily high resolution thermal data from modis images the resulting kc curves were compared against the lai and temperature variations in the end differences in cwr were discussed considering the different climatic conditions and previously reported values 2 materials and methods mokhtari et al 2018b thoroughly evaluated four different methods of kc calculation including the priestley taylor referred to as the msdf et approach in this study fao 56 svi based and data assimilation into agro hydrological model approaches in which the msdf et approach showed more promising results thus the data fusion part was modified and then the method taken into account in this study for kc calculation of major crops in iran the kc calculation had been conducted for winter wheat in the qazvin plain hence in this study in addition to winter wheat in the qazvin plain we took temperature fluctuations and the measured lai of forage maize sugar beet wheat and barley into account for investigating the goodness of the trends of kc in the hezar jolfa agro industry company in the qazvin plain and the research farms of the university of tehran in the tehran karaj plain afterwards kc curves from the msdf et approach were calculated for major crops in different climatic conditions in order to discuss the discrepancies with regard to the changes in meteorological parameters then cwrs were estimated and compared with the previous data reported under the iran s program on providing national water agenda 2 1 field data measurements 2 1 1 the hezar jolfa agro industry company the qazvin plain the region includes the qazvin irrigation network the hezar jolfa agro industry company lies within the eastern part of the qazvin irrigation network with latitude of 36 8 n and longitude of 50 11 e the climate is arid agricultural planning economic and rural development research institute aperdri and the average annual rainfall is 100 mm long term meteorological data the company is located in abyek county it is limited to the east by the hezar jolfa village to the south by the abdol abad village to the west by the magsal agro industry company and it is 10 km south of the city of mohammadiye the company consists of 5 center pivot cp 1 to cp 5 and a few classic irrigation systems fig 1 b the crop rotation comprised of wheat barley and canola in winter and maize and sugar beet in spring long term meteorological data were obtained from the magsal station 500 m to the east of the company situated at 36 9 n and 50 10 12 e data collection was conducted in 2012 growing season in forage maize and sugar beet fields forage maize was planted in cp 5 with 15 days delay compared to the forage maize in cp 2 and sugar beet was planted on 7th of april 2012 in the western side of cp 4 cp 2 cp 4 and cp 5 are respectively about 40 40 and 30 hectares which consist of a decent number of landsat pixels 30 m yet was small for 1000 meter pixel size of the modis lst the harvesting dates for all the crops were similar table 1 field data included lai which had been destructively collected for every 7 to 14 days table 1 particular attention was paid for choosing a location for data sampling with a decent distance from the edge of the fields after each field survey the samples were transferred to laboratory under the standard conditions leaves were detached and the surface area was measured using deltat device uk jonckheere et al 2004 then eventually lai was calculated by the division of the leaf surface area to the plot surface area the growing season was during 2012 when landsat 8 had not been launched therefore landsat 7 etm was the only possible option in this region the time series of images with the path of 165 and the row of 35 was chosen those pixels under cloud and slc off scan line corrector failure of the sensor data conditions were set aside from the image processing procedure then kc curves were simulated by using the validated landsat 7 modis and meteorological datasets 2 1 2 university of tehran agriculture research farms the tehran karaj plain the tehran karaj plain is located in the north of iran fig 1c with arid climatic conditions aperdri and has 250 mm average annual rainfall long term meteorological data from the qazvin station predominant crops are wheat and barley in winter and maize in spring in this study the university of tehran agriculture research farms were chosen for data collection the surface area of the research farms was about 200 hectares and consists of 2 main 270 center pivot cp 1 and cp 2 with surface area of about 30 hectares each and a few classic the barley field irrigation systems data collection was done for wheat and barley for 17 sampling points which were randomly selected around the fields meteorological data were obtained from the synoptic station provided particularly for the research farms fig 1c the station was situated at 35 48 23 n and 50 57 12 e mean elevation of the research farms was 1305 above the sea level data sampling included lai measurements which had been done once a week during the wheat and barley growing seasons table 2 14 plots were allocated to wheat and 3 plots to barley the data collection was implemented by the means of a li cor lai 2200c device one data was read above the canopy along with several data under the canopy then lai was directly proposed by the device using the average values of the data readings under the canopy with respect to the above canopy value both wheat and barley growing seasons started from 6 november 2017 until 29 june 2018 landsat 8 164035 and 165035 scenes have overlap in this area therefore the intervals between the times of the image acquisitions were 7 and 9 days which is why more robust kc curves could be extracted from landsat 8 oli and modis imagery associated with long term meteorological data however in this period several images were ruled out inevitably because of many cloudy days 2 2 selection of plains iran has been divided into several plains and watersheds with regard to many hydrological features the center for water resources research tamab has partitioned the country into 609 plains in this study 31 plains across the country were selected based on firstly the accessibility of the meteorological and crop data and secondly because of the variations in climatic conditions the plains were categorized into three climatic zones including north west nw central c and south west sw fig 1a 1 the plains of nw zone had relatively cold climate with air temperature variability of 5 to 25 c and aridity index of 0 2 0 5 2 the climate in the c zone was arid with air temperature varying from 0 to 30 c and aridity index of 0 03 0 2 3 sw climate was warm and humid with high air temperature ranging from 10 to greater than 35 c and the aridity index of 0 03 0 2 14 plains were located in nw 7 in c and 10 in sw see table a1 in appendix a climatic information and maps and at least 10 year meteorological data were obtained from aperdri ministry of agriculture jihad the data from 33 synoptic stations were used fig 1a 2 2 1 crop calendar in this study the kc curves were calculated for 34 crops in 474 fields in 31 plains in iran first the location of the studied fields and crop combinations were determined by aperdri then abundant field surveys were conducted in order to fill out questionnaires and specify farm coordinates by using gps navigation devices satellite based kc must have been derived for the fields under approximately optimum conditions therefore irrigated farms were preferable mateos et al 2013 and mokhtari et al 2018b also chose irrigated fields for calculating crop coefficients all the fields properties were transferred to experts at iranian space agency isa landsat and modis imagery were downloaded and preprocessed prior to svi calculation svis time series from september 2014 until september 2015 were calculated for the pixel corresponding to the specified coordinates using landsat 7 etm and 8 oli also efforts were directed towards choosing fields located on the overlap of the landsat images calculated svis included normalized different vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 and soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 in addition to application of these indices in calculating crop parameters they can successfully distinguish the health of vegetation and the goodness of trends in crop growth during growing season hence unhealthy crops were excluded ndvi under low lai lai 1 conditions is more sensitive to green vegetation variations in comparison with other svis therefore the dates of crop germination and crop harvest can be determined using this index mokhtari et al 2018a in this study crop calendar was specified considering ndvi variability at low vegetation cover the point where the ndvi curve started to rise was assumed to be the date of crop germination in which green vegetation was becoming gradually visible a sufficient knowledge of crop management and methods of crop planting which differed for each crop in each region was necessary for determining planting date a week or a month before crop germination according to the crop type and management practices the time of harvest was determined as follows fig 2 1 as soon as ndvi curve plummeted to almost minimum for those crops which were harvested after senescing such as wheat and barley and continued with almost a constant value or 2 the time before ndvi curve reached its minimum for those crops which were harvested before complete senescing and kept on declining until it reached the minimum constant value in order to evaluate the accuracy of the remote sensing based planting and harvesting dates an opportunity came up to provide several questionnaires and distribute them among farmers in order to gather information about the real planting and harvesting dates thus the results were compared with those of the remote sensing 2 3 single crop coefficient calculation the algorithm for kc calculation was similar in all the regions and is depicted in fig 3 the main procedures of the approach were adopted from mokhtari et al 2018b in short potential evapotranspiration etp was estimated using the priestley taylor equation based on the combination of landsat imagery and modis thermal data yet in this study the fusion process was facilitated in order for the method to be more practical in vast areas then reference evapotranspiration et0 was from the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 in the end kc was calculated by dividing etp by et0 the reason behind choosing the fao penman monteith equation was that it is currently being widely used in the country for irrigation scheduling and water allocation plans therefore in order for the results to be taken into practice in the water agenda the fao penman monteith equation was selected and the calculation procedure was based completely on the meteorological data as for the aforementioned purposes 2 3 1 potential evapotranspiration calculation using the multisensor data fusion approach the msdf et method has been established on the basis of the priestley taylor equation for etp calculation the etp calculation procedure was implemented using landsat optical and modis thermal bands associated with meteorological data eqs 2 7 one of the biggest advantages of this equation is its applicability at regional scales shuttleworth 1993 2 et p φ δ δ γ r n daily rn daily is the daily net radiation over the canopy watt m 2 d 1 δ is the slope of the vapor pressure kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 φ is the priestley taylor coefficient which was considered 1 26 for coastal areas sw region and 1 74 for interior regions nw and c yates and strzepek 1994 rn daily was obtained using the energy balance equation 3 r n daily 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is the broadband surface albedo which was estimated using a weighted sum of landsat surface reflectance for each band waters et al 2002 rs is the daily surface solar radiation watt m 2 d 1 rl is the surface incoming longwave radiation watt m 2 d 1 rl is the outgoing surface longwave radiation watt m 2 d 1 and ε0 is the surface emissivity which was held by modis land surface temperature lst products dimensionless rs was calculated by the means of the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1982 4 r s k r t max t min 0 5 r a where ra is the daily extra terrestrial solar radiation watt m 2 d 1 and it was estimated using the duffie and beckman 1980 1991 method tmax and tmin are the maximum and minimum temperatures in a day c and kr was calculated as allen 1995 has suggested 5 k r k ra p p 0 0 5 where p and p0 are the average atmosphere pressure in the study area kpa and the average atmosphere pressure at the sea level kpa kra is an empirical coefficient which was considered 0 17 for interior regions and 0 2 for coastal regions p varies with elevation above sea level and was calculated as suggested in allen et al 1998 therefore dem was utilized for this purpose rl and rl were obtained using the stefan boltzmann law which describes the radiance of an object in terms of its temperature eqs 6 and 7 6 r l ε a sb t a 4 7 r l ε 0 sb lst 4 where sb is the stefan boltzmann constant equal to 5 67 108 watt m 2 k4 ta is the air temperature from the closest meteorological station to the studied field k εa is the atmosphere emissivity and lst is the land surface temperature k obtained from satellite data r l was calculated using the method proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 and daily average air temperature to obtain daily r l in order to achieve daily r l landsat thermal bands were of no help because the lst calculated from these bands are instantaneous therefore we took modis terra and aqua lst products into account for daily r l estimation mokhtari et al 2018b in addition to lst mod11a1 and myd11a1 products table 3 hold surface emissivity data hence in this study before sharpening these products to landsat spatial resolution outgoing longwave radiation was calculated using eq 7 the sharpening method was the same as tsharp kustas et al 2003 but the relationship between r l and savi was discussed and applied to all the regions more details can be found in section 3 4 2 4 datasets the protocol and types of data for making use of the satellite images was similar in all the regions table 3 first ndvi and savi time series were calculated by using landsat imagery landsat 8 took priority over landsat 7 but to fill the time gaps caused by cloudy pixels landsat 7 was used thermal characteristics of each pixel were determined using modis terra and aqua lst products then etp was calculated for the day of landsat acquisition which was led into kc time series kc curves were smoothed and linearly interpolated in order to obtain daily kc values 2 5 fao single crop coefficient kc curves from the fao approach was plotted considering the kc of initial middle and late season growth stages these quantities were taken from the table 12 of fao 56 then the lengths of four crop growth stages were specified using table 11 from fao 56 maximum kc values middle stage kc were modified by the means of wind speed and minimum rh for each region equation 62 of fao 56 and then the fao kc curves were obtained 3 results and discussion 3 1 the hezar jolfa agro industry company the qazvin plain 1 lai the lai curves of forage maize and sugar beet are shown against the kc curves derived from the fao and msdf et approaches fig 4 the leaves collected from the hezar jolfa agro industry company were the green parts of the crops so the resulted parameter was actually green lai in fact in forage maize and sugar beet where crops are harvested before the senescing total lai and green lai are the same for an entire growing season forage maize was planted in a warm season spring therefore the initial stage was relatively short about a month the planting date was 16 days earlier in cp 2 than cp 4 however both of them were harvested in a same day this short delay in the planting date concluded significant differences in lai curves in the mid and late season stages lai in early planted forage maize declined about 1 3 m2 m 2 in 10 days after the peak lai was reached both lai curves of early and late planted forage maize slightly declined at the late season stage due to stopping irrigation about 2 to 3 weeks before harvesting the concept behind the irrigation termination was to let soil dry out before harvest for the facilitation of agricultural machinery movements the lai data for the sugar beet initial stage was not obtained the peak lai took about a month to decline from 19 july 2012 to 26 august 2012 then harvesting was done after about three months before complete senescing of the crop 2 temperature air temperature is one of the most effective factors in cwr sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 investigated the impact of different parameters on the amount of evapotranspiration in 8 meteorological stations in different climatic conditions in iran they found that evapotranspiration had the highest sensitivity to air temperature in the qazvin plain the maximum air temperature occurred in mid july and the minimum was in mid january fig 5 both early and late planted forage maize were planted near the peak period of air temperature which is why the initial stage was short fig 4 it should be noted that both methods fao and msdf et properly distinguished the shortness caused by the temperature also the higher air temperature was the reason to the shorter duration of the growing seasons of the spring crops compared to the winter crop studied in mokhtari et al 2018b in the hezar jolfa agro industry company 3 kccurves the trends in satellite based kc variations were almost similar to that of fao for maize and sugar beet except that the kc values of the initial stage were relatively higher at the initial stage the major part of etp is comprised of evaporation allen et al 1998 indicated that kc in this stage is a function of evaporative power of the atmosphere et0 irrigation frequency and depth kc ini calculation required soil moisture and irrigation data these data are sorely collected at regional scales therefore the initial and terminal values of kc in the fao approach were inevitably limited to the values presented in table 12 of fao 56 however when etp is calculated using the priestley taylor equation in addition to the bands affected by vegetation cover thermal and shortwave infrared bands along with air temperature were used the higher kc values at the initial stage in forage maize and sugar beet compared to the fao approach were the results of the first heavy irrigation table 1 given that the first irrigation practices were performed during the warm season when the evaporative power of the atmosphere is relatively higher albedo and soil surface temperature decreased consequently shortwave radiation absorption increased and longwave radiation emitted from the ground was reduced accordingly msdf et derived etp rose up also higher values of kc in the initial stage might be partly caused by tillage or soil fertilization the middle stage was significantly shorter which due to the fact that it is the stage influencing the cwr the most it will eventually lead the cwr to a lower value compared with the conventional fao approach used for irrigation scheduling the kc end values were slightly lower in the satellite based curves it was caused because of the actual senescing detected by the satellite sensors affecting the satellite based kc to plummet below the fao curve comparing kc with lai the trends observed in kc curves fairly conform to the lai variability where lai started to rise about 15th and 30th of july in early and late planted maize the kc also rose the length of the middle stage was from late august until late september in both maize curves and early july until late august in sugar beet which were almost similar in both satellite based kc and field measured lai and had better results compared with fao curves 3 2 university of tehran agriculture research farms the tehran karaj plain 1 lai lai time series of wheat and barley of the agriculture research farms in the 2017 18 growing season were plotted against kc trends fig 6 these curves were the average of wheat and barley plots the peak lai of 5 28 table 2 occurred in only one plot but the average lai for the whole farm reached the maximum of 3 8 the reason for the low lai was the heavy snowfall which occurred during the pollination stage of the crops as reported by the agriculture research office the inclement weather also caused degradation in crop yield 2 temperature both crops were planted in the middle of autumn therefore there was time only for germination before entering the dormancy period which is why the initial stage was prolonged for about 4 months the low value of kc in the initial stage compared with the fao curves was caused by the low temperature of the late january the ground had also been covered by snow for 2 to 3 weeks which resulted in reduction of etp down to almost zero the decrease in etp led to the decrease in kc same results were obtained in mokhtari et al 2018b for winter wheat in the hezar jolfa agro industry company without snow condition so it appeared that the snow cover did not have significant influence on the kc curves and the low air temperature conditions might have had more dominant effect 3 kccurves the modeled curves from the msdf et approach varied with the changes in α and savi lai trends were almost the same in both crops except that barley had about a month longer initial stage due to the fact that the trends in α and savi are deeply dependent on lai trends the satellite based kc curves were in high compliance with the corresponding lai time series according to lai variability the fao curves were unrealistic for example the mid season stage of barley started in the middle of winter when crop was actually in the dormancy period and the situation continued until the middle of spring also when the lai curve was at its peak the fao curve was declining the trends in fao curve of wheat were much closer to the real world variations of vegetation cover except that the middle stage was a month longer than the satellite based kc kc possesses a strong relationship with variations in vegetative surface and relatively proportional to temperature fluctuations allen et al 2011 therefore according to the results obtained in this study using optical bands of oli and etm sensors and taking advantage of thermal radiation of electromagnetic spectrum concluded more logical kc curves in addition the environmental parameters in the model were used and enhanced the results taking the remote sensing data into practice for crop growth modeling and evapotranspiration calculation at regional scales would significantly extend our knowledge in how crop growth curves vary with the changes in environmental parameters 3 3 crop calendar the questionnaires were distributed among the farmers of 39 fields in the razan qahavand naqade sojas mahneshan angooran zanjan khooy ardebil and moqan pars abad plains for 15 crops including winter and spring wheat sugar beet rice melon heather tomato bean sunflower zucchini barley potato pea black cumin and cotton 1 evaluation of crop growth duration from ndvi time series planting and harvesting dates were presented by local farmers in the studied area in the iranian calendar these dates were converted into the english calendar and a list has been drawn up against satellite based planting and harvesting dates see table b1 in appendix b the results showed that 26 of the planting dates and 27 of the harvesting dates coincided with the intervals presented by farmers 68 percent of the data other dates were not so distant from the questionnaires results 2 3 weeks differences these results were representative of a reliable crop calendar obtained from landsat images therefore the lengths of the growing seasons of the other crops in the other plains were determined as such urban et al 2018 found that the svi calculated using the modis optical sensor performed more consistently with moderate to good prediction for estimating planting dates compared with ku band backscattering of quickscat and solar induced fluorescence index from gome 2 in principle we take the view that the optical sensors can be taken into practice for estimating the planting dates with reliable accuracy 2 crop growth duration in the studied plains the length of the growing seasons cannot be easily determined by conducting local surveys at regional scales allen et al 1998 mentioned that table 11 of fao 56 is useful only as a general guide the values should be modified by field surveys or remote sensing to incorporate effects of plant variety climate and cultural practices according to the long term meteorological data obtained from the synoptic stations minimum maximum and average air temperatures were 15 34 38 04 and 11 86 c respectively for the nw zone 12 06 39 4 and 15 22 c for the c zone and 1 93 57 32 and 25 67 c for the sw zone even a subtle air temperature difference might be the fundamental factor for the various lengths of growing seasons table 4 plants grow faster under high air temperature conditions and reach the harvest time quickly the lengths of the growing seasons were the highest in nw followed by c and sw however some crops did not follow this general rule for example the crop growth duration of onion is reduced by the increase in air temperature in different climatic zones the reason was that there might be limited studied farms of onion to investigate in the three zones the sw zone was near the sea and also had lower latitude in comparison with nw and c therefore in addition to the extreme temperature conditions especially in warm months the lowest temperature did not fall below zero in cold months so practically winter crops would not experience dormancy this condition allowed farmers to cultivate most of the crops in both winter and spring even in particular cases crops were planted three times a year the previously reported lengths of the growing seasons were also laid out in table 4 most of which were different from that of the crop growth durations derived from the satellite data so the reported data can be superseded by the modified values 3 4 radiance emitted from the ground against spectral vegetation indices tsharp algorithm was proposed by kustas et al 2003 in their study lst was downscaled to the landsat spatial resolution using the relationship between lst and ndvi derived cc previous studies have shown more linearity between savi and vegetation cover choudhury et al 1994 badiyeneshin et al 2015 mokhtari et al 2018a therefore it can be concluded that savi would better demonstrate spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and subsequently apply it in lst calculation hence in this study the procedure of tsharp implementation was modified first savi was computed for each pixel using modis data second the savi images were aggregated by simple areal average to achieve pixel size of approximately 1000 m third there s a strong relationship between lst and r l eq 7 so given that the modis lst products also contain surface emissivity the emitted energy from the ground caused by temperature was calculated for each pixel fourth the relationship between r l and savi was discussed fig 7 fifth and the last errors in the least squares regression due to forces altering surface temperature other than vegetation intensity e g soil moisture were corrected estimating r l directly from the relationship between savi and outgoing radiance had the following benefits 1 calculation of surface emissivity from landsat images was not required 2 the errors caused by cc estimation from svis were removed r l was fairly correlated with savi variability fig 7 similar results were found in kustas et al 2003 agam et al 2007a and sun and kafatos 2007 between the ndvi and lst relationship sun and kafatos 2007 found that ndvi and lst were directly correlated in cold months positive slope of regression line and inversely correlated in warm months negative slope of regression line in this study results were similar except that r l was negatively correlated with savi in january under the sw zone conditions slope of the regression line was 54 84 the reason was the high temperature conditions in all the months of year in this region the r2 in the relationship between r l and savi was between 0 2 0 6 in the warm seasons and lower than 0 15 in the cold seasons according to agam et al 2007b the low values of r2 are stemmed from surface moisture variability and other non vegetative conditions maybe such as buildings and roads which is relatively suppressed through the reintroduction of the sharpening residuals in the tsharp procedure also we take the view that the low correlation in the cold seasons could be overlooked because the evapotranspiration is so low that does not significant effect on the outcome of the msdf et method 3 5 single crop coefficient curves satellite based single crop coefficient was calculated for all the crops using the msdf et approach due to numerous modeled curves only two of each winter and spring crops including winter wheat and barley and spring maize and potato were selected fig 8 these crops had been commonly cultivated in all the climatic zones so that the comparisons could be made it was noted that the selected curves were fairly representative of the whole regions the winter crops wheat and barley in the nw zone had considerably longer lengths of growing seasons cold period occurred from mid autumn until mid winter so the lengthened dormancy period was the distinct characteristic of this zone therefore winter crops were planted in the first half of the autumn in order to find the opportunity to germinate before dormancy while winter crops under sw and in some cases in c were planted in winter the dramatic declination in the sw curves occurred due to the fact that crops in this region had the opportunity to completely grow and then face the low temperatures of winter however never entered the dormancy because the cold period was too short so the curves started to increase quickly another reason could be the air temperature of about 15 c in winter under sw climatic conditions fig 9 this value of air temperature was not adequately low to cause crop dormancy the winter crops in c were planted in late autumn in order to find the opportunity to only germinate and then faced the short dormancy period the dormancy was so short that it could not be observed in the curve the lengths of the growing seasons were longer under nw and c conditions and shorter in sw compared to fao crop growth duration of potato and maize in sw and c were longer than nw the trends in satellite based kc curves were almost similar to fao except that the crop growth duration and initial and terminal values of kc were different the maximum values of kc in nw were lower than the other zones allen et al 1998 in fao 56 mentioned that the increase in rh and the decrease in wind speed reduce the maximum kc value both rh and wind speed were higher in nw hence according to kc variability of spring crops in the nw zone fig 8 relative humidity was more effective which caused reductions in kc max values satellite sensors were able to detect multiple harvests of crops such as alfalfa and apply it to kc curve fig 10 taking advantage of this method the average number of harvests can be determined in a region and accordingly propose kc curves overall according to air temperature and latitude discrepancies satellite based kc curves were in more compliance with the reality in addition to kc values the lengths of the growing seasons were actualized these improvements would result in more accurate cwr estimate which is the essential factor in irrigation system design water allocation to farmers and water balance calculations 3 6 crop water requirements the magnitude of irrigation water requirements is greatly affected by cwr and rainfall amount in this section cwr of studied crops were calculated by multiplication of et0 from fao penman monteith by satellite based kc etp and comparisons were made between the reported and satellite based values table 4 the etp values of spring crops were significantly higher under the sw zone conditions i e 754 2 mm in sw 681 8 mm in c and 630 4 mm in nw for spring maize and 684 2 mm in sw 450 5 mm in c and 544 mm in nw for spring tomato the main reason was the considerably higher air temperature and surface solar radiation the impact of these two meteorological parameters on et0 was greater in warm seasons of sw rather than the nw and c zones fig 9 therefore the values of etp in spring crops decreased with respect to the decrease in air temperature for sw c and nw rh was higher in warm seasons under nw which could be another reason for the decrease in etp kc max values were relatively lower in nw therefore it led to lower cwr in the peak period of crop growth opposite results were observed for winter crops winter crops had shorter growing seasons under sw table 4 they had been harvested before reaching the peak air temperature period so the maximum portion of the kc curves was in the early spring but winter crops in c and nw were harvested in early and mid summer where the peak air temperature period almost covered the peak kc period of winter crops on the other hand et0 in sw was only slightly higher in the cold seasons which subsequently had smaller effects on cwr also because of the shorter duration of the growing seasons cwr in sw was much lower compared with the nw and c zones cwr of black cumin canola and heather in nw turnip winter maize and winter vegetables in c and okra spring wheat vegetables winter maize winter potato and winter rice in sw had not been reported the sum of the cwr varied depending on the lengths of the growing seasons for example due to the longer growing period of spring wheat in nw 27 days longer cwr was higher compared with the reported values 715 2 mm derived from the satellite data against 681 mm in conclusion satellite based cwr varied irregularly with respect to the reported values 4 conclusions kc values offered by fao 56 cannot be relied on due to its empirical nature thus this research has been carried out for kc curves improvements regarding different climatic conditions kc curves were derived from satellite data based on the msdf et method the method was based on the energy balance equation for etp calculation the priestley taylor equation which is practically twofold first due to its use for the regional etp calculation and second incorporating the thermal data and albedo the resulting curves would conform better to the real world variations of crop and weather conditions studied regions were categorized into regions with and without field data due to the strong relationship between kc and lai the kc trends were discussed in the regions with field data using the lai time series as the result the kc curves showed good trends with respect to lai variability and also air temperature prior to applying the msdf et method on the selected plains ndvi which proved to be accurate regarding the field survey was used to determine the planting and harvesting dates of all crops in the 31 plains then kc curves of major crops were calculated in three selected climatic zones in iran climatic zones included cold nw arid c and warm and humid sw in the end cwr of each crop was calculated and compared with previously reported values the differences in air temperature relative humidity and wind speed caused different trends in kc curves and cwr values the lengths of the growing seasons were shorter and cwr were higher in sw notably for spring crops due to shorter crop growth duration and earlier harvesting dates in winter crops in sw cwr decreased compared to nw and c overall satellite data provide us a broader perspective of how crops grow considering prevailing climatic conditions so consequently irrigation scheduling would be improved and water resources better managed the bold dates coincide with the results obtained from the questionnaires acknowledgements calculation of kc curves for major crops in iran was a cooperative project between isa and aperdri the field surveys and selection were conducted by aperdri and the digital processing of satellite imagery was performed in isa the project was successfully implemented with the support of our colleagues in the university of tehran where also field data collections were conducted by their efforts appendix a appendix b 
11059,improving the accuracy of single crop coefficient kc for major crops at regional scales would significantly result in optimizing the consumption of agriculture water in this study a new approach is applied to generate kc curves from satellite images based on the priestley taylor equation the equation mainly consists of shortwave radiation and thermal terms therefore in order to meet the equation s requirements the landsat optical data was considered as the essential satellite based input of the approach yet thermal data was obtained from the modis imagery which was primarily downscaled using the tsharp algorithm to fit the 30 m spatial resolution of landsat therefore in this study the method is referred to as the multisensor data fusion for potential evapotranspiration calculation msdf et the kc trends were first evaluated for annual crops forage maize sugar beet wheat and barley in two different regions the qazvin and tehran karaj plains using field observation data of leaf area index lai the method was then applied to the major crops in 31 selected plains with three different climatic conditions in iran climatic conditions were categorized into cold north west region arid central region and warm and humid south west region eventually crop water requirements cwr in different regions were compared considering long term air temperature wind and relative humidity rh variations evaluation of the method in the qazvin and tehran karaj plains showed promising results the kc trend varied according to the lai and temperature variability crop growth duration and especially kc curves were successfully extracted using remotely sensed data in the studied areas cwr in the zone with higher values of air temperature notably in warm seasons was higher in comparison with other climatic zones also lengths of the growing seasons were shorter in conclusion surface and groundwater resources management would be improved as the result of taking satellite data into account for kc and subsequently cwr calculations keywords crop coefficient different climatic conditions landsat modis msdf et method 1 introduction coping with water scarcity has been always a big challenge in arid and semi arid climates in many countries such as iran in addition to poor quality of water used in agriculture the continuous decrease of surface and groundwater level has raised political cultural socio economic concerns agriculture is the largest water user in iran therefore broadening our knowledge on the amount of water required for agriculture sector would be essential in better management of water resources the magnitude of water evapotranspired can be determined through manifold of measurement techniques including lysimeters bowen ratio eddy covariance water balance scintillometry sap flow and remote sensing allen et al 2011 yet conducting such field experiments are costly and time consuming hence allen et al 1998 in no 56 of journal series of food and agriculture organization fao 56 proposed a simplified method for estimation of crop water requirements cwr under optimum conditions of soil and water without any salinity stress diseases and pests etc however in this study we refer to it as potential evapotranspiration etp by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 and single crop coefficient kc 1 et p k c et 0 kc values change along the growing season of a crop with regard to fluctuations in vegetation cover and are representative of crop growth curve according to fao 56 the curve is built by making use of parameters such as crop growth duration table 11 in fao 56 and three values of initial crop coefficient kc ini middle crop coefficient kc mid and terminal crop coefficient kc end obtained from the table 12 of fao 56 designing efficient irrigation systems appropriate water allocation plans and also the proper use of the water balance equations are solely achieved using accurate estimations of kc curves because of its empirical nature utilization of fao 56 values are considered inaccurate in different climatic regions under different soil and water management and will eventually lead to unrealistic estimates of cwr jagtap and jones 1989 neale et al 1990 allen et al 1998 mentioned that these values are to be used as general guide and more accurate ones must be extracted considering field surveys or by the means of remote sensing kc calculation based on satellite data can be categorized into two main approaches 1 spectral vegetation indices svis and 2 energy balance equation previous efforts in different regions of the world showed linear and almost linear relationships between vegetative surface leaf area index lai and canopy cover cc and satellite based svis gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 nguy robertson and gitelson 2015 mokhtari et al 2018a the conditions of vegetation cover directly affect the amount of radiation reflected from surface and consequently result in svis variations but in addition to lai and cc etp is influenced by several environmental and meteorological parameters therefore calculating kc merely from svis would cause errors mokhtari et al 2018b crop variables physical soil characteristics soil moisture content and weather conditions exert uncertainties on svi based kc values choudhury et al 1994 hence all being said kc curves can be ameliorated by taking advantage of satellite imagery associated with energy balance equation and meteorological data for one thing optical thermal satellite imagery provide us with nothing but energy reflected or emitted from the surface on the other hand priestley and taylor 1972 developed an equation a derivative of the penman monteith equation based merely on energy absorbed by the surface parodi and gabriel 2002 calculated etp using satellite images in ahas algorithm ahas derived etp is based on the priestley taylor equation mokhtari et al 2018b found that the energy balance equation for kc calculation could result in more realistic values satellite based energy balance equations have also proved to be useful in actual evapotranspiration eta estimation against measured data bastiaanssen et al 1998 pioneered the calculation of eta using net energy flux over vegetation cover obtained from satellite images sebal algorithm satellite based eta was evaluated against lysimeter data in several previous studies and presented as a practical approach on a large scale paul et al 2013 bansouleh et al 2015 jaber et al 2016 lian and huang 2016 barker et al 2017 generally widely examination of previous studies kc calculation based on energy balance equation has been barely paid attention to let alone its use in different climatic conditions all methods of energy balance equation require hourly meteorological measurements which many regions in developing countries suffer from the dearth of such data therefore the average of satellite based nighttime and daytime land surface temperatures lsts as the 24 hour lst sun and kafatos 2007 used in radiation calculation can be of great help in direct estimation of etp many satellite imagery including noaa and modis are provided with such data with low spatial resolution however lst sharpening is required prior to taking into practice the combination of coarse lst and images with higher spatial resolution such as landsat series lst has shown a promising relationship with svis therefore kustas et al 2003 presented the tsharp algorithm for the purpose of downscaling modis lst 1000 m to landsat spatial resolution 30 m and proved to be accurate in agricultural areas agam et al 2007a validating kc directly one would face myriad of difficulties yet we know that kc has a strong relationship with crop parameters such as lai and cc heilman et al 1982 moran et al 1995 accordingly čereković et al 2010 presented an equation based on this relationship for kc calculation as a function of lai sumner and jacobs 2005 also found that the vegetation coefficients are a simple function of lai kc is also relatively dependent on wind speed relative humidity and temperature differences in disparate climatic regions allen et al 1998 which can also be taken into consideration the main objective of this study was to investigate the application of a remote sensing based method for improving kc curves in 31 selected plains in iran under three different climatic conditions first the method was validated in two research farms in the qazvin and karaj tehran plains and then after the determination of sowing and harvesting dates the method was applied on major crops in the climatic zones the method was based on etp from the priestley taylor equation and et0 from the penman monteith equation etp was obtained using the landsat 7 etm and 8 oli imagery combined with modis thermal data and meteorological data as input which in this research we refer to the method as the multi sensor data fusion for evapotranspiration calculation msdf et also we modified the tsharp algorithm in order to better achieve daily high resolution thermal data from modis images the resulting kc curves were compared against the lai and temperature variations in the end differences in cwr were discussed considering the different climatic conditions and previously reported values 2 materials and methods mokhtari et al 2018b thoroughly evaluated four different methods of kc calculation including the priestley taylor referred to as the msdf et approach in this study fao 56 svi based and data assimilation into agro hydrological model approaches in which the msdf et approach showed more promising results thus the data fusion part was modified and then the method taken into account in this study for kc calculation of major crops in iran the kc calculation had been conducted for winter wheat in the qazvin plain hence in this study in addition to winter wheat in the qazvin plain we took temperature fluctuations and the measured lai of forage maize sugar beet wheat and barley into account for investigating the goodness of the trends of kc in the hezar jolfa agro industry company in the qazvin plain and the research farms of the university of tehran in the tehran karaj plain afterwards kc curves from the msdf et approach were calculated for major crops in different climatic conditions in order to discuss the discrepancies with regard to the changes in meteorological parameters then cwrs were estimated and compared with the previous data reported under the iran s program on providing national water agenda 2 1 field data measurements 2 1 1 the hezar jolfa agro industry company the qazvin plain the region includes the qazvin irrigation network the hezar jolfa agro industry company lies within the eastern part of the qazvin irrigation network with latitude of 36 8 n and longitude of 50 11 e the climate is arid agricultural planning economic and rural development research institute aperdri and the average annual rainfall is 100 mm long term meteorological data the company is located in abyek county it is limited to the east by the hezar jolfa village to the south by the abdol abad village to the west by the magsal agro industry company and it is 10 km south of the city of mohammadiye the company consists of 5 center pivot cp 1 to cp 5 and a few classic irrigation systems fig 1 b the crop rotation comprised of wheat barley and canola in winter and maize and sugar beet in spring long term meteorological data were obtained from the magsal station 500 m to the east of the company situated at 36 9 n and 50 10 12 e data collection was conducted in 2012 growing season in forage maize and sugar beet fields forage maize was planted in cp 5 with 15 days delay compared to the forage maize in cp 2 and sugar beet was planted on 7th of april 2012 in the western side of cp 4 cp 2 cp 4 and cp 5 are respectively about 40 40 and 30 hectares which consist of a decent number of landsat pixels 30 m yet was small for 1000 meter pixel size of the modis lst the harvesting dates for all the crops were similar table 1 field data included lai which had been destructively collected for every 7 to 14 days table 1 particular attention was paid for choosing a location for data sampling with a decent distance from the edge of the fields after each field survey the samples were transferred to laboratory under the standard conditions leaves were detached and the surface area was measured using deltat device uk jonckheere et al 2004 then eventually lai was calculated by the division of the leaf surface area to the plot surface area the growing season was during 2012 when landsat 8 had not been launched therefore landsat 7 etm was the only possible option in this region the time series of images with the path of 165 and the row of 35 was chosen those pixels under cloud and slc off scan line corrector failure of the sensor data conditions were set aside from the image processing procedure then kc curves were simulated by using the validated landsat 7 modis and meteorological datasets 2 1 2 university of tehran agriculture research farms the tehran karaj plain the tehran karaj plain is located in the north of iran fig 1c with arid climatic conditions aperdri and has 250 mm average annual rainfall long term meteorological data from the qazvin station predominant crops are wheat and barley in winter and maize in spring in this study the university of tehran agriculture research farms were chosen for data collection the surface area of the research farms was about 200 hectares and consists of 2 main 270 center pivot cp 1 and cp 2 with surface area of about 30 hectares each and a few classic the barley field irrigation systems data collection was done for wheat and barley for 17 sampling points which were randomly selected around the fields meteorological data were obtained from the synoptic station provided particularly for the research farms fig 1c the station was situated at 35 48 23 n and 50 57 12 e mean elevation of the research farms was 1305 above the sea level data sampling included lai measurements which had been done once a week during the wheat and barley growing seasons table 2 14 plots were allocated to wheat and 3 plots to barley the data collection was implemented by the means of a li cor lai 2200c device one data was read above the canopy along with several data under the canopy then lai was directly proposed by the device using the average values of the data readings under the canopy with respect to the above canopy value both wheat and barley growing seasons started from 6 november 2017 until 29 june 2018 landsat 8 164035 and 165035 scenes have overlap in this area therefore the intervals between the times of the image acquisitions were 7 and 9 days which is why more robust kc curves could be extracted from landsat 8 oli and modis imagery associated with long term meteorological data however in this period several images were ruled out inevitably because of many cloudy days 2 2 selection of plains iran has been divided into several plains and watersheds with regard to many hydrological features the center for water resources research tamab has partitioned the country into 609 plains in this study 31 plains across the country were selected based on firstly the accessibility of the meteorological and crop data and secondly because of the variations in climatic conditions the plains were categorized into three climatic zones including north west nw central c and south west sw fig 1a 1 the plains of nw zone had relatively cold climate with air temperature variability of 5 to 25 c and aridity index of 0 2 0 5 2 the climate in the c zone was arid with air temperature varying from 0 to 30 c and aridity index of 0 03 0 2 3 sw climate was warm and humid with high air temperature ranging from 10 to greater than 35 c and the aridity index of 0 03 0 2 14 plains were located in nw 7 in c and 10 in sw see table a1 in appendix a climatic information and maps and at least 10 year meteorological data were obtained from aperdri ministry of agriculture jihad the data from 33 synoptic stations were used fig 1a 2 2 1 crop calendar in this study the kc curves were calculated for 34 crops in 474 fields in 31 plains in iran first the location of the studied fields and crop combinations were determined by aperdri then abundant field surveys were conducted in order to fill out questionnaires and specify farm coordinates by using gps navigation devices satellite based kc must have been derived for the fields under approximately optimum conditions therefore irrigated farms were preferable mateos et al 2013 and mokhtari et al 2018b also chose irrigated fields for calculating crop coefficients all the fields properties were transferred to experts at iranian space agency isa landsat and modis imagery were downloaded and preprocessed prior to svi calculation svis time series from september 2014 until september 2015 were calculated for the pixel corresponding to the specified coordinates using landsat 7 etm and 8 oli also efforts were directed towards choosing fields located on the overlap of the landsat images calculated svis included normalized different vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 and soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 in addition to application of these indices in calculating crop parameters they can successfully distinguish the health of vegetation and the goodness of trends in crop growth during growing season hence unhealthy crops were excluded ndvi under low lai lai 1 conditions is more sensitive to green vegetation variations in comparison with other svis therefore the dates of crop germination and crop harvest can be determined using this index mokhtari et al 2018a in this study crop calendar was specified considering ndvi variability at low vegetation cover the point where the ndvi curve started to rise was assumed to be the date of crop germination in which green vegetation was becoming gradually visible a sufficient knowledge of crop management and methods of crop planting which differed for each crop in each region was necessary for determining planting date a week or a month before crop germination according to the crop type and management practices the time of harvest was determined as follows fig 2 1 as soon as ndvi curve plummeted to almost minimum for those crops which were harvested after senescing such as wheat and barley and continued with almost a constant value or 2 the time before ndvi curve reached its minimum for those crops which were harvested before complete senescing and kept on declining until it reached the minimum constant value in order to evaluate the accuracy of the remote sensing based planting and harvesting dates an opportunity came up to provide several questionnaires and distribute them among farmers in order to gather information about the real planting and harvesting dates thus the results were compared with those of the remote sensing 2 3 single crop coefficient calculation the algorithm for kc calculation was similar in all the regions and is depicted in fig 3 the main procedures of the approach were adopted from mokhtari et al 2018b in short potential evapotranspiration etp was estimated using the priestley taylor equation based on the combination of landsat imagery and modis thermal data yet in this study the fusion process was facilitated in order for the method to be more practical in vast areas then reference evapotranspiration et0 was from the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 in the end kc was calculated by dividing etp by et0 the reason behind choosing the fao penman monteith equation was that it is currently being widely used in the country for irrigation scheduling and water allocation plans therefore in order for the results to be taken into practice in the water agenda the fao penman monteith equation was selected and the calculation procedure was based completely on the meteorological data as for the aforementioned purposes 2 3 1 potential evapotranspiration calculation using the multisensor data fusion approach the msdf et method has been established on the basis of the priestley taylor equation for etp calculation the etp calculation procedure was implemented using landsat optical and modis thermal bands associated with meteorological data eqs 2 7 one of the biggest advantages of this equation is its applicability at regional scales shuttleworth 1993 2 et p φ δ δ γ r n daily rn daily is the daily net radiation

and p0 are the average atmosphere pressure in the study area kpa and the average atmosphere pressure at the sea level kpa kra is an empirical coefficient which was considered 0 17 for interior regions and 0 2 for coastal regions p varies with elevation above sea level and was calculated as suggested in allen et al 1998 therefore dem was utilized for this purpose rl and rl were obtained using the stefan boltzmann law which describes the radiance of an object in terms of its temperature eqs 6 and 7 6 r l ε a sb t a 4 7 r l ε 0 sb lst 4 where sb is the stefan boltzmann constant equal to 5 67 108 watt m 2 k4 ta is the air temperature from the closest meteorological station to the studied field k εa is the atmosphere emissivity and lst is the land surface temperature k obtained from satellite data r l was calculated using the method proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998 and daily average air temperature to obtain daily r l in order to achieve daily r l landsat thermal bands were of no help because the lst calculated from these bands are instantaneous therefore we took modis terra and aqua lst products into account for daily r l estimation mokhtari et al 2018b in addition to lst mod11a1 and myd11a1 products table 3 hold surface emissivity data hence in this study before sharpening these products to landsat spatial resolution outgoing longwave radiation was calculated using eq 7 the sharpening method was the same as tsharp kustas et al 2003 but the relationship between r l and savi was discussed and applied to all the regions more details can be found in section 3 4 2 4 datasets the protocol and types of data for making use of the satellite images was similar in all the regions table 3 first ndvi and savi time series were calculated by using landsat imagery landsat 8 took priority over landsat 7 but to fill the time gaps caused by cloudy pixels landsat 7 was used thermal characteristics of each pixel were determined using modis terra and aqua lst products then etp was calculated for the day of landsat acquisition which was led into kc time series kc curves were smoothed and linearly interpolated in order to obtain daily kc values 2 5 fao single crop coefficient kc curves from the fao approach was plotted considering the kc of initial middle and late season growth stages these quantities were taken from the table 12 of fao 56 then the lengths of four crop growth stages were specified using table 11 from fao 56 maximum kc values middle stage kc were modified by the means of wind speed and minimum rh for each region equation 62 of fao 56 and then the fao kc curves were obtained 3 results and discussion 3 1 the hezar jolfa agro industry company the qazvin plain 1 lai the lai curves of forage maize and sugar beet are shown against the kc curves derived from the fao and msdf et approaches fig 4 the leaves collected from the hezar jolfa agro industry company were the green parts of the crops so the resulted parameter was actually green lai in fact in forage maize and sugar beet where crops are harvested before the senescing total lai and green lai are the same for an entire growing season forage maize was planted in a warm season spring therefore the initial stage was relatively short about a month the planting date was 16 days earlier in cp 2 than cp 4 however both of them were harvested in a same day this short delay in the planting date concluded significant differences in lai curves in the mid and late season stages lai in early planted forage maize declined about 1 3 m2 m 2 in 10 days after the peak lai was reached both lai curves of early and late planted forage maize slightly declined at the late season stage due to stopping irrigation about 2 to 3 weeks before harvesting the concept behind the irrigation termination was to let soil dry out before harvest for the facilitation of agricultural machinery movements the lai data for the sugar beet initial stage was not obtained the peak lai took about a month to decline from 19 july 2012 to 26 august 2012 then harvesting was done after about three months before complete senescing of the crop 2 temperature air temperature is one of the most effective factors in cwr sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 investigated the impact of different parameters on the amount of evapotranspiration in 8 meteorological stations in different climatic conditions in iran they found that evapotranspiration had the highest sensitivity to air temperature in the qazvin plain the maximum air temperature occurred in mid july and the minimum was in mid january fig 5 both early and late planted forage maize were planted near the peak period of air temperature which is why the initial stage was short fig 4 it should be noted that both methods fao and msdf et properly distinguished the shortness caused by the temperature also the higher air temperature was the reason to the shorter duration of the growing seasons of the spring crops compared to the winter crop studied in mokhtari et al 2018b in the hezar jolfa agro industry company 3 kccurves the trends in satellite based kc variations were almost similar to that of fao for maize and sugar beet except that the kc values of the initial stage were relatively higher at the initial stage the major part of etp is comprised of evaporation allen et al 1998 indicated that kc in this stage is a function of evaporative power of the atmosphere et0 irrigation frequency and depth kc ini calculation required soil moisture and irrigation data these data are sorely collected at regional scales therefore the initial and terminal values of kc in the fao approach were inevitably limited to the values presented in table 12 of fao 56 however when etp is calculated using the priestley taylor equation in addition to the bands affected by vegetation cover thermal and shortwave infrared bands along with air temperature were used the higher kc values at the initial stage in forage maize and sugar beet compared to the fao approach were the results of the first heavy irrigation table 1 given that the first irrigation practices were performed during the warm season when the evaporative power of the atmosphere is relatively higher albedo and soil surface temperature decreased consequently shortwave radiation absorption increased and longwave radiation emitted from the ground was reduced accordingly msdf et derived etp rose up also higher values of kc in the initial stage might be partly caused by tillage or soil fertilization the middle stage was significantly shorter which due to the fact that it is the stage influencing the cwr the most it will eventually lead the cwr to a lower value compared with the conventional fao approach used for irrigation scheduling the kc end values were slightly lower in the satellite based curves it was caused because of the actual senescing detected by the satellite sensors affecting the satellite based kc to plummet below the fao curve comparing kc with lai the trends observed in kc curves fairly conform to the lai variability where lai started to rise about 15th and 30th of july in early and late planted maize the kc also rose the length of the middle stage was from late august until late september in both maize curves and early july until late august in sugar beet which were almost similar in both satellite based kc and field measured lai and had better results compared with fao curves 3 2 university of tehran agriculture research farms the tehran karaj plain 1 lai lai time series of wheat and barley of the agriculture research farms in the 2017 18 growing season were plotted against kc trends fig 6 these curves were the average of wheat and barley plots the peak lai of 5 28 table 2 occurred in only one plot but the average lai for the whole farm reached the maximum of 3 8 the reason for the low lai was the heavy snowfall which occurred during the pollination stage of the crops as reported by the agriculture research office the inclement weather also caused degradation in crop yield 2 temperature both crops were planted in the middle of autumn therefore there was time only for germination before entering the dormancy period which is why the initial stage was prolonged for about 4 months the low value of kc in the initial stage compared with the fao curves was caused by the low temperature of the late january the ground had also been covered by snow for 2 to 3 weeks which resulted in reduction of etp down to almost zero the decrease in etp led to the decrease in kc same results were obtained in mokhtari et al 2018b for winter wheat in the hezar jolfa agro industry company without snow condition so it appeared that the snow cover did not have significant influence on the kc curves and the low air temperature conditions might have had more dominant effect 3 kccurves the modeled curves from the msdf et approach varied with the changes in α and savi lai trends were almost the same in both crops except that barley had about a month longer initial stage due to the fact that the trends in α and savi are deeply dependent on lai trends the satellite based kc curves were in high compliance with the corresponding lai time series according to lai variability the fao curves were unrealistic for example the mid season stage of barley started in the middle of winter when crop was actually in the dormancy period and the situation continued until the middle of spring also when the lai curve was at its peak the fao curve was declining the trends in fao curve of wheat were much closer to the real world variations of vegetation cover except that the middle stage was a month longer than the satellite based kc kc possesses a strong relationship with variations in vegetative surface and relatively proportional to temperature fluctuations allen et al 2011 therefore according to the results obtained in this study using optical bands of oli and etm sensors and taking advantage of thermal radiation of electromagnetic spectrum concluded more logical kc curves in addition the environmental parameters in the model were used and enhanced the results taking the remote sensing data into practice for crop growth modeling and evapotranspiration calculation at regional scales would significantly extend our knowledge in how crop growth curves vary with the changes in environmental parameters 3 3 crop calendar the questionnaires were distributed among the farmers of 39 fields in the razan qahavand naqade sojas mahneshan angooran zanjan khooy ardebil and moqan pars abad plains for 15 crops including winter and spring wheat sugar beet rice melon heather tomato bean sunflower zucchini barley potato pea black cumin and cotton 1 evaluation of crop growth duration from ndvi time series planting and harvesting dates were presented by local farmers in the studied area in the iranian calendar these dates were converted into the english calendar and a list has been drawn up against satellite based planting and harvesting dates see table b1 in appendix b the results showed that 26 of the planting dates and 27 of the harvesting dates coincided with the intervals presented by farmers 68 percent of the data other dates were not so distant from the questionnaires results 2 3 weeks differences these results were representative of a reliable crop calendar obtained from landsat images therefore the lengths of the growing seasons of the other crops in the other plains were determined as such urban et al 2018 found that the svi calculated using the modis optical sensor performed more consistently with moderate to good prediction for estimating planting dates compared with ku band backscattering of quickscat and solar induced fluorescence index from gome 2 in principle we take the view that the optical sensors can be taken into practice for estimating the planting dates with reliable accuracy 2 crop growth duration in the studied plains the length of the growing seasons cannot be easily determined by conducting local surveys at regional scales allen et al 1998 mentioned that table 11 of fao 56 is useful only as a general guide the values should be modified by field surveys or remote sensing to incorporate effects of plant variety climate and cultural practices according to the long term meteorological data obtained from the synoptic stations minimum maximum and average air temperatures were 15 34 38 04 and 11 86 c respectively for the nw zone 12 06 39 4 and 15 22 c for the c zone and 1 93 57 32 and 25 67 c for the sw zone even a subtle air temperature difference might be the fundamental factor for the various lengths of growing seasons table 4 plants grow faster under high air temperature conditions and reach the harvest time quickly the lengths of the growing seasons were the highest in nw followed by c and sw however some crops did not follow this general rule for example the crop growth duration of onion is reduced by the increase in air temperature in different climatic zones the reason was that there might be limited studied farms of onion to investigate in the three zones the sw zone was near the sea and also had lower latitude in comparison with nw and c therefore in addition to the extreme temperature conditions especially in warm months the lowest temperature did not fall below zero in cold months so practically winter crops would not experience dormancy this condition allowed farmers to cultivate most of the crops in both winter and spring even in particular cases crops were planted three times a year the previously reported lengths of the growing seasons were also laid out in table 4 most of which were different from that of the crop growth durations derived from the satellite data so the reported data can be superseded by the modified values 3 4 radiance emitted from the ground against spectral vegetation indices tsharp algorithm was proposed by kustas et al 2003 in their study lst was downscaled to the landsat spatial resolution using the relationship between lst and ndvi derived cc previous studies have shown more linearity between savi and vegetation cover choudhury et al 1994 badiyeneshin et al 2015 mokhtari et al 2018a therefore it can be concluded that savi would better demonstrate spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and subsequently apply it in lst calculation hence in this study the procedure of tsharp implementation was modified first savi was computed for each pixel using modis data second the savi images were aggregated by simple areal average to achieve pixel size of approximately 1000 m third there s a strong relationship between lst and r l eq 7 so given that the modis lst products also contain surface emissivity the emitted energy from the ground caused by temperature was calculated for each pixel fourth the relationship between r l and savi was discussed fig 7 fifth and the last errors in the least squares regression due to forces altering surface temperature other than vegetation intensity e g soil moisture were corrected estimating r l directly from the relationship between savi and outgoing radiance had the following benefits 1 calculation of surface emissivity from landsat images was not required 2 the errors caused by cc estimation from svis were removed r l was fairly correlated with savi variability fig 7 similar results were found in kustas et al 2003 agam et al 2007a and sun and kafatos 2007 between the ndvi and lst relationship sun and kafatos 2007 found that ndvi and lst were directly correlated in cold months positive slope of regression line and inversely correlated in warm months negative slope of regression line in this study results were similar except that r l was negatively correlated with savi in january under the sw zone conditions slope of the regression line was 54 84 the reason was the high temperature conditions in all the months of year in this region the r2 in the relationship between r l and savi was between 0 2 0 6 in the warm seasons and lower than 0 15 in the cold seasons according to agam et al 2007b the low values of r2 are stemmed from surface moisture variability and other non vegetative conditions maybe such as buildings and roads which is relatively suppressed through the reintroduction of the sharpening residuals in the tsharp procedure also we take the view that the low correlation in the cold seasons could be overlooked because the evapotranspiration is so low that does not significant effect on the outcome of the msdf et method 3 5 single crop coefficient curves satellite based single crop coefficient was calculated for all the crops using the msdf et approach due to numerous modeled curves only two of each winter and spring crops including winter wheat and barley and spring maize and potato were selected fig 8 these crops had been commonly cultivated in all the climatic zones so that the comparisons could be made it was noted that the selected curves were fairly representative of the whole regions the winter crops wheat and barley in the nw zone had considerably longer lengths of growing seasons cold period occurred from mid autumn until mid winter so the lengthened dormancy period was the distinct characteristic of this zone therefore winter crops were planted in the first half of the autumn in order to find the opportunity to germinate before dormancy while winter crops under sw and in some cases in c were planted in winter the dramatic declination in the sw curves occurred due to the fact that crops in this region had the opportunity to completely grow and then face the low temperatures of winter however never entered the dormancy because the cold period was too short so the curves started to increase quickly another reason could be the air temperature of about 15 c in winter under sw climatic conditions fig 9 this value of air temperature was not adequately low to cause crop dormancy the winter crops in c were planted in late autumn in order to find the opportunity to only germinate and then faced the short dormancy period the dormancy was so short that it could not be observed in the curve the lengths of the growing seasons were longer under nw and c conditions and shorter in sw compared to fao crop growth duration of potato and maize in sw and c were longer than nw the trends in satellite based kc curves were almost similar to fao except that the crop growth duration and initial and terminal values of kc were different the maximum values of kc in nw were lower than the other zones allen et al 1998 in fao 56 mentioned that the increase in rh and the decrease in wind speed reduce the maximum kc value both rh and wind speed were higher in nw hence according to kc variability of spring crops in the nw zone fig 8 relative humidity was more effective which caused reductions in kc max values satellite sensors were able to detect multiple harvests of crops such as alfalfa and apply it to kc curve fig 10 taking advantage of this method the average number of harvests can be determined in a region and accordingly propose kc curves overall according to air temperature and latitude discrepancies satellite based kc curves were in more compliance with the reality in addition to kc values the lengths of the growing seasons were actualized these improvements would result in more accurate cwr estimate which is the essential factor in irrigation system design water allocation to farmers and water balance calculations 3 6 crop water requirements the magnitude of irrigation water requirements is greatly affected by cwr and rainfall amount in this section cwr of studied crops were calculated by multiplication of et0 from fao penman monteith by satellite based kc etp and comparisons were made between the reported and satellite based values table 4 the etp values of spring crops were significantly higher under the sw zone conditions i e 754 2 mm in sw 681 8 mm in c and 630 4 mm in nw for spring maize and 684 2 mm in sw 450 5 mm in c and 544 mm in nw for spring tomato the main reason was the considerably higher air temperature and surface solar radiation the impact of these two meteorological parameters on et0 was greater in warm seasons of sw rather than the nw and c zones fig 9 therefore the values of etp in spring crops decreased with respect to the decrease in air temperature for sw c and nw rh was higher in warm seasons under nw which could be another reason for the decrease in etp kc max values were relatively lower in nw therefore it led to lower cwr in the peak period of crop growth opposite results were observed for winter crops winter crops had shorter growing seasons under sw table 4 they had been harvested before reaching the peak air temperature period so the maximum portion of the kc curves was in the early spring but winter crops in c and nw were harvested in early and mid summer where the peak air temperature period almost covered the peak kc period of winter crops on the other hand et0 in sw was only slightly higher in the cold seasons which subsequently had smaller effects on cwr also because of the shorter duration of the growing seasons cwr in sw was much lower compared with the nw and c zones cwr of black cumin canola and heather in nw turnip winter maize and winter vegetables in c and okra spring wheat vegetables winter maize winter potato and winter rice in sw had not been reported the sum of the cwr varied depending on the lengths of the growing seasons for example due to the longer growing period of spring wheat in nw 27 days longer cwr was higher compared with the reported values 715 2 mm derived from the satellite data against 681 mm in conclusion satellite based cwr varied irregularly with respect to the reported values 4 conclusions kc values offered by fao 56 cannot be relied on due to its empirical nature thus this research has been carried out for kc curves improvements regarding different climatic conditions kc curves were derived from satellite data based on the msdf et method the method was based on the energy balance equation for etp calculation the priestley taylor equation which is practically twofold first due to its use for the regional etp calculation and second incorporating the thermal data and albedo the resulting curves would conform better to the real world variations of crop and weather conditions studied regions were categorized into regions with and without field data due to the strong relationship between kc and lai the kc trends were discussed in the regions with field data using the lai time series as the result the kc curves showed good trends with respect to lai variability and also air temperature prior to applying the msdf et method on the selected plains ndvi which proved to be accurate regarding the field survey was used to determine the planting and harvesting dates of all crops in the 31 plains then kc curves of major crops were calculated in three selected climatic zones in iran climatic zones included cold nw arid c and warm and humid sw in the end cwr of each crop was calculated and compared with previously reported values the differences in air temperature relative humidity and wind speed caused different trends in kc curves and cwr values the lengths of the growing seasons were shorter and cwr were higher in sw notably for spring crops due to shorter crop growth duration and earlier harvesting dates in winter crops in sw cwr decreased compared to nw and c overall satellite data provide us a broader perspective of how crops grow considering prevailing climatic conditions so consequently irrigation scheduling would be improved and water resources better managed the bold dates coincide with the results obtained from the questionnaires acknowledgements calculation of kc curves for major crops in iran was a cooperative project between isa and aperdri the field surveys and selection were conducted by aperdri and the digital processing of satellite imagery was performed in isa the project was successfully implemented with the support of our colleagues in the university of tehran where also field data collections were conducted by their efforts appendix a appendix b
