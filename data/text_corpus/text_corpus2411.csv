12055,volcanic aquifers are sources of groundwater for both urban and rural areas their occurrence in geological formations and water quality are the main issues for sustainable utilisation dangila town and its surrounding area northwest ethiopia is assessed for hydrogeological framework and groundwater quality based on well and hydrochemical data the study showed that the area has a multi aquifer system an unconfined perched aquifer at shallow depth and semi confined and confined aquifers at greater depth in quaternary basalts the aquifer has five groundwater facies ca hco3 ca mg hco3 ca na hco3 na ca hco3 and na hco3 the ca hco3 groundwater types are dominant in the shallow unconfined aquifer system and the na ca hco3 and na hco3 types are dominant in deep aquifer systems mixing of waters from shallow and deep aquifer systems is minimal and possible only through interconnected fractures groundwater storage and flow is controlled by intensity and interconnection of fractures hydraulic conductivity is higher for fracture dominant aquifers than weathered rock aquifers the groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering and cation exchange groundwater quality assessment shows that water from both aquifer sources is potable based on sodium adsorption ratio sar and residual sodium carbonate rsc values all groundwater schemes are in the excellent quality class and can be used for irrigation without any problem however high na in borehole samples restrict the deep groundwater suitability for irrigation use without adjustment the combined results of the study are used to construct a hydrogeological conceptual model of volcanic aquifers which can be used to manage the groundwater resource for sustainable development this study would be helpful for water resources management in other similar geological settings keywords volcanic aquifer groundwater quality fractured rock ethiopia 1 introduction volcanic aquifers are vital and sometimes the only sources of groundwater in many regions of the world they are stored in volcanic rocks that are considered as minor in areal coverage of continental crust compared to other rock types the proportion of volcanic rocks exposed on continents totals only 6 8 8 of all the rock types of the earth blatt and jones 1975 meybeck 1987 suchet et al 2003 among these extrusive rocks 36 of the total is found between 0 and 30 n mainly in the deccan traps in india and in ethiopia suchet et al 2003 they occupy only 6 of the land area of sub saharan africa and are mostly confined to east africa macdonald et al 2008 in numerous countries all over the world including ethiopia groundwater is obtained from volcanic aquifers that are stored in the fractured and weathered parts of volcanic rocks groundwater provides more than 90 of the freshwater used for domestic and industrial supply in ethiopia kebede et al 2018 and is dominantly abstracted from volcanic aquifers its occurrence varies spatially owing to complexities of regional and local geology and associated geological structures since surface waters are becoming increasingly unreliable due to climate change and pollution understanding the groundwater system is essential previous research on volcanic aquifers focussed mainly on oceanic islands join et al 2005 prada et al 2005 pryet et al 2012 violette et al 2014 in contrast to islandic basaltic volcanism the predominant action of rifting and jointing generally generate more significant lithological variety giving rise to very high lateral and vertical variability of the structure and the hydrodynamic properties of aquifers there has been very little research on continental rift or faulted volcanic aquifers in ethiopia aberra 1990 ayenew et al 2008 vernier 1993 owing to the complexity of volcanic rocks the inadequacy of data and limited previous research the hydrogeology of the area is barely understood hydrogeological prospecting can be problematic in volcanic rocks especially in the rift and faulted volcanic areas and groundwater resources are not easily exploited several programs were conducted by different sectors to alleviate the scarcity of drinking water in dangila town and surrounding area over the past 44 years 1973 2017 spring developments drilling of shallow hand dug wells and deep boreholes of 58 209 m depth were among the leading programmes despite these programmes only a few 3 out of ten boreholes have groundwater yield of 18 30 l s while others have less than 3 5 l s and became dry or were abandoned after drilling there are reports of yield reduction of these boreholes over time and most of the springs and shallow wells have meagre groundwater yield 1l sec the significant dependency of the urban and rural population on groundwater as primary drinking water source and the recent increases in industrial and irrigation uses requires a better understanding of the groundwater system the exponential growth of the urban population and agricultural led industrial development policies of ethiopia attracts greater attention of researchers to groundwater as the potentially cost effective water supply source the country has implemented groundwater based irrigation projects utilizing more than 9000 boreholes 28 000 monitoring wells and 14 657 spring improvements and achieved 10 gdp growth during the last two decades mengistu et al 2019 the countrywide pilot scale irrigation practices are to be intensified soon and there are several small scale irrigation schemes in the study area despite this expansion of groundwater use for irrigation the suitability quality and future effects of the groundwater on agricultural soils are not well studied therefore this research aimed to assess the quality and suitability of the groundwater for irrigation the existing deep boreholes shallow wells and springs provide several information about the hydrogeological framework and groundwater quality of the area therefore the study aimed to fill the research gap concerning faulted or rifted volcanic aquifers using well information and hydrochemistry data the lack of integrated research in volcanic basaltic continental contexts justified the necessity of more in depth characterization of the hydrogeological functioning of the area thus the research aimed to develop a hydrogeological conceptual model of the structure and functioning of a volcanic aquifer system situated in a vast continental rifted context 1 1 general description of the study area the study area is located at dangila district known in ethiopia as a woreda in northwest ethiopia fig 1 physiographically the area is found at the southern part of lake tana basin dangila town and its surrounding areas have a mean annual rainfall of 1640 mm as measured since 1988 at the national meteorology agency nma weather station at dangila 91 of which falls from may to october walker et al 2019a the average annual precipitation across the whole country of ethiopia is 817 mm year fazzini et al 2015 the climate of the area is moist subtropical with a median annual daily maximum temperature of 25 c and minimum of 9 c as measured at the nma weather station in dangila walker et al 2016 the mean annual temperature of the country varies from over 25 c in the hot lowlands to less than 7 12 c in the high altitude plateau fao 2016 dangila woreda that contains the study area has an area of approximately 900 km2 and a population of around 160 000 of which 132 000 are rural and the remaining 28 000 dominantly reside within dangila town csa 2012 the elevation of the area ranges from 1933 to 2453 m with seasonally inundated large floodplains used as pasture and low hills comprising rain fed cultivation groundwater of the study area is used for drinking household industrial and small scale backyard agricultural purposes 1 2 geological setting two main types of volcanic rocks cover the region of lake tana basin with a considerable thickness they are defined by their age and are known as the tertiary or trap series and the quaternary or aden series mohr 1963 tertiary volcanic rocks trap series mainly cover the area surrounding lake tana and the quaternary volcanic rocks aden series comprise the area to the south of lake tana overlying the older tertiary volcanics the tertiary volcanic rocks of the basin are not exposed in the study area as they are covered by quaternary volcanics comprising basaltic lava flows scoria and their weathering products as regolith and clay soil the quaternary volcanics of the area are greater than 210 m in thickness as observed in borehole logs fig 2 and they provide outstanding groundwater reserves structurally the basin has experienced at least three phases of deformation the earliest recognizable deformation features ne sw trending regional gneissic foliation and schistosity followed by ne sw trending compressive stress producing micro folds having nw se trending axial trace the last and recent regional deformation event created low angle brittle fracture representing right lateral strike slip fault beshawered et al 2010 a study by sogreah and geomatrix 2013 grouped faults in the basin into four distinct sets of linear features trending in ne sw nw se n s and rarely e w directions these deformations interlinked with the timing of volcanic eruption events form a complex aquifer system at the study site 2 materials and method 2 1 rock samples and borehole lithology quaternary rock outcrop samples from two locations were analysed at the university of szeged mineralogy geochemistry and petrology laboratory for mineralogical composition and rock structure at microscopic scale standard rock sample thin sections were prepared and analysed using ore and raman microscopes lithological data of boreholes and shallow wells in the area were collected from borehole drilling companies to construct geological sections and support geological maps 2 2 water samples a total of 14 shallow well two deep borehole and four spring water samples were collected during the dry seasons february to april in 2015 and 2017 the samples were analysed for physical and chemical parameters in amhara water works design and supervision enterprise laboratory ethiopia physical and chemical parameters comprising ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds cations ca2 mg2 na k mn2 fe2 and anions cl so4 2 hco3 co3 2 no3 f and b were measured the portable multiparameter measuring instrument hanna hi 991301 was used in the field to measure ph ec and tds in the laboratory atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to measure cations palintest photometer 7100 employing the colorimetry method was used for anions and alternatively titration for carbonate and bicarbonate measurements physical and chemical data from five boreholes were collected from the borehole drilling companies the drilling companies collected three samples at the beginning middle and end of each pumping test during 24 48 and 72 h tests depending on the specification to assess hydrochemistry variations of near and distant aquifers the physical water parameters ph ec and tds were measured in both the field and the laboratory 2 3 pumping test step and constant rate pumping tests were conducted for boreholes at the end of drilling before well construction step tests consisted of four steps with each step having a duration of 1 2 h with ¼ to 1 l s times the expected yield of the boreholes subsequently the boreholes were tested for 24 48 or 72 h with constant yield depending on the specification pumping test data of four selected boreholes was analysed using the moench fracture flow model moench 1984 to estimate the aquifer hydraulic parameters it is not common practice to conduct tests following completion of drilling works of shallow wells in ethiopia therefore hydraulic parameters of 5 shallow wells in the area are inferred from previous research 2 4 hydrogeological conceptual model existing conceptual hydrogeological models of volcanic aquifers the hawaiian model mcdonald et al 1983 the canary islands model custodio 1989 and the mayotte model lachassagne et al 2014 were used as benchmarks to construct dangila area s hydrogeological conceptual model these islandic volcanic aquifer hydrogeological conceptual models do not resemble the rifted or faulted continental aquifers systems therefore a new model was developed that can consider the real situation of the area integrating our research by combining information from boreholes pumping tests hydrochemistry and other sources 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of quaternary volcanic aquifer reservoirs the occurrence of groundwater and consequently developing the groundwater resource primarily depends on the aquifer s current and historic properties together with rainfall and geomorphological factors the volcanic rocks extending from the surface to 210 m depth consist of quaternary basalt scoria scoriaceous basalt and their weathering products as soil and regolith the basalt locally varies laterally and with depth in both mineralogical composition degree of weathering fracturing the density of vesicles and the amount of secondary minerals that fill the vesicles the thickness and depth of these layers varies considerably across the boreholes in the area these variations showed that the area had experienced several periods of eruptions from different sources directions and timing it exposed the upper layer for surface weathering before being overlain by younger basaltic lava flows scoriaceous flows and scoria falls the boreholes rock and soil samples collected at 2 m intervals and occasionally every metre whenever lithology changes were observed comprised the following 75 5 vesicular to aphanitic basalt lava flows 7 scoriaceous basaltic lava flow 6 5 scoria falls 7 7 clay soil and regolith originating from both erosion and transport of volcanic rocks the alluvial sediment constitutes 1 6 ash with clay 7 7 sand 0 15 and pyroclastics 1 8 of the total collected and recorded samples fig 2 in all existing boreholes the upper bedrock below clay soil and regolith comprises basaltic lava flows followed by alternating rock layers in most cases the scoria and scoriaceous basalt are weathered and at some boreholes d3 and dtw4 are altered to clays the crystalline lava consists of hard dense basalt of light to dark grey colour basalt outcrops are vesicular and in some cases the vesicles are filled with secondary minerals fig 3 mainly calcite and occasional zeolite creating amygdaloidal texture due to hydrothermal activities the calcite filling is highly weathered on surface outcrops but is easily observable in the subsurface where the soil has been excavated for road construction fig 3c at some localities secondary minerals are not observed in the vesicles but in other places the vesicular basalts together with their secondary minerals filling the vesicles are observed up to 140 m depth in borehole lithologies fig 3d fractures occurring at the top and bottom of lava flows associated with paleosols and joints both provide groundwater flow pathways weathered zones in rocks can be suitable aquifers unless they are dominated by secondary clay products hencher and mcnicholl 1995 basalts are easily weathered compared to other crystalline silicate rocks suchet and probst 1993 though it depends on the cumulative effect of runoff and temperature white and blum 1995 the higher weathering fluxes associated with basalt due to its high intrinsic reactivity of basaltic mafic mineral assemblages desserta et al 2003 increase the porosity in the basalt weathering zone navarre sitchler et al 2015 which is observed in the upper soil and regolith layers the basalt is aphanitic though can be porphyritic consisting of olivine pyroxene and plagioclase porphyries according to walker s classification system based on petrology and texture of the rocks walker 1959 the basalt of the area is classed as two different petrographic types olivine basalt and porphyritic basalt similar quaternary basaltic volcanic rocks also cover significant areas in lake tana basin and the ethiopian rift they are essential groundwater sources for several million people living in rural and urban areas the highly vesicular and fractured permeable basalts are the most productive aquifer in the area thin section laboratory analysis of two rock samples showed that vesicles were not interconnected at microscopic scale and in some instances were filled by calcite which reduces the porosity and permeability of the rock fig 4 the dominant minerals in the rocks following analysis by thermo dxr raman spectroscope include forsterite mg2sio4 olivine augite and diopside pyroxene albite naalsi3o8 and anorthite ca al2si2o8 plagioclase minerals the augite and diopside minerals contain ca mg and fe and rarely aluminium too the vesicle filling mineral in the amygdales contained calcite caco3 and the opaque minerals comprise magnetite fe3o4 ilmenite fetio3 and hematite fe2o3 hematite fe2o3 is the most resistant mineral to weathering and might be the cause of the reddish colour of soil and regolith in the area this petrological thin section analysis is in agreement with previous works by wolde 1996 on olivine alkaline basalts and abate et al 1998 who suggested the more recent dek island and earlier gimjabet kosober alkali basalts are likely to be the result of fractional crystallisation of the same basaltic magma source quaternary volcanic events resulted in the eruption of basaltic magmas through local volcanoes and several well preserved eruption points are visible to the south of lake tana previous works by hofmann et al 1997 and abate et al 1998 related the origin to the afar plume and main ethiopian rift these quaternary basalt flows are characteristically alkaline and represent the final pulse of basaltic volcanism on the ethiopian plateau the quaternary basalt dated by prave et al 2016 from the blue nile river outlet of lake tana basin has a plateau age of 33 000 years 3 2 hydrochemistry groundwater geochemical properties depend on chemical constituents of rainfall and the various geochemical processes as water moves from recharge to discharge areas freeze and cherry 1979 matthess 1982 previous studies on ethiopian volcanic aquifer hydrochemistry by ayenew et al 2008 demlie et al 2007 kebede et al 2005 woldemariyam ayenew 2016 provide essential highlights on geochemical variation derived from different controlling mechanisms hydrochemical laboratory analysis of representative groundwater samples of the area from boreholes shallow wells and springs provided the groundwater physio chemical parameters shown in table 1 the ph values of deep aquifers varies from 6 83 to 8 81 with a mean value of 8 07 0 73 these values suggest that deep aquifers have neutral to weakly alkaline character the ph values of shallow wells and springs representing the shallow aquifer system vary from 5 37 to 6 88 with a mean value of 5 62 0 29 these values suggest that the shallow aquifer system has a character close to neutral in a few shallow wells and is weakly acidic in the remaining shallow wells and springs the ph values in the shallow aquifer system indicate that the upper unconfined aquifer is recharged from rain locally and did not travel long distances before discharge to the surface the increased ph value of deep aquifers is due to rock water interaction during groundwater flow or storage in the volcanic reservoirs tds and ec values support these characteristics of the groundwater of the area the groundwater of the area has very low salinity with tds values varing from 24 to 312 mg l the ec values vary from 40 to 480 μs cm with the smallest values in springs and highest in shallow wells and boreholes the lowest ec values in the springs and some shallow wells is due to recently recharged young groundwater of the upper unconfined aquifer the higher ec of boreholes and a few shallow wells imply that they have older groundwater and these few shallow wells possibly recharged from the greater depth older groundwater through factures considering all physical parameters of the groundwater ph tds and ec the lowest values are from springs and the highest are from shallow wells and boreholes the high values are due to increases in dissolution of ions in the aquifers with time and depth whereas low values in shallow aquifers imply young groundwater with low residence time the concentration of cations and anions varies from shallow depth to the deep aquifer system of the area the dominant cations in the borehole groundwater samples are in the order of na ca2 mg2 k whereas in the shallow wells and springs are ca2 mg2 na k the dominant anions in both shallow and deep aquifer system are in the order of hco3 cl so4 2 therefore the most abundant cation in the deep aquifer system is na whereas in shallow aquifers is ca 2 the groundwater system of the area both shallow and deep aquifers are mainly dominated by hco3 of all other anions the concentration of fluoride is less than 0 82 mg l unlike the groundwater of ethiopian rift volcanic rocks that cause health problems ashley and burley 1994 though the concentration of sulphate and nitrate is low in both aquifers system an increasing tendency to the shallow aquifer system is observed the low concentration of sulphate and nitrate indicates the little human impact on the groundwater but needs consideration in the future use of fertilizers that may affect the shallow aquifer system except for one shallow well with 12 5 mg l of cl all physical and chemical water parameters are within the drinking water limits of the world health organisation who 2011 making it suitable for human consumption without consideration of microbial water quality the high value of cl in the single shallow well is attributed to anthropogenic effects related to the well being located close to a village and being poorly constructed groundwater flows are accompanied by rock water interaction in the aquifer rock water interaction changes the hydrochemistry of the groundwater and leads to trends that provide essential information about the hydrogeochemical processes and evolution li et al 2014 piper diagrams piper 1944 are often used to determine the main composition and hydrochemical facies of groundwater the piper diagram fig 5 depicted five main types of water facies ca hco3 and ca mg hco3 in shallow aquifers and na ca hco3 ca na hco3 and na hco3 water facies in the deep aquifer system the influence of anthropogenic pollution on the shallow aquifer leads to having a ca hco3 cl and ca mg hco3 cl water facies in two shallow well water samples in a few borehole water samples the concentration of ca 2 mg 2 and na are significant leading to ca na mg hco3 water facies this type of water facies might be due to intermixing of shallow and deep aquifers where fractures connect them variations and similarities in chemical composition have a distinct location and intermixing of water from different sources the dominant water type in the shallow aquifer system is ca hco3 which is a typical water facies in shallow young groundwater the dominant water facies in a relatively deeper source borehole is na ca hco3 and na hco3 types though ca na hco3 water facies also can be seen the results of the hydrochemical analysis and groundwater facies are in agreement with the study by abiye and kebede 2011 on the upper blue nile basin a broader region that includes our study area their study showed that the majority of springs have a character of ca hco3 hydrochemical composition and low tds value however the mineralised springs have a character of na hco3 water facies 3 2 1 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry the chemistry of groundwater is affected by several factors including the original composition of recharge water or precipitation the reservoir rock mineralogical composition residence time in the reservoir rock and other characteristics of the groundwater flow path redwan and moneim 2015 groundwater composition controlling mechanism is assessed using the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 that relates the composition of water with its dominant sources the three distinct zones precipitation dominance evaporation dominance and rock weathering dominance have been defined and labelled in the gibbs diagram fig 6 the weight ratio of major cations na na ca 2 is drawn on the x axis and the variation in total salinity on the y axis similarly the weight ratio of major anions cl cl hco3 versus total dissolved salts drawn for anions in both cation and anion diagrams the sample locations are at the place where the rock weathering dominates as the controlling factor for the chemistry of groundwater though the dominant water chemistry controlling mechanism is rock weathering in some shallow wells and springs both rock weathering dominance and precipitation dominance is observed there are no samples plotted on the transition domain between the rock domain and evaporation domain suggesting the influence of evaporation on groundwater chemistry is minimal the relation between major ions could help to identify the change in the groundwater chemical compositions the origin of ions and hydrochemical processes involved in the evolution of groundwater wang et al 2013 the relationship between major cations and anions helps to identify which rock water interaction affects the major cation and anion concentration during groundwater flow and evolution the relationship between na to cl and ca 2 to hco3 is presented in fig 7 along the halite and calcite dissolution lines the majority of shallow wells and spring samples and all borehole samples plotted below and to the right of the halite dissolution line fig 7a this result showed that halite dissolution is not the source of either sodium or chlorine rather the weathering of rock forming silicate minerals and cation exchange possibly increased the concentration of na from the shallow to the deep aquifer system the low concentration of na in some shallow aquifer samples located above and left of the halite dissolution line may originate from the combined effect of recharge water and limited weathering of surface or unsaturated zone rocks a similar characteristic is the relationship between ca 2 and hco3 values of groundwater with respect to the calcite dissolution line fig 7b the groundwater concentrations for these ions are situated below and to the right of the calcite dissolution line that indicates the source of hco3 ion is not co3 2 that results from dissolution of calcite the relationship plot of hco3 and the sum effect of ca 2 and mg 2 ca 2 mg 2 showed a similar increase in bicarbonate values in groundwater from the shallow aquifer to the deep aquifer system fig 8 a the continuous increase of bicarbonate concentrations in the aquifer with residence times and depth suggests that the primary source of bicarbonate in volcanic aquifers is attributed to the existence of soil carbon dioxide interacting with water to form carbonic acid freeze and cherry 1979 kebede et al 2005 the low amount of na and relatively higher ca 2 and mg 2 in shallow aquifers is attributed to recharge water chemistry and limited rock water interaction the increasing amount of na but decreasing values of ca 2 with depth and residence times are due to cation exchange exchange of ca 2 and mg 2 by na and dissolution of na containing silicate minerals the trend towards increasing na content and decreasing ca 2 content along the flow path and with depth indicated cation exchange where ca 2 was absorbed onto clay minerals and na was released this release of na into the groundwater changed the chemical compositions of groundwater in deep aquifers to na dominant this result is supported by the relation of hco3 versus ca 2 mg 2 and na k cl versus ca 2 mg 2 hco3 so4 2 graphs fig 8a and b the plot of goundwater samples values on na k cl versus ca 2 mg 2 hco3 so4 2 graphs which is often used to study cation exchange in goundwater ahmed et al 2013 have a negative relation the negative correlation or slope of groundwater sample values is neither precisely on the line 1 1 with slope 1 nor very close to it that would show complete cation exchange had occurred fisher and mullican 1997 the plot indicates that even though there is cation exchange of major cations ca 2 and mg 2 by na the higher amount of na was released into the aquifer system from weathering of na containing silicate minerals the results showed that calcium and magnesium cations change from dominant to subordinate cations in relation to total cations with increasing depth and as groundwater flows away from sources of recharge generally groundwater associated with recharge in the shallow aquifers is represented by water dominant in calcium magnesium and bicarbonates with lesser amounts of sodium as groundwater flows away from the source of recharge the interaction between water and rock increases sodic lithologic units are encountered as the groundwater moves along a flow path and calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions attached to aquifer solids besides the sodium containing silicates weathering increases with depth and along flow paths so that both processes reactions result in a decrease in calcium magnesium and a corresponding increase in sodium and bicarbonate as groundwater flows away from the source of recharge this results in a water that evolves to a sodium bicarbonate type and sodium calcium bicarbonate types in between recharge and discharge areas it is possible to propose two distinct hydrochemical systems 1 a shallow localised perched system with little interaction with the deeper aquifer that is hydrodynamic with the atmosphere and generally less than 25 m deep in the shallow geochemical zone and 2 an underlying deeper probably regional and relatively chemically static system in the deep hydrochemical zone along fault and fracture lines 3 2 2 chemical weathering of rock forming minerals silicate rock forming mineral weathering is the main factor for the prevalence of cations ca 2 mg 2 na and k with a significant amount in groundwater srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 forsterite identified by laboratory analysis from rock outcrop samples dissolves with the presence of carbonic acid the dissolution results in magnesium ion silicic acid and dissolved bicarbonate as follows mg2sio4 4h2co3 2mg2 h4sio4 4hco3 pyroxene minerals diopside camgsi2o6 and augite camgfe mgfe si2o6 dissolve to produce either ca mg fe bicarbonate ion and silicic acid diopside dissolution is given by camg si2o6 2h2o 4h2co3 ca mg 2 2h4sio4 4hco3 plagioclase feldspar minerals albite naalsi3o8 and anorthite caal2si2o8 undergo hydrolysis during reaction with water to give cations clay mineral kaolinite silica and hydroxide as follows 4naalsi3o8 4h2co3 2h2o al4si4o10 oh 8 4na 4hco3 8sio2 for albite and 2caal2si2o8 4h2co3 2h2o 2al2si2o5 oh 4 2ca 2 4hco3 for anorthite the minor opaque mineral hematite can further react with water as fe2o3 h2o 2feo oh goethite but hematite and goethite are both very insoluble in water and they remain as residual minerals of iron oxides that give many soils their reddish colour chemical weathering of silicate minerals produces insoluble clay minerals positively charged metal ions ca2 mg2 na negatively charged ions oh hco3 and some soluble silica the presence of these ions in soil and water causes variations in groundwater chemistry 3 2 3 water quality for irrigation the trend of using groundwater for small scale irrigation at small backyard agricultural land is expanding because of its simplicity and ease of management the aptness of groundwater for agricultural use depends mainly on the mineralogical contents of the water in soil and plants salts in groundwater can change soil structure permeability and aerations which in turn affect plant development the sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na and residual sodium carbonate rsc are the commonly employed parameters to assess the suitability of water for irrigation purposes sar has been the benchmark measure of probable sodium hazard for irrigation water by united states salinity laboratory staff 1954 it is the relative concentration ratio of na ions to ca 2 and mg 2 ions in irrigation water which is used to estimate the potential accumulation of na in soil due to regular use of sodic water for irrigation the relationship between sar in irrigation water and the extent to which the soils adsorb sodium helps to decide the suitability of water for irrigation when high sodium and low calcium water is used for irrigation the cation exchange complex may become saturated with sodium which can damage the soil structure due to the distribution of clay particles singh 2002 it will reduce water movement and aeration in soils and will affect the growth of plants and reduce crop yield the deficiency of ca 2 and mg 2 may arise due to the high accumulation of na which means the evaluation of sodic water hazard is essential sar is determined using the equation given below suarez et al 2006 1 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 where na ca 2 and mg 2 are in meq l sar values ranged from 0 004 to 3 28 with a mean varying from the value of 0 087 0 079 to 1 69 1 00 respective to the three groundwater schemes in the study table 2 the plot of electrical conductivity μs cm versus sar on the us regional laboratory staff salinity diagram 1954 illustrates that most of the groundwater samples of boreholes belong to the categories c2s1 which is medium salinity and low sodium fig 9 the shallow well samples belong to both c2s1 and c1s1 low salinity and low sodium whereas the samples from springs belong to c1s1 categories all samples from the three groundwater schemes fall in low sodium class s1 with sar values 10 which shows that no alkali hazard is anticipated to crops shrinking and swelling of clay soil particles can occur if the amount of sar in the irrigation water is greater than 6 9 saleh et al 1999 the c2s1 and c1s1 categories of water with low to medium salinity and low sodium water imply the groundwater can be used for irrigation on all types of soil without any danger of exchangeable sodium na is considered as a parameter for determination of water suitability for irrigation wilcox 1948 the reaction of na with a weak acid co3 2 results in alkaline soil whereas na reacts with strong acids cl resulting in saline soils both alkaline and saline soils retard plant growth todd 1980 because high concentration of na in irrigation water will remove ca 2 and mg 2 ions through a base exchange reaction in clay soil particles the exchange of ca 2 and mg 2 by na will reduce water and air movement and the soils will become hard during the dry season saleh et al 1999 na is calculated using the formula 2 na na ca 2 mg 2 na k x 100 where na ca 2 mg 2 and k are in meq l the na of groundwater samples from boreholes ranged from 20 35 to 76 26 with mean of 46 47 22 30 samples from shallow wells ranged from 0 27 to 18 54 with mean of 6 90 5 97 and samples from springs ranged from 0 335 to 16 642 with mean of 6 639 7 29 table 2 irrigation water is classified based on na as excellent 20 good 20 40 permissible 40 60 doubtful 60 80 and unsuitable 80 the na values indicate that the groundwater from springs and shallow wells are excellent whereas from boreholes range from good to doubtful categories using groundwater from boreholes that can yield a high amount of water for irrigation without any adjustment may result in the high concentration of na that leads to a reduction in permeability and internal drainage of the soil excess amount of rsc which results from the sum of carbonate and bicarbonate also affects the suitability of groundwater for irrigation use rsc is calculated as follows based on the united states salinity laboratory staff 1954 3 rsc hco 3 co 3 2 ca 2 mg 2 where hco3 co3 2 ca 2 and mg 2 are in meq l rsc values range from 0 61 to 1 18 with mean of 0 89 0 20 for the boreholes from 0 229 to 0 451 with mean of 0 052 0 242 for the shallow wells and from 0 27 to 0 014 with mean of 0 102 0 120 for spring samples table 2 based on the rsc value ranges the united states salinity laboratory staff 1954 classified irrigation waters into three categories rsc values 1 5 probably safe 1 5 to 2 5 marginal and 2 5 not suitable for irrigation use the rsc values of all the samples from the three groundwater schemes have less than 1 25 and are considered suitable for irrigation moreover the rsc values in boreholes denote that na existence in the soils is possible whereas the negative values in shallow wells and spring samples denote that the concentration of ca2 and mg2 is in excess the different classification of water for irrigation use based on the three water quality indicators is summerised in table 3 the groundwater of the area is in a good quality but can be vulnerable to contamination the sustainability of the groundwater for irrigation use from the shallow weathered volcanic aquifer during the dry season is problematic the distribution of the shallow wells in farmlands increases their exposure to anthropogenic contamination 3 3 aquifer properties 3 3 1 shallow aquifer the clay soil and regolith being at high altitude are always under the influence of rainfall temperature variation and erosion precipitation in the area seeps through the soil and recharges the upper perched aquifer rock fragments consisting of well rounded quaternary vesicular basalt usually highly weathered are both resting on the soil surface and partly embedded in the top layer walker et al 2019b have estimated recharge of this shallow aquifer at 280 430 mm year or 17 26 of mean annual precipitation the shallow hand dug wells that abstract groundwater from the upper unconfined aquifer are 98 productive the maximum water yield of a given shallow well is usually less than 1 l s and even lower for wells which did not encounter shallow fractured basalt below the regolith springs are both topographic and fractured controlled in depressions through faults or fractures and emerge from the upper unconfined perched aquifer with usually less than 1 l s yield investigations by walker 2016 on unconfined upper soil and regolith aquifer of five wells in the same study area calculated mean hydraulic conductivity values of 2 3 m d in the dry season and 9 7 m d in the wet season when saturated thickness was greater and more transmissive layers were intercepted the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer is low and has slow recovery after abstraction groundwater discharges via springs streams or in some cases via wetlands from the unconfined upper perched aquifer the perched aquifer has high interaction with rainfall and rivers a time series of rainfall and river stage measurements collected within the study area locally called dangesheta kebele by walker et al 2019a showed that the rivers are very flashy with sharp peaks in river stage quickly following rainfall events the groundwater levels from shallow wells follow a similar pattern of seasonal variation and fluctuation the fractured zone below the soil and regolith profoundly affects the hydraulic properties shallow depth aquifers lack of fractured zones causes a gradual decline of groundwater levels during the dry season and their presence below the regolith rapidly increases the amount of water in the shallow wells during the rainy season 3 3 2 deep aquifer there are varying degrees of weathered and fractured quaternary basalt scoriaceous basalt and scoria fall in the confined and semi confined deep aquifers the most productive boreholes consist of more fractured layers generally the boreholes have multi aquifers of various thicknesses with alternating layers unlike the upper unconfined soil and regolith aquifer which is recharged from rainfall the deeper volcanic aquifers are recharged from the upper unconfined shallow aquifer through fractures and faults the deeper faults fractures are expected to serve as conduits to the lower aquifers hydraulic conductivity and borehole yields are high for boreholes that penetrate the deeper fracture zones the depth of water strikes varies between boreholes in addition to the aquifer type which makes it challenging to confirm different pressure heads in the productive borehole dtw1 that yields 24 5 l s groundwater the primary fracture zone with enormous quantities of water is detected at a shallower depth the water bearing zone of the borehole dtw2 that yields 3 5 l s groundwater is situated at greater depth than in dtw1 and the water is mainly contained in weathered and fractured vesicular and scoriaceous basalts the most productive borehole of the area dtw3 that yields 30 l s groundwater has fractured zones at shallow depth and highly weathered scoria layers at greater depth in general the water bearing geological formations indicate that the potential of the aquifers increases where the basalt provides fracture zones and weathered scoria layers these fracture zones may be aquifers in their own right or link several water bearing layers of scoria and scoriaceous beds they may also link weathered basalts basaltic fractures and vesicles related to lava cooling when fractures connect the water bearing porous layers these locations will be ideal for drilling boreholes the hydraulic conductivity k of the deeper confined and semi confined aquifers are estimated using data gathered during borehole pumping tests the k values are calculated for three productive boreholes dtw1 dtw3 dtw4 and a nonfunctional borehole dtw2 using moench fracture flow model moench 1984 and the values are given in table 4 the hydraulic conductivity of the boreholes dominated by fractures is higher and during pumping tests the recovery of these boreholes was fast the complex volcanic rock setting of the area influenced by weathering and deformational processes cause it to be intricate for groundwater exploration and sustainable management the results of quaternary basaltic magma eruption through different eruption centres different lava flow directions and timing exposure to surface weathering as well as deformational activities causes the quaternary basalt scoriaceous basalt and scoria to vary laterally and with depth these lead to a multi aquifer system with several alternating aquifer layers that communicate with fractures and fault lines or make discontinuous and heterogeneous aquifer system the infilling of secondary minerals calcite and zeolite in vesicular basalts cause reduction of porosity but weathering and fracturing lead to an increase in porosity and permeability of the reservoir rocks 3 4 hydrogeological conceptual model the findings of this study showed that neither of the available islandic volcanic aquifer conceptual model nor the previous large scale conceptual groundwater flow model of ethiopian volcanic aquifers could be adapted without modification for the study area since there is no continuous basal aquifer the two most commonly employed hydrogeological conceptual models for volcanic aquifers of basaltic islands the hawaiian model mcdonald et al 1983 having a low lying basal aquifer linked to inland dyke impounded and perched aquifers and the canary islands model custodio 1989 having a continuous basal aquifer cannot be employed the perched aquifer of the hawaiian model has some similarity to the upper perched aquifer of our model the upper unconfined perched aquifer in the soil regolith and occasionally in the upper fractured basalt has a resemblance to the mayotte model lachassagne et al 2014 the mayotte hydrogeological conceptual model for complex multiphase partly eroded and subsided basaltic islands describes the main hydrogeological structures as superimposed palaeovalleys filled with various types of volcanic products its discontinuous and perched aquifer lacking a continuous basal aquifer resembles the dangila area model fig 10 though there are similarities the mayotte model cannot be adapted because 1 mayotte model has several discontinuous perched aquifers with depth but dangila model has a single upper unsaturated soil and regolith aquifer 2 in the mayotte model groundwater flows through low permeability volcanic rocks and discharges as springs when the perched aquifer intersects the surface in the dangila model flow is highly controlled by fractures faults and the deeper aquifers found at depths extending up to 210 m below the surface is recharged from the upper unconfined aquifer through fractures the permeability of the lower aquifers are not low due to the presence of weathered and fractured quaternary basalt scoriaceous rocks and scoria but their interconnection depends on the nature and density of fracture lines the layers may have fractures to store and transmit groundwater but need another high aperture fracture to be connected to other shallower or deeper weathered and fractured layers the dangila model does not resemble the groundwater flow model of the tana basin fenta et al 2016 due to its fracture dissected flow systems the conceptual model is in agreement with the shallow aquifer conceptual model of the area by walker et al 2019a who also noted the lack of interaction between shallow and deep groundwater the model will have a considerable advantage in exploration and management of groundwater from volcanic aquifers of complex geological setting affected by the fault fracture or rifting it can be transferred to an area with a similar geological setting for groundwater exploration with great emphasise to fracture networks 3 4 1 sustainable groundwater management of dangila town and surrounding area population growth establishment of new settlements agricultural expansion application of fertilizer and pesticides increased attention of freshwater bottling companies and decreasing groundwater yields of wells all point to a need for better monitoring and sustainable management of groundwater groundwater quality and hydrogeological framework studies will assist the water sector to sustainably manage groundwater as the only available freshwater of the area the sustainable management for rural development is dependant on research results to enable wise utilisation of the diverse geological setting of volcanic aquifers the common utilisation of groundwater in the study area and throughout ethiopia has traditionally been through the use of hand dug shallow wells and springs drilling of deep wells requires a tremendous amount of budget and insufficient study will cause a lot of budgets to be spent ineffectively the deep drilling and pumping technology in the country since the 1970s has enabled groundwater exploitation and human settlement to be extended in response to the increasing population though the sanitation risk of the shallow groundwater is still questionable the intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides for agriculture affects surface water the ethiopian government is currently implementing countrywide irrigation projects using groundwater mengistu et al 2019 and the results of this study could be used for sustainable development in the area moreover the results of the study showed that the groundwater of dangila town and its surrounding area is good quality for drinking and industrial use while needing few adjustments on the deep groundwater for irrigation due to na that will lead to sodicity of the soil the use of irrigation water from springs and shallow wells is appropriate concerning quality but yield is meagre and cannot be used for more than small scale backyard agriculture the future management of groundwater for sustainable development in the area should focus on modelling of structural groundwater flow and anthropogenic pollution due to locations of shallow wells in agricultural land traditional practices to manage groundwater based on observation and previous data alone will lead to loss of time and budget and overexploitation of groundwater from a single source or scheme will lead to reduction of groundwater yield over time furthermore for sustainable groundwater use and management in the area the focus should be to understand the flow system locate appropriate drilling sites evaluate anthropogenic pollution and the sodicity effects of soil due to sodium 4 conclusions the approach of analysing and interpreting various data sets helped to understand the hydrogeological framework and groundwater quality of the area the results of the study showed that the volcanic aquifer systems of the area comprise a multi aquifer system with alternating groundwater bearing layers a perched unconfined aquifer in the upper soils and regolith overlies confined and semi confined aquifers in the weathered and fractured rocks fractures with high hydraulic conductivity principally control both groundwater storage and flow and the presence of weathered scoria is paramount chemically and physically the groundwater is of good quality for both drinking and irrigation use except na from deep boreholes that can result in sodic soils if implemented without any adjustment the groundwater of the area is mainly ca hco3 type in the shallow aquifer and ca na hco3 na ca hco3 and na hco3 types in deep aquifers rock water interactions involving silicate weathering cation exchange and carbonation are the main hydrochemical processes that control the major composition of the groundwater a hydrogeological conceptual model affected by structures and representing a dissected groundwater flow system was developed using information from various data sets for future sustainable groundwater management acknowledgement the authors would like to thank dangila woreda water bureau of ethiopia for their information about the status of shallow hand dug wells and spring data we are also grateful to amhara water works design and supervision enterprise for their support in providing borehole data lastly the first author would like to thank the hungarian government for the study scholarship support 
12055,volcanic aquifers are sources of groundwater for both urban and rural areas their occurrence in geological formations and water quality are the main issues for sustainable utilisation dangila town and its surrounding area northwest ethiopia is assessed for hydrogeological framework and groundwater quality based on well and hydrochemical data the study showed that the area has a multi aquifer system an unconfined perched aquifer at shallow depth and semi confined and confined aquifers at greater depth in quaternary basalts the aquifer has five groundwater facies ca hco3 ca mg hco3 ca na hco3 na ca hco3 and na hco3 the ca hco3 groundwater types are dominant in the shallow unconfined aquifer system and the na ca hco3 and na hco3 types are dominant in deep aquifer systems mixing of waters from shallow and deep aquifer systems is minimal and possible only through interconnected fractures groundwater storage and flow is controlled by intensity and interconnection of fractures hydraulic conductivity is higher for fracture dominant aquifers than weathered rock aquifers the groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering and cation exchange groundwater quality assessment shows that water from both aquifer sources is potable based on sodium adsorption ratio sar and residual sodium carbonate rsc values all groundwater schemes are in the excellent quality class and can be used for irrigation without any problem however high na in borehole samples restrict the deep groundwater suitability for irrigation use without adjustment the combined results of the study are used to construct a hydrogeological conceptual model of volcanic aquifers which can be used to manage the groundwater resource for sustainable development this study would be helpful for water resources management in other similar geological settings keywords volcanic aquifer groundwater quality fractured rock ethiopia 1 introduction volcanic aquifers are vital and sometimes the only sources of groundwater in many regions of the world they are stored in volcanic rocks that are considered as minor in areal coverage of continental crust compared to other rock types the proportion of volcanic rocks exposed on continents totals only 6 8 8 of all the rock types of the earth blatt and jones 1975 meybeck 1987 suchet et al 2003 among these extrusive rocks 36 of the total is found between 0 and 30 n mainly in the deccan traps in india and in ethiopia suchet et al 2003 they occupy only 6 of the land area of sub saharan africa and are mostly confined to east africa macdonald et al 2008 in numerous countries all over the world including ethiopia groundwater is obtained from volcanic aquifers that are stored in the fractured and weathered parts of volcanic rocks groundwater provides more than 90 of the freshwater used for domestic and industrial supply in ethiopia kebede et al 2018 and is dominantly abstracted from volcanic aquifers its occurrence varies spatially owing to complexities of regional and local geology and associated geological structures since surface waters are becoming increasingly unreliable due to climate change and pollution understanding the groundwater system is essential previous research on volcanic aquifers focussed mainly on oceanic islands join et al 2005 prada et al 2005 pryet et al 2012 violette et al 2014 in contrast to islandic basaltic volcanism the predominant action of rifting and jointing generally generate more significant lithological variety giving rise to very high lateral and vertical variability of the structure and the hydrodynamic properties of aquifers there has been very little research on continental rift or faulted volcanic aquifers in ethiopia aberra 1990 ayenew et al 2008 vernier 1993 owing to the complexity of volcanic rocks the inadequacy of data and limited previous research the hydrogeology of the area is barely understood hydrogeological prospecting can be problematic in volcanic rocks especially in the rift and faulted volcanic areas and groundwater resources are not easily exploited several programs were conducted by different sectors to alleviate the scarcity of drinking water in dangila town and surrounding area over the past 44 years 1973 2017 spring developments drilling of shallow hand dug wells and deep boreholes of 58 209 m depth were among the leading programmes despite these programmes only a few 3 out of ten boreholes have groundwater yield of 18 30 l s while others have less than 3 5 l s and became dry or were abandoned after drilling there are reports of yield reduction of these boreholes over time and most of the springs and shallow wells have meagre groundwater yield 1l sec the significant dependency of the urban and rural population on groundwater as primary drinking water source and the recent increases in industrial and irrigation uses requires a better understanding of the groundwater system the exponential growth of the urban population and agricultural led industrial development policies of ethiopia attracts greater attention of researchers to groundwater as the potentially cost effective water supply source the country has implemented groundwater based irrigation projects utilizing more than 9000 boreholes 28 000 monitoring wells and 14 657 spring improvements and achieved 10 gdp growth during the last two decades mengistu et al 2019 the countrywide pilot scale irrigation practices are to be intensified soon and there are several small scale irrigation schemes in the study area despite this expansion of groundwater use for irrigation the suitability quality and future effects of the groundwater on agricultural soils are not well studied therefore this research aimed to assess the quality and suitability of the groundwater for irrigation the existing deep boreholes shallow wells and springs provide several information about the hydrogeological framework and groundwater quality of the area therefore the study aimed to fill the research gap concerning faulted or rifted volcanic aquifers using well information and hydrochemistry data the lack of integrated research in volcanic basaltic continental contexts justified the necessity of more in depth characterization of the hydrogeological functioning of the area thus the research aimed to develop a hydrogeological conceptual model of the structure and functioning of a volcanic aquifer system situated in a vast continental rifted context 1 1 general description of the study area the study area is located at dangila district known in ethiopia as a woreda in northwest ethiopia fig 1 physiographically the area is found at the southern part of lake tana basin dangila town and its surrounding areas have a mean annual rainfall of 1640 mm as measured since 1988 at the national meteorology agency nma weather station at dangila 91 of which falls from may to october walker et al 2019a the average annual precipitation across the whole country of ethiopia is 817 mm year fazzini et al 2015 the climate of the area is moist subtropical with a median annual daily maximum temperature of 25 c and minimum of 9 c as measured at the nma weather station in dangila walker et al 2016 the mean annual temperature of the country varies from over 25 c in the hot lowlands to less than 7 12 c in the high altitude plateau fao 2016 dangila woreda that contains the study area has an area of approximately 900 km2 and a population of around 160 000 of which 132 000 are rural and the remaining 28 000 dominantly reside within dangila town csa 2012 the elevation of the area ranges from 1933 to 2453 m with seasonally inundated large floodplains used as pasture and low hills comprising rain fed cultivation groundwater of the study area is used for drinking household industrial and small scale backyard agricultural purposes 1 2 geological setting two main types of volcanic rocks cover the region of lake tana basin with a considerable thickness they are defined by their age and are known as the tertiary or trap series and the quaternary or aden series mohr 1963 tertiary volcanic rocks trap series mainly cover the area surrounding lake tana and the quaternary volcanic rocks aden series comprise the area to the south of lake tana overlying the older tertiary volcanics the tertiary volcanic rocks of the basin are not exposed in the study area as they are covered by quaternary volcanics comprising basaltic lava flows scoria and their weathering products as regolith and clay soil the quaternary volcanics of the area are greater than 210 m in thickness as observed in borehole logs fig 2 and they provide outstanding groundwater reserves structurally the basin has experienced at least three phases of deformation the earliest recognizable deformation features ne sw trending regional gneissic foliation and schistosity followed by ne sw trending compressive stress producing micro folds having nw se trending axial trace the last and recent regional deformation event created low angle brittle fracture representing right lateral strike slip fault beshawered et al 2010 a study by sogreah and geomatrix 2013 grouped faults in the basin into four distinct sets of linear features trending in ne sw nw se n s and rarely e w directions these deformations interlinked with the timing of volcanic eruption events form a complex aquifer system at the study site 2 materials and method 2 1 rock samples and borehole lithology quaternary rock outcrop samples from two locations were analysed at the university of szeged mineralogy geochemistry and petrology laboratory for mineralogical composition and rock structure at microscopic scale standard rock sample thin sections were prepared and analysed using ore and raman microscopes lithological data of boreholes and shallow wells in the area were collected from borehole drilling companies to construct geological sections and support geological maps 2 2 water samples a total of 14 shallow well two deep borehole and four spring water samples were collected during the dry seasons february to april in 2015 and 2017 the samples were analysed for physical and chemical parameters in amhara water works design and supervision enterprise laboratory ethiopia physical and chemical parameters comprising ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds cations ca2 mg2 na k mn2 fe2 and anions cl so4 2 hco3 co3 2 no3 f and b were measured the portable multiparameter measuring instrument hanna hi 991301 was used in the field to measure ph ec and tds in the laboratory atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to measure cations palintest photometer 7100 employing the colorimetry method was used for anions and alternatively titration for carbonate and bicarbonate measurements physical and chemical data from five boreholes were collected from the borehole drilling companies the drilling companies collected three samples at the beginning middle and end of each pumping test during 24 48 and 72 h tests depending on the specification to assess hydrochemistry variations of near and distant aquifers the physical water parameters ph ec and tds were measured in both the field and the laboratory 2 3 pumping test step and constant rate pumping tests were conducted for boreholes at the end of drilling before well construction step tests consisted of four steps with each step having a duration of 1 2 h with ¼ to 1 l s times the expected yield of the boreholes subsequently the boreholes were tested for 24 48 or 72 h with constant yield depending on the specification pumping test data of four selected boreholes was analysed using the moench fracture flow model moench 1984 to estimate the aquifer hydraulic parameters it is not common practice to conduct tests following completion of drilling works of shallow wells in ethiopia therefore hydraulic parameters of 5 shallow wells in the area are inferred from previous research 2 4 hydrogeological conceptual model existing conceptual hydrogeological models of volcanic aquifers the hawaiian model mcdonald et al 1983 the canary islands model custodio 1989 and the mayotte model lachassagne et al 2014 were used as benchmarks to construct dangila area s hydrogeological conceptual model these islandic volcanic aquifer hydrogeological conceptual models do not resemble the rifted or faulted continental aquifers systems therefore a new model was developed that can consider the real situation of the area integrating our research by combining information from boreholes pumping tests hydrochemistry and other sources 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of quaternary volcanic aquifer reservoirs the occurrence of groundwater and consequently developing the groundwater resource primarily depends on the aquifer s current and historic properties together with rainfall and geomorphological factors the volcanic rocks extending from the surface to 210 m depth consist of quaternary basalt scoria scoriaceous basalt and their weathering products as soil and regolith the basalt locally varies laterally and with depth in both mineralogical composition degree of weathering fracturing the density of vesicles and the amount of secondary minerals that fill the vesicles the thickness and depth of these layers varies considerably across the boreholes in the area these variations showed that the area had experienced several periods of eruptions from different sources directions and timing it exposed the upper layer for surface weathering before being overlain by younger basaltic lava flows scoriaceous flows and scoria falls the boreholes rock and soil samples collected at 2 m intervals and occasionally every metre whenever lithology changes were observed comprised the following 75 5 vesicular to aphanitic basalt lava flows 7 scoriaceous basaltic lava flow 6 5 scoria falls 7 7 clay soil and regolith originating from both erosion and transport of volcanic rocks the alluvial sediment constitutes 1 6 ash with clay 7 7 sand 0 15 and pyroclastics 1 8 of the total collected and recorded samples fig 2 in all existing boreholes the upper bedrock below clay soil and regolith comprises basaltic lava flows followed by alternating rock layers in most cases the scoria and scoriaceous basalt are weathered and at some boreholes d3 and dtw4 are altered to clays the crystalline lava consists of hard dense basalt of light to dark grey colour basalt outcrops are vesicular and in some cases the vesicles are filled with secondary minerals fig 3 mainly calcite and occasional zeolite creating amygdaloidal texture due to hydrothermal activities the calcite filling is highly weathered on surface outcrops but is easily observable in the subsurface where the soil has been excavated for road construction fig 3c at some localities secondary minerals are not observed in the vesicles but in other places the vesicular basalts together with their secondary minerals filling the vesicles are observed up to 140 m depth in borehole lithologies fig 3d fractures occurring at the top and bottom of lava flows associated with paleosols and joints both provide groundwater flow pathways weathered zones in rocks can be suitable aquifers unless they are dominated by secondary clay products hencher and mcnicholl 1995 basalts are easily weathered compared to other crystalline silicate rocks suchet and probst 1993 though it depends on the cumulative effect of runoff and temperature white and blum 1995 the higher weathering fluxes associated with basalt due to its high intrinsic reactivity of basaltic mafic mineral assemblages desserta et al 2003 increase the porosity in the basalt weathering zone navarre sitchler et al 2015 which is observed in the upper soil and regolith layers the basalt is aphanitic though can be porphyritic consisting of olivine pyroxene and plagioclase porphyries according to walker s classification system based on petrology and texture of the rocks walker 1959 the basalt of the area is classed as two different petrographic types olivine basalt and porphyritic basalt similar quaternary basaltic volcanic rocks also cover significant areas in lake tana basin and the ethiopian rift they are essential groundwater sources for several million people living in rural and urban areas the highly vesicular and fractured permeable basalts are the most productive aquifer in the area thin section laboratory analysis of two rock samples showed that vesicles were not interconnected at microscopic scale and in some instances were filled by calcite which reduces the porosity and permeability of the rock fig 4 the dominant minerals in the rocks following analysis by thermo dxr raman spectroscope include forsterite mg2sio4 olivine augite and diopside pyroxene albite naalsi3o8 and anorthite ca al2si2o8 plagioclase minerals the augite and diopside minerals contain ca mg and fe and rarely aluminium too the vesicle filling mineral in the amygdales contained calcite caco3 and the opaque minerals comprise magnetite fe3o4 ilmenite fetio3 and hematite fe2o3 hematite fe2o3 is the most resistant mineral to weathering and might be the cause of the reddish colour of soil and regolith in the area this petrological thin section analysis is in agreement with previous works by wolde 1996 on olivine alkaline basalts and abate et al 1998 who suggested the more recent dek island and earlier gimjabet kosober alkali basalts are likely to be the result of fractional crystallisation of the same basaltic magma source quaternary volcanic events resulted in the eruption of basaltic magmas through local volcanoes and several well preserved eruption points are visible to the south of lake tana previous works by hofmann et al 1997 and abate et al 1998 related the origin to the afar plume and main ethiopian rift these quaternary basalt flows are characteristically alkaline and represent the final pulse of basaltic volcanism on the ethiopian plateau the quaternary basalt dated by prave et al 2016 from the blue nile river outlet of lake tana basin has a plateau age of 33 000 years 3 2 hydrochemistry groundwater geochemical properties depend on chemical constituents of rainfall and the various geochemical processes as water moves from recharge to discharge areas freeze and cherry 1979 matthess 1982 previous studies on ethiopian volcanic aquifer hydrochemistry by ayenew et al 2008 demlie et al 2007 kebede et al 2005 woldemariyam ayenew 2016 provide essential highlights on geochemical variation derived from different controlling mechanisms hydrochemical laboratory analysis of representative groundwater samples of the area from boreholes shallow wells and springs provided the groundwater physio chemical parameters shown in table 1 the ph values of deep aquifers varies from 6 83 to 8 81 with a mean value of 8 07 0 73 these values suggest that deep aquifers have neutral to weakly alkaline character the ph values of shallow wells and springs representing the shallow aquifer system vary from 5 37 to 6 88 with a mean value of 5 62 0 29 these values suggest that the shallow aquifer system has a character close to neutral in a few shallow wells and is weakly acidic in the remaining shallow wells and springs the ph values in the shallow aquifer system indicate that the upper unconfined aquifer is recharged from rain locally and did not travel long distances before discharge to the surface the increased ph value of deep aquifers is due to rock water interaction during groundwater flow or storage in the volcanic reservoirs tds and ec values support these characteristics of the groundwater of the area the groundwater of the area has very low salinity with tds values varing from 24 to 312 mg l the ec values vary from 40 to 480 μs cm with the smallest values in springs and highest in shallow wells and boreholes the lowest ec values in the springs and some shallow wells is due to recently recharged young groundwater of the upper unconfined aquifer the higher ec of boreholes and a few shallow wells imply that they have older groundwater and these few shallow wells possibly recharged from the greater depth older groundwater through factures considering all physical parameters of the groundwater ph tds and ec the lowest values are from springs and the highest are from shallow wells and boreholes the high values are due to increases in dissolution of ions in the aquifers with time and depth whereas low values in shallow aquifers imply young groundwater with low residence time the concentration of cations and anions varies from shallow depth to the deep aquifer system of the area the dominant cations in the borehole groundwater samples are in the order of na ca2 mg2 k whereas in the shallow wells and springs are ca2 mg2 na k the dominant anions in both shallow and deep aquifer system are in the order of hco3 cl so4 2 therefore the most abundant cation in the deep aquifer system is na whereas in shallow aquifers is ca 2 the groundwater system of the area both shallow and deep aquifers are mainly dominated by hco3 of all other anions the concentration of fluoride is less than 0 82 mg l unlike the groundwater of ethiopian rift volcanic rocks that cause health problems ashley and burley 1994 though the concentration of sulphate and nitrate is low in both aquifers system an increasing tendency to the shallow aquifer system is observed the low concentration of sulphate and nitrate indicates the little human impact on the groundwater but needs consideration in the future use of fertilizers that may affect the shallow aquifer system except for one shallow well with 12 5 mg l of cl all physical and chemical water parameters are within the drinking water limits of the world health organisation who 2011 making it suitable for human consumption without consideration of microbial water quality the high value of cl in the single shallow well is attributed to anthropogenic effects related to the well being located close to a village and being poorly constructed groundwater flows are accompanied by rock water interaction in the aquifer rock water interaction changes the hydrochemistry of the groundwater and leads to trends that provide essential information about the hydrogeochemical processes and evolution li et al 2014 piper diagrams piper 1944 are often used to determine the main composition and hydrochemical facies of groundwater the piper diagram fig 5 depicted five main types of water facies ca hco3 and ca mg hco3 in shallow aquifers and na ca hco3 ca na hco3 and na hco3 water facies in the deep aquifer system the influence of anthropogenic pollution on the shallow aquifer leads to having a ca hco3 cl and ca mg hco3 cl water facies in two shallow well water samples in a few borehole water samples the concentration of ca 2 mg 2 and na are significant leading to ca na mg hco3 water facies this type of water facies might be due to intermixing of shallow and deep aquifers where fractures connect them variations and similarities in chemical composition have a distinct location and intermixing of water from different sources the dominant water type in the shallow aquifer system is ca hco3 which is a typical water facies in shallow young groundwater the dominant water facies in a relatively deeper source borehole is na ca hco3 and na hco3 types though ca na hco3 water facies also can be seen the results of the hydrochemical analysis and groundwater facies are in agreement with the study by abiye and kebede 2011 on the upper blue nile basin a broader region that includes our study area their study showed that the majority of springs have a character of ca hco3 hydrochemical composition and low tds value however the mineralised springs have a character of na hco3 water facies 3 2 1 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry the chemistry of groundwater is affected by several factors including the original composition of recharge water or precipitation the reservoir rock mineralogical composition residence time in the reservoir rock and other characteristics of the groundwater flow path redwan and moneim 2015 groundwater composition controlling mechanism is assessed using the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 that relates the composition of water with its dominant sources the three distinct zones precipitation dominance evaporation dominance and rock weathering dominance have been defined and labelled in the gibbs diagram fig 6 the weight ratio of major cations na na ca 2 is drawn on the x axis and the variation in total salinity on the y axis similarly the weight ratio of major anions cl cl hco3 versus total dissolved salts drawn for anions in both cation and anion diagrams the sample locations are at the place where the rock weathering dominates as the controlling factor for the chemistry of groundwater though the dominant water chemistry controlling mechanism is rock weathering in some shallow wells and springs both rock weathering dominance and precipitation dominance is observed there are no samples plotted on the transition domain between the rock domain and evaporation domain suggesting the influence of evaporation on groundwater chemistry is minimal the relation between major ions could help to identify the change in the groundwater chemical compositions the origin of ions and hydrochemical processes involved in the evolution of groundwater wang et al 2013 the relationship between major cations and anions helps to identify which rock water interaction affects the major cation and anion concentration during groundwater flow and evolution the relationship between na to cl and ca 2 to hco3 is presented in fig 7 along the halite and calcite dissolution lines the majority of shallow wells and spring samples and all borehole samples plotted below and to the right of the halite dissolution line fig 7a this result showed that halite dissolution is not the source of either sodium or chlorine rather the weathering of rock forming silicate minerals and cation exchange possibly increased the concentration of na from the shallow to the deep aquifer system the low concentration of na in some shallow aquifer samples located above and left of the halite dissolution line may originate from the combined effect of recharge water and limited weathering of surface or unsaturated zone rocks a similar characteristic is the relationship between ca 2 and hco3 values of groundwater with respect to the calcite dissolution line fig 7b the groundwater concentrations for these ions are situated below and to the right of the calcite dissolution line that indicates the source of hco3 ion is not co3 2 that results from dissolution of calcite the relationship plot of hco3 and the sum effect of ca 2 and mg 2 ca 2 mg 2 showed a similar increase in bicarbonate values in groundwater from the shallow aquifer to the deep aquifer system fig 8 a the continuous increase of bicarbonate concentrations in the aquifer with residence times and depth suggests that the primary source of bicarbonate in volcanic aquifers is attributed to the existence of soil carbon dioxide interacting with water to form carbonic acid freeze and cherry 1979 kebede et al 2005 the low amount of na and relatively higher ca 2 and mg 2 in shallow aquifers is attributed to recharge water chemistry and limited rock water interaction the increasing amount of na but decreasing values of ca 2 with depth and residence times are due to cation exchange exchange of ca 2 and mg 2 by na and dissolution of na containing silicate minerals the trend towards increasing na content and decreasing ca 2 content along the flow path and with depth indicated cation exchange where ca 2 was absorbed onto clay minerals and na was released this release of na into the groundwater changed the chemical compositions of groundwater in deep aquifers to na dominant this result is supported by the relation of hco3 versus ca 2 mg 2 and na k cl versus ca 2 mg 2 hco3 so4 2 graphs fig 8a and b the plot of goundwater samples values on na k cl versus ca 2 mg 2 hco3 so4 2 graphs which is often used to study cation exchange in goundwater ahmed et al 2013 have a negative relation the negative correlation or slope of groundwater sample values is neither precisely on the line 1 1 with slope 1 nor very close to it that would show complete cation exchange had occurred fisher and mullican 1997 the plot indicates that even though there is cation exchange of major cations ca 2 and mg 2 by na the higher amount of na was released into the aquifer system from weathering of na containing silicate minerals the results showed that calcium and magnesium cations change from dominant to subordinate cations in relation to total cations with increasing depth and as groundwater flows away from sources of recharge generally groundwater associated with recharge in the shallow aquifers is represented by water dominant in calcium magnesium and bicarbonates with lesser amounts of sodium as groundwater flows away from the source of recharge the interaction between water and rock increases sodic lithologic units are encountered as the groundwater moves along a flow path and calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions attached to aquifer solids besides the sodium containing silicates weathering increases with depth and along flow paths so that both processes reactions result in a decrease in calcium magnesium and a corresponding increase in sodium and bicarbonate as groundwater flows away from the source of recharge this results in a water that evolves to a sodium bicarbonate type and sodium calcium bicarbonate types in between recharge and discharge areas it is possible to propose two distinct hydrochemical systems 1 a shallow localised perched system with little interaction with the deeper aquifer that is hydrodynamic with the atmosphere and generally less than 25 m deep in the shallow geochemical zone and 2 an underlying deeper probably regional and relatively chemically static system in the deep hydrochemical zone along fault and fracture lines 3 2 2 chemical weathering of rock forming minerals silicate rock forming mineral weathering is the main factor for the prevalence of cations ca 2 mg 2 na and k with a significant amount in groundwater srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 forsterite identified by laboratory analysis from rock outcrop samples dissolves with the presence of carbonic acid the dissolution results in magnesium ion silicic acid and dissolved bicarbonate as follows mg2sio4 4h2co3 2mg2 h4sio4 4hco3 pyroxene minerals diopside camgsi2o6 and augite camgfe mgfe si2o6 dissolve to produce either ca mg fe bicarbonate ion and silicic acid diopside dissolution is given by camg si2o6 2h2o 4h2co3 ca mg 2 2h4sio4 4hco3 plagioclase feldspar minerals albite naalsi3o8 and anorthite caal2si2o8 undergo hydrolysis during reaction with water to give cations clay mineral kaolinite silica and hydroxide as follows 4naalsi3o8 4h2co3 2h2o al4si4o10 oh 8 4na 4hco3 8sio2 for albite and 2caal2si2o8 4h2co3 2h2o 2al2si2o5 oh 4 2ca 2 4hco3 for anorthite the minor opaque mineral hematite can further react with water as fe2o3 h2o 2feo oh goethite but hematite and goethite are both very insoluble in water and they remain as residual minerals of iron oxides that give many soils their reddish colour chemical weathering of silicate minerals produces insoluble clay minerals positively charged metal ions ca2 mg2 na negatively charged ions oh hco3 and some soluble silica the presence of these ions in soil and water causes variations in groundwater chemistry 3 2 3 water quality for irrigation the trend of using groundwater for small scale irrigation at small backyard agricultural land is expanding because of its simplicity and ease of management the aptness of groundwater for agricultural use depends mainly on the mineralogical contents of the water in soil and plants salts in groundwater can change soil structure permeability and aerations which in turn affect plant development the sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage na and residual sodium carbonate rsc are the commonly employed parameters to assess the suitability of water for irrigation purposes sar has been the benchmark measure of probable sodium hazard for irrigation water by united states salinity laboratory staff 1954 it is the relative concentration ratio of na ions to ca 2 and mg 2 ions in irrigation water which is used to estimate the potential accumulation of na in soil due to regular use of sodic water for irrigation the relationship between sar in irrigation water and the extent to which the soils adsorb sodium helps to decide the suitability of water for irrigation when high sodium and low calcium water is used for irrigation the cation exchange complex may become saturated with sodium which can damage the soil structure due to the distribution of clay particles singh 2002 it will reduce water movement and aeration in soils and will affect the growth of plants and reduce crop yield the deficiency of ca 2 and mg 2 may arise due to the high accumulation of na which means the evaluation of sodic water hazard is essential sar is determined using the equation given below suarez et al 2006 1 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 where na ca 2 and mg 2 are in meq l sar values ranged from 0 004 to 3 28 with a mean varying from the value of 0 087 0 079 to 1 69 1 00 respective to the three groundwater schemes in the study table 2 the plot of electrical conductivity μs cm versus sar on the us regional laboratory staff salinity diagram 1954 illustrates that most of the groundwater samples of boreholes belong to the categories c2s1 which is medium salinity and low sodium fig 9 the shallow well samples belong to both c2s1 and c1s1 low salinity and low sodium whereas the samples from springs belong to c1s1 categories all samples from the three groundwater schemes fall in low sodium class s1 with sar values 10 which shows that no alkali hazard is anticipated to crops shrinking and swelling of clay soil particles can occur if the amount of sar in the irrigation water is greater than 6 9 saleh et al 1999 the c2s1 and c1s1 categories of water with low to medium salinity and low sodium water imply the groundwater can be used for irrigation on all types of soil without any danger of exchangeable sodium na is considered as a parameter for determination of water suitability for irrigation wilcox 1948 the reaction of na with a weak acid co3 2 results in alkaline soil whereas na reacts with strong acids cl resulting in saline soils both alkaline and saline soils retard plant growth todd 1980 because high concentration of na in irrigation water will remove ca 2 and mg 2 ions through a base exchange reaction in clay soil particles the exchange of ca 2 and mg 2 by na will reduce water and air movement and the soils will become hard during the dry season saleh et al 1999 na is calculated using the formula 2 na na ca 2 mg 2 na k x 100 where na ca 2 mg 2 and k are in meq l the na of groundwater samples from boreholes ranged from 20 35 to 76 26 with mean of 46 47 22 30 samples from shallow wells ranged from 0 27 to 18 54 with mean of 6 90 5 97 and samples from springs ranged from 0 335 to 16 642 with mean of 6 639 7 29 table 2 irrigation water is classified based on na as excellent 20 good 20 40 permissible 40 60 doubtful 60 80 and unsuitable 80 the na values indicate that the groundwater from springs and shallow wells are excellent whereas from boreholes range from good to doubtful categories using groundwater from boreholes that can yield a high amount of water for irrigation without any adjustment may result in the high concentration of na that leads to a reduction in permeability and internal drainage of the soil excess amount of rsc which results from the sum of carbonate and bicarbonate also affects the suitability of groundwater for irrigation use rsc is calculated as follows based on the united states salinity laboratory staff 1954 3 rsc hco 3 co 3 2 ca 2 mg 2 where hco3 co3 2 ca 2 and mg 2 are in meq l rsc values range from 0 61 to 1 18 with mean of 0 89 0 20 for the boreholes from 0 229 to 0 451 with mean of 0 052 0 242 for the shallow wells and from 0 27 to 0 014 with mean of 0 102 0 120 for spring samples table 2 based on the rsc value ranges the united states salinity laboratory staff 1954 classified irrigation waters into three categories rsc values 1 5 probably safe 1 5 to 2 5 marginal and 2 5 not suitable for irrigation use the rsc values of all the samples from the three groundwater schemes have less than 1 25 and are considered suitable for irrigation moreover the rsc values in boreholes denote that na existence in the soils is possible whereas the negative values in shallow wells and spring samples denote that the concentration of ca2 and mg2 is in excess the different classification of water for irrigation use based on the three water quality indicators is summerised in table 3 the groundwater of the area is in a good quality but can be vulnerable to contamination the sustainability of the groundwater for irrigation use from the shallow weathered volcanic aquifer during the dry season is problematic the distribution of the shallow wells in farmlands increases their exposure to anthropogenic contamination 3 3 aquifer properties 3 3 1 shallow aquifer the clay soil and regolith being at high altitude are always under the influence of rainfall temperature variation and erosion precipitation in the area seeps through the soil and recharges the upper perched aquifer rock fragments consisting of well rounded quaternary vesicular basalt usually highly weathered are both resting on the soil surface and partly embedded in the top layer walker et al 2019b have estimated recharge of this shallow aquifer at 280 430 mm year or 17 26 of mean annual precipitation the shallow hand dug wells that abstract groundwater from the upper unconfined aquifer are 98 productive the maximum water yield of a given shallow well is usually less than 1 l s and even lower for wells which did not encounter shallow fractured basalt below the regolith springs are both topographic and fractured controlled in depressions through faults or fractures and emerge from the upper unconfined perched aquifer with usually less than 1 l s yield investigations by walker 2016 on unconfined upper soil and regolith aquifer of five wells in the same study area calculated mean hydraulic conductivity values of 2 3 m d in the dry season and 9 7 m d in the wet season when saturated thickness was greater and more transmissive layers were intercepted the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer is low and has slow recovery after abstraction groundwater discharges via springs streams or in some cases via wetlands from the unconfined upper perched aquifer the perched aquifer has high interaction with rainfall and rivers a time series of rainfall and river stage measurements collected within the study area locally called dangesheta kebele by walker et al 2019a showed that the rivers are very flashy with sharp peaks in river stage quickly following rainfall events the groundwater levels from shallow wells follow a similar pattern of seasonal variation and fluctuation the fractured zone below the soil and regolith profoundly affects the hydraulic properties shallow depth aquifers lack of fractured zones causes a gradual decline of groundwater levels during the dry season and their presence below the regolith rapidly increases the amount of water in the shallow wells during the rainy season 3 3 2 deep aquifer there are varying degrees of weathered and fractured quaternary basalt scoriaceous basalt and scoria fall in the confined and semi confined deep aquifers the most productive boreholes consist of more fractured layers generally the boreholes have multi aquifers of various thicknesses with alternating layers unlike the upper unconfined soil and regolith aquifer which is recharged from rainfall the deeper volcanic aquifers are recharged from the upper unconfined shallow aquifer through fractures and faults the deeper faults fractures are expected to serve as conduits to the lower aquifers hydraulic conductivity and borehole yields are high for boreholes that penetrate the deeper fracture zones the depth of water strikes varies between boreholes in addition to the aquifer type which makes it challenging to confirm different pressure heads in the productive borehole dtw1 that yields 24 5 l s groundwater the primary fracture zone with enormous quantities of water is detected at a shallower depth the water bearing zone of the borehole dtw2 that yields 3 5 l s groundwater is situated at greater depth than in dtw1 and the water is mainly contained in weathered and fractured vesicular and scoriaceous basalts the most productive borehole of the area dtw3 that yields 30 l s groundwater has fractured zones at shallow depth and highly weathered scoria layers at greater depth in general the water bearing geological formations indicate that the potential of the aquifers increases where the basalt provides fracture zones and weathered scoria layers these fracture zones may be aquifers in their own right or link several water bearing layers of scoria and scoriaceous beds they may also link weathered basalts basaltic fractures and vesicles related to lava cooling when fractures connect the water bearing porous layers these locations will be ideal for drilling boreholes the hydraulic conductivity k of the deeper confined and semi confined aquifers are estimated using data gathered during borehole pumping tests the k values are calculated for three productive boreholes dtw1 dtw3 dtw4 and a nonfunctional borehole dtw2 using moench fracture flow model moench 1984 and the values are given in table 4 the hydraulic conductivity of the boreholes dominated by fractures is higher and during pumping tests the recovery of these boreholes was fast the complex volcanic rock setting of the area influenced by weathering and deformational processes cause it to be intricate for groundwater exploration and sustainable management the results of quaternary basaltic magma eruption through different eruption centres different lava flow directions and timing exposure to surface weathering as well as deformational activities causes the quaternary basalt scoriaceous basalt and scoria to vary laterally and with depth these lead to a multi aquifer system with several alternating aquifer layers that communicate with fractures and fault lines or make discontinuous and heterogeneous aquifer system the infilling of secondary minerals calcite and zeolite in vesicular basalts cause reduction of porosity but weathering and fracturing lead to an increase in porosity and permeability of the reservoir rocks 3 4 hydrogeological conceptual model the findings of this study showed that neither of the available islandic volcanic aquifer conceptual model nor the previous large scale conceptual groundwater flow model of ethiopian volcanic aquifers could be adapted without modification for the study area since there is no continuous basal aquifer the two most commonly employed hydrogeological conceptual models for volcanic aquifers of basaltic islands the hawaiian model mcdonald et al 1983 having a low lying basal aquifer linked to inland dyke impounded and perched aquifers and the canary islands model custodio 1989 having a continuous basal aquifer cannot be employed the perched aquifer of the hawaiian model has some similarity to the upper perched aquifer of our model the upper unconfined perched aquifer in the soil regolith and occasionally in the upper fractured basalt has a resemblance to the mayotte model lachassagne et al 2014 the mayotte hydrogeological conceptual model for complex multiphase partly eroded and subsided basaltic islands describes the main hydrogeological structures as superimposed palaeovalleys filled with various types of volcanic products its discontinuous and perched aquifer lacking a continuous basal aquifer resembles the dangila area model fig 10 though there are similarities the mayotte model cannot be adapted because 1 mayotte model has several discontinuous perched aquifers with depth but dangila model has a single upper unsaturated soil and regolith aquifer 2 in the mayotte model groundwater flows through low permeability volcanic rocks and discharges as springs when the perched aquifer intersects the surface in the dangila model flow is highly controlled by fractures faults and the deeper aquifers found at depths extending up to 210 m below the surface is recharged from the upper unconfined aquifer through fractures the permeability of the lower aquifers are not low due to the presence of weathered and fractured quaternary basalt scoriaceous rocks and scoria but their interconnection depends on the nature and density of fracture lines the layers may have fractures to store and transmit groundwater but need another high aperture fracture to be connected to other shallower or deeper weathered and fractured layers the dangila model does not resemble the groundwater flow model of the tana basin fenta et al 2016 due to its fracture dissected flow systems the conceptual model is in agreement with the shallow aquifer conceptual model of the area by walker et al 2019a who also noted the lack of interaction between shallow and deep groundwater the model will have a considerable advantage in exploration and management of groundwater from volcanic aquifers of complex geological setting affected by the fault fracture or rifting it can be transferred to an area with a similar geological setting for groundwater exploration with great emphasise to fracture networks 3 4 1 sustainable groundwater management of dangila town and surrounding area population growth establishment of new settlements agricultural expansion application of fertilizer and pesticides increased attention of freshwater bottling companies and decreasing groundwater yields of wells all point to a need for better monitoring and sustainable management of groundwater groundwater quality and hydrogeological framework studies will assist the water sector to sustainably manage groundwater as the only available freshwater of the area the sustainable management for rural development is dependant on research results to enable wise utilisation of the diverse geological setting of volcanic aquifers the common utilisation of groundwater in the study area and throughout ethiopia has traditionally been through the use of hand dug shallow wells and springs drilling of deep wells requires a tremendous amount of budget and insufficient study will cause a lot of budgets to be spent ineffectively the deep drilling and pumping technology in the country since the 1970s has enabled groundwater exploitation and human settlement to be extended in response to the increasing population though the sanitation risk of the shallow groundwater is still questionable the intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides for agriculture affects surface water the ethiopian government is currently implementing countrywide irrigation projects using groundwater mengistu et al 2019 and the results of this study could be used for sustainable development in the area moreover the results of the study showed that the groundwater of dangila town and its surrounding area is good quality for drinking and industrial use while needing few adjustments on the deep groundwater for irrigation due to na that will lead to sodicity of the soil the use of irrigation water from springs and shallow wells is appropriate concerning quality but yield is meagre and cannot be used for more than small scale backyard agriculture the future management of groundwater for sustainable development in the area should focus on modelling of structural groundwater flow and anthropogenic pollution due to locations of shallow wells in agricultural land traditional practices to manage groundwater based on observation and previous data alone will lead to loss of time and budget and overexploitation of groundwater from a single source or scheme will lead to reduction of groundwater yield over time furthermore for sustainable groundwater use and management in the area the focus should be to understand the flow system locate appropriate drilling sites evaluate anthropogenic pollution and the sodicity effects of soil due to sodium 4 conclusions the approach of analysing and interpreting various data sets helped to understand the hydrogeological framework and groundwater quality of the area the results of the study showed that the volcanic aquifer systems of the area comprise a multi aquifer system with alternating groundwater bearing layers a perched unconfined aquifer in the upper soils and regolith overlies confined and semi confined aquifers in the weathered and fractured rocks fractures with high hydraulic conductivity principally control both groundwater storage and flow and the presence of weathered scoria is paramount chemically and physically the groundwater is of good quality for both drinking and irrigation use except na from deep boreholes that can result in sodic soils if implemented without any adjustment the groundwater of the area is mainly ca hco3 type in the shallow aquifer and ca na hco3 na ca hco3 and na hco3 types in deep aquifers rock water interactions involving silicate weathering cation exchange and carbonation are the main hydrochemical processes that control the major composition of the groundwater a hydrogeological conceptual model affected by structures and representing a dissected groundwater flow system was developed using information from various data sets for future sustainable groundwater management acknowledgement the authors would like to thank dangila woreda water bureau of ethiopia for their information about the status of shallow hand dug wells and spring data we are also grateful to amhara water works design and supervision enterprise for their support in providing borehole data lastly the first author would like to thank the hungarian government for the study scholarship support 
12056,the present investigation includes assessment of radon thoron and their progeny concentrations in the environment of kangra district himachal pradesh india using pin hole based single entrance dosimeters and time deposition based progeny sensors dtps drps the total equilibrium equivalent radon eecr and thoron eect for attached and unattached fractions have been found to vary from 8 04 to 29 58 bq m3 with an average of 13 94 bq m3 and 0 18 2 18 bq m3 with an average of 1 23 bq m3 respectively the equilibrium factors for radon and thoron progeny which depend upon various environmental factors have also been evaluated these have been found to be varying from 0 17 to 0 77 and 0 01 to 0 06 for radon and thoron respectively the calculated annual effective doses for radon 0 51 1 86 msv y and thoron 0 05 to o 61 msv y have been found to be much below the recommended range of 3 10 msv y given by international commission of radiological protection icrp and level of 10 msv y by world health organization who hence the inhabitants of investigated region appear to be safe from exposure to radon thoron and their progenies graphical abstract image 1 keywords radon dwellings icrp limits pin hole based dosimeter equilibrium factor 1 introduction it is a widely established fact that radon thoron and their progeny contribute about 52 of the total radiation dose received by general population due to natural sources unscear 2008 measurement of radon in any environment is of significant interest due to its property of α particle emission radon itself is not a big problem as it is cleared as quickly as it is absorbed but its daughter nuclei can be hazardous singh et al 2015 as radon is inhaled the ionizing α particles emitted by short lived decay products of radon 212po and 214po can react with the sensitive tissues in the lungs leading to dna damage and possibility of lung cancer for this reason radon has been classified as group 1 carcinogen by international agency for research on cancer a branch of who mehra and bala 2013 in the past investigations thoron 220rn has been neglected due to its short half life and small diffusion length it was expected that concentration of thoron decreases very sharply as one move away from its source and hence it is not of great concern from health point of view but today it is an accepted fact that it needs special attention in high background radiation areas like china india and brazil which have thorium rich soils sharma et al 2018 the knowledge of natural radioactivity in such areas is significant for assessing the effect of radiations on human health sharma et al 2017 the airborne radon decay products deposited in human respiratory tract through inhalation damage the sensitive tissues there the deposition of radon progeny in respiratory tract can be assessed more clearly if its size distribution is known sharma et al 2018a radon decay products having size commonly known as activity median diameter amd below 10 nm as classified as unattached progeny while those having amd more than 10 nm but less than 1000 nm are termed as attached progeny attached progeny can adhere to tiny dust particles water vapors and other solid surfaces their further decay can release huge amounts of energy that can damage dna within cells the unattached progeny get registered in the respiratory tract due to high diffusion rate and their high α activity causes extensive damage saini et al 2016 thus estimation of attached and unattached fractions of radon and thoron is the need of the hour from dosimetric aspects equilibrium factor is an important parameter in dose calculation for lungs it is the ratio of concentration of progeny to that of radon gas it indicates the degree of disequilibrium between radon and its progeny an equilibrium factor of 1 indicates that secular equilibrium has been reached unattached fractions size distribution and equilibrium factor are the most contributing factors in the calculation of lung dose concentration of indoor radon and thoron depends upon internal and external factors external factors is the air outside while the internal sources include soil beneath building materials water used in construction type of ventilation and flooring type of season life style of inhabitants etc many research groups have carried many surveys all around the world in the past decade to assess the levels of radon thoron and their progeny in air narang et al 2018 kumar et al 2014 2018b sharma et al 2018b shikha et al 2018 guo et al 2012 curguz et al 2015 kaur et al 2019 zunic et al 2017 however such studies in himachal himalayas are scarce with new techniques the most important geographical features of the study area are presence of geological substructure and various fault lines the fault is generally accompanied with specific changes in geographical qualities such as an extensive increment in the porosity and porousness of deformed shakes along this zone hence this part of himalayas is very significant for the study of ionizing radiations in the present investigation radon and thoron measurements have been carried out in 12 villages of kangra district himachal pradesh india certain parameters like total attached and unattached progeny concentrations equilibrium factor and annual effective dose have been calculated for both radon and thoron as a part of health risk assessment epidemiological studies are used for the calculations of effective concentration and their related doses which depend upon the calibration factors sensitivity factors and dose conversion factor 2 methodology section 2 1 sampling plan the pin hole based single entry 222rn 220rn discriminating dosimeters and drps dtps have been deployed in different locations of hamirpur district of himachal pradesh india to measure indoor radon thoron and their progeny concentrations respectively the measurements were performed only in winter jan 19 to april 19 the latitudes and longitudes of different locations of the study area were measured by etrex 10 garmin make gps system these are important for preparing a radon thoron gis map of the country the outdoor gamma dose rate has been measured in these locations using dosimeter radiometer mks 03d sarad at about 1 m above the ground surface 2 2 study area fig 1 shows the map of himachal pradesh showing kangra district with different study locations himachal pradesh lies in the north western himalayas with mountainous terrain between the river ravi in the north west tons yamuna in the south west

jutogh group of rocks the siwalik group comprises of mudstones sandstones and coarsely bedded conglomerates the upper part of the lower siwalik and middle siwalik formations in himachal pradesh comprises of hard grey to greenish sandstone and inter bedded intra formational clay conglomerates which carry an un oxidised grey mudstone shale and siltstone fragmentsand carbonaceous and sulphide materials the sandstones are of sub greywacke type and carry numerous rock fragments these are feldsparic and micaceous and have calcite cement 2 3 dosimeter radiometer in the selected villages of kangra district ambient outdoor gamma dose rate has been measured by using dosimeter radiometer mks 03d gamma detector meter at about 1 m above the ground surface it is gm geiger muller tube based survey meter with digital display it can detect the gamma radiation of energy ranged between 0 05 and 3 0 mev and can detect the ambient gamma radiation dose equivalent rate ranged between 0 1μsv h and 0 1 sv h measurements were taken in indoor and outdoor environments during installation and retrieval of the detectors at all locations the data obtained for the internal exposure rate in μsv h was converted into internal absorbed dose rate adrin in ngy h using conversion factor of 1000 ngy h sharma et al 2017 2 4 pin hole based 222rn 220rn discriminating dosimeter the newly designed dosimetric system has a single entry through which gas enters the first chamber radon thoron chamber through a glass fiber filter paper 0 56 μm which filters out the decay products and the gas subsequently diffuses into the second chamber radon chamber through four pin holes each having 2 mm length and 1 mm diameter which removes the passage of 220rn gas in this chamber the systematic diagram of the dosimeter cup is shown in fig 2 both chambers are cylindrical and hollow each having a length of 4 1 cm and radius 3 1 cm chambers are covered with metallic powders from inside to have zero electric field inside the chamber volume so that the decay products of the gasses will be uniform all through the volume sahoo et al 2013 2 5 direct radon thoron progeny sensors the direct radon thoron progeny sensors drps dtps are based upon time integrated deposition based technique used for the measurement of total equilibrium equivalent concentration of radon and thoron fig 3 these are made of solid state nuclear track detector lr 115 mounted with absorbers of appropriate thickness for 220rn progeny the absorber is a 50 μm aluminized mylar which selectively detects only 8 78 mev α particles emitted from 212po while for 222rn progeny the absorber is a combination of aluminized mylar and cellulose nitrate of effective thickness 37 μm to detect mainly 7 67 mev α particles emitted from 214po mishra and mayya 2008 detectors were installed for a period of 4 months the solid state nuclear track detector lr 115 type ii of size 3 3 cm was used for registration of alpha particles track density after environmental exposure detectors were retrieved and etched with 2 5 n sodium hydroxide solution in etching bath unit at a constant temperature of 60 c for 90 min for developing the registered tracks at research laboratory d a v college amritsar india the detectors were washed dried and the cellulose nitrate layers of the detector were peeled off from the polyester base the track densities produced by the alpha particles were counted using spark counting technique the detectors were first pre sparked at 900 v to ensure that the developed track get completely punched off and then tracks were counted at 500 v twice or trice the track density from the detector was corrected by subtracting background track density due to detector storage and transport etc 2 6 calculation of indoor 222rn and 220rn concentrations the average of track density was converted into radon and thoron concentrations according to following relations sahoo et al 2013 1 cr t 1 d k r and 2 ct t 2 d c

factor the activity concentration of the short lived radon progeny in air is always less than that of the radon gas equilibrium factor is the ratio of radon and its short lived radioactive decay products which is a measure of the degree between the radon gas and its progeny sharma et al 2018 if the activity concentration of the short lived radon progeny is equal to the activity concentration of the radon gas i e secular equilibrium has been reached then f would be 1 but practically it is always less than 1 icrp 1993 the variation of ef mainly depends on environmental conditions like humidity sort of houses and ventilation rate etc therefore equilibrium factor for radon thoron and their progeny was calculated using following expressions sharma et al 2018 f rn e e c r c r f tn e e c t c t 3 results and discussion 3 1 indoor and outdoor gamma dose rates the overall value of indoor gamma dose rate of kangra district himachal pradesh is listed in table 1 the range of indoor gamma dose rate has been found to vary from 0 11 to 0 17 μsv h with an average value of 0 14 0 02 μsv h the range of indoor absorbed dose rate adr varied from 110 to 170 ngy h with an average value of 138 19 ngy h icrp 2010 has suggested a limit of 1000 μsv y for gamma annual effective dose rate the value of indoor annual effective dose equivalent varied from 431 to 666 μsv y with an average value of 542 75 μsv y and is found to be well within the safe limit 1000 μsv y suggested by icrp icrp 2010 the variation of indoor gamma dose rate has been shown in fig 4 3 2 indoor 222rn 220rn and progeny concentration the variation of indoor radon 222rn and thoron 220rn concentrations at different locations of kangra district is given in table 2 the indoor radon concentration varies from 14 bq m3 to 102 bq m3 with an arithmetic mean of 43 24 bq m3 it is much less than the lower limit of action level recommended by icrp 200 300 bq m3 icrp 2010 out of total only 50 dwellings have higher values than world average of 40 bq m3 prescribed by united nations scientific committee on effects of atomic radiations unscear 2000 only one location has the comparable indoor radon concentration to the lower action level of 100 bq m3 recommended by world health organization who 2009 similarly thoron concentration varies from 7 bq m3 to 166 bq m3 with an average value of 55 45 bq m3 the level of thoron concentration in indoor air is well within the recommended limit 200 bq m3 prescribed by icrp 2010 the results show that the indoor thoron mean concentration is about five times higher than the global average value 10 bq m3 the indoor thoron concentration is slightly higher than indoor radon level the reason for the variation in radon concentration could be the geological structure of the area the higher content of radon found in chanbi trefad and khalta areas may be due to the fact that the area is tectonically active due to the presence of main central thrust mct indoor radon and thoron concentration mainly depends upon uranium and thorium content beneath the earth surface and diffusion of radon from rock and soil fractures stoma and fissures in some locations the value of indoor radon concentration is high this may be due to the exposition of granite or the presence of uranium mineralization in kangra area reported earlier by some authors kaul et al 1993 kumar et al 1994 sharma et al 2000 the box plot of indoor radon and its progeny is shown in fig 5 the 25th and 75th percentiles of radon concentrations are 27 bq m3 and 53 bq m3 respectively this means that radon concentration in indoor air in 25 of the dwellings is below 27 bq m3 while it is below 53 bq m3 in 75 of the dwellings similarly the 25th and 75th thoron concentration percentile is 23 and 71 bq m3 respectively fig 6 the equilibrium equivalent concentration of radon eecr has been found to vary from 8 04 bq m3 to 29 58 bq m3 with an average value of 14 7 bq m3 similarly the equilibrium equivalent concentration of thoron eect has been found to vary from 0 18 bq m3 to 2 18 bq m3 with an average value of 1 23 0 66 bq m3 table 2 icrp prescribed an estimated range in buildings to be 2 50 bq m3 and 0 04 2 bq m3 for 222rn and 220rn progeny concentrations respectively eecr eect icrp 1993 all measured results of eecr are well within the icrp range however 2 16 66 values of eect are higher than the maximum limit of icrp icrp 1993 the average value of eect is also well within the range the box whisker plot of thoron and equilibrium equivalent concentration of thoron is given in fig 6 the indoor 222rn concentration of the studied area of kangra district was compared with some neighbouring regions of punjab haryana jammu kashmir and garhwal himalaya of india and islamabad lahore poonch pakistan muzaffarabad and punjab region of pakistan the observed values of 222rn concentration 14 102 bq m3 in indoor air were found to be lesser than that of western haryana 126 172 bq m3 mehra et al 2011 garhwal himalayas 27 148bq m3 kandari et al 2016 kauman himalayas 40 208 bq m3 singh et al 2016 tehri garhwal 13 291 bq m3 prasad et al 2016 poonch pakistan 86 3 bq m3 rafique et al 2010 and muzaffarabad of pakistan 55 13 bq m3 shafique et al 2016 the higher value of radon concentration in western haryana is due to geology of the area and the presence of radioactive rich granite rocks mehra et al 2011 in dehradun is due to presence of mbt which is tectonically active area kandari et al 2016 due to granite rocks in kauman himalaya singh et al 2016 in poonch pakistan and muzaffarabad of pakistan is due to crevice and cracks produced due to earthquake and high concentration of radium content in the building materials rafique et al 2010 shafique et al 2016 but radon concentration in indoor environment of the study area is also comparable to measured values of tosham region haryana 37 80 bq m3 singh et al 2015 udhampur region of jammu kashmir india 11 58 bq m3 kumar et al 2018a and islamabad of pakistan 20 83 bq m3 tufail et al 1988 the comparable results of indoor radon concentration of study region with udhampur districts may be due to the fact that these regions lie in foothills of the siwalik himalayas while in case of islamabad pakistan it lies in the vicinity of murree region of pakistan having the almost same geology with the studied region 3 3 equilibrium

arithmetic mean and standard deviation of effective dose due thoron and its progeny aedt are 0 05 0 61 msv y and 0 35 0 18 msv y respectively the total average annual inhalation dose aedtotal due to radon thoron and its progeny is estimated to be 1 32 0 60 msv range 0 65 2 68 msv which is comparable to the prescribed value of annual inhalation dose limit of 1 15 msv unscear 2000 and less than the suggested range of 3 10 msv icrp 2008 radon values are higher than those of thoron so it is considered as the major contributor to the total dose received by residents in the study region but calculated values are within the recommended limits so it has no health hazard to the surrounding environment the column plot of total annual inhalation dose of the studied dwellings is given in fig 8 about 50 dwellings have value of total inhalation dose well within the dose limit of 1 15 msv y recommended by unscear unscear 2000 4 conclusions following conclusions are drawn from the study the indoor gamma dose rate varied from 0 11 to 0 17 μsv h and measured value of annual effective gamma dose was found well within the safe limit suggested by icrp 222rn and 220rn concentration in the studied area are lower than the recommended action level of icrp the observed average progeny concentration of 222rn and 220rn are less than the estimated range of icrp the results showed that about 50 of dwellings have radon concentration greater than world average range unscear 2000 due to different geological structure and exposition of granite or presence of uranium mineralization in himachal himalayas the measured equilibrium factor for radon and thoron was lower than the globally accepted value prescribed by unscear the mean value of total annual effective dose is 1 32 0 60 msv y results

12056,the present investigation includes assessment of radon thoron and their progeny concentrations in the environment of kangra district himachal pradesh india using pin hole based single entrance dosimeters and time deposition based progeny sensors dtps drps the total equilibrium equivalent radon eecr and thoron eect for attached and unattached fractions have been found to vary from 8 04 to 29 58 bq m3 with an average of 13 94 bq m3 and 0 18 2 18 bq m3 with an average of 1 23 bq m3 respectively the equilibrium factors for radon and thoron progeny which depend upon various environmental factors have also been evaluated these have been found to be varying from 0 17 to 0 77 and 0 01 to 0 06 for radon and thoron respectively the calculated annual effective doses for radon 0 51 1 86 msv y and thoron 0 05 to o 61 msv y have been found to be much below the recommended range of 3 10 msv y given by international commission of radiological protection icrp and level of 10 msv y by world health organization who hence the inhabitants of investigated region appear to be safe from exposure to radon thoron and their progenies graphical abstract image 1 keywords radon dwellings icrp limits pin hole based dosimeter equilibrium factor 1 introduction it is a widely established fact that radon thoron and their progeny contribute about 52 of the total radiation dose received by general population due to natural sources unscear 2008 measurement of radon in any environment is of significant interest due to its property of α particle emission radon itself is not a big problem as it is cleared as quickly as it is absorbed but its daughter nuclei can be hazardous singh et al 2015 as radon is inhaled the ionizing α particles emitted by short lived decay products of radon 212po and 214po can react with the sensitive tissues in the lungs leading to dna damage and possibility of lung cancer for this reason radon has been classified as group 1 carcinogen by international agency for research on cancer a branch of who mehra and bala 2013 in the past investigations thoron 220rn has been neglected due to its short half life and small diffusion length it was expected that concentration of thoron decreases very sharply as one move away from its source and hence it is not of great concern from health point of view but today it is an accepted fact that it needs special attention in high background radiation areas like china india and brazil which have thorium rich soils sharma et al 2018 the knowledge of natural radioactivity in such areas is significant for assessing the effect of radiations on human health sharma et al 2017 the airborne radon decay products deposited in human respiratory tract through inhalation damage the sensitive tissues there the deposition of radon progeny in respiratory tract can be assessed more clearly if its size distribution is known sharma et al 2018a radon decay products having size commonly known as activity median diameter amd below 10 nm as classified as unattached progeny while those having amd more than 10 nm but less than 1000 nm are termed as attached progeny attached progeny can adhere to tiny dust particles water vapors and other solid surfaces their further decay can release huge amounts of energy that can damage dna within cells the unattached progeny get registered in the respiratory tract due to high diffusion rate and their high α activity causes extensive damage saini et al 2016 thus estimation of attached and unattached fractions of radon and thoron is the need of the hour from dosimetric aspects equilibrium factor is an important parameter in dose calculation for lungs it is the ratio of concentration of progeny to that of radon gas it indicates the degree of disequilibrium between radon and its progeny an equilibrium factor of 1 indicates that secular equilibrium has been reached unattached fractions size distribution and equilibrium factor are the most contributing factors in the calculation of lung dose concentration of indoor radon and thoron depends upon internal and external factors external factors is the air outside while the internal sources include soil beneath building materials water used in construction type of ventilation and flooring type of season life style of inhabitants etc many research groups have carried many surveys all around the world in the past decade to assess the levels of radon thoron and their progeny in air narang et al 2018 kumar et al 2014 2018b sharma et al 2018b shikha et al 2018 guo et al 2012 curguz et al 2015 kaur et al 2019 zunic et al 2017 however such studies in himachal himalayas are scarce with new techniques the most important geographical features of the study area are presence of geological substructure and various fault lines the fault is generally accompanied with specific changes in geographical qualities such as an extensive increment in the porosity and porousness of deformed shakes along this zone hence this part of himalayas is very significant for the study of ionizing radiations in the present investigation radon and thoron measurements have been carried out in 12 villages of kangra district himachal pradesh india certain parameters like total attached and unattached progeny concentrations equilibrium factor and annual effective dose have been calculated for both radon and thoron as a part of health risk assessment epidemiological studies are used for the calculations of effective concentration and their related doses which depend upon the calibration factors sensitivity factors and dose conversion factor 2 methodology section 2 1 sampling plan the pin hole based single entry 222rn 220rn discriminating dosimeters and drps dtps have been deployed in different locations of hamirpur district of himachal pradesh india to measure indoor radon thoron and their progeny concentrations respectively the measurements were performed only in winter jan 19 to april 19 the latitudes and longitudes of different locations of the study area were measured by etrex 10 garmin make gps system these are important for preparing a radon thoron gis map of the country the outdoor gamma dose rate has been measured in these locations using dosimeter radiometer mks 03d sarad at about 1 m above the ground surface 2 2 study area fig 1 shows the map of himachal pradesh showing kangra district with different study locations himachal pradesh lies in the north western himalayas with mountainous terrain between the river ravi in the north west tons yamuna in the south west falling within the latitude 30 460 33 100 n and longitude 70 460 79 000 e the district kangra in the state of himachal pradesh lies between 31 400 and 32 250 north latitudes and 75 350 77 50 east longitudes kangra district is situated between 76 3637 e 32 0669 n kangra district lies in siwalik lesser zone and its topography is well defined by series of almost parallel hills ranges which rise in height towards north east the rocks of siwalik group occur as several km wide hills eanges with steeper scaraps towards the north the valleys are filled with alluvial sand slate and boulder

jutogh group of rocks the siwalik group comprises of mudstones sandstones and coarsely bedded conglomerates the upper part of the lower siwalik and middle siwalik formations in himachal pradesh comprises of hard grey to greenish sandstone and inter bedded intra formational clay conglomerates which carry an un oxidised grey mudstone shale and siltstone fragmentsand carbonaceous and sulphide materials the sandstones are of sub greywacke type and carry numerous rock fragments these are feldsparic and micaceous and have calcite cement 2 3 dosimeter radiometer in the selected villages of kangra district ambient outdoor gamma dose rate has been measured by using dosimeter radiometer mks 03d gamma detector meter at about 1 m above the ground surface it is gm geiger muller tube based survey meter with digital display it can detect the gamma radiation of energy ranged between 0 05 and 3 0 mev and can detect the ambient gamma radiation dose equivalent rate ranged between 0 1μsv h and 0 1 sv h measurements were taken in indoor and outdoor environments during installation and retrieval of the detectors at all locations the data obtained for the internal exposure rate in μsv h was converted into internal absorbed dose rate adrin in ngy h using conversion factor of 1000 ngy h sharma et al 2017 2 4 pin hole based 222rn 220rn discriminating dosimeter the newly designed dosimetric system has a single entry through which gas enters the first chamber radon thoron chamber through a glass fiber filter paper 0 56 μm which filters out the decay products and the gas subsequently diffuses into the second chamber radon chamber through four pin holes each having 2 mm length and 1 mm diameter which removes the passage of 220rn gas in this chamber the systematic diagram of the dosimeter cup is shown in fig 2 both chambers are cylindrical and hollow each having a length of 4 1 cm and radius 3 1 cm chambers are covered with metallic powders from inside to have zero electric field inside the chamber volume so that the decay products of the gasses will be uniform all through the volume sahoo et al 2013 2 5 direct radon thoron progeny sensors the direct radon thoron progeny sensors drps dtps are based upon time integrated deposition based technique used for the measurement of total equilibrium equivalent concentration of radon and thoron fig 3 these are made of solid state nuclear track detector lr 115 mounted with absorbers of appropriate thickness for 220rn progeny the absorber is a 50 μm aluminized mylar which selectively detects only 8 78 mev α particles emitted from 212po while for 222rn progeny the absorber is a combination of aluminized mylar and cellulose nitrate of effective thickness 37 μm to detect mainly 7 67 mev α particles emitted from 214po mishra and mayya 2008 detectors were installed for a period of 4 months the solid state nuclear track detector lr 115 type ii of size 3 3 cm was used for registration of alpha particles track density after environmental exposure detectors were retrieved and etched with 2 5 n sodium hydroxide solution in etching bath unit at a constant temperature of 60 c for 90 min for developing the registered tracks at research laboratory d a v college amritsar india the detectors were washed dried and the cellulose nitrate layers of the detector were peeled off from the polyester base the track densities produced by the alpha particles were counted using spark counting technique the detectors were first pre sparked at 900 v to ensure that the developed track get completely punched off and then tracks were counted at 500 v twice or trice the track density from the detector was corrected by subtracting background track density due to detector storage and transport etc 2 6 calculation of indoor 222rn and 220rn concentrations the average of track density was converted into radon and thoron concentrations according to following relations sahoo et al 2013 1 cr t 1 d k r and 2 ct t 2 d c

factor the activity concentration of the short lived radon progeny in air is always less than that of the radon gas equilibrium factor is the ratio of radon and its short lived radioactive decay products which is a measure of the degree between the radon gas and its progeny sharma et al 2018 if the activity concentration of the short lived radon progeny is equal to the activity concentration of the radon gas i e secular equilibrium has been reached then f would be 1 but practically it is always less than 1 icrp 1993 the variation of ef mainly depends on environmental conditions like humidity sort of houses and ventilation rate etc therefore equilibrium factor for radon thoron and their progeny was calculated using following expressions sharma et al 2018 f rn e e c r c r f tn e e c t c t 3 results and discussion 3 1 indoor and outdoor gamma dose rates the overall value of indoor gamma dose rate of kangra district himachal pradesh is listed in table 1 the range of indoor gamma dose rate has been found to vary from 0 11 to 0 17 μsv h with an average value of 0 14 0 02 μsv h the range of indoor absorbed dose rate adr varied from 110 to 170 ngy h with an average value of 138 19 ngy h icrp 2010 has suggested a limit of 1000 μsv y for gamma annual effective dose rate the value of indoor annual effective dose equivalent varied from 431 to 666 μsv y with an average value of 542 75 μsv y and is found to be well within the safe limit 1000 μsv y suggested by icrp icrp 2010 the variation of indoor gamma dose rate has been shown in fig 4 3 2 indoor 222rn 220rn and progeny concentration the variation of indoor radon 222rn and thoron 220rn concentrations at different locations of kangra district is given in table 2 the indoor radon concentration varies from 14 bq m3 to 102 bq m3 with an arithmetic mean of 43 24 bq m3 it is much less than the lower limit of action level recommended by icrp 200 300 bq m3 icrp 2010 out of total only 50 dwellings have higher values than world average of 40 bq m3 prescribed by united nations scientific committee on effects of atomic radiations unscear 2000 only one location has the comparable indoor radon concentration to the lower action level of 100 bq m3 recommended by world health organization who 2009 similarly thoron concentration varies from 7 bq m3 to 166 bq m3 with an average value of 55 45 bq m3 the level of thoron concentration in indoor air is well within the recommended limit 200 bq m3 prescribed by icrp 2010 the results show that the indoor thoron mean concentration is about five times higher than the global average value 10 bq m3 the indoor thoron concentration is slightly higher than indoor radon level the reason for the variation in radon concentration could be the geological structure of the area the higher content of radon found in chanbi trefad and khalta areas may be due to the fact that the area is tectonically active due to the presence of main central thrust mct indoor radon and thoron concentration mainly depends upon uranium and thorium content beneath the earth surface and diffusion of radon from rock and soil fractures stoma and fissures in some locations the value of indoor radon concentration is high this may be due to the exposition of granite or the presence of uranium mineralization in kangra area reported earlier by some authors kaul et al 1993 kumar et al 1994 sharma et al 2000 the box plot of indoor radon and its progeny is shown in fig 5 the 25th and 75th percentiles of radon concentrations are 27 bq m3 and 53 bq m3 respectively this means that radon concentration in indoor air in 25 of the dwellings is below 27 bq m3 while it is below 53 bq m3 in 75 of the dwellings similarly the 25th and 75th thoron concentration percentile is 23 and 71 bq m3 respectively fig 6 the equilibrium equivalent concentration of radon eecr has been found to vary from 8 04 bq m3 to 29 58 bq m3 with an average value of 14 7 bq m3 similarly the equilibrium equivalent concentration of thoron eect has been found to vary from 0 18 bq m3 to 2 18 bq m3 with an average value of 1 23 0 66 bq m3 table 2 icrp prescribed an estimated range in buildings to be 2 50 bq m3 and 0 04 2 bq m3 for 222rn and 220rn progeny concentrations respectively eecr eect icrp 1993 all measured results of eecr are well within the icrp range however 2 16 66 values of eect are higher than the maximum limit of icrp icrp 1993 the average value of eect is also well within the range the box whisker plot of thoron and equilibrium equivalent concentration of thoron is given in fig 6 the indoor 222rn concentration of the studied area of kangra district was compared with some neighbouring regions of punjab haryana jammu kashmir and garhwal himalaya of india and islamabad lahore poonch pakistan muzaffarabad and punjab region of pakistan the observed values of 222rn concentration 14 102 bq m3 in indoor air were found to be lesser than that of western haryana 126 172 bq m3 mehra et al

muzaffarabad of pakistan 55 13 bq m3 shafique et al 2016 the higher value of radon concentration in western haryana is due to geology of the area and the presence of radioactive rich granite rocks mehra et al 2011 in dehradun is due to presence of mbt which is tectonically active area kandari et al 2016 due to granite rocks in kauman himalaya singh et al 2016 in poonch pakistan and muzaffarabad of pakistan is due to crevice and cracks produced due to earthquake and high concentration of radium content in the building materials rafique et al 2010 shafique et al 2016 but radon concentration in indoor environment of the study area is also comparable to measured values of tosham region haryana 37 80 bq m3 singh et al 2015 udhampur region of jammu kashmir india 11 58 bq m3 kumar et al 2018a and islamabad of pakistan 20 83 bq m3 tufail et al 1988 the comparable results of indoor radon concentration of study region with udhampur districts may be due to the fact that these regions lie in foothills of the siwalik himalayas while in case of islamabad pakistan it lies in the vicinity of murree region of pakistan having the almost same geology with the studied region 3 3 equilibrium

12057,this study attempted to conceptualize the hydrogeological setting of the hout river catchment located in the limpopo river basin using multiple methods that include groundwater flow patterns structural analysis stable 18o 2h and 13c and radiogenic 14c isotopes of water and water table fluctuation methods the hydrogeological system of the catchment is represented by fractured crystalline basement aquifer as the main host for groundwater and is overlain by weathered rocks that act as a vadose zone and shallow aquifer in various places groundwater from the fractured basement rocks is the main source of water for large scale irrigation and domestic use potential aquifers in the area are evident within the hout river granitic gneiss and the goudplaats granitic gneiss besides the younger granites as a result of fracturing and weathering groundwater flow map shows a flow pattern from the southern part of the catchment towards the north eastern part of the catchment dictated by dolerite dykes and tectonic lineaments that trend in the ene and e direction 088 and 075 with the dip angle of 50 to 55 the deeper aquifer in the southern and central part of the catchment contain old

environment requires integration of results from different methods to support groundwater management where it is the main source for water supply the study area fig 1 refers to the hout river catchment hrc with an area of 2478 km2 in the limpopo river basin in south africa the town of mogwadi previously called dendron is the main urban and commercial farming center situated in the north central part of the catchment the region is the main source of agricultural production for the southern african region primarily potatoes that rely on groundwater since the 1950s vegter 2003 moreover groundwater is used for domestic supplies and livestock watering in the area over the years there has been an increase in water demand as a result of the expansion of irrigated areas that led to the competition on the groundwater exploitation in some areas groundwater levels declined below pumping level due to over abstraction for irrigation vegter 2003 during the field survey in october 2016 and july 2017 the hout river was found to be dry which raised a question why in addition to the dryness of the river farmers are also complaining about dry wells and the alarming rate at which groundwater levels were lowering besides an increase in the salinity of irrigation water vegter 2003 noted that groundwater abstraction from the doornlaagte catchment diminished the downstream groundwater flow due to declining groundwater levels which is believed to be a cause for the dryness of the hout river this is attributed to the growth in large scale competitive use of groundwater in the area in the current circumstances it only flows during torrential rainfall as a result of the dependence of different economic activities and livelihood on groundwater within the catchment the current work tries to apply an integrated method that involves structural analyses stable and radioactive isotopes of water such as 18o 2h 13c and 14c and water table fluctuation wtf methods to conceptualize the hydrogeological setting of the study area these methods were selected as they have not been used collectively to conceptualize hydrogeological system in the hout river catchment the hrc is characterized by semi arid subtropical climate with variable monthly rainfall pattern fig 2 sporadic and very torrential rainfalls in some months rainfall is unevenly distributed with limited peaks in december january and february the mean annual temperature reaches a maximum of 30 c in january and a minimum of 4 c in july dwa 2004 1 1 geological setting the hout river catchment is located within the southern marginal zone smz of the limpopo mobile belt lmb where the basement rocks of the goudplaats hout river gneisses represent the oldest rocks in the area 3 6 ga 3 2 ga which were categorized as archaean rocks anhaeusser 1992 with typical coarse crystalline texture fig 3 the goudplaats granitic gneiss has dark grey appearance and highly folded fig 3a as compared to the younger hout river granitic gneiss fig 3b and c which is pinkish grey pegmatoidal and highly fractured and weathered these rocks are bounded to the north by the soutpansberg volcano sedimentary rocks holland 2011 based on the simplified geological map fig 4 the archaean greenstone belts 2 8 2 7 ga within the study area are represented by the pietersbug group zandriespoort formation which is composed of metamorphosed volcanic rocks interlayered with magnetic quartzites de wit et al 1992 stratigraphically this formation is covered by the bandelierkop complex 2 67 ga which is made up of mafic felsic ultramafic and pelitic gneisses that are metamorphosed at granulite facies van biljon and legg 1983 older ultramafic rocks such as peridotite dunite and pyroxenite are widely scattered in the area overlain by a mafic member which is fairly foliated and show concordant and discordant association with intruded leucocratic granites van biljon and legg 1983 the younger pelitic member is highly foliated and associated with banded iron formation anhaeusser 1992 the main neoarchean intrusions 2 8 2 5 ga in the area are represented by the lunsklip granites moletsi granites and hugomond granites these granitic outcrops form prominent hills with localized occurrence in the catchment fig 5 the soutpansberg group rocks 1 85 ga mainly occur within the soutpansberg mountain cheney et al 1990 which forms the northern boundary of the catchment it consists of marine and continental clastic deposits such as sandstones barker et al 2006 in most places the rocks contain an intercalation of volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks geng et al 2014 large part of the low lying areas is covered by alluvial sediments that are characterized by sandy texture since they are primarily derived from fractured granites fig 5 and gneisses fig 3 the basement rocks have been intruded by dolerite dykes often highly fractured fig 6 the regional alignment of dolerites in different directions forms a network of interconnected structures the hout river shear zone hrsz cross cut the catchment in the e w direction with almost equal portion fig 4 based on the structural record the section of the catchment located to the north of the hrsz is intensively faulted with predominantly ne oriented structures besides the aeromagnetic map of the study area shows areas of high magnetic anomalies along the soutpansberg mountain and dolerite dykes predominantly trending ne magnetic methods are commonly used to delineate some features affecting groundwater flow such as intrusive rocks geological contacts and dykes additionally aeromagnetic data are best used in the interpretation of structures with magnetic nature as well as faults and lineaments according to reeves 2005 mafic dykes retain residual magnetism formed when magma was rapidly cooled after emplacement other magnetic signatures associated with dykes occur along contact aureole which also gives pronounced magnetic anomalies reeves 2005 the aeromagnetic map fig 7 exhibits both positive and negative anomalies largely influenced by geological structures such as faults and dykes qualitative analysis of the aeromagnetic data shows that positive magnetic anomalies 404 nt coincide with granites the soutpansberg group rocks greenstone remnants and dolerite dykes with a general trend of ne sw direction the high magnetic signatures along the soutpansberg mountain are related to volcanic layers within the volcano sedimentary sequence of the soutpansberg group rocks high magnetic anomalies are also associated with greenstone belts as a result of iron rich layer underneath the younger successions the areas of negative anomalies showing a general trend of ne sw have amplitudes in the range of 46 nt to 280 nt and are related to highly weathered zones therefore these areas could be considered as sites with high groundwater storage the areas with positive magnetic anomalies can potentially influence groundwater flow and its spatial occurrence based on the aeromagnetic and structural evidence dolerite dykes show dominantly parallel pattern with the ne trend where the dykes seem to be superimposed along with the positive magnetic anomalies sakala et al 2014 interpreted the continuous and parallel characteristics of the dykes as an indication of emplacement in an extensional crustal regime along zones of weakness due to earth s crust pulling apart however not all superimposed dykes and lineaments in the aeromagnetic map coincide with high magnetic anomalies indicating that some of these dykes may not be magnetic 1 2 hydrogeological setting the main aquifers that occur within the crystalline rocks of the hout river granitic gneiss and goudplaats granitic gneiss are extensively weathered and fractured vegter 2003 reported that the hout river granitic gneiss has high productivity compared to the goudplaats granitic gneiss the least productive aquifer is represented by the younger granites characterized by less fracture occurrence and massive outcrops tectonic and geomorphological evolutions modified the original hydrogeological characteristics of the rocks subsequently forming a composite aquifer composed of weathered zone and underlying fractured crystalline bedrock holland 2011 explored different aspects of the geology and hydrogeology of the area at large to understand how hydraulic parameters influence aquifer transmissivity and ultimately borehole yield holland 2011 reported that high transmissivity values are associated with contact between the rocks pegmatite topographical lows and areas proximal to lineaments in crystalline aquifers geological structures are an integral part of the hydrogeological system which influence groundwater flow within the aquifer according to jolly 1986 and pietersen et al 2011 three distinct aquifers exist within the limpopo plateau namely the composite aquifer deeply fractured aquifer and the alluvial aquifer the composite aquifer is characterized by weathered zones underlain by fractured basement rocks on the other hand deeply fractured aquifer consists of the interconnected network of fractures the alluvial aquifer resulted from a reworked weathered material that formed laterally narrow and shallow reservoirs along river channels pietersen et al 2011 the thickness of the upper weathered zone ranges from 12 to 50 m while the fractured aquifer extends to a depth greater than 120 m dziembowski 1976 jolly 1986 vegter 2003 pietersen et al 2011 holland 2011 however the exposed thickness of the regolith varies between 5 m and 10 m along the river valley fig 8 the storage coefficients of the upper weathered and lower fractured zones of the composite aquifer are 0 01 and 0 0025 respectively jolly 1986 due to low permeability of the weathered zone low borehole yields were recorded with a mean yield of 1 ℓ s while in the fractured zone the borehole yield reaches 40 ℓ s pietersen et al 2011 holland 2011 correlated the trend of dykes and borehole productivity and showed that high mean transmissivities are related to ne ene and wnw trending dykes and lower transmissivity in the nw and nne trending dykes particularly the depths of weathering and fracturing are higher where the hout river gneiss overlie the younger granitic intrusions especially in the southern part of the catchment however towards the north eastern part of the catchment the importance of alluvial weathered zone increases due to higher thickness and episodic recharge from the river itself the connectivity of fractures and nature of the granites ensure high transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity in facilitating local and regional circulation the transmissivities of the aquifer vary between 4 m2 d and 40 m2 d with high values around the mogwadi area holland 2011 the prominent aquifers that act as the main water bearing units at shallow depth along the hout river are composed of sand from weathering of gneisses and granites according to vegter 2003 in this aquifer water strikes are mostly between 30 m and 50 m below surface while the probability of striking water down to 75 m is high in the hout river granitic gneiss in the younger granitic batholiths that are less weathered but fractured the water strike ranges between 15 m and 50 m below surface vegter 2003 in the past decades various recharge estimation techniques were applied to understand groundwater recharge in the crystalline aquifer in the limpopo province bredenkamp et al 1995 mandiwana 2004 holland 2011 ebrahim et al 2019 crystalline aquifers in semi arid environments are replenished during episodic rainfall events through torrential rainfalls and floods van wyk 2010 abiye 2016 therefore a recharge amount of 0 5 of mean annual precipitation map was obtained by holland 2011 through the chloride mass balance cmb method and 0 7 8 of map by bredenkamp et al 1995 masiyandima et al 2002 also estimated values in the range of 2 5 from 400 mm map while dziembowski 1976 estimated recahrge of about 3 8 of map furthermore ebrahim et al 2019 developed a numerical model for the hrc to understand sustainability of groundwater pumping for irrigation and groundwater flow dynamics for irrigation the model provided pumping values within the range of 13 9 to 19 3 mm3 year for the simulation period between 2008 and 2015 groundwater abstraction for irrigation was also estimated on the basis of irrigated crop area delineated using landsat normalized difference vegetation index and crop water requirements ebrahim et al 2019 the mean annual simulated irrigation pumping for the period 2008 2015 was 6 9 mm year 17 mm3 year the mean annual irrigation licensed volume aggregated for all licensed farmers for the same period was 11 3 mm year 28 0 mm3 year the analysis shows that the licensed volume is almost twice the actual irrigation pumping calculated based on the optimal crop water requirements the possible explanation for the difference between the licensed irrigation volume and the simulated irrigation pumping could be that farmers are abstracting less than their allotted amounts or it could be that farmers were licensed more than what they need presently in order to secure water for future agricultural expansion if the first is the case then farmers pump less because of physical or economic constraints in terms of accessing groundwater which indicates that licensed volumes are likely exaggerated in terms of what the aquifer can provide sustainably even today it is important to note that the irrigation pumping reported in this study is conservative i e on the high side as it assumes groundwater pumping equivalent to optimal crop irrigation requirements which may not hold true however according to jolly 1986 groundwater abstraction for irrigation three decades ago was in the order of 21 mm3 year with an irrigated area of 3579 ha with about 1 mm3 year for livestock watering 2 materials and methods the in situ measurements of temperature ph electrical conductivity and oxidation reduction potential were performed with crison mm 40 and aquaread multi parameter instruments after onsite calibration data on groundwater level and drill log were obtained from the national groundwater archives nga and groundwater resource information project grip department of water and sanitation south africa geological and aeromagnetic data were obtained from the council for geoscience south africa meteorological data were gathered from the south african weather service to understand the groundwater flow pattern and its relationship with the magnetic anomalies water levels were collected and interpreted from 77 monitoring boreholes that are spatially distributed across the catchment fig 9 the groundwater level elevation above mean sea level was obtained by subtracting the static water level from the surface elevation based on the aster digital elevation model with 30 m 30 m resolution the corrected groundwater elevations were then used to create a groundwater flow map for the catchment using surfer 15 software for stable isotopes of 18o and 2h 17 groundwater one river one dam one spring and 26 rainfall samples were collected by using 10 mℓ glass bottle the stable isotope samples were analyzed using the liquid water isotope analyzer model 45 ep at the university of the witwatersrand south africa the precision of measurement was approximately 1 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o in liquid water samples the analysis was done against five standards of known isotopic signatures ten groundwater samples were collected for 14c and 13c analysis where barium carbonate baco3 was precipitated from 50 ℓ of the water sample to precipitate the baco3 which was required for the analysis purified naoh was added in the 50 ℓ sample to increase the ph above 10 and was verified with phenolphthalein indicator finally bacl3 was added to precipitate barium carbonate the solution was then left for about 3 h and the precipitate was retrieved in 500 mℓ polyethylene bottle and transported in a cooler box to the laboratory for analysis to understand the source of rainfall it was important to compare how the slope and intercept of the stable isotopes of water deviate either from meteoric water line the d excess deuterium excess is a function of relative humidity above the ocean surface which indicates the conditions during the formation of vapour geyh et al 2000 being located in the semi arid region it was essential to understand the source of moisture that generates limited rainfall in the area which later act as a source for groundwater recharge therefore the distribution of d excess was assessed to deduce the moisture source and circulation the mean residence time mrt t based on the 14c activity was estimated based on equation 1 1 t 8267 l n a a o where t is mrt of groundwater between the time of recharge and groundwater abstraction a o represents the initial 14c activity while a is the final 14c activity measured in percent modern carbon pmc clark and fritz 1997 the wtf method equation 2 is applied to estimate point recharge using five monitoring boreholes located within the granitic gneisses and dolerites 2 r s y δ h δt where r is the recharge sy represents specific yield δ h is a change in the hydraulic head m m and δ t is a time of water level observation assuming that the geological material above the water table is at field capacity then the recharging water that causes a rise in water table occupies the effective porosity of the geological material hence appropriate determination of sy for the lithology at fluctuation depth is essential 3 results and discussion the measured ph values range from 6 9 to 8 8 table 1 this can be considered as normal for the environment characterized by water rock interaction through a natural process the lowest ph values are associated with ion leaching from the greenstone belts the oxidation reduction potential orp values range from 149 mv to 92 mv table 1 where the positive orp values suggest that groundwater occurs in an oxidizing environment which could further indicate the presence of an open system in the form of fracture controlled flow however in the case where deep groundwater displays positive orp such as borehole d3 to d5 with the depth ranging between 94 m and 110 m it could be related to the presence of iron in the water derived from the greenstones electrical conductivity ec revealed the presence of saline water with high ec values only one spring sample from the northern part of the catchment with recently recharged water contains low ec value of 49 0 μs cm and alkaline ph which could be due to leaching of soil carbonate in the southern part of the catchment ec ranges between 473 0 μs cm and 1228 0 μs cm in the central part of the catchment ec values range from 1035 0 μs cm to 2020 0 μs cm in the northern part of the catchment the ec values are in the range of 1227 0 μs cm the high ec could be due to solute leaching from the upper weathered zone as a result of prolonged water rock interaction besides high ec values recorded around the mogwadi area could be attributed to agricultural activity resulting in a salinity build up possibly as a result of the irrigation return this is due to the water use practice by farmers that irrigate from surface impoundment after pumping from boreholes fig 10 a practice that could facilitate evaporation of water thereby increasing salinity the physicochemical parameters for the boreholes sampled in the hrc are presented in table 1 the boreholes with shallow water levels in the hrc are in the range of 2 m 5 m b g l while along the hrsz groundwater level is in the range of 13 m b g l generally groundwater levels are higher where structures are densely concentrated and deep groundwater levels occur in areas with less occurrence of structural discontinuities even though the catchment was identified as semi arid with limited rainfall the shallow aquifer has good potential in groundwater storage derived from episodic rainfall the analysis of geological structures magnetic anomalies and the depth to groundwater levels indicate that the structural discontinuities in the area coincide with the variable magnetic anomalies that can potentially control groundwater occurrence it was also observed that structures with positive magnetic anomalies trend in the ne direction the groundwater level analysis indicates that the regional groundwater flow seems to be following similar direction ne sw as the structures it was deduced from this observation that the general trend of groundwater flow is dictated by the local faults and dykes which could indicate that groundwater occurrence in the area is structurally controlled this needs further investigation to ascertain the role of dykes and faults in the area based on the groundwater flow direction it is possible to deduce that predominantly groundwater recharge occurs in the southern part of the catchment fig 11 however the samples taken from shallow aquifer in the northern part of the catchment indicates the presence of recent recharge suggesting another recharge possibility in the area in the form of mountain front recharge the stable isotope results for δ18o and δ2h from rainfall groundwater hout river dam and spring samples are presented in table 2 the results were plotted against the pretoria local meteoric water line lmwl and the global meteoric water line gmwl fig 12 the slope and intercept of the lmwl are 6 7 and 7 2 that are lower than that of the gmwl 8 and 10 indicating relatively low humidity condition and signature of secondary evaporation in the area however most rainfall samples plotted above the lmwl indicate high humidity source due to condensation of air masses for the rainfall samples the mean d excess values are low indicating moisture from regional circulation due to the occurrence of high pressure cells in the southern africa region and moisture circulation that emanates from the south indian ocean and takes a long anticlockwise path to reach south africa abiye 2016 the average values of the stable isotopes presented in fig 12 exhibits distinctive evaporation effect δ18o 0 10 and δ2h 4 8 for surface water the rainfall samples showed relatively low values δ18o 0 10 and δ2h 10 1 highly depleted values are recorded for groundwater δ18o 4 52 and δ2h 29 0 which could indicate the possibility of depleted rainfall as a source of recharge after long atmospheric circulation the isotopic composition of rainfall samples has a mean value of δ2h and δ18o at 10 1 and 2 30 respectively during the sampling period nov 2016 to july 2017 rainfall amounts in the area ranged from 3 4 mm to 24 mm per day towards the southern portion of the catchment and 70 5 mm 34 5 mm per day around the mogwadi area towards the northern part of the catchment rainfall was in the range of 11 8 mm 120 4 mm per day however on annual basis the amount is very low as the rainfall is temporally limited to few days a year although variable rainfall amount was noted during the sampling period most of the results showed depleted values of δ18o and δ2h with few samples showing enriched values fig 12 the stable isotope record from groundwater samples revealed the mean value of 4 52 for δ18o and 29 0 for δ2h the highly depleted isotope values signify lack of evaporation prior to recharge and subsequent long term deep groundwater circulation within the aquifer the depleted isotope values with respect to the lmwl indicates the occurrence of recharge during colder climates in high humidity condition these samples have a small range of δ18o and δ2h values at 3 75 5 43 and 25 1 to 35 8 respectively suggesting regional moisture circulation in addition the plot for d excess and δ18o shows the dominance of low d excess values fig 13 which also supports a regional source for moisture however some rainfall events with enriched positive values in this case δ18o and depleted negative values δ2h and vice versa could suggest the presence of mixing of moisture from local and regional sources as a source for rainfall and hence groundwater recharge the stable isotope records show an inconsistent trend with some deep boreholes showing both depleted and enriched isotope signature which could be attributed to recharge from rainfall in different seasons with diverse isotope composition for example boreholes d7 and d8 have the deepest static water level of below 100 m b g l and show the most depleted δ18o values at 4 70 and 4 60 respectively on the other hand d4 also represents the deepest water levels at 110 m b g l and least depleted in δ18o at 3 72 furthermore d1 is one of the shallowest boreholes with groundwater level at 60 m b g l but amongst the most depleted with respects to δ18o at 4 45 this variability could suggest the occurrence of mixed groundwater and diversity in source rainfall where highly depleted stable isotopes exist at shallow level and less depleted stable isotopes occur at greater depth indicating variability in the characteristics of recharge it could also be due to faults fractures being intercepted by shallow boreholes allowing relatively deep groundwater to mix in significant way besides this distribution is not uniform even within a short distance between boreholes e g d1 d7 which were sampled in the same farm also suggests the possibility of hydrogeological dissimilarity as a result of geological structures that compartmentalized the aquifers in the eastern part of the catchment boreholes d11 to d13 stable isotopes are depleted below the depth of 100 m b g l this could suggest the presence of regional groundwater circulation from the high altitudes areas or recharge of highly depleted rainfall from regional moisture circulation it is also evident that water with diverse origin exists at a similar depth for example below 100 m d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 and d8 fig 14 this gives an evidence on the variability of recharge history and hydraulic properties of the rocks that dictate the recharge process and mixing among different groundwater components based on 14c results there is diverse mrt in the area with recent recharge situated in the shallow aquifer in the northern part of the area while the second category could be regarded as recharge that took place over hundreds to thousands of years ago 500 1400 years table 3 indicating substantially old groundwater which is being used for irrigation different sources of carbon ranging from co2 in soil magma hydrothermal fluids and carbonate minerals exist in nature geyh et al 2000 these sources make up the total dissolved carbons both organic and inorganic within groundwater and because of their distinctiveness they give rise to variable δ13c isotopic signatures in the study area the δ13c values range from 9 41 to 13 81 with an average value of 11 30 table 3 these results indicate a source of δ13cdic dissolved inorganic carbon from carbon fractionation through c4 plants photosynthetic cycle and carbon reduction processes in metamorphic and igneous rocks c4 plants have the range of δ13c values between 10 and 16 clark and fritz 1997 with some degree of δ13c being contributed by metamorphic and igneous rocks in the area the plot for 14c and δ13c fig 15 shows as the 14c values increase there is a corresponding decrease in the δ13c values indicating the presence of young groundwater with less dilution by dic as depicted for example by d15 sample in contrast decrease in the14c values is related to an increase in δ13c values when the mrt of groundwater is substantially longer however some samples d18 and d20 have values of 14c and δ13c at 88 10 2 5 pmc 9 41 and 87 70 2 5 10 67 respectively indicating mixing of water from different carbon sources and dilution of 14c by dic based on the stable isotope results groundwater recharge within the hrc occurs during the humid condition or colder climates with the moisture derived from regional source such as from the nearest indian ocean or high latitude regions after long moisture circulation based on the d excess values groundwater recharge also occurs from a mixture of different rainfalls in the area the groundwater samples with the highest mrt based on 14c of less than 100 pmc were recorded along the eastern southern and south eastern part of the catchment these results suggest the possibility of compartmentalization of crystalline aquifers or variability in the depth of circulation that is dictated by geological structures this was also confirmed from the aeromagnetic data groundwater recharge rate was computed from groundwater level fluctuation data from 2007 to 2015 to substantiate the groundwater characteristics obtained from the radiogenic and stable isotopes analyses based on equation 2 borehole intersecting gneisses with a specific yield of 0 02 resulted in groundwater recharge of 1 82 mm year it seems that the recharge is low which is related to low rainfall amount due to the fact that we might have also underestimated the specific yield besides sluggish water level response in the aquifers further work is necessary to improve the current understanding previous recharge estimations conducted in the area with a simple rainfall runoff models resulted recharge rates ranging from 1 76 to 17 82 mm year mandiwana 2004 while masiyandima et al 2002 estimated the range of 3 5 of map this further shows that even though the rainfall amount is low there is some local contribution for recharge in a limited area groundwater recharge rate in the dolerites with a specific yield of 0 01 is about 33 mm year while in the weathered zone it is 17 33 mm year table 4 the wide variation of groundwater recharge follows different properties of rocks of the aquifer in the area based on the wtf method for the year 2007 2015 the average groundwater recharge was estimated at 5 21 mm year 12 91 mm3 year which is equivalent to 1 7 of map table 4 it was evident that groundwater recharge was significantly lower than abstraction in dry years 2008 2009 and 2011 2012 as estimated by ebrahim et al 2019 with recharge raniging from 3 2 to 14 4 mm3 year the abstraction for irrigation varied between 15 1 and 18 6 mm3 year towards the south eastern part of the catchment the mrt of groundwater used for irrigation is high greater than 1000 years with low 14c content of less than 90 pmc in some places although the southern and southwestern part of the catchment acts as a headwater region groundwater contains the 14c activity of less than 90 pmc indicating the presence of groundwater with long residence time in the aquifer probably linked to the regional circulation the results might also suggest that the boreholes are tapping the lower confined aquifer with insignificant contribution from recent recharge 4 conclusions regional circulation of groundwater is prevalent in the catchment where the deeper aquifer contains water with long residence time the short residence time coincides with recharge areas along the soutpansberg mountain northern part of the catchment which suggests that this region acts as a potential source of localized recharge for the shallow aquifer from radiocarbon dating it was apparent that groundwater around the mogwadi south eastern and southern part of the catchment which is extensively used for commercial farming is recharged more than 1000 years ago the results portray that the occurrence of a weathered and deeply fractured aquifer in the catchment could facilitate longer residence of water in the crystalline aquifer it is also evident that the groundwater distribution pattern is also constrained by structures with a variable magnetic anomaly elevated groundwater levels are associated with a positive magnetic anomaly while the deeper groundwater levels are represented by negative magnetic anomalies areas with negative magnetic anomalies may likely represent the presence of groundwater in isolated compartments where groundwater resides for a long period as confirmed by carbon 14 activity of less than 90 pmc oxygen 18 and hydrogen 2 isotopic ratios revealed that hrc is receiving rainfall from a regional moisture source as witnessed by low deuterium excess the fractured aquifer does not show dilution by atmospheric carbon and increased dissolved solids although groundwater samples along the south western part of the catchment show less dissolved solids on the other hand the upper aquifer shows dilution of the radiocarbon suggesting mixing of different water in the area in general groundwater with different recharge and residence time is being exploited for large scale irrigation in the area significant recharge is limited to high rainfall events and does not always occur with every rainfall event balancing of recharge and exploitation might not be feasible in cases where old groundwater more than 1000 years is being exploited the important issue would be to balance abstraction and the episodic recharge which does not occur every year but only in heavy rainfall events in the catchment water conservation and managed aquifer recharge would be the most feasible way to manage the groundwater resources declaration of competing interest we declare that

12057,this study attempted to conceptualize the hydrogeological setting of the hout river catchment located in the limpopo river basin using multiple methods that include groundwater flow patterns structural analysis stable 18o 2h and 13c and radiogenic 14c isotopes of water and water table fluctuation methods the hydrogeological system of the catchment is represented by fractured crystalline basement aquifer as the main host for groundwater and is overlain by weathered rocks that act as a vadose zone and shallow aquifer in various places groundwater from the fractured basement rocks is the main source of water for large scale irrigation and domestic use potential aquifers in the area are evident within the hout river granitic gneiss and the goudplaats granitic gneiss besides the younger granites as a result of fracturing and weathering groundwater flow map shows a flow pattern from the southern part of the catchment towards the north eastern part of the catchment dictated by

central part of the catchment the region is the main source of agricultural production for the southern african region primarily potatoes that rely on groundwater since the 1950s vegter 2003 moreover

levels were lowering besides an increase in the salinity of irrigation water vegter 2003 noted that groundwater abstraction from the doornlaagte catchment diminished the downstream groundwater flow due to declining groundwater levels which is believed to be a cause for the dryness of the hout river this is attributed to the growth in large scale competitive use of groundwater in the area in the

the southern marginal zone smz of the limpopo mobile belt lmb where the basement rocks of the goudplaats hout river gneisses represent the oldest rocks in the area 3 6 ga 3 2 ga which were categorized as archaean rocks anhaeusser 1992 with typical coarse crystalline texture fig 3 the goudplaats granitic gneiss has dark grey appearance and highly folded fig 3a as compared to the younger hout river granitic gneiss fig 3b and c which is pinkish grey pegmatoidal and highly fractured and weathered these rocks are bounded to the north by the soutpansberg volcano sedimentary rocks holland 2011 based on the simplified geological map fig 4 the archaean greenstone belts 2 8 2 7 ga within the study area are represented by the pietersbug group zandriespoort formation which is composed of metamorphosed volcanic rocks interlayered with magnetic quartzites de wit et al 1992 stratigraphically this formation is covered by the bandelierkop complex 2 67 ga which is made up of mafic felsic ultramafic and pelitic gneisses that are metamorphosed at granulite facies van biljon and legg 1983 older ultramafic rocks such as peridotite dunite and pyroxenite are widely scattered in the area overlain by a mafic member which is fairly foliated and show concordant and discordant association with intruded leucocratic granites van biljon and legg 1983 the younger pelitic member is highly foliated and associated with banded iron formation anhaeusser 1992 the main neoarchean intrusions 2 8 2 5 ga in the area are represented by the lunsklip granites moletsi granites and hugomond granites these granitic outcrops form prominent hills with localized occurrence in the catchment fig 5 the soutpansberg group rocks 1 85 ga mainly occur within the soutpansberg mountain cheney et al 1990 which forms the northern boundary of the catchment it consists of marine and continental clastic deposits such as sandstones barker et al 2006 in most places the rocks contain an intercalation of volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks geng et al 2014 large part of the low lying areas is covered by alluvial sediments that are characterized by sandy texture since they are primarily derived from fractured granites fig 5 and gneisses fig 3 the basement rocks have been intruded by dolerite dykes often highly fractured fig 6 the regional alignment of dolerites in different directions forms a network of interconnected structures the hout river shear zone hrsz cross cut the catchment in the e w direction with almost equal portion fig 4 based on the structural record the section of the catchment located to the north of the hrsz is intensively faulted with predominantly ne oriented structures besides the aeromagnetic map of the study area shows areas of high magnetic anomalies along the soutpansberg mountain and dolerite dykes predominantly trending ne magnetic methods are commonly used to delineate some features affecting groundwater flow such as intrusive rocks geological contacts and dykes additionally aeromagnetic data are best used in the interpretation of structures with magnetic nature as well as faults and lineaments according to reeves 2005 mafic dykes retain residual magnetism formed when magma was rapidly cooled after emplacement other magnetic signatures associated with dykes occur along contact aureole which also gives pronounced magnetic anomalies reeves 2005 the aeromagnetic map fig 7 exhibits both positive and negative anomalies largely influenced by geological structures such as faults and dykes qualitative analysis of the aeromagnetic data shows that positive magnetic anomalies 404 nt coincide with granites the soutpansberg group rocks greenstone remnants and dolerite dykes with a general trend of ne sw direction the high magnetic signatures along the soutpansberg mountain are related to volcanic layers within the volcano sedimentary sequence of the soutpansberg group rocks high magnetic anomalies are also associated with greenstone belts as a result of iron rich layer underneath the younger successions the areas of negative anomalies showing a general trend of ne sw have amplitudes in the range of 46 nt to 280 nt and are related to highly weathered zones therefore these areas could be considered as sites with high groundwater storage the areas with positive magnetic anomalies can potentially influence groundwater flow and its spatial occurrence based on the aeromagnetic and structural evidence dolerite dykes show dominantly parallel pattern with the ne trend where the dykes seem to be superimposed along with the positive magnetic anomalies sakala et al 2014 interpreted the continuous and parallel characteristics of the dykes as an indication of emplacement in an extensional crustal regime along zones of weakness due to earth s crust pulling apart however not all superimposed dykes and lineaments in the aeromagnetic map coincide with high magnetic anomalies indicating that some of these dykes may not be magnetic 1 2 hydrogeological setting the main aquifers that occur within the crystalline rocks of the hout river granitic gneiss and goudplaats granitic gneiss are extensively weathered and fractured vegter 2003 reported that the hout river granitic gneiss has high productivity compared to the goudplaats granitic gneiss the least productive aquifer is represented by the younger granites characterized by less fracture occurrence and massive outcrops tectonic and geomorphological evolutions modified the original hydrogeological characteristics of the rocks subsequently forming a composite aquifer composed of weathered zone and underlying fractured crystalline bedrock holland 2011 explored different aspects of the geology and hydrogeology of the area at large to understand how hydraulic parameters influence aquifer transmissivity and ultimately borehole yield holland 2011 reported that high transmissivity values are associated with contact between the rocks pegmatite topographical lows and areas proximal to lineaments in crystalline aquifers geological structures are an integral part of the hydrogeological system which influence groundwater flow within the aquifer according to jolly 1986 and pietersen et al 2011 three distinct aquifers exist within the limpopo plateau namely the composite aquifer deeply fractured aquifer and the alluvial aquifer the composite aquifer is characterized by weathered zones underlain by fractured basement rocks on the other hand deeply fractured aquifer consists of the interconnected network of fractures the alluvial aquifer resulted from a reworked weathered material that formed laterally narrow and shallow reservoirs along river channels pietersen et al 2011 the thickness of the upper weathered zone ranges from 12 to 50 m while the fractured aquifer extends to a depth greater than 120 m dziembowski 1976 jolly 1986 vegter 2003 pietersen et al 2011 holland 2011 however the exposed thickness of the regolith varies between 5 m and 10 m along the river valley fig 8 the storage coefficients of the upper weathered and lower fractured zones of the composite aquifer are 0 01 and 0 0025 respectively jolly 1986 due to low permeability of the weathered zone low borehole yields were recorded with a mean yield of 1 ℓ s while in the fractured zone the borehole yield reaches 40 ℓ s pietersen et al 2011 holland 2011 correlated the trend of dykes and borehole productivity and showed that high mean transmissivities are related to ne ene and wnw trending dykes and lower transmissivity in the nw and nne trending dykes particularly the depths of weathering and fracturing are higher where the hout river gneiss overlie the younger granitic intrusions especially in the southern part of the catchment however towards the north eastern part of the catchment the importance of alluvial weathered zone increases due to higher thickness and episodic recharge from the river itself the connectivity of fractures and nature of the granites ensure high transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity in facilitating local and regional circulation the transmissivities of the aquifer vary between 4 m2 d and 40 m2 d with high values around the mogwadi area holland 2011 the prominent aquifers that act as the main water bearing units at shallow depth along the hout river are composed of sand from weathering of gneisses and granites according to vegter 2003 in this aquifer water strikes are mostly between 30 m and 50 m below surface while the probability of striking water down to 75 m is high in the hout river granitic gneiss in the younger granitic batholiths that are less weathered but fractured the water strike ranges between 15 m and 50 m below surface vegter 2003 in the past decades various recharge estimation techniques were applied to understand groundwater recharge in the crystalline aquifer in the limpopo province bredenkamp et al 1995 mandiwana 2004 holland 2011 ebrahim et al 2019 crystalline aquifers in semi arid environments are replenished during episodic rainfall events through torrential rainfalls and floods van wyk 2010 abiye 2016 therefore a recharge amount of 0 5 of mean annual precipitation map was obtained by holland 2011 through the chloride mass balance cmb method and 0 7 8 of map by bredenkamp et al 1995 masiyandima et al 2002 also estimated values in the range of 2 5 from 400 mm map while dziembowski 1976 estimated recahrge of about 3 8 of map furthermore ebrahim et al 2019 developed a numerical model for the hrc to understand sustainability of groundwater pumping for irrigation and groundwater flow dynamics for irrigation the model provided pumping values within the range of 13 9 to 19 3 mm3 year for the simulation period between 2008 and 2015 groundwater abstraction for irrigation was also estimated on the basis of irrigated crop area delineated using landsat normalized difference vegetation index and crop water requirements ebrahim et al 2019 the mean annual simulated irrigation pumping for the period 2008 2015 was 6 9 mm year 17 mm3 year the mean annual irrigation licensed volume aggregated for all licensed farmers for the same period was 11 3 mm year 28 0 mm3 year the analysis shows that the licensed volume is almost twice the actual irrigation pumping calculated based on the optimal crop water requirements the possible explanation for the difference between the licensed irrigation volume and the simulated irrigation pumping could be that farmers are abstracting less than their allotted amounts or it could be that farmers were licensed more than what they need presently in order to secure water for future agricultural expansion if the first is the case then farmers pump less because of physical or economic constraints in terms of accessing groundwater which indicates that licensed volumes are likely exaggerated in terms of what the aquifer can provide sustainably even today it is important to note that the irrigation pumping reported in this study is conservative i e on the high side as it assumes groundwater pumping equivalent to optimal crop irrigation requirements which may not hold true however according to jolly 1986 groundwater abstraction for irrigation three decades ago was in the order of 21 mm3 year with an irrigated area of 3579 ha with about 1 mm3 year for livestock watering 2 materials and methods the in situ measurements of temperature ph electrical conductivity and oxidation reduction potential were performed with crison mm 40 and aquaread multi parameter instruments after onsite calibration data on groundwater level and drill log were obtained from the national groundwater archives nga and groundwater resource information project grip department of water and sanitation south africa geological and aeromagnetic data were obtained from the council for geoscience south africa meteorological data were gathered from the south african weather service to understand the groundwater flow pattern and its relationship with the magnetic anomalies water levels were collected and interpreted from 77 monitoring boreholes that are spatially distributed across the catchment fig 9 the groundwater level elevation above mean sea level was obtained by subtracting the static water level from the surface elevation based on the aster digital elevation model with 30 m 30 m resolution the corrected groundwater elevations were then used to create a groundwater flow map for the catchment using surfer 15 software for stable isotopes of 18o and 2h 17 groundwater one river one dam one spring and 26 rainfall samples were collected by using 10 mℓ glass bottle the stable isotope samples were analyzed using the liquid water isotope analyzer model 45 ep at the university of the witwatersrand south africa the precision of measurement was approximately 1 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o in liquid water samples the analysis was done against five standards of known isotopic signatures ten groundwater samples were collected for 14c and 13c analysis where barium carbonate baco3 was precipitated from 50 ℓ of the water sample to precipitate the baco3 which was required for the analysis purified naoh was added in the 50 ℓ sample to increase the ph above 10 and was verified with phenolphthalein indicator finally bacl3 was added to precipitate barium carbonate the solution was then left for about 3 h and the precipitate was retrieved in 500 mℓ polyethylene bottle and transported in a cooler box to the laboratory for analysis to understand the source of rainfall it was important to compare how the slope and intercept of the stable isotopes of water deviate either from meteoric water line the d excess deuterium excess is a function of relative humidity above the ocean surface which indicates the conditions during the formation of vapour geyh et al 2000 being located in the semi arid region it was essential to understand the source of moisture that generates limited rainfall in the area which later act as a source for groundwater recharge therefore the distribution of d excess was assessed to deduce the moisture source and circulation the mean residence time mrt t based on the 14c activity was estimated based on equation 1 1 t 8267 l n a a o where t is mrt of groundwater between the time of recharge and groundwater abstraction a o represents the initial 14c activity while a is the final 14c activity measured in percent modern carbon pmc clark and fritz 1997 the wtf method equation 2 is applied to estimate point recharge using five monitoring boreholes located within the granitic gneisses and dolerites 2 r s y δ h δt where r is the recharge sy represents specific yield δ h is a change in the hydraulic head m m and δ t is a time of water level observation assuming that the geological material above the water table is at field capacity then the recharging water that causes a rise in water table occupies the effective porosity of the geological material hence appropriate determination of sy for the lithology at fluctuation depth is essential 3 results and discussion the measured ph values range from 6 9 to 8 8 table 1 this can be considered as normal for the environment characterized by water rock interaction through a natural process the lowest ph values are associated with ion leaching from the greenstone belts the oxidation reduction potential orp values range from 149 mv to 92 mv table 1 where the positive orp values suggest that groundwater occurs in an oxidizing environment which could further indicate the presence of an open system in the form of fracture controlled flow however in the case where deep groundwater displays positive orp such as borehole d3 to d5 with the depth ranging between 94 m and 110 m it could be related to the presence of iron in the water derived from the greenstones electrical conductivity ec revealed the presence of saline water with high ec values only one spring sample from the northern part of the catchment with recently recharged water contains low ec value of 49 0 μs cm and alkaline ph which could be due to leaching of soil carbonate in the southern part of the catchment ec ranges between 473 0 μs cm and 1228 0 μs cm in the central part of the catchment ec values range from 1035 0 μs cm to 2020 0 μs cm in the northern part of the catchment the ec values are in the range of 1227 0 μs cm the high ec could be due to solute leaching from the upper weathered zone as a result of prolonged water rock interaction besides high ec values recorded around the mogwadi area could be attributed to agricultural activity resulting in a salinity build up possibly as a result of the irrigation return this is due to the water use practice by farmers that irrigate from surface impoundment after pumping from boreholes fig 10 a practice that could facilitate evaporation of water thereby increasing salinity the physicochemical parameters for the boreholes sampled in the hrc are presented in table 1 the boreholes with shallow water levels in the hrc are in the range of 2 m 5 m b g l while along the hrsz groundwater level is in the range of 13 m b g l generally groundwater levels are higher where structures are densely concentrated and deep groundwater levels occur in areas with less occurrence of structural discontinuities even though the catchment was identified as semi arid with limited rainfall the shallow aquifer has good potential in groundwater storage derived from episodic rainfall the analysis of geological structures magnetic anomalies and the depth to groundwater levels indicate that the structural discontinuities in the area coincide with the variable magnetic anomalies that can potentially control groundwater occurrence it was also observed that structures with positive magnetic anomalies trend in the ne direction the groundwater level analysis indicates that the regional groundwater flow seems to be following similar direction ne sw as the structures it was deduced from this observation that the general trend of groundwater flow is dictated by the local faults and dykes which could indicate that groundwater occurrence in the area is structurally controlled this needs further investigation to ascertain the role of dykes and faults in the area based on the groundwater flow direction it is possible to deduce that predominantly groundwater recharge occurs in the southern part of the catchment fig 11 however the samples taken from shallow aquifer in the northern part of the catchment indicates the presence of recent recharge suggesting another recharge possibility in the area in the form of mountain front recharge the stable isotope results for δ18o and δ2h from rainfall groundwater hout river dam and spring samples are presented in table 2 the results were plotted against the pretoria local meteoric water line lmwl and the global meteoric water line gmwl fig 12 the slope and intercept of the lmwl are 6 7 and 7 2 that are lower than that of the gmwl 8 and 10 indicating relatively low humidity condition and signature of secondary evaporation in the area however most rainfall samples plotted above the lmwl indicate high humidity source due to condensation of air masses for the rainfall samples the mean d excess values are low indicating moisture from regional circulation due to the occurrence of high pressure cells in the southern africa region and moisture circulation that emanates from the south indian ocean and takes a long anticlockwise path to reach south africa abiye 2016 the average values of the stable isotopes presented in fig 12 exhibits distinctive evaporation effect δ18o 0 10 and δ2h 4 8 for surface water the rainfall samples showed relatively low values δ18o 0 10 and δ2h 10 1 highly depleted values are recorded for groundwater δ18o 4 52 and δ2h 29 0 which could indicate the possibility of depleted rainfall as a source of recharge after long atmospheric circulation the isotopic composition of rainfall samples has a mean value of δ2h and δ18o at 10 1 and 2 30 respectively during the sampling period nov 2016 to july 2017 rainfall amounts in the area ranged from 3 4 mm to 24 mm per day towards the southern portion of the catchment and 70 5 mm 34 5 mm per day around the mogwadi area towards the northern part of the catchment rainfall was in the range of 11 8 mm 120 4 mm per day however on annual basis the amount is very low as the rainfall is temporally limited to few days a year although variable rainfall amount was noted during the sampling period most of the results showed depleted values of δ18o and δ2h with few samples showing enriched values fig 12 the stable isotope record from groundwater samples revealed the mean value of 4 52 for δ18o and 29 0 for δ2h the highly depleted isotope values signify lack of evaporation prior to recharge and subsequent long term deep groundwater circulation within the aquifer the depleted isotope values with respect to the lmwl indicates the occurrence of recharge during colder climates in high humidity condition these samples have a small range of δ18o and δ2h values at 3 75 5 43 and 25 1 to 35 8 respectively suggesting regional moisture circulation in addition the plot for d excess and δ18o shows the dominance of low d excess values fig 13 which also supports a regional source for moisture however some rainfall events with enriched positive values in this case δ18o and depleted negative values δ2h and vice versa could suggest the presence of mixing of moisture from local and regional sources as a source for rainfall and hence groundwater recharge the stable isotope records show an inconsistent trend with some deep boreholes showing both depleted and enriched isotope signature which could be attributed to recharge from rainfall in different seasons with diverse isotope composition for example boreholes d7 and d8 have the deepest static water level of below 100 m b g l and show the most depleted δ18o values at 4 70 and 4 60 respectively on the other hand d4 also represents the deepest water levels at 110 m b g l and least depleted in δ18o at 3 72 furthermore d1 is one of the shallowest boreholes with groundwater level at 60 m b g l but amongst the most depleted with respects to δ18o at 4 45 this variability could suggest the occurrence of mixed groundwater and diversity in source rainfall where highly depleted stable isotopes exist at shallow level and less depleted stable isotopes occur at greater depth indicating variability in the characteristics of recharge it could also be due to faults fractures being intercepted by shallow boreholes allowing relatively deep groundwater to mix in significant way besides this distribution is not uniform even within a short distance between boreholes e g d1 d7 which were sampled in the same farm also suggests the possibility of hydrogeological dissimilarity as a result of geological structures that compartmentalized the aquifers in the eastern part of the catchment boreholes d11 to d13 stable isotopes are depleted below the depth of 100 m b g l this could suggest the presence of regional groundwater circulation from the high altitudes areas or recharge of highly depleted rainfall from regional moisture circulation it is also evident that water with diverse origin exists at a similar depth for example below 100 m d3 d4 d5 d6 d7 and d8 fig 14 this gives an evidence on the variability of recharge history and hydraulic properties of the rocks that dictate the recharge process and mixing among different groundwater components based on 14c results there is diverse mrt in the area with recent recharge situated in the shallow aquifer in the northern part of the area while the second category could be regarded as recharge that took place over hundreds to thousands of years ago 500 1400 years table 3 indicating substantially old groundwater which is being used for irrigation different sources of carbon ranging from co2 in soil magma hydrothermal fluids and carbonate minerals exist in nature geyh et al 2000 these sources make up the total dissolved carbons both organic and inorganic within groundwater and because of their distinctiveness they give rise to variable δ13c isotopic signatures in the study area the δ13c values range from 9 41 to 13 81 with an average value of 11 30 table 3 these results indicate a source of δ13cdic dissolved inorganic carbon from carbon fractionation through c4 plants photosynthetic cycle and carbon reduction processes in metamorphic and igneous rocks c4 plants have the range of δ13c values between 10 and 16 clark and fritz 1997 with some degree of δ13c being contributed by metamorphic and igneous rocks in the area the plot for 14c and δ13c fig 15 shows as the 14c values increase there is a corresponding decrease in the δ13c values indicating the presence of young groundwater with less dilution by dic as depicted for example by d15 sample in contrast decrease in the14c values is related to an increase in δ13c values when the mrt of groundwater is substantially longer however some samples d18 and d20 have values of 14c and δ13c at 88 10 2 5 pmc 9 41 and 87 70 2 5 10 67 respectively indicating mixing of water from different carbon sources and dilution of 14c by dic based on the stable isotope results groundwater recharge within the hrc occurs during the humid condition or colder climates with the moisture derived from regional source such as from the nearest indian ocean or high latitude regions after long moisture circulation based on the d excess values groundwater recharge also occurs from a mixture of different rainfalls in the area the groundwater samples with the highest mrt based on 14c of less than 100 pmc were recorded along the eastern southern and south eastern part of the catchment these results suggest the possibility of compartmentalization of crystalline aquifers or variability in the depth of circulation that is dictated by geological structures this was also confirmed from the aeromagnetic data groundwater recharge rate was computed from groundwater level fluctuation data from 2007 to 2015 to substantiate the groundwater characteristics obtained from the radiogenic and stable isotopes analyses based on equation 2 borehole intersecting gneisses with a specific yield of 0 02 resulted in groundwater recharge of 1 82 mm year it seems that the recharge is low which is related to low rainfall amount due to the fact that we might have also underestimated the specific yield besides sluggish water level response in the aquifers further work is necessary to improve the current understanding previous recharge estimations conducted in the area with a simple rainfall runoff models resulted recharge rates ranging from 1 76 to 17 82 mm year mandiwana 2004 while masiyandima et al 2002 estimated the range of 3 5 of map this further shows that even though the rainfall amount is low there is some local contribution for recharge in a limited area groundwater recharge rate in the dolerites with a specific yield of 0 01 is about 33 mm year while in the weathered zone it is 17 33 mm year table 4 the wide variation of groundwater recharge follows different properties of rocks of the aquifer in the area based on the wtf method for the year 2007 2015 the average groundwater recharge was estimated at 5 21 mm year 12 91 mm3 year which is equivalent to 1 7 of map table 4 it was evident that groundwater recharge was significantly lower than abstraction in dry years 2008 2009 and 2011 2012 as estimated by ebrahim et al 2019 with recharge raniging from 3 2 to 14 4 mm3 year the abstraction for irrigation varied between 15 1 and 18 6 mm3 year towards the south eastern part of the catchment the mrt of groundwater used for irrigation is high greater than 1000 years with low 14c content of less than 90 pmc in some places although the southern and southwestern part of the catchment acts as a headwater region groundwater contains the 14c activity of less than 90 pmc indicating the presence of groundwater with long residence time in the aquifer probably linked to the regional circulation the results might also suggest that the boreholes are tapping the lower confined aquifer with insignificant contribution from recent recharge 4 conclusions regional circulation of groundwater is prevalent in the catchment where the deeper aquifer contains water with long residence time the short residence time coincides with recharge areas along the soutpansberg mountain northern part of the catchment which suggests that this region acts as a potential source of localized recharge for the shallow aquifer from radiocarbon dating it was apparent that groundwater around the mogwadi south eastern and southern part of the catchment which is extensively used for commercial farming is recharged more than 1000 years ago the results portray that the occurrence of a weathered and deeply fractured aquifer in the catchment could facilitate longer residence of water in the crystalline aquifer it is also evident that the groundwater distribution pattern is also constrained by structures with a variable magnetic anomaly elevated groundwater levels are associated with a positive magnetic anomaly while the deeper groundwater levels are represented by negative magnetic anomalies areas with negative magnetic anomalies may likely represent the presence of groundwater in isolated compartments where groundwater resides for a long period as confirmed by carbon 14 activity of less than 90 pmc oxygen 18 and hydrogen 2 isotopic ratios revealed that hrc is receiving rainfall from a regional moisture source as witnessed by low deuterium excess the fractured aquifer does not show dilution by atmospheric carbon and increased dissolved solids although groundwater samples along the south western part of the catchment show less dissolved solids on the other hand the upper aquifer shows dilution of the radiocarbon suggesting mixing of different water in the area in general groundwater with different recharge and residence time is being exploited for large scale irrigation in the area significant recharge is limited to high rainfall events and does not always occur with every rainfall event balancing of recharge and exploitation might not be feasible in cases where old groundwater more than 1000 years is being exploited the important issue would be to balance abstraction and the episodic recharge which does not occur every year but only in heavy rainfall events in the catchment water conservation and managed aquifer recharge would be the most feasible way to manage the groundwater resources declaration of competing interest we declare that

12058,groundwaters mainly along the asahi river in maniwa city a mountainous area in okayama prefecture have been supplied as tap water to the residence to examine the source and water quality of the groundwaters chemical and isotopic δd and δ18o analyses were conducted on 58 shallow groundwater and 30 river water samples collected from 51 water intake facilities twice during winter february april and summer august september in 2017 three hot springs were also sampled the water temperatures of the groundwater in the northern area was almost constant throughout the year whereas seasonal temperature variation was observed in the other area groundwater samples were plotted along a line with slope 3 in a δd vs δ18o diagram both δd and δ18o of the groundwater showed tendencies to be low in the north and high in the south due to altitude effect the groundwater sampled here had low electric conductivity and samples in the north and south were rich in sio2 and ca2 hco3 respectively this strongly reflects the influence of regional geology containing diatomite in the north and limestone in the south these results indicate that the groundwater in maniwa city flows near the surface and that their residence times are several months except for groundwater in the northern mountains from the major and trace components the groundwater in maniwa city are judged to be safe as drinking and agricultural water graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater tap water source isotope water quality 1 introduction the spread rate of tap water in japan is currently 97 9 after ministry of health labour and welfare 2020a however in the mountainous areas where population density is low groundwater is still used as tap water the mountainous area of maniwa city okayama prefecture is one of the areas that falls under such a region maniwa city is located between latitudes 34 9 and 35 3 in the mountainous area of okayama prefecture in western japan fig 1 a the northernmost part of the city

2019 after maniwa city in maniwa city the villages are dispersed in each water system and it is difficult to secure a large amount of water source in addition good quality groundwater such as shiogama cold spring which was selected as one of the 100 prestigious water agencies of the environment agency and valley water have been obtained the construction of water supply facilities that cover the entire area was uncommon maniwa city buries pipes underground in the vicinity of asahi river and its major tributaries and supplies groundwaters to the residents as tap water fifty one health components such as bacteria e coli arsenic and its compounds trichlorethylene and so on are regularly examined to ensure the safety of tap water by maniwa city however the origin and flow pattern of the groundwater have not been investigated also major chemical compositions of the groundwaters were not analyzed it is noted that groundwater even near rivers is not necessarily derived from 100

the elevation of maniwa city increases from 150 m to 600 m and water samples were collected from different elevation in the same latitude fig 1b fig 2 is a geological map of maniwa city aist 2015 in the north mt daisen 1700 m in elevation consists of quaternary pleistocene volcanic ejecta and basaltic andesite lava and pyroclastic rocks the 1000 m ridgeline to the east of mt daisen including mt hiruzen consists of several lava flows of pyroxene and amphibole andesite from the pleistocene at the southern foot of mt hiruzen diatomaceous earth layers and sand gravel layers are widely distributed in the lower and upper layers respectively the diatomaceous earth layer is currently mined on a large scale which is characterized by the appearance of a clear striped pattern after agricultural groundwater research group 1986 from the south to the central part of maniwa city granitic rocks formed in the cenozoic period are widely distributed fig 2 mudstone formed in the late triassic period is widespread in the south and limestones formed in the mesozoic era are distributed to the south part of the bichu river in the okayama prefecture three major rivers flow south from the chugoku mountains to the seto inland sea the asahi yoshii and takahashi rivers since the total catchment area of these three water systems 6590 km2 ministry of land infrastructure and transport comprises more than 90 of the okayama prefecture it is used for a wide variety of purposes such as agricultural industrial domestic use and so on the combined watershed also includes several springs such as shiogama cold spring in maniwa city and omachi cold spring in okayama city the source of the asahi river is in maniwa city several of its major tributaries e g the shinjo meki and bichu rivers join the asahi in this region fig 3 the average annual temperatures from 2011 to 2017 at kuse in the south and at kaminagata in the north fig 3 are about 13 6 c and 11 4 c respectively japan meteorological agency 2019 throughout maniwa city daily air temperatures exceed 30 c in the summer and drop below 0 c during winter annual precipitation at kuse and kaminagata is about 1500 mm and 2500 mm respectively which reflects the large difference in precipitation patterns between the southern and northern areas in maniwa city the northernmost part of maniwa city is in the chugoku mountain spine which causes orographic lift of siberian winter air masses that form over mainland china and pass over the sea of japan as a result much of this precipitation falls as snow during the winter 3 sample location and analytical procedures groundwater and river water samples in 5 catchments areas a to e were collected at 51 water intake facilities across maniwa city along with samples from three hot springs table 1 fig 3 in winter february april and summer august september of 2017 a total of 58 groundwater 30 river water and 6 hot spring water samples were examined tables 2 a and 2b with the cooperation of maniwa city and okayama health foundation water samples were classified as groundwater shallow well water spring water stream water or river water by the okayama health foundation for the purposes of this study groundwater shallow well water and cool spring water were classified as groundwater whereas river and stream waters were considered river water tables 2a and 2b hot spring water was defined by its high temperature at the time of sampling water temperature ph and electric conductivity ec were measured at the sampling site using a thermometer water proof digital thermometer yi chun ph meter ks 701 shindengen and ec meter b 173 horiba respectively in some locations the samples oxidation reduction potential orp was also measured using an orp meter rm 12p toa full water samples were collected in polyethylene bottles 1 l in volume and brought to the laboratory and immediately separated into two 250 ml bottles also a 100 ml aliquot was separated for trace element analysis which was filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter and added 1 ml of 6 n hno3 the rest of the samples was kept into 500 ml bottle sample water was filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter in preparation for instrument analysis such as ion chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and water isotope analysis oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios were analyzed using l2120 i and l2130 i picarro water isotope analyzers at the research institute for humanity and nature the results were reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water with an analytical precision of 1 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o alkalinity was determined using standard titration with hcl at the university of toyama dissolved ion concentrations were measured using conventional methods the major cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 were analyzed with an ion chromatograph ics 3000 dionex at the research institute for humanity and nature the charge balances of the obtained results were within 5 and the analytical uncertainties on dissolved ion concentrations are also within 5 the silica concentration was quantified by the molybdenum yellow method at a measurement wavelength of 385 nm with a spectrophotometer uv 1280 shimadzu at the university of toyama the measurement error with this method was 3 for quantitative analysis of trace elements icp mass spectrometer 7700cx icp ms agilent technologies of okayama university institute of plant science and resource was used and concentration was determined by the calibration curve method with internal standard correction 4 results and discussion the results obtained in this study are shown in table 2 through 4 and in fig 4 through 10 where the sample location numbers m correspond to those in table 1 and fig 3 4 1 groundwater temperature underground temperature is generally constant throughout the year at depths of 10 m or more below the ground surface which will generally match the annual average temperature of the area e g yamamoto 1992 sekiya 2003 hanova and dowlatabadi 2007 as a result groundwater with a residence time of 1 year or more will be close to the average air temperature value in that area it is therefore possible to infer the residence time of groundwater by comparing the temperatures of the groundwater and river water to air temperature as a result water temperature is an important tracer for groundwater flow the distributions of groundwater temperatures during winter and summer are shown in fig 4 a where water temperatures of river waters are also shown in colors the average annual air temperatures measured at stations in the central region of maniwa city kuse and in the north kaminagata fig 3 are 13 6 c and 11 4 c respectively fig 4a demonstrates that groundwater temperatures in the northern area are lower than those in the southern area fig 4b illustrates the temperature differences across the region between summer and winter the groundwater temperatures in the northern m 28 m 44 and east central areas m 18 were almost constant throughout the year in contrast a large temperature difference was observed in the central area m 2 m 11 m 17 fig 4c e shows water and air temperature variation at sampling sites m 44 m 2 and m 42 over the course of 3 years 2016 2018 data from maniwa city at the sampling point m 44 in the northern area the water temperature was constant at approximately 9 c throughout the year fig 4c in contrast at the sampling point m 2 the water temperature showed almost the same value as the air temperature and showed the same behavior as the monthly temperature change fig 4d at the sampling point m 42 located in the southern part of maniwa city the water temperature shows the same seasonal change as the air temperature but fluctuates in the range of 17 3 c fig 4e fig 4f plots the groundwater temperature during winter against groundwater temperature during summer for 5 areas in fig 3 this is another way to visualize the residence time of each site with longer residence times plotting closer to the 1 1 line in the study area the annual average temperature rises towards the south fig 4f indicates that the groundwaters at north area area a in fig 3 are plotted near this line especially m 44 and m 28 and have long residence time compared with groundwaters at southern and central area other sampling points near the next 1 1 line are m 5 in area c and m 18 in area d in the central area sampling points m 2 and m 11 in area c and m 17 in area d are farthest from the line this means that the residence time of these groundwaters is shorter than other area thus groundwater temperature change has become one of the effective tools to discuss its residence time 4 2 δd and δ18o of groundwater the δd and δ18o values of groundwater in the study area ranged from 56 to 47 and from 9 5 to 7 2 respectively table 2 fig 5 which were similar to the values of river water δd 55 to 46 and δ18o 9 2 to 7 9 most groundwater and river water samples fall far from a global meteoric water line δd 8δ18o 10 defined by craig 1961 the relationship between δd and δ18o for groundwater during winter fig 5a and summer fig 5b are described as δd 3 09δ18o 24 6 r2 0 81 and δd 2 42δ18o 30 7 r2 0 58 respectively the isotope compositions of the river water samples were somewhat dispersed compared to the groundwater samples the δd and δ18o values of the hot springs were only measured for summer samples and these values were lower than those of groundwater or river water table 2 fig 5b maniwa city is in a valley surrounded by high mountain ranges in the north east and west fig 5c illustrates the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters for each of the main five catchment areas fig 3 both δd and δ18o values of groundwaters increase from area a to area e with decrease of the latitude in each catchment a slope of the δd δ18o values of groundwaters seems to be 8 but most are scattered the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in area a are not significantly changed in winter and summer fig 5c on the other hand those of groundwaters in other areas tend to show different values in summer and winter these results combined with temperature profiles of groundwaters in areas b to e means that groundwaters in maniwa city except for area a may be directly derived from precipitation and discharge to river and surface within few months in toyama prefecture groundwater in the sho river alluvial fan has been measured as having a δd δ18o slope of 8 which is believed to be a mixture of river water and precipitation iwatake et al 2013 okakita et al 2019 in contrast yamada and ueda 2018 reported the relationship of δd 3 3δ18o 15 5 n 123 r2 0 60 for groundwater samples in sabae city in fukui prefecture fig 1a yabusaki 2016 also measured a relationship of δd 5 4δ18o 9 4 n 339 r2 0 94 for groundwater samples in fukushima prefecture northern japan the observed δd δ18o ratios in maniwa city is similar to latter two examples kumar et al 2011 2013 examined δd δ18o ratios of groundwater and surface water in four regions around delhi india and reported the δd δ18o ratios in high elevation forest area to be 4 76 with d excess value of 5 38 they demonstrated that most data in this region fall on the left side of the regional meteoric water line indicating recirculation of precipitation moisture as secondary precipitation and that this is possible in this zone due to its high elevation and the coverage of thick forest isotope analysis of groundwater observed in maniwa city is similar to the one in delhi india kumar et al 2011 2013 and δd δ18o values became about 3 due to the altitude effect of precipitation 4 3 altitude and latitude inland effects on δd and δ18o of groundwater fig 6 shows the changes in δd and δ18o of groundwater with elevation in maniwa city the elevation of the land surface increases from 150 m to 600 m with the increase of latitude fig 1b both δd and δ18o values for groundwater have a negative correlation with elevation fig 6a and b 1 δ 18 o 0 0034 h 7 2 r 2 0 73 2 δd 0 0091 h 47 r 2 0 48 where h is the elevation in masl the δ18o fig 6a shows much clear tendency compared to the δd fig 6b eliminating h from equations 1 and 2 yields the equation 3 δd 2 67 δ 18 o 27 7 this result is quite similar to the relationship observed in groundwaters fig 5 a and b further reinforcing our conclusion that the altitude effect drives the inland effect in our study area for each 100 m change in elevation δd and δ18o changed by 1 0 and 0 34 in winter and 1 1 and 0 39 in summer respectively the altitude effect observed for precipitation by other researchers is typically between 1 5 and 4 for δd and between 0 12 and 1 for δ18o in each 100 m change of elevation dansgaard 1964 waseda and nakai 1983 mizutani and satake 1997 clark and fritz 1997 rong et al 2012 windhorst et al 2013 rong et al 2012 observed a relationship between elevation and δ18o in river water in the southern himalayas 2000 5000 masl and reported a rate of 0 36 100 m r2 0 90 which is similar to our results even though our samples are from groundwater katsuyama et al 2015 compiled δd and δ18o data from streams across japan and showed an altitude effect of 0 28 100 m r2 0 30 for δ18o yabusaki 2016 reported δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in fukushima prefecture northeast japan and that they decreased from 0 to 150 km from the pacific coast which equated to an elevation increase from 0 to 1500 masl the altitude effects in this region are 0 3 100 m and 1 8 100 m for δd and δ18o respectively in sabae city in fukui prefecture fig 1a the altitude effects on groundwater isotopes have been reported as 1 9 100 m for δ18o yamada and ueda 2018 which is a larger than our results research in toyama prefecture along the sea of japan fig 1a found that the altitude effects on δd and δ18o in river water were 1 9 100 m and 0 24 100 m respectively mizutani and satake 1997 which is more similar to our results the δd and δ18o values of river water samples show much poor altitude effects compared to those of groundwaters 4 4 δd and δ18o of groundwaters at different catchment areas and their relation to precipitations precipitation samples were monthly collected at 5 observation sites across okayama and tottori prefectures in 2011 2018 and analyzed for their δd and δ18o values and chemical compositions by fujiike 2017 and other members at okayama university the data at okutsu fig 1a in 2016 and 2017 are used in this study to discuss the source of groundwater in maniwa city the seasonal variations in δd and δ18o values and amount of precipitation are shown for a two year period in fig 7 a to d although the δd and δ18o values of precipitations largely vary from 112 to 27 and 15 0 to 4 3 respectively table 3 the δd and δ18o values vary widely and these are no significant correlation between their values and month in contrast d excess values d 8δ18o δd craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 have good correlation with month fig 7c fig 7e shows δd and δ18o values of precipitation at okutsu with those of groundwaters in winter and summer the precipitations are plotted along local meteoric water line δd δ18o 8 with different d excess values from 10 to 30 the precipitation samples collected from april to september and in november to january are plotted along the meteoric lines with d 10 and 30 respectively precipitation samples collected in other months are plotted between the two meteoric water lines fig 7e katsuyama et al 2015 compiled 298 precipitation samples in japan and found a good correlation of δd 7 03δ18o 7 91 n 298 r2 0 93 between δd and δ18o ichiyanagi and tanoue 2016 reported that spatial distributions of δd δ18o slope and annual mean d excess of the local meteoric water line in precipitations at 56 sites across japan are 7 6 8 6 and 8 21 respectively similar findings have been reported elsewhere e g petit et al 1991 delmotte et al 2000 peng et al 2004 wassenaar et al 2011 windhorst et al 2013 okakita et al 2019 the annual average value of precipitation for 1 year before sampling in winter and summer considering the amount was in the range of δd 49 and 50 and δ18o 8 2 and 7 8 respectively table 3 these average δd and δ18o values are quite similar to those of groundwater in areas c and d isotopic compositions of monthly precipitation change drastically however precipitation amount weighted isotopic composition lies close to the isotopic compositions of groundwaters at area c and d whose elevations are similar to okutsu observation site it suggests that the groundwaters in maniwa city are recharged by precipitation and that the distribution of isotopic compositions of groundwaters from different areas are affected by isotopic altitude effect of precipitation the isotopic compositions of groundwaters except for area a are different between winter and summer this may be due to the large seasonal variation of isotopic composition of precipitation and short residence time of groundwaters the isotopic compositions of river water samples show different isotopic trend compared to those of groundwaters thus contribution of river water to groundwater systems is negligible 4 5 major chemical composition there is no significant difference in ec values of groundwaters between winter and summer table 2 groundwater samples with high ec 20 ms m were primarily distributed along the bichu river m 41 m 42 and m 43 as well as at sampling sites m 25 and m 39 table 2 fig 8 a and b provide stiff and piper diagrams respectively for the main dissolved components of groundwater river water and hot spring water we identified no clear differences in chemical constituents between winter and summer samples and only summer data are plotted these geochemical characteristics are quite similar to groundwaters observed in alluvial fans in japan e g iwatake et al 2013 yamada and ueda 2018 the groundwater samples in the southern region contained elevated concentrations of ca2 and hco3 which is likely related to the paleozoic carbonate rocks distributed there fig 2 fig 9 a shows the relationship between ca2 and hco3 the solid line in fig 9a corresponds to carbonate dissolution with co2 contribution eq 4 this result demonstrates that most groundwater samples in this area dissolves carbonate minerals and becomes enriched in ca2 and hco3 4 caco3 h2o co2 ca2 2hco3 fig 9b and c shows the na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 weight ratios of groundwater and river water showing the extent of the rock water reaction proposed by gibbs 1970 except for sampling site m 25 the na na ca2 diagram in fig 9b shows that the rock water reaction of groundwater is more advanced than that of river water further the fact that the cl cl hco3 weight ratios are decreasing due to the reaction with rocks suggest that the concentration of hco3 in groundwater is increasing due to the reaction with carbonate rocks groundwater at sampling point m 25 is in the yubara hot spring area fig 3 and has higher na and cl concentrations than other groundwater this suggests that the groundwater may have been affected by hot spring water the concentration of sio2 in groundwater is one of the most powerful tools available for determining the residence time of groundwater katsuyama et al 2005 narimiya et al 2009 ishibashi et al 2012 gbadebo et al 2013 rautio and korkka niemi 2015 marçais et al 2018 sospedra et al 2018 the sio2 concentrations of the groundwater did not change by season despite variations in water temperature the groundwater in the north area was richer in sio2 than the other areas tables 2a and 2b since the water temperature there was constant the residence time of this groundwater seems to be relatively long however the concentrations of other major components such as na k ca2 etc did not show particularly high values in the northern part of maniwa city is home to diatomaceous earth formations groundwater may be flowing through a layer of diatomaceous earth which has a high degree of permeability diatomaceous earth has a fine particle size and a large surface area per volume so it readily leaches sio2 into groundwater which can become enriched in sio2 4 6 source of groundwater in maniwa city geochemical characteristics of groundwater in maniwa city are its low ec values and the slope of 3 in the δd vs δ18o diagram due to the altitude effect in addition the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters except for area a change with season based on these results all groundwater in maniwa city except for area a is considered to be derived from several months of precipitation rather than one year of precipitation in the area a water temperature of the groundwater was almost constant throughout the year and the isotopic composition does not change significantly from this fact the groundwater in the area a seems to have a residence time of more than one year the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in area a are lower than those of weight averaged value of precipitation for 1 year fig 7e the precipitation data was obtained at the sampling site 20 km east of the study area and we have no isotopic data of precipitation at five areas in maniwa city all groundwaters are of meteoric origin mainly from precipitation the observed δd and δ18o values of groundwaters show the altitude effect fig 6 therefore we estimated that the source of groundwaters in the area a is derived from precipitation with the altitude effect the similar observation δd δ18o 4 76 and d excess value 5 38 was also reported by kumar et al 2011 2013 in groundwater and surface water at high elevation forest area around delhi india they demonstrated that most data in this region fall on the left side of the regional meteoric water line indicating recirculation of precipitation moisture as secondary precipitation isotope analysis of groundwater observed in maniwa city is similar to the one in delhi india kumar et al 2011 2013 and δd δ18o values became about 3 due to the altitude effect of precipitation in the area b the groundwater has the most variable δd and δ18o values and shows different isotopic composition in summer and winter fig 5c from this result the groundwater in this area is estimated to be strongly affected by seasonal precipitation and the residence time is short this is consistent with the result that the groundwater temperature varies considerably between summer and winter although the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in area b are close to the weight averaged values of precipitation the observed temperature and isotopic features indicate that the source of groundwater in the area b come from precipitation several months ago in this study hot spring water at 3 locations in area b was analyzed table 2 the isotopic composition of hot spring water in summer is lower than that of groundwater in area b the water temperature of the hot spring water is as high as 34 46 c but the ec value is almost the same as that of the ground water or slightly higher therefore it is considered that the precipitation infiltrates deep and is heated by heat conduction and gushes out with a short retention time in area c groundwater is characterized by large changes in water temperature between summer and winter fig 4f similar to area b but its seasonal variation of δd and δ18o is smaller than that of area b and the δd δ18o ratio is almost 8 this may suggest that the residence time of groundwater in area c is longer than the groundwater in area b in the area d the groundwater shows a higher δd and δ18o values than those in area c due to the altitude effect and its isotopic composition is close to the annual weighted isotopic composition of precipitation the temperature change in summer and winter is similar to area c fig 4f these suggest that the groundwater in area d has a relatively long residence time the large change in temperature in summer and winter is that groundwater in this area flows at a shallow depth 10 m like the groundwater in area c in the area e the groundwater has the highest δd and δ18o values in maniwa city and is close to the global meteoric water line d 10 they are characterized by a different isotope composition in summer and winter as for the groundwater in summer it is highly possible that the precipitation from april to august is mixed in any proportion and in the winter it may be affected by the precipitation from september to march the large change of groundwater temperature in the area e in summer and winter fig 4f is that groundwater in this area flows at a shallow depth 10 m within few months from the above discussion groundwater in maniwa city is thought to be formed from precipitation and has an altitude effect groundwater in the north has a small temperature difference between winter and summer and the rock water reaction has promoted leaching of sio2 from diatomaceous earth it is considered that the northern groundwater has long residence time groundwaters in other areas have a large temperature difference between the winter and summer seasons they are expected to spring out in a few months or at a depth of 10m or less 4 7 suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is an important consideration in maniwa city since it is the main source of drinking and irrigation waters higher levels of dissolved ions in irrigated water leads to physical and chemical damages of human crops and soil e g ravikumar et al 2011 fig 10 shows na vs ec of the groundwater in the study area all groundwater samples were plotted in the region of very good one in order to examine the anthropogenic effects on groundwater in the study area trace elements in groundwater river water and hot spring waters in maniwa city were measured one to three times at the same location table 4 however the sampling time of the water samples are different from those of analyzing the isotope composition and main chemical components table 2 table 4 also shows drinking water quality standards in japan after ministry of health labour and welfare 2020b all elements in water samples are below drinking water quality standards maniwa city regularly examines fifty one health components such as bacteria e coli trichlorethylene and so on to ensure the safety of tap water for example the results showed that the e coli was always not detected and trichlorethylene are less than 0 01 mg l maniwa city 2020 other components are also below the standard values maniwa is a depopulated city with 45 000 residents in an area of 828 km2 and anthropogenic effects are assumed to be low these data with our results show that groundwater in maniwa city is safe for drinking and irrigation 5 conclusions in maniwa city surrounded by mountains with a steep topography the groundwater originates from precipitation and the residence time in the mountainous region in the north is expected to be more than one year on the other hand in other areas there are differences in water temperature and hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition between summer and winter so that the residence time is considered to be short but the reaction with rocks is advanced and it is assumed that it is rich in ca2 hco3 and cl from the major and trace components the groundwater in maniwa city are judged to be safe as drinking and agricultural water declaration of competing interest no acknowledgments the authors wish to thank members of

12058,groundwaters mainly along the asahi river in maniwa city a mountainous area in okayama prefecture have been supplied as tap water to the residence to examine the source and water quality of the groundwaters chemical and isotopic δd and δ18o analyses were conducted on 58 shallow groundwater and 30 river water samples collected from 51 water intake facilities twice during winter february april and summer august september in 2017 three hot springs were also sampled the water temperatures of the groundwater in the northern area was almost constant throughout the year whereas seasonal temperature variation was observed in the other area groundwater samples were plotted along a line with slope 3 in a δd vs δ18o diagram both δd and δ18o of the groundwater showed tendencies to be low in the north and high in the south due to altitude effect the groundwater sampled here had low electric conductivity and samples in the north and south were rich in sio2 and ca2 hco3 respectively this strongly reflects the influence of regional geology containing diatomite in the north and limestone in the south these results indicate that the groundwater in maniwa city flows near the surface and that their residence times are several months except for groundwater in the northern mountains from the major and trace components the groundwater in maniwa city are judged to be safe as drinking and agricultural water graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater tap water source isotope water quality 1 introduction the spread rate of tap water in japan is currently 97 9 after ministry of health labour and welfare 2020a however in the mountainous areas where population density is low groundwater is still used as tap water the mountainous area of maniwa city okayama prefecture is one of the areas that falls under such a region maniwa city is located between latitudes 34 9 and 35 3 in the mountainous area of okayama prefecture in western japan fig 1 a the northernmost part of the city follows the dividing ridge of the kilometer high chugoku mountains that define the border with tottori prefecture the population and land area of maniwa city are 45 635 and 828 km2 respectively as of 2019 after maniwa city in maniwa city the villages are dispersed in each water system and it is difficult to secure a large amount of water source in addition good quality groundwater such as shiogama cold spring which was selected as one of the 100 prestigious water agencies of the environment agency and valley water have been obtained the construction of water supply facilities that cover the entire area was uncommon maniwa city buries pipes underground in the vicinity of asahi river and its major tributaries and supplies groundwaters to the residents as tap water fifty one health components such as bacteria e coli arsenic and its compounds trichlorethylene and so on are regularly examined to ensure the safety of tap water by maniwa city however the origin and flow pattern of the groundwater have not been investigated also major chemical compositions of the groundwaters were not analyzed it is noted that groundwater even near rivers is not necessarily derived from 100 river water and precipitation is also mixed e g iwatake et al 2013 okakita et al 2019 the purpose of this study is to geochemically investigate the origin and flow pattern of groundwater at water intake facilities in maniwa city and obtain basic data for stable and safe supply as a tap water source chemical and isotopic δd and δ18o analyses were conducted on 58 shallow groundwater and 30 river water samples collected twice during winter and summer three hot springs were also sampled many researchers have studied the chemistry and hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in japanese groundwater to

analyses to study the water of the main rivers recently groundwater was examined in okayama kida 2016 and akaiwa konishi 2017 which are both south of maniwa city using hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and chemical compositions to apply the groundwater to use the heat source for a ground source heat pump system fujiike 2017 monthly collected precipitation samples from 2011 to 2017 at 5 observation sites 20 km east of maniwa city and analyzed for their isotopic d and 18o and chemical compositions and a part of these data at okutsu fig 1a were used for discussion of origin of groundwaters in maniwa city 2 outline of geology in the study area maniwa city is located in okayama prefecture in the western portion of japan s main island to the north of the seto inland sea fig 1a from south to north the elevation of maniwa city increases from 150 m to 600 m and water samples were collected from different elevation in the same latitude fig 1b fig 2 is a geological map of maniwa city aist 2015 in the north mt daisen 1700 m in elevation consists of quaternary pleistocene volcanic ejecta and basaltic andesite lava and pyroclastic rocks the 1000 m ridgeline to the east of mt daisen including mt hiruzen consists of several lava flows of pyroxene and amphibole andesite from the pleistocene at the southern foot of mt hiruzen diatomaceous earth layers and sand gravel layers are widely distributed in the lower and upper layers respectively the diatomaceous earth layer is currently mined on a large scale which is characterized by the appearance of a clear striped pattern after agricultural groundwater research group 1986 from the south to the central part of maniwa city granitic rocks formed in the cenozoic period are widely distributed fig 2 mudstone formed in the late triassic period is widespread in the south and limestones formed in the mesozoic era are distributed to the south part of the bichu river in the okayama prefecture three major rivers flow south from the chugoku mountains to the seto inland sea the asahi yoshii and takahashi rivers since the total catchment area of these three water systems 6590 km2 ministry of land infrastructure and transport comprises more than 90 of the okayama prefecture it is used for a wide variety of purposes such as agricultural industrial domestic use and so on the combined watershed also includes several springs such as shiogama cold spring in maniwa city and omachi cold spring in okayama city the source of the asahi river is in maniwa city several of its major tributaries e g the shinjo meki and bichu rivers join the asahi in this region fig 3 the average annual temperatures from 2011 to 2017 at kuse in the south and at kaminagata in the north fig 3 are about 13 6 c and 11 4 c respectively japan meteorological agency 2019 throughout maniwa city daily air temperatures exceed 30 c in the summer and drop below 0 c during winter annual precipitation at kuse and kaminagata is about 1500 mm and 2500 mm respectively which reflects the large difference in precipitation patterns between the southern and northern areas in maniwa city the northernmost part of maniwa city is in the chugoku mountain spine which causes orographic lift of siberian winter air masses that form over mainland china and pass over the sea of japan as a result much of this precipitation falls as snow during the winter 3 sample location and analytical procedures groundwater and river water samples in 5 catchments areas a to e were collected at 51 water intake facilities across maniwa city along with samples from three hot springs table 1 fig 3 in winter february april and summer august september of 2017 a total of 58 groundwater 30 river water and 6 hot spring water samples were examined tables 2 a and 2b with the cooperation of maniwa city and okayama health foundation water samples were classified as groundwater shallow well water spring water stream water or river water by the okayama health foundation for the purposes of this study groundwater shallow well water and cool spring water were classified as groundwater whereas river and stream waters were considered river water tables 2a and 2b hot spring water was defined by its high temperature at the time of sampling water temperature ph and electric conductivity ec were measured at the sampling site using a thermometer water proof digital thermometer yi chun ph meter ks 701 shindengen and ec meter b 173 horiba respectively in some locations the samples oxidation reduction potential orp was also measured using an orp meter rm 12p toa full water samples were collected in polyethylene bottles 1 l in volume and brought to the laboratory and immediately separated into two 250 ml bottles also a 100 ml aliquot was separated for trace element analysis which was filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter and added 1 ml of 6 n hno3 the rest of the samples was kept into 500 ml bottle sample water was filtered through a 0 2 μm membrane filter in preparation for instrument analysis such as ion chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and water isotope analysis oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios were analyzed using l2120 i and l2130 i picarro water isotope analyzers at the research institute for humanity and nature the results were reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water with an analytical precision of 1 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o alkalinity was determined using standard titration with hcl at the university of toyama dissolved ion concentrations were measured using conventional methods the major cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 were analyzed with an ion chromatograph ics 3000 dionex at the research institute for humanity and nature the charge balances of the obtained results were within 5 and the analytical uncertainties on dissolved ion concentrations are also within 5 the silica concentration was quantified by the molybdenum yellow method at a measurement wavelength of 385 nm with a spectrophotometer uv 1280 shimadzu at the university of toyama the measurement error with this method was 3 for quantitative analysis of trace elements icp mass spectrometer 7700cx icp ms agilent technologies of okayama university institute of plant science and resource was used and concentration was determined by the calibration curve method with internal standard correction 4 results and discussion the results obtained in this study are shown in table 2 through 4 and in fig 4 through 10 where the sample location numbers m correspond to those in table 1 and fig 3 4 1 groundwater temperature underground temperature is generally constant throughout the year at depths of 10 m or more below the ground surface which will generally match the annual average temperature of the area e g yamamoto 1992 sekiya 2003 hanova and dowlatabadi 2007 as a result groundwater with a residence time of 1 year or more will be close to the average air temperature value in that area it is therefore possible to infer the residence time of groundwater by comparing the temperatures of the groundwater and river water to air temperature as a result water temperature is an important tracer for groundwater flow the distributions of groundwater temperatures during winter and summer are shown in fig 4 a where water temperatures of river waters are also shown in colors the average annual air temperatures measured at stations in the central region of maniwa city kuse and in the north kaminagata fig 3 are 13 6 c and 11 4 c respectively fig 4a demonstrates that groundwater temperatures in the northern area are lower than those in the southern area fig 4b illustrates the temperature differences across the region between summer and winter the groundwater temperatures in the northern m 28 m 44 and east central areas m 18 were almost constant throughout the year in contrast a large temperature difference was observed in the central area m 2 m 11 m 17 fig 4c e shows water and air temperature variation at sampling sites m 44 m 2 and m 42 over the course of 3 years 2016 2018 data from maniwa city at the sampling point m 44 in the northern area the water temperature was constant at approximately 9 c throughout the year fig 4c in contrast at the sampling point m 2 the water temperature showed almost the same value as the air temperature and showed the same behavior as the monthly temperature change fig 4d at the sampling point m 42 located in the southern part of maniwa city the water temperature shows the same seasonal change as the air temperature but fluctuates in the range of 17 3 c fig 4e fig 4f plots the groundwater temperature during winter against groundwater temperature during summer for 5 areas in fig 3 this is another way to visualize the residence time of each site with longer residence times plotting closer to the 1 1 line in the study area the annual average temperature rises towards the south fig 4f indicates that the groundwaters at north area area a in fig 3 are plotted near this line especially m 44 and m 28 and have long residence time compared with groundwaters at southern and central area other sampling points near the next 1 1 line are m 5 in area c and m 18 in area d in the central area sampling points m 2 and m 11 in area c and m 17 in area d are farthest from the line this means that the residence time of these groundwaters is shorter than other area thus groundwater temperature change has become one of the effective tools to discuss its residence time 4 2 δd and δ18o of groundwater the δd and δ18o values of groundwater in the study area ranged from 56 to 47 and from 9 5 to 7 2 respectively table 2 fig 5 which were similar to the values of river water δd 55 to 46 and δ18o 9 2 to 7 9 most groundwater and river water samples fall far from a global meteoric water line δd 8δ18o 10 defined by craig 1961 the relationship between δd and δ18o for groundwater during winter fig 5a and summer fig 5b are described as δd 3 09δ18o 24 6 r2 0 81 and δd 2 42δ18o 30 7 r2 0 58 respectively the isotope compositions of the river water samples were somewhat dispersed compared to the groundwater samples the δd and δ18o values of the hot springs were only measured for summer samples and these values were lower than those of groundwater or river water table 2 fig 5b maniwa city is in a valley surrounded by high mountain ranges in the north east and west fig 5c illustrates the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters for each of the main five catchment areas fig 3 both δd and δ18o values of groundwaters increase from area a to area e with decrease of the latitude in each catchment a slope of the δd δ18o values of groundwaters seems to be 8 but most are scattered the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in area a are not significantly changed in winter and summer fig 5c on the other hand those of groundwaters in other areas tend to show different values in summer and winter these results combined with temperature profiles of groundwaters in areas b to e means that groundwaters in maniwa city except for area a may be directly derived from precipitation and discharge to river and surface within few months in toyama prefecture groundwater in the sho river alluvial fan has been measured as having a δd δ18o slope of 8 which is believed to be a mixture of river water and precipitation iwatake et al 2013 okakita et al 2019 in contrast yamada and ueda 2018 reported the relationship of δd 3 3δ18o 15 5 n 123 r2 0 60 for groundwater samples in sabae city in fukui prefecture fig 1a yabusaki 2016 also measured a relationship of δd 5 4δ18o 9 4 n 339 r2 0 94 for groundwater samples in fukushima prefecture northern japan the observed δd δ18o ratios in maniwa city is similar to latter two examples kumar et al 2011 2013 examined δd δ18o ratios of groundwater and surface water in four regions around delhi india and reported the δd δ18o ratios in high elevation forest area to be 4 76 with d excess value of 5 38 they demonstrated that most data in this region fall on the left side of the regional meteoric water line indicating recirculation of precipitation moisture as secondary precipitation and that this is possible in this zone due to its high elevation and the coverage of thick forest isotope analysis of groundwater observed in maniwa city is similar to the one in delhi india kumar et al 2011 2013 and δd δ18o values became about 3 due to the altitude effect of precipitation 4 3 altitude and latitude inland effects on δd and δ18o of groundwater fig 6 shows the changes in δd and δ18o of groundwater with elevation in maniwa city the elevation of the land surface increases from 150 m to 600 m with the increase of latitude fig 1b both δd and δ18o values for groundwater have a negative correlation with elevation fig 6a and b 1 δ 18 o 0 0034 h 7 2 r 2 0 73 2 δd 0 0091 h 47 r 2 0 48 where h is the elevation in masl the δ18o fig 6a shows much clear tendency compared to the δd fig 6b eliminating h from equations 1 and 2 yields the equation 3 δd 2 67 δ 18 o 27 7 this result is quite similar to the relationship observed in groundwaters fig 5 a and b further reinforcing our conclusion that the altitude effect drives the inland effect in our study area for each 100 m change in elevation δd and δ18o changed by 1 0 and 0 34 in winter and 1 1 and 0 39 in summer respectively the altitude effect observed for precipitation by other researchers is typically between 1 5 and 4 for δd and between 0 12 and 1 for δ18o in each 100 m change of elevation dansgaard 1964 waseda and nakai 1983 mizutani and satake 1997 clark and fritz 1997 rong et al 2012 windhorst et al 2013 rong et al 2012 observed a relationship between elevation and δ18o in river water in the southern himalayas 2000 5000 masl and reported a rate of 0 36 100 m r2 0 90 which is similar to our results even though our samples are from groundwater katsuyama et al 2015 compiled δd and δ18o data from streams across japan and showed an altitude effect of 0 28 100 m r2 0 30 for δ18o yabusaki 2016 reported δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in fukushima prefecture northeast japan and that they decreased from 0 to 150 km from the pacific coast which equated to an elevation increase from 0 to 1500 masl the altitude effects in this region are 0 3 100 m and 1 8 100 m for δd and δ18o respectively in sabae city in fukui prefecture fig 1a the altitude effects on groundwater isotopes have been reported as 1 9 100 m for δ18o yamada and ueda 2018 which is a larger than our results research in toyama prefecture along the sea of japan fig 1a found that the altitude effects on δd and δ18o in river water were 1 9 100 m and 0 24 100 m respectively mizutani and satake 1997 which is more similar to our results the δd and δ18o values of river water samples show much poor altitude effects compared to those of groundwaters 4 4 δd and δ18o of groundwaters at different catchment areas and their relation to precipitations precipitation samples were monthly collected at 5 observation sites across okayama and tottori prefectures in 2011 2018 and analyzed for their δd and δ18o values and chemical compositions by fujiike 2017 and other members at okayama university the data at okutsu fig 1a in 2016 and 2017 are used in this study to discuss the source of groundwater in maniwa city the seasonal variations in δd and δ18o values and amount of precipitation are shown for a two year period in fig 7 a to d although the δd and δ18o values of precipitations largely vary from 112 to 27 and 15 0 to 4 3 respectively table 3 the δd and δ18o values vary widely and these are no significant correlation between their values and month in contrast d excess values d 8δ18o δd craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 have good correlation with month fig 7c fig 7e shows δd and δ18o values of precipitation at okutsu with those of groundwaters in winter and summer the precipitations are plotted along local meteoric water line δd δ18o 8 with different d excess values from 10 to 30 the precipitation samples collected from april to september and in november to january are plotted along the meteoric lines with d 10 and 30 respectively precipitation samples collected in other months are plotted between the two meteoric water lines fig 7e katsuyama et al 2015 compiled 298 precipitation samples in japan and found a good correlation of δd 7 03δ18o 7 91 n 298 r2 0 93 between δd and δ18o ichiyanagi and tanoue 2016 reported that spatial distributions of δd δ18o slope and annual mean d excess of the local meteoric water line in precipitations at 56 sites across japan are 7 6 8 6 and 8 21 respectively similar findings have been reported elsewhere e g petit et al 1991 delmotte et al 2000 peng et al 2004 wassenaar et al 2011 windhorst et al 2013 okakita et al 2019 the annual average value of precipitation for 1 year before sampling in winter and summer considering the amount was in the range of δd 49 and 50 and δ18o 8 2 and 7 8 respectively table 3 these average δd and δ18o values are quite similar to those of groundwater in areas c and d isotopic compositions of monthly precipitation change drastically however precipitation amount weighted isotopic composition lies close to the isotopic compositions of groundwaters at area c and d whose elevations are similar to okutsu observation site it suggests that the groundwaters in maniwa city are recharged by precipitation and that the distribution of isotopic compositions of groundwaters from different areas are affected by isotopic altitude effect of precipitation the isotopic compositions of groundwaters except for area a are different between winter and summer this may be due to the large seasonal variation of isotopic composition of precipitation and short residence time of groundwaters the isotopic compositions of river water samples show different isotopic trend compared to those of groundwaters thus contribution of river water to groundwater systems is negligible 4 5 major chemical composition there is no significant difference in ec values of groundwaters between winter and summer table 2 groundwater samples with high ec 20 ms m were primarily distributed along the bichu river m 41 m 42 and m 43 as well as at sampling sites m 25 and m 39 table 2 fig 8 a and b provide stiff and piper diagrams respectively for the main dissolved components of groundwater river water and hot spring water we identified no clear differences in chemical constituents between winter and summer samples and only summer data are plotted these geochemical characteristics are quite similar to groundwaters observed in alluvial fans in japan e g iwatake et al 2013 yamada and ueda 2018 the groundwater samples in the southern region contained elevated concentrations of ca2 and hco3 which is likely related to the paleozoic carbonate rocks distributed there fig 2 fig 9 a shows the relationship between ca2 and hco3 the solid line in fig 9a corresponds to carbonate dissolution with co2 contribution eq 4 this result demonstrates that most groundwater samples in this area dissolves carbonate minerals and becomes enriched in ca2 and hco3 4 caco3 h2o co2 ca2 2hco3 fig 9b and c shows the na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 weight ratios of groundwater and river water showing the extent of the rock water reaction proposed by gibbs 1970 except for sampling site m 25 the na na ca2 diagram in fig 9b shows that the rock water reaction of groundwater is more advanced than that of river water further the fact that the cl cl hco3 weight ratios are decreasing due to the reaction with rocks suggest that the concentration of hco3 in groundwater is increasing due to the reaction with carbonate rocks groundwater at sampling point m 25 is in the yubara hot spring area fig 3 and has higher na and cl concentrations than other groundwater this suggests that the groundwater may have been affected by hot spring water the concentration of sio2 in groundwater is one of the most powerful tools available for determining the residence time of groundwater katsuyama et al 2005 narimiya et al 2009 ishibashi et al 2012 gbadebo et al 2013 rautio and korkka niemi 2015 marçais et al 2018 sospedra et al 2018 the sio2 concentrations of the groundwater did not change by season despite variations in water temperature the groundwater in the north area was richer in sio2 than the other areas tables 2a and 2b since the water temperature there was constant the residence time of this groundwater seems to be relatively long however the concentrations of other major components such as na k ca2 etc did not show particularly high values in the northern part of maniwa city is home to diatomaceous earth formations groundwater may be flowing through a layer of diatomaceous earth which has a high degree of permeability diatomaceous earth has a fine particle size and a large surface area per volume so it readily leaches sio2 into groundwater which can become enriched in sio2 4 6 source of groundwater in maniwa city geochemical characteristics of groundwater in maniwa city are its low ec values and the slope of 3 in the δd vs δ18o diagram due to the altitude effect in addition the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters except for area a change with season based on these results all groundwater in maniwa city except for area a is considered to be derived from several months of precipitation rather than one year of precipitation in the area a water temperature of the groundwater was almost constant throughout the year and the isotopic composition does not change significantly from this fact the groundwater in the area a seems to have a residence time of more than one year the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in area a are lower than those of weight averaged value of precipitation for 1 year fig 7e the precipitation data was obtained at the sampling site 20 km east of the study area and we have no isotopic data of precipitation at five areas in maniwa city all groundwaters are of meteoric origin mainly from precipitation the observed δd and δ18o values of groundwaters show the altitude effect fig 6 therefore we estimated that the source of groundwaters in the area a is derived from precipitation with the altitude effect the similar observation δd δ18o 4 76 and d excess value 5 38 was also reported by kumar et al 2011 2013 in groundwater and surface water at high elevation forest area around delhi india they demonstrated that most data in this region fall on the left side of the regional meteoric water line indicating recirculation of precipitation moisture as secondary precipitation isotope analysis of groundwater observed in maniwa city is similar to the one in delhi india kumar et al 2011 2013 and δd δ18o values became about 3 due to the altitude effect of precipitation in the area b the groundwater has the most variable δd and δ18o values and shows different isotopic composition in summer and winter fig 5c from this result the groundwater in this area is estimated to be strongly affected by seasonal precipitation and the residence time is short this is consistent with the result that the groundwater temperature varies considerably between summer and winter although the δd and δ18o values of groundwaters in area b are close to the weight averaged values of precipitation the observed temperature and isotopic features indicate that the source of groundwater in the area b come from precipitation several months ago in this study hot spring water at 3 locations in area b was analyzed table 2 the isotopic composition of hot spring water in summer is lower than that of groundwater in area b the water temperature of the hot spring water is as high as 34 46 c but the ec value is almost the same as that of the ground water or slightly higher therefore it is considered that the precipitation infiltrates deep and is heated by heat conduction and gushes out with a short retention time in area c groundwater is characterized by large changes in water temperature between summer and winter fig 4f similar to area b but its seasonal variation of δd and δ18o is smaller than that of area b and the δd δ18o ratio is almost 8 this may suggest that the residence time of groundwater in area c is longer than the groundwater in area b in the area d the groundwater shows a higher δd and δ18o values than those in area c due to the altitude effect and its isotopic composition is close to the annual weighted isotopic composition of precipitation the temperature change in summer and winter is similar to area c fig 4f these suggest that the groundwater in area d has a relatively long residence time the large change in temperature in summer and winter is that groundwater in this area flows at a shallow depth 10 m like the groundwater in area c in the area e the groundwater has the highest δd and δ18o values in maniwa city and is close to the global meteoric water line d 10 they are characterized by a different isotope composition in summer and winter as for the groundwater in summer it is highly possible that the precipitation from april to august is mixed in any proportion and in the winter it may be affected by the precipitation from september to march the large change of groundwater temperature in the area e in summer and winter fig 4f is that groundwater in this area flows at a shallow depth 10 m within few months from the above discussion groundwater in maniwa city is thought to be formed from precipitation and has an altitude effect groundwater in the north has a small temperature difference between winter and summer and the rock water reaction has promoted leaching of sio2 from diatomaceous earth it is considered that the northern groundwater has long residence time groundwaters in other areas have a large temperature difference between the winter and summer seasons they are expected to spring out in a few months or at a depth of 10m or less 4 7 suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is an important consideration in maniwa city since it is the main source of drinking and irrigation waters higher levels of dissolved ions in irrigated water leads to physical and chemical damages of human crops and soil e g ravikumar et al 2011 fig 10 shows na vs ec of the groundwater in the study area all groundwater samples were plotted in the region of very good one in order to examine the anthropogenic effects on groundwater in the study area trace elements in groundwater river water and hot spring waters in maniwa city were measured one to three times at the same location table 4 however the sampling time of the water samples are different from those of analyzing the isotope composition and main chemical components table 2 table 4 also shows drinking water quality standards in japan after ministry of health labour and welfare 2020b all elements in water samples are below drinking water quality standards maniwa city regularly examines fifty one health components such as bacteria e coli trichlorethylene and so on to ensure the safety of tap water for example the results showed that the e coli was always not detected and trichlorethylene are less than 0 01 mg l maniwa city 2020 other components are also below the standard values maniwa is a depopulated city with 45 000 residents in an area of 828 km2 and anthropogenic effects are assumed to be low these data with our results show that groundwater in maniwa city is safe for drinking and irrigation 5 conclusions in maniwa city surrounded by mountains with a steep topography the groundwater originates from precipitation and the residence time in the mountainous region in the north is expected to be more than one year on the other hand in other areas there are differences in water temperature and hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition between summer and winter so that the residence time is considered to be short but the reaction with rocks is advanced and it is assumed that it is rich in ca2 hco3 and cl from the major and trace components the groundwater in maniwa city are judged to be safe as drinking and agricultural water declaration of competing interest no acknowledgments the authors wish to thank members of

plate and stainless steel ss sheet tray is used as a basin the inner surface of the basin is painted with black color for excellent absorption the surrounding heat loss from the basin is prevented by adding thermocol with a thickness of 50 mm and an aluminum foil is wrapped with the thermocol the schematic diagram of the cps is shown in fig 1 a the solar radiation is received by the transparent plate and transmitted to the basin some of radiation is reflected back to the atmosphere the brine is filled up to 0 02 m height in the basin the maximum radiation will be absorbed by the black coating inside the basin the radiation absorber at the top surface of the brine is heated and starts to evaporate the evaporation rate depends up on the solar radiation received by the brine the evaporated brine will be raised up to the lower surface of transparent plate due to the density difference between the brine and the evaporated brine inside the still the evaporated brine started to condense at the lower surface of the transparent plate because the temperature of the transparent plate lowers than the brine temperature the condensed distilled water drop slide down the transparent glass bottom and accumulated in the collecting jar the solar radiation is restricted inside the basin by shading the transparent plate as shown in fig 1 b the production of still water is similar to the cps but the effect of shading will be lowered the evaporation rate at the top surface of the brine it will slow down the productivity rate of distill water and accumulation in the collecting jar

june 2018 to may 2019 between 6 a m and 6 p m fig 3 the ambient temperature was increasing or decreasing when solar radiation is increases or decreases the experimentation on the cps and sps was conducted in may 2019 from 8 a m to 6 p m for receiving the maximum solar radiation inside the basin the yield in the cps from 8 a m to 1 p m was 1 60 kg and from 1 p m to 6 p m was 1 62 kg the yield of the distilled water was the same in the morning and evening because of the constant rise and decrease in solar radiation throughout the day the cumulative yield of distilled water of sps was lowered because of the restriction of solar radiation inside the basin the daily yield in the cps was 2 65 kg day and sps was 1 79 kg day fig 4 the daily yield from the sps was 32 lower than the cps the monthly yield and monthly thermal efficiency are calculated with respect to the number of cloudless days in a month fig 5 the entire cloudless days in between june 2018 to may 2019 was 256 the yearly yield and thermal efficiency were 678 40 kg m2 14 79 for cps and 460 80 kg m2 10 40 for sps the yearly yield decreased in sps was 0 32 compared to cps the electrical conductivity of the brine was 0 9 ds m and distilled water of cps and sps has 0 2 ds m at the end of energy analysis yearly epf for the cps was 1 36 and for the sps was 0 9 the epf varies from 6 8 to 40 9 in the cps and 4 51 to 27 08 in the sps for the number of expected life years varies from 5 to 30 years table 2 the epf is improved by increasing the number of expected life years the epf of the solar still is improved by increasing the yield of the distilled water in both the cps and sps the higher evaporative and condensate rate of the brine will give a higher yield the lcce varies from 29 6 to 30 4 in cps and 19 12 19 98 in sps for the number of expected life years of the still varies from 15 to 30 years which shows that there was a minimal improvement after 15 life years as shown in table 2 the thermal efficiency of the cps was 31 17 and sps was 20 75 the lcce and thermal efficiency are lowered in the sps because of the improper solar radiation the area of the basin is 0 5 m2 gives the lower lcce and thermal efficiency it can be improved by increasing the area of the basin also values show that there is more concentration needed for the selection of materials and types of fabrication methods to reduce pollution in the environment the co2 emission values are calculated for the number of expected life year varies from 5 to 30 years fig 6 a the co2 emission is decreasing with respect to the number of expected life years the co2 emission for the cps varies from 3 95 to 0 66 tons and for the sps it varies from 4 52 to 0 75 tons the variation of co2 emission values shows that both the still should have more than 15 life year s life to reduce pollution the co2 mitigation for the 15 years life of still was increased by 35 in the cps compared to the sps similarly for the 30 years the life of the still was increased by 34 as shown in fig 6 b the yield of the distilled water was a critical role for the deviation in both the still the co2 emission of 20 07 tons barred by using the cps for purification of salt water and similarly 13 19 tons barred by using the sps this shows the importance of renewable energy sources for reducing co2 emission the working day of the cps and sps should be more than the 275 days to higher yield and co2 mitigation the carbon credit and cash flow for the carbon trade were increasing with respect to the number of expected life years of the still fig 6 c and d the carbon credit for the 15 and 30 life years was rs 7708 and rs 15 814 for cps and rs 4998 and rs 10 395 for sps similarly the cash flow for carbon trade per kg of distilled water for cps was rs 11 35 and rs 23 28 and for sps were rs 10 9 and rs 22 67 the amount gained by the carbon credit will prompt the renewable energy use in commercial co2 emission can be decreased by increasing the uses of renewable energy devices the payback years of the cps and sps were calculated in term of carbon credit and number of expected life years if we sell the distilled water with the consideration of carbon credit in the indian market the return of the total price invested in the cps was 0 99 1 1 years and the sps was 1 57 1 79 years at the number of expected life year is 15years fig 7 the interest rate plays a significant role in the increase of payback years the government provides subsidies of 5 in the bank interest for renewable energy devices the payback year of cps was around 0 5 and sps was around 0 77 years the above all analyses deliver valuable evidence for promoting the use of solar still for purification of water the yearly yield and basin area are essential to increase the lcce and co2 mitigation table 3 the ssss rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016 gives more yearly yield lcce and co2 mitigation than the dsss dwivedi and tiwari 2010 the dsss dwivedi and tiwari 2010 has 2 m2 basin areas and a higher condensation area compare to ssss rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016 the location of experiments for dsss dwivedi and tiwari 2010 was in north india and ssss rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016 was in south india the solar radiation received higher in south india as compared to north india the higher solar radiation gives higher results for ssss the cascaded vertical dsss sharon and reddy 2015 was also experimented at south india and the absorber area is 4 m2 and it has given higher results among all compared solar still table 3 the solar radiation absorber area more than 2 4 m2 gives the higher yearly yield lcce and co2 mitigation the higher solar radiation and the maximum number of working days of the solar still produced a higher result 4 conclusion the study of the yearly performance energy and carbon analyses are investigated for cps and sps the yearly performance of the sps was lower than the cps the epf and lcce were higher in the cps the carbon analysis gives the impression of using eco friendly materials the fully shading given the lower result and examinations of the partial shading will be an experiment in the future for better understanding the effect of the shading on the transparent plate the following outcomes are observed during the experimentation and different analysis the co2 emission of 20 7 tons barred by using the cps for purification of saltwater similarly 13 2 tons barred by using the sps the co2 mitigation can be increased by the higher solar radiation higher absorber area and working days of the solar still if there is carbon credit consideration in selling the distilled water it will engorge people to use solar still which will minimize the co2emission the lcce was lower for cps and sps it can be improved by selecting eco friendly material and manufacture the embodied energy of the still is increased because of maintenance the ambient conditions of operating the solar still should have the average solar radiation of 700 w m2 day will give the higher lcce the payback analysis for cps is 0 52 years and sps is 0 82 years by selling the distilled water with a carbon credit declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

the method for calculating the co2 kg year emission co2 tons mitigation and carbon credit rs earned for the cps and sps were carried out in this research this is the opportunity to explain the relation of co2 associated with the solar still there was no co2 associated with the passive solar still but it can be associated with active solar still here fabrication material is processed from raw material the process of fabrication requires the several types of machines which is operated by the conventional electricity and for the materials transportation fuel is required to operate the engine these are the identified process which emits co2 to the environment the below calculation method explains the co2 associated with the solar still this research work is a critical factor for researchers to minimize co2 relations and produce better solar still the conversation of kg of co2 to the kwh in the indian condition was 1 58 kg of co2 per kwh dwivedi and tiwari 2010 kumar 2013 co2

tp is the total price of the solar still and i is the interest rate the total price of the cps was rs 7500 and the sps was rs 7700 the interest rate of the loan amount for the solar still materials fabrication and experimentation vary from 2 to 12 in india tiwari and khas 2009 kumar 2013 kumar and tiwari 2009 3 results and discussion the solar radiation and ambient temperature were measured from june 2018 to may 2019 between 6 a m and 6 p m fig 3 the ambient temperature was increasing or decreasing when solar radiation is increases or decreases the experimentation on the cps and sps was conducted in may 2019 from 8 a m to 6 p m for receiving the maximum solar radiation inside the basin the yield in the cps from 8 a m to 1 p m was 1 60 kg and from 1 p m to 6 p m was 1 62 kg the yield of the distilled water was the same in the morning and evening because of the constant rise and decrease in solar radiation throughout the day the cumulative yield of distilled water of sps was lowered because of the restriction of solar radiation inside the basin the daily yield in the cps was 2 65 kg day and sps was 1 79 kg day fig 4 the daily yield from the sps was 32 lower than the cps the monthly yield and monthly thermal efficiency are calculated with respect to the number of cloudless days in a month fig 5 the entire cloudless days in between june 2018 to may 2019 was 256 the yearly yield and thermal efficiency were 678 40 kg m2 14 79 for cps and 460 80 kg m2 10 40 for sps the yearly yield decreased in sps was 0 32 compared to cps the electrical conductivity of the brine was 0 9 ds m and distilled water of cps and sps has 0 2 ds m at the end of energy analysis yearly epf for the cps was 1 36 and for the sps was 0 9 the epf varies from 6 8 to 40 9 in the cps and 4 51 to 27 08 in the sps for the number of expected life years varies from 5 to 30 years table 2 the epf is improved by increasing the number of expected life years the epf of the solar still is improved by increasing the yield of the distilled water in both the cps and sps the higher evaporative and condensate rate of the brine will give a higher yield the lcce varies from 29 6 to 30 4 in cps and 19 12 19 98 in sps for the number of expected life years of the still varies from 15 to 30 years which shows that there was a minimal improvement after 15 life years as shown in table 2 the thermal efficiency of the cps was 31 17 and sps was 20 75 the lcce and thermal efficiency are lowered in the sps because of the improper solar radiation the area of the basin is 0 5 m2 gives the lower lcce and thermal efficiency it can be improved by increasing the area of the basin also values show that there is more concentration needed for the selection of materials and types of fabrication methods to reduce pollution in the environment the co2 emission values are calculated for the number of expected life year varies from 5 to 30 years fig 6 a the co2 emission is decreasing with respect to the number of expected life years the co2 emission for the cps varies from 3 95 to 0 66 tons and for the sps it varies from 4 52 to 0 75 tons the variation of co2 emission values shows that both the still should have more than 15 life year s life to reduce pollution the co2 mitigation for the 15 years life of still was increased by 35 in the cps compared to the sps similarly for the 30 years the life of the still was increased by 34 as shown in fig 6 b the yield of the distilled water was a critical role for the deviation in both the still the co2 emission of 20 07 tons barred by using the cps for purification of salt water and similarly 13 19 tons barred by using the sps this shows the importance of renewable energy sources for reducing co2 emission the working day of the cps and sps should be more than the 275 days to higher yield and co2 mitigation the carbon credit and cash flow for the carbon trade were increasing with respect to the number of expected life years of the still fig 6 c and d the carbon credit for the 15 and 30 life years was rs 7708 and rs 15 814 for cps and rs 4998 and rs 10 395 for sps similarly the cash flow for carbon trade per kg of distilled water for cps was rs 11 35 and rs 23 28 and for sps were rs 10 9 and rs 22 67 the amount gained by the carbon credit will prompt the renewable energy use in commercial co2 emission can be decreased by increasing the uses of renewable energy devices the payback years of the cps and sps were calculated in term of carbon credit and number of expected life years if we sell the distilled water with the consideration of carbon credit in the indian market the return of the total price invested in the cps was 0 99 1 1 years and the sps was 1 57 1 79 years at the number of expected life year is 15years fig 7 the interest rate plays a significant role in the increase of payback years the government provides subsidies of 5 in the bank interest for renewable energy devices the payback year of cps was around 0 5 and sps was around 0 77 years the above all analyses deliver valuable evidence for promoting the use of solar still for purification of water the yearly yield and basin area are essential to increase the lcce and co2 mitigation table 3 the ssss rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016 gives more yearly yield lcce and co2 mitigation than the dsss dwivedi and tiwari 2010 the dsss dwivedi and tiwari 2010 has 2 m2 basin areas and a higher condensation area compare to ssss rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016 the location of experiments for dsss dwivedi and tiwari 2010 was in north india and ssss rajaseenivasan and srithar 2016 was in south india the solar radiation received higher in south india as compared to north india the higher solar radiation gives higher results for ssss the cascaded vertical dsss sharon and reddy 2015 was also experimented at south india and the absorber area is 4 m2 and it has given higher results among all compared solar still table 3 the solar radiation absorber area more than 2 4 m2 gives the higher yearly yield lcce and co2 mitigation the higher solar radiation and the maximum number of working days of the solar still produced a higher result 4 conclusion the study of the yearly performance energy and carbon analyses are investigated for cps and sps the yearly performance of the sps was lower than the cps the epf and lcce were higher in the cps the carbon analysis gives the impression of using eco friendly materials the fully shading given the lower result and examinations of the partial shading will be an experiment in the future for better understanding the effect of the shading on the transparent plate the following outcomes are observed during the experimentation and different analysis the co2 emission of 20 7 tons barred by using the cps for purification of saltwater similarly 13 2 tons barred by using the sps the co2 mitigation can be increased by the higher solar radiation higher absorber area and working days of the solar still if there is carbon credit consideration in selling the distilled water it will engorge people to use solar still which will minimize the co2emission the lcce was lower for cps and sps it can be improved by selecting eco friendly material and manufacture the embodied energy of the still is increased because of maintenance the ambient conditions of operating the solar still should have the average solar radiation of 700 w m2 day will give the higher lcce the payback analysis for cps is 0 52 years and sps is 0 82 years by selling the distilled water with a carbon credit declaration of
