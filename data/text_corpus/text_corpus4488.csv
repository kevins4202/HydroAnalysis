22440,this paper shows that gaussian process regression gpr with a periodic kernel has better mean prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds than time series or fourier series when forecasting motion data of underwater vehicles subject to wave excitation many robotic systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are required to operate in environments with disturbances and relative motion that make task performance difficult this motion often exhibits periodic near sinusoidal behaviour by predicting this motion control strategies can be developed to improve accuracy moreover factoring in uncertainty can aid the robustness of these predictive control methods time series and fourier series have been applied to several predictive control problems in a variety of fields however there are contradictory results in performance based on parameters assessment criteria and application this paper seeks to clarify these discrepancies using auv motion as a case study gpr is also introduced as a third candidate for prediction based on previous applications to time series forecasting in other fields of science in addition to assessing mean prediction accuracy the ability of each model to adequately bound prediction error is also considered as a key performance indicator keywords wave motion prediction auv robot 1 introduction robotic systems have the ability to perform intervention tasks in environments that humans are otherwise incapable of this could be due to environmental hazards or a lack of physical aptitude often this involves operating within the context of natural environs which produce disturbances that affect performance in certain situations these disturbances manifest themselves as periodic near sinusoidal motion the movement of marine vessels under wave excitation is exemplary of this kind of problem e g fig 1 in such cases conventional methods such as feedback control may not be able to adequately compensate for this undesired motion imposed on the system methods such as model predictive control mpc on the other hand formulate a sequence of control actions across a finite control horizon to minimize an objective function typically task error it follows that if the motion disturbances can be forecast for this horizon it would be possible to negate them allowing for more precise control these periodicities and patterns in the disturbance lend themselves to mathematical modelling which can then be used to forecast said disturbances indeed these types of phenomena have already been modelled and applied to predictive control schemes in a variety of marine robotic systems riedel and healy 1998 from et al 2011 medagoda and williams 2012 kormushev and caldwell 2013 woolfrey et al 2016 fernandéz and hollinger 2016 similar strategies have also been applied to surgical applications for instance becker et al 2008 attempted to predict the tremor of a surgeon s hand during teleoperated microsurgery heart motion prediction was also explored by yuen et al 2008 from which bowthorpe and tavakoli 2016 successfully applied a predictive control method for robot assisted beating heart surgery despite applying similar prediction models and control strategies there still exists discrepancies in performance within and between fields 1 1 motion prediction of marine vessels wave theory asserts that the undulation of fluids can be modelled via a superposition of sinusoids dean and dalrymple 1991 this assumption has formed the basis for several prediction modelling methods in literature for instance chung et al 1990 used a discrete fourier series to model and predict the motion of a ship in waves for the purpose of improving the accuracy of on board targeting systems from et al 2011 compared this method to time series known as autoregression ar for ship motion prediction in sea swell they concluded the latter to be the better method moreover they noted that ar had lower prediction error variance than fourier series in contrast yang et al 2008 stated that ar had poor long term prediction accuracy for ship motion prediction instead they developed a method that used past observations of ship motion plus wave excitation input to produce predictions for maritime flight operations love et al 2004 showed that the inertial forces produced by sea swell on ship mounted manipulators could be significantly large such that feedback control was insufficient for compensation instead they used repetitive learning control rlc to estimate and counteract these dynamic disturbances however they noted that this method failed when periodicity was not constant this is an important factor to consider if operating in the natural environment in the same line of research from et al 2009 showed that the dynamic properties of the ship have no effect on the manipulator dynamics all that is required is knowledge of the ship motion in that regard they showed that knowledge of the future ship motion could be used in motion planning to reduce joint torque of ship mounted manipulators this work was extended by from et al 2011 in which actual predictions were used furthermore factoring in joint state uncertainty improved the robustness of the predictive motion planning 1 2 disturbance prediction for auvs some of the earliest work for wave compensation in autonomous underwater vehicles auvs was conducted by riedel and healy 1998 a kalman filter kf was used to estimate the external sea effects this was then used with sliding mode control smc to improve theaccuracy of station keeping under oscillating forces in later work medagoda and williams 2012 used an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp to sense the current flow beneath an auv descending in a water column mpc was then used to proactively counter the anticipated disturbances and reduce trajectory tracking error riedel and healy 1998 had actually argued against the use of remote sensing technology in order to reduce weight and monetary costs in the auv design this necessitates that some form of on board estimation be developed in more recent work fernandéz and hollinger 2016 applied mpc for stationkeeping to a simulated 2d auv they showed reduced position error over a pid feedback controller however simulation data was given to the mpc controller no forecasting method was presented the ability to predict disturbances can also be utilized to minimize energy consumption for instance kormushev and caldwell 2013 modelled disturbances to an auv using a superposition of sinusoids using machine learning the amplitudes and frequencies were adapted to best approximate the local conditions this was then used in a control strategy that enabled the system to reduce energy expenditure forecasts of sea currents were utilized in research by huynh et al 2015 and jones and hollinger 2017 to plan efficient trajectories over long distances factoring prediction uncertainty was shown to improve robustness 1 3 motion prediction in related fields periodic motion compensation has also been a topic of research in other fields for instance yuen et al 2008 compared different models for heart motion prediction with the intended use for teleoperated beating heart surgery they also tested fourier series due to the periodic motion of the heart however unlike chung et al 1990 and from et al 2011 they applied an extended kalman filter ekf which can track the changing periodicity this method was compared to an ar 30 model their conclusion was that the fourier series with ekf outperformed time series this research was then successfully applied to a predictive control method by bowthorpe and tavakoli 2016 by using the motion prediction it was shown that tracking error between a surgical tool and the surface of the heart could be reduced time series forecasting has also been applied to modelling and predicting unwanted hand tremor during microsurgery becker et al 2008 the authors implemented both ar and autoregressive moving averages arma their conclusion was that an arma model performed better at predicting this form of periodic motion than a simpler ar format 1 4 contribution and outline evidently the ability to forecast near sinusoidal periodic motion has wide applications for predictive control strategies in robotics although they have been applied successfully there are still several questions that remain which this paper will attempt to address did the ar model perform better than fourier series for ship motion prediction by from et al 2011 because it is better suited to the application or would the implementation of the fourier series with ekf used by yuen et al 2008 improve results and would an arma model like that used by becker et al 2008 be better than ar for motion prediction of marine vessels as used by from et al 2011 and woolfrey et al 2016 furthermore how well do each of the prediction models adequately capture uncertainty about the future state forecast uncertainty is often overlooked in literature on predictive control despite its utility in planning and optimization as silver 2012 writes the words predict and forecast are largely used interchangeably today but in shakespeare s time they meant different things making a forecast typically implied planning under conditions of uncertainty it suggested having prudence wisdom and industriousness more like the way we now use the word foresight from et al 2011 had opted for the ar model over fourier series in part because the former had lower prediction error variance than the latter this uncertainty was used as part of their optimization problem however it is not evident that low uncertainty in a forecast is desirable per se on the contrary overconfidence may lead to sub optimal or unsafe actions an interesting piece of research by fang and williams 2014 showed that statistical distributions beyond the conventional gaussian distribution can provide better uncertainty bounds around trajectories this paper provides a systematic comparison of the forecasting abilities between time series fourier series and gaussian process regression gpr using auv motion data as a case study this includes both the mean accuracy and uncertainty gpr is considered as a third candidate due to its application in time series prediction for wind power generation yan et al 2016 physiology dürichen et al 2015 and many other natural phenomena roberts et al 2013 section 2 covers time series modelling with some statistical analysis of motion data to guide future model development section 3 outlines the fourier series and ekf method section 4 covers gpr and the model selection for the kernel functions in section 5 different metrics for assessing forecast quality are examined in particular theil s inequality coefficient theil 1966 is opted for as a dimensionless metric to better compare linear and angular motion the standard error of the forecasts is also considered as a means of assessing forecast uncertainty section 6 covers the analysis of forecasting motion data for two different auvs under wave excitation the three aforementioned methods are assessed with 2 variations on the parameters for each 2 time series forecasting 2 1 structure of a time series model in time series modelling the expected value of a state observation y ˆ t is expressed as a weighted sum of previous observations and forecast errors 1 y ˆ t i 1 p α i y t i j 1 q β j ε t j where p is the number of autoregression ar terms q is the number of moving average ma terms and ε y ˆ y n 0 σ ε 2 is the prediction error eq 1 is referred to as an arma p q model which assumes stationarity in the data i e it exhibits a long term mean this equation can be modified to account for nonstationary data a thorough reference on time series can be found in box et al 2016 the coefficients α i for i 1 p and β j for j 1 q can optimized via linear least squares these can be fitted at each time step in a control loop using a moving window of l historical state observations this approach was taken by from et al 2011 and woolfrey et al 2016 so that the values best reflected the current conditions 2 2 determination of model parameters several methods have been applied in literature to determine the number of parameters for p and q in eq 1 a popular method is to evaluate the root mean squared error rmse of the predictions for various models becker et al 2008 from et al 2011 woolfrey et al 2016 however it is well known that linear regression methods can overfit data to account for this the akaike information criterion aic can be used which includes a penalty term for the number of model parameters thereby promoting model parsimony this was the approach taken by yuen et al 2008 conversely the aic was criticized by schwarz 1978 as been unreliable for large sample sizes and instead proposed the bayesian information criterion bic this was used by yang et al 2008 for fitting parameters in their time series model for ship motion prediction however literature on time series modelling asserts that the model parameters are determined by the statistical properties of the data box et al 2016 namely the number of p terms is determined by the number of statistically significant partial autocorrelation values in the data and the number of q terms is given by the number of statistically significant autocorrelation values with this regard the correlograms for a sample of imu data for an auv under wave excitation is shown in fig 2 there a numerous autocorrelation values in the data but an infinite ma process is equivalent to a finite ar process box et al 2016 moreover the partial autocorrelation values show a sharp decline albeit with several significant values these two observations suggest a high order ar process an arma 40 0 model is applied in this paper as it was found to give satisfactory prediction results with some balance for model parsimony and although the data do not indicate it an arma 40 1 model may also help improve forecasts by correcting for the past prediction errors 2 3 producing forecasts with time series after optimizing the coefficients in eq 1 from et al 2011 and woolfrey et al 2016 used an iterative process to calculate predictions using an ar model 2 y ˆ t i t j 1 p α j y ˆ t i j t for i 1 l where l is the number of lead terms or forecast steps however through recursive substitution of y t i in eq 1 with its own arma model it is possible to arrive at an equivalent state space form box et al 2016 3 y ˆ t 1 t ϕ t y ˆ t t ψ t ε t where y ˆ t t y ˆ t t y ˆ t 1 t y ˆ t l 1 t y ˆ t l t ϕ t 0 l 1 i 0 α l 2 α 2 α 1 ψ t ψ 0 ψ 1 ψ l 1 ψ l t ψ α β is a function of the coefficients in eq 1 the advantage to this method is that the state propagation of eq 3 gives all the predictions across the forecast horizon moreover the application of a kf will correct both the current state estimate and the predictions when new sensor information is acquired the uncertainty propagation of this model is then readily calculated using 4 σ y t 1 t ϕ t σ y t t ϕ t σ ε 2 ψ t ψ t t where σ ε 2 is the variance of the 1 step ahead prediction errors eq 4 gives both the current state uncertainty as well as the forecast uncertainty the observation matrix for the kf is given as 5 h 1 0 1 l since future states cannot be observed 3 fourier series 3 1 superposition of sinusoids wave theory asserts that the undulation of a body of water can be expressed as a superposition of sinusoids dean and dalrymple 1991 indeed this assumption has been applied in many modelling and predictive control problems chung et al 1990 from et al 2011 kormushev and caldwell 2013 fernandéz and hollinger 2016 using this method the state equation for a system under periodic motion can be expressed as a discrete sum of m sinusoids 6 y ˆ t c 0 t i 1 m r i t sin θ i t 7 c 0 t i 1 m a i sin i ω t b i cos i ω t 8 θ i t i 0 t ω τ d τ ϕ i t eq 6 is the polar form and eq 7 is the rectangular form arrived at through trigonometric identities the coefficients in eq 7 can be initialized using a best linear unbiased blu estimate 9 β ˆ x t σ y 1 x 1 x t σ y 1 y 10 σ β x t σ y 1 x 1 where β ˆ c ˆ 0 a ˆ 1 a ˆ m b ˆ 1 b ˆ m t is the estimate of the coefficients y y t y t l t are prior sensor or state observations σ y is the uncertainty of said observations and x t 1 1 sin ω δ t sin ω l δ t sin m ω δ t sin m ω l δ t cos ω δ t cos ω l δ t cos m ω δ t cos m ω l δ t much like the time series application authors like chung et al 1990 and from et al 2011 optimized the coefficients for eq 7 using an unweighted form of eq 9 then forecasts were made recursively using 11 y ˆ t i t c ˆ j 1 m a ˆ j sin ω i δ t b ˆ j cos ω i δ t for i 1 l one flaw with this method is that the fundamental frequency ω is assumed to be known a priori it is possible to use historical information to initialize this term or even guess the parameter moreover eq 9 only optimizes for the amplitudes and phase shifts and not the frequency ω chung et al 1990 had recognized this and therefore devised a method to update the frequency based on an error gradient method 3 2 extended kalman filter ekf parker and anderson 1990 developed an ekf method to track hidden frequencies in noise based on the polar form of the fourier series eq 6 their results showed that it was able to sufficiently track the underlying frequency ω in a given data set yuen et al 2008 extended this method to produce forecasts of heart motion then bowthorpe and tavakoli 2016 successfully integrated these forecasts in to a predictive control strategy this same method is applied in this paper to predict auv motion under wave excitation the parameters for the state vector can be initialized from eq 9 x ˆ 0 c ˆ 0 0 r ˆ i 0 ω ˆ 0 θ ˆ i 0 t r ˆ i a ˆ i 2 b ˆ i 2 1 2 θ ˆ i atan 2 b ˆ i a ˆ i for i 1 m for the initial state uncertainty yuen et al 2008 and bowthorpe and tavakoli 2016 had opted for a diagonal matrix in this paper the uncertainty is determined by mapping eq 10 via the jacobian 12 σ x 0 x ˆ β ˆ σ β x ˆ β ˆ t σ w where σ w is additional uncertainty to account for loss of information through linearization the state propagation is given by 13 x ˆ t 1 t a x ˆ t t q where q n 0 σ q and the state propagation matrix is defined as 14 a i m 2 0 δ t 1 0 0 0 2 δ t 0 1 0 mδt 0 0 1 for the ekf the observation matrix is given by the partial derivative of eq 6 with respect to the state vector 15 h t i y x ˆ t i t x ˆ t i t 16 1 sin θ ˆ 1 sin θ ˆ m 0 r ˆ 1 cos θ ˆ 1 r ˆ m cos θ ˆ m the forecasts using the ekf method differ from eq 11 in that the intrinsic parameters and uncertainty must first be propagated 17 x ˆ t i t a i x ˆ t t 18 σ x t i t a i σ x t t a i t j 0 i 1 a j σ q a j t for i 1 l then the predictions of the actual state outcome and uncertainty are calculated as 19 y ˆ t i t f x ˆ t i t 20 σ y 2 t i t h t i σ x t i t h t i t 4 gaussian process regression both the time series and fourier series methods use deterministic mathematical models to explain covariance between sets of data this assumes that observations are generated according to a given mathematical model deviations errors are regarded as corruptions from noise gaussian processes gps on the other hand model a distribution over functions inferences about an expected output are generated from the covariance between nearby observations as can be seen from the time series analysis in section 2 2 the motion of a vessel under wave excitation exhibits statistically significant autocorrelation in time this property has been exploited in using gps to model time series data in a variety of natural phenomena respiratory data was predicted by brahim belhouari and bermak 2004 for respiratory data wind power forecasting by yan et al 2016 and multivariate physiological phenomena by dürichen et al 2015 roberts et al 2013 also offer a variety examples for periodic motion such as tide heights to stellar light curves the set of current state estimates y ˆ t t and future predicted values y ˆ t 1 t can be modelled via a joint gaussian distribution 21 y ˆ t t y ˆ t 1 t n μ t μ t 1 σ aa σ ab σ ab t σ bb where μ is a mean function and the covariance matrices between state observations are σ aa c o v a a σ ab c o v a b σ bb c o v b b and input spaces to the time series gp are a y ˆ t 1 t 1 y ˆ t l t l t b y ˆ t t y ˆ t l 1 t l 1 t for given inputs a b a prediction about future expected states given a window of historical state observations can then be made using 22 y ˆ t 1 t μ t 1 σ ab t σ aa 1 y ˆ t t μ t 23 σ y 2 t 1 t σ bb σ ab t σ aa 1 σ ab a kf can readily be applied to the state estimates from eqs 22 and 23 4 1 kernel functions the crux of the gp is in the kernel functions of the covariance matrix a variety of these can be found in work published by rasmussen and williams 2006 and roberts et al 2013 one useful property of the kernel functions is that additions and products can be constructed to model complex data 4 1 1 matérn the matérn function equates to a continuous time ar process rasmussen and williams 2006 roberts et al 2013 and hence is of particular interest here as can be seen from the correlogram in fig 2 auv motion under wave excitation has many statistically significant partial autocorrelation values the matérn kernel function is 24 c o v m a b h 2 1 γ ν 2 ν 1 2 ν δ b ν 2 ν δ where δ λ 1 a b γ is the gamma function and b is the 2nd order modified bessel function 4 1 2 rational quadratic this kernel function was combined with a periodic kernel byroberts et al 2013 to model changes in periodicity over time for stellar light curves a similar formulation is thus employed in this paper the kernel function is given as 25 c o v rq a b h 2 1 a b 2 α λ 2 α where h accounts for amplitude λ is a length or time scale and α is known as the index parameter 4 1 3 periodic rational quadratic periodicity can be introduced in to certain kernel functions by replacing a b 2 with sin 2 π a b t with periodic parameter t substituting this in to the rational quadratic kernel 36 becomes 26 c o v prq a b h 2 1 1 α λ 2 sin 2 π a b t α 4 2 mean functions mean functions influence the behaviour of the expected output in a gp model the mean function may be useful in accounting for steady disturbances in addition to the periodicity such as steady current flow the zero mean or even a constant mean function is the simplest 27 μ t c t assuming zero mean or constant is reasonable for local predictions as the kernel functions can account for complex behaviour however distant predictions are dominated by the mean it was found in this paper that other mean functions such as linear did not improve forecasts of the gp and often optimization of the hyperparameters did not converge as such no further considerations are made 5 forecast accuracy 5 1 root mean squared error rmse a conventional approach to evaluate prediction accuracy is to measure the rmse between the predicted state and the realized state observation 28 rmse n 1 y ˆ t t 1 y ˆ t t 2 however there are two disadvantages to this metric 1 it does not give a measure of prediction performance against the minimum standard of a last value predictor indeed it is possible to perform worse than this 2 it does not allow for comparison of a model across different dimensions in this case linear acceleration and angular velocity 5 2 theil s inequality coefficient in this paper theil s inequality coefficient theil 1966 is opted for over rmse this metric is given by the following equation 29 u 2 i y ˆ t t y ˆ t t i 2 y ˆ t t y ˆ t i t i 2 which can be regarded as a ratio of the predicted error over the actual change a value of u 0 would indicate a perfect prediction whereas u 1 means the model performs worse than a na ive last value predictor and unlike rmse this metric is dimensionless thus it is possible to compare a model s ability to predict the linear motion of a vehicle against angular motion 5 3 standard error of predictions forecast uncertainty can provide useful information in motion planning and control for instance probabilistic bounds have been considered in trajectory generation for robotic systems fang and williams 2014 from et al 2011 also attempted to minimize joint state uncertainty for predictive motion planning of manipulators on ship platforms evidently sound information about forecast uncertainty can provide a better basis for planning and control for example if the forecast uncertainty underestimates the prediction error this could lead to a false sense of security in applications that require collision avoidance conversely an overly conservative estimate may hinder planning exploration and control a useful metric is to take the average standardized prediction error sometimes referred to as the normalized estimation error squared nees li et al 2001 30 σ se 2 i n 1 y ˆ t i t i y ˆ t i t 2 σ 2 t i t where σ 2 t i t is the forecast uncertainty of the i th step ahead forecast the square root of eq 30 will give the number of standard deviations that the realized state outcome y ˆ t i t i is from the forecast mean y ˆ t i t thus when σ se 1 96 then the state observation exceeds the 95 confidence interval of the forecast this implies the prediction model is unable to sufficiently encompass the prediction errors 6 comparison of forecast models 6 1 data collection process data was collected from two different auvs designed for intervention tasks in shallow bathymetry the first is an auv prototype being developed for exploration under antarctic sea ice dubbed the antarctic auv a auv fig 3 the second is an auv manipulator system for high pressure water cleaning of bridge piles and submerged infrastructure dubbed the submerged pile inspection robot spir fig 6 raw sensor data was collected from an inertial measurement unit imu onboard each auv whilst they were subject to wave motion the linear motion is in m s2 and the angular motion is in rad s each of the auvs was placed in a test tank at separate time and left to float freely on the surface of the water waves were manually generated by using a large object to displace the water the tank measures 6 m in length and 4 m in width with the wavelength of 4 m matching the shorter side of the tank due to harmonic resonance the data were recorded at 50 hz 6 2 selection of model parameters 6 2 1 time series model parameters for the arma p q method were chosen based on analysing correlograms for samples of motion data fig 2 using values of p 30 produced capricious results in the forecast when coupled with a kf it was found that an arma 40 0 model produced stable forecasts up to 5 s ahead a lag length of l 250 5 s of historical data was used to solve the coefficients in eq 1 each time step this was then used to formulate the state propagation matrices in eq 3 various combinations of an arma 40 q model were also tested though prediction results did not improve an arma 40 1 is presented in this paper 6 2 2 fourier series the fourier series with ekf was implemented with m 5 and m 10 harmonics in general it was found that a higher number of harmonics lead to the method overfitting the model to noise to optimize the initial coefficients eq 9 was solved using a lag length of l 400 data points 8 s of historical data 6 2 3 gaussian process the hyperparameters for the kernel functions eqs 24 and 26 can be fitted via gradient descent optimization via the log likelihood function rasmussen and williams 2006 and roberts et al 2013 these were fitted with 600 samples within the data collected initial values were randomized and several attempts at optimization were conducted to ensure convergence in the result a moving window of l 200 2 s of historical observations were used for the input space for calculating the covariance matrices used in eqs 22 and 23 this was found to produce more accurate predictions than shorter windows 6 3 antarctic auv the a auv weighs approximately 17 kg the three prediction methods were tested on 60 s worth of imu data thirty 30 seconds worth of this data is shown in fig 4 forecasts were made in 0 02 s increments for a maximum of l 250 steps equating to a 5 s forecast lead 6 3 1 mean forecast accuracy results for theil s inequality coefficient eq 29 were averaged for 10 step intervals up to 5 s in total length which can be seen in table 1 by inspection it can be seen that the gpr with either a matérn or periodic kernel has better short term mean predictions than either time series or the fourier series methods the long term performance results of the arma 40 0 time series model has comparable performance to the gpr methods both of these also better captured the periodicity in the motion 1 2 s than the fourier series becker et al 2008 had claimed that an arma model performed better than a simple ar for predicting the unwanted tremor of a surgeon s hand during microsurgery the results of this analysis showed that extending the arma 40 0 to an arma 40 1 did not improve results in fact it can be seen in table 1 that the inclusion of the ma term over corrects the 1 step ahead predictions leading to poorer results this is to be expected from the analysis of the correlograms in section 2 fig 2 which indicated a high order ar p 0 process the fourier series with m 10 harmonics actually proved to have slightly better 1 step ahead predictions than time series this was also noted by from et al 2011 in their analysis of ship motion prediction however the long term forecasts are not as accurate and the method did not adequately track the periodicity in the data 6 3 2 forecast uncertainty the standard error of the forecasts eq 30 for the a auv motion data are plotted in table 2 for 10 step intervals the gpr with the periodic kernel function underestimates the prediction error for forecast horizons 1 s in length with observations outside the 3 σ or 99 97 confidence interval these generally improve for long term predictions with forecasts under this 3 σ range the fourier series overall appears to have good short term uncertainty bounds for m 10 harmonics although the long term uncertainty intervals encompass the realized state observation this usually falls within the 1 σ range 68 and hence could be regarded as too conservative the time series method overall had very poor prediction uncertainty in excess of 3 σ and thus state observations routinely fall outside the 99 97 confidence interval from et al 2011 had noted that the time series had low forecast error variance and opted for this over fourier series for their mpc problem however the findings here would suggest the forecast uncertainty of the time series is unreliable for the data used in this paper 6 4 submerged pile inspection robot spir the spir weighs approximately 45 kg fig 6 as with the a auv the different prediction methods were tested on 60 s worth of data a 30 s sample is shown in fig 7 as before forecasts were made at 0 2 s intervals for l 250 steps equating to a maximum 5 s lead time theil s inequality coefficient eq 29 and the standard errors eq 30 were calculated and averaged for every 10th step 6 4 1 mean forecast accuracy theil s inequality coefficient for the spir motion prediction is shown in table 4 it can be seen that this data proved much more difficult to predict for all the forecasting methods presented in this paper in particular theil s inequality coefficient u 1 for the surge motion with all the prediction methods tested this implies that in practice it would be better to use a last value predictor the gp methods had very accurate 1 step ahead predictions u 0 01 and the periodic kernel had generally good predictions for the dimensions other than surge for forecasts 2 s in length the matérn kernel performed poorly for long terms predictions on further analysis of the spir motion data it was found to be nonstationary this may explain the poor results of the forecasting methods compared to the a auv data ironically the fourier series with m 5 was better at forecasting surge motion than all the other models 6 4 2 forecast uncertainty the results of the forecast uncertainty table 5 also prove to be much worse overall for the spir motion data than the a auv again the time series is overconfident in its predictions with standard errors in excess of 3 σ and both the matérn and periodic kernel functions for the gp have significantly large standard errors for the predictions 6 5 performance summary based on the analysis of the different forecasting methods a summary of their different performance strengths is given in table 3 fourier series alone had the best short term forecast uncertainties although failed to capture periodicity time series appears to have good long term mean predictions and estimates of the periodicity in the data overall the gp with periodic kernel performed best with the stationary data 7 discussion 7 1 time series vs fourier series from et al 2011 stated that an ar time series model was better for predicting ship motion than fourier series conversely yuen et al 2008 concluded that fourier series using an ekf was better at predicting heart motion than ar the question was posed in the introduction as to whether the application of the ekf could improve forecasts for marine vessels under wave excitation over time series the results of this paper showed that an ar 40 model with state space form produced more accurate long term predictions than the ekf method with the data presented these results are to be expected as the ekf method was originally proposed by parker and anderson 1990 to track hidden frequencies in periodic data and not for producing forecasts per se 7 2 model parameters becker et al 2008 had found that using an arma model was better at predicting the periodic tremors of a surgeon s hand during teleoperated surgery compared to a simple ar analysis of the statistical properties for some of the motion data indicated a high order ar model moreover the results of the mean prediction accuracy showed that an arma 40 1 model did not significantly improve motion prediction for auvs over an ar 40 0 model in fact the additional ma term appeared to over correct the 1 step ahead predictions table 1 for the fourier series it was found that using m 10 harmonics produced the best overall results for all dof of vehicle motion with stationary data these results are commensurate with the m 8 harmonics that yuen et al 2008 used for heart motion prediction 7 3 forecast uncertainty the forecast uncertainty was considered a critical factor in this paper for evaluating a prediction model from et al 2011 had noted that the long term prediction errors had lower variance than that of fourier series the results in this paper showed that the forecast uncertainty for auv motion prediction is very small leading to large standard errors for the predictions table 2 5 the reason for this is clear the uncertainty propagation for the time series model eq 4 is a function of the 1 step ahead prediction error variance σ ε 2 thus a small variance in prediction error leads to overconfidence in the forecast uncertainty likewise the gp method also greatly underestimated prediction error when applied to the nonstationary motion data of the spir if these methods are to be applied in predictive control the forecast uncertainty would need to be manually increased to account for this overconfidence 7 4 vehicle geometry and data stationarity both the a auv and the spir motion data were collected in the same test tank however it was found that the a auv data exhibited stationarity whereas the spir did not as a consequence all the prediction models presented performed poorly when forecasting the spir motion data according to dean and dalrymple 1991 an unpropelled object floating in water is dominated by the particle accelerations and the pressure field as such the different geometry between the two vehicles may help explain the discrepancies in the observed motion both vehicles are neutrally buoyant and sit fully submerged in the water column the length of the waves during the data collection was approximately 4 m due to resonance with the 4 m width of the tank the wave height reached approximately 320 mm fig 9 illustrates the pressure gradients from the surrounding water on the a auv and spir from a passing wave because the body of the spir is longer than that of the a auv a minute net force would be generated by a passing wave this would cause it to drift over time with the propagation of the waves which was also observed during data collection the force in the x direction from this pressure field on a rectangular object is given as dean and dalrymple 1991 31 f x 2 ρ gh k sin θ sinh kh sinh k h d kcosh kh δ where 32 δ sin 1 2 kl x cos θ sin 1 2 kl y sin θ sin ω t and d is the draught depth of submersion for the vessel g is the gravitational acceleration h is the wavelength h is the wave height k is a constant l x l y is the length and width of the vessel respectively ρ is the fluid density θ is the angle of wave propagation w r t the vehicle and ω is the wave frequency the force being generated is a function of the vehicle heading relative to the wave propagation θ fig 10 shows a diagram comparing the spir and the a auv in the x y plane the spir s centre of mass does not align with the centre of volume as such any net wave forces on the body will cause a yaw moment and a subsequent change in θ over time fig 11 shows how there is an underlying curvature to the yaw motion data in fig 8 furthermore if the angle of the wave propagation with respect to the robot θ changes over time because of said yaw moment then the surge and sway forces will also drift with time this may account for the nonstationarity of the data conversely the body of the a auv is cylindrical in shape and will thus not incur any large yaw moments from passing waves the amplitude of the yaw motion data is mostly smaller than that of the spir moreover it has a constant zero mean fig 5 and hence exhibits stationarity 7 5 potential avenues to improve forecasting there are a couple of methods that can be used to deal with the nonstationary nature of the spir motion data the first is to use an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model box et al 2016 using this method the data is differenced until stationarity is achieved an arima p 1 q model for example would predict δ y ˆ instead of y ˆ another option is to use gpr with a nonstationary kernel function brahim belhouari and bermak 2004 showed good results for predicting respiratory data with a nonstationary kernel this may be a point of future research that said the time series and gp with periodic kernel performed better than a last value prediction for prediction horizons 2 5 s for all but the surge motion 8 conclusion there are many scenarios in which robotic systems are subject to disturbances which leads to periodic near sinusoidal behaviour both time series and fourier series have been successfully applied to predictive control strategies in previous literature however performance results in the prediction accuracy of each method differs depending on derivation parameters and application in this paper time series fourier series and gaussian process regression were applied to motion prediction of two small auvs designed for intervention tasks in shallow bathymetry mean forecast accuracy was assessed using theil s inequality coefficient which gives an agnostic measure of performance versus a naïve last value predictor furthermore the confidence interval of forecasts was studied for each model to determine if they could adequately capture uncertainty about the future state the results of the analysis showed that a gp combined with a periodic rational quadratic kernel function performed better than both the time series and fourier series for the short term mean prediction error and for the long term the gp had comparable performance to time series analysis of the forecast uncertainty revealed new and interesting insights the time series method had low forecast uncertainty as noted in prior research and thus was overconfident in its prediction estimate conversely the fourier series was the most conservative of the three methods the gp method was overconfident in the short term but provided the best confidence bounds for long term forecasts acknowledgements this work is supported in part by the australian research council arc linkage project

22440,this paper shows that gaussian process regression gpr with a periodic kernel has better mean prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds than time series or fourier series when forecasting motion data of underwater vehicles subject to wave excitation many robotic systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are required to operate in environments with disturbances and relative motion that make task performance difficult this motion often exhibits periodic near sinusoidal behaviour by predicting this motion control strategies can be developed to improve accuracy moreover factoring in uncertainty can aid the robustness of these predictive control methods time series and fourier series have been applied to several predictive control problems in a variety of fields however there are contradictory results in performance based on parameters assessment criteria and application this paper seeks to clarify these discrepancies using auv motion as a case study gpr is also introduced as a third candidate for prediction based on previous applications to time series forecasting in other fields of science in addition to assessing mean prediction accuracy the ability of each model to adequately bound prediction error is also considered as a key performance indicator keywords wave motion prediction auv robot 1 introduction robotic systems have the ability to perform intervention tasks in environments that humans are otherwise incapable of this could be due to environmental hazards or a lack of physical aptitude often this involves operating within the context of natural environs which produce disturbances that affect performance in certain situations these disturbances manifest themselves as periodic near sinusoidal motion the movement of marine vessels under wave excitation is exemplary of this kind of problem e g fig 1 in such cases conventional methods such as feedback control may not be able to adequately compensate for this undesired motion imposed on the system methods such as model predictive control mpc on the other hand formulate a sequence of control actions across a finite control horizon to minimize an objective function typically task error it follows that if the motion disturbances can be forecast for this horizon it would be possible to negate them allowing for more precise control these periodicities and patterns in the disturbance lend themselves to mathematical modelling which can then be used to forecast said disturbances indeed these types of phenomena have already been modelled and applied to predictive control schemes in a variety of marine robotic systems riedel and healy 1998 from et al 2011 medagoda and williams 2012 kormushev and caldwell 2013 woolfrey et al 2016 fernandéz and hollinger 2016 similar strategies have also been applied to surgical applications for instance becker et al 2008 attempted to predict the tremor of a surgeon s hand during teleoperated microsurgery heart motion prediction was also explored by yuen et al 2008 from which bowthorpe and tavakoli 2016 successfully applied a predictive control method for robot assisted beating heart surgery despite applying similar prediction models and control strategies there still exists discrepancies in performance within and between fields 1 1 motion prediction of marine vessels wave theory asserts that the undulation of fluids can be modelled via a superposition of sinusoids dean and dalrymple 1991 this assumption has formed the basis for several prediction modelling methods in literature for instance chung et al 1990 used a discrete fourier series to model and predict the motion of a ship in waves for the purpose of improving the accuracy of on board targeting systems from et al 2011 compared this method to time series known as autoregression ar for ship motion prediction in sea swell they concluded the latter to be the better method moreover they noted that ar had lower prediction error variance than fourier series in contrast yang et al 2008 stated that ar had poor long term prediction accuracy for ship motion prediction instead they developed a method that used past observations of ship motion plus wave excitation input to produce predictions for maritime flight operations love et al 2004 showed that the inertial forces produced by sea swell on ship mounted manipulators could be significantly large such that feedback control was insufficient for compensation instead they used repetitive learning control rlc to estimate and counteract these dynamic disturbances however they noted that this method failed when periodicity was not constant this is an important factor to consider if operating in the natural environment in the same line of research from et al 2009 showed that the dynamic properties of the ship have no effect on the manipulator dynamics all that is required is knowledge of the ship motion in that regard they showed that knowledge of the future ship motion could be used in motion planning to reduce joint torque of ship mounted manipulators this work was extended by from et al 2011 in which actual predictions were used furthermore factoring in joint state uncertainty improved the robustness of the predictive motion planning 1 2 disturbance prediction for auvs some of the earliest work for wave compensation in autonomous underwater vehicles auvs was conducted by riedel and healy 1998 a kalman filter kf was used to estimate the external sea effects this was then used with sliding mode control smc to improve theaccuracy of station keeping under oscillating forces in later work medagoda and williams 2012 used an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp to sense the current flow beneath an auv descending in a water column mpc was then used to proactively counter the anticipated disturbances and reduce trajectory tracking error riedel and healy 1998 had actually argued against the use of remote sensing technology in order to reduce weight and monetary costs in the auv design this necessitates that some form of on board estimation be developed in more recent work fernandéz and hollinger 2016 applied mpc for stationkeeping to a simulated 2d auv they showed reduced position error over a pid feedback controller however simulation data was given to the mpc controller no forecasting method was presented the ability to predict disturbances can also be utilized to minimize energy consumption for instance kormushev and caldwell 2013 modelled disturbances to an auv using a superposition of sinusoids using machine learning the amplitudes and frequencies were adapted to best approximate the local conditions this was then used in a control strategy that enabled the system to reduce energy expenditure forecasts of sea currents were utilized in research by huynh et al 2015 and jones and hollinger 2017 to plan efficient trajectories over long distances factoring prediction uncertainty was shown to improve robustness 1 3 motion prediction in related fields periodic motion compensation has also been a topic of research in other fields for instance yuen et al 2008 compared different models for heart motion prediction with the intended use for teleoperated beating heart surgery they also tested fourier series due to the periodic motion of the heart however unlike chung et al 1990 and from et al 2011 they applied an extended kalman filter ekf which can track the changing periodicity this method was compared to an ar 30 model their conclusion was that the fourier series with ekf outperformed time series this research was then successfully applied to a predictive control method by bowthorpe and tavakoli 2016 by using the motion prediction it was shown that tracking error between a surgical tool and the surface of the heart could be reduced time series forecasting has also been applied to modelling and predicting unwanted hand tremor during microsurgery becker et al 2008 the authors implemented both ar and autoregressive moving averages arma their conclusion was that an arma model performed better at predicting this form of periodic motion than a simpler ar format 1 4 contribution and outline evidently the ability to forecast near sinusoidal periodic motion has wide applications for predictive control strategies in robotics although they have been applied successfully there are still several questions that remain which this paper will attempt to address did the ar model perform better than fourier series for ship motion prediction by from et al 2011 because it is better suited to the application or would the implementation of the fourier series with ekf used by yuen et al 2008 improve results and would an arma model like that used by becker et al 2008 be better than ar for motion prediction of marine vessels as used by from et al 2011 and woolfrey et al 2016 furthermore how well do each of the prediction models adequately capture uncertainty about the future state forecast uncertainty is often overlooked in literature on predictive control despite its utility in planning and optimization as silver 2012 writes the words predict and forecast are largely used interchangeably today but in shakespeare s time they meant different things making a forecast typically implied planning under conditions of uncertainty it suggested having prudence wisdom and industriousness more like the way we now use the word foresight from et al 2011 had opted for the ar model over fourier series in part because the former had lower prediction error variance than the latter this uncertainty was used as part of their optimization problem however it is not evident that low uncertainty in a forecast is desirable per se on the contrary overconfidence may lead to sub optimal or unsafe actions an interesting piece of research by fang and williams 2014 showed that statistical distributions beyond the conventional gaussian distribution can provide better uncertainty bounds around trajectories this paper provides a systematic comparison of the forecasting abilities between time series fourier series and gaussian process regression gpr using auv motion data as a case study this includes both the mean accuracy and uncertainty gpr is considered as a third candidate due to its application in time series prediction for wind power generation yan et al 2016 physiology dürichen et al 2015 and many other natural phenomena roberts et al 2013 section 2 covers time series modelling with some statistical analysis of motion data to guide future model development section 3 outlines the fourier series and ekf method section 4 covers gpr and the model selection for the kernel functions in section 5 different metrics for assessing forecast quality are examined in particular theil s inequality coefficient theil 1966 is opted for as a dimensionless metric to better compare linear and angular motion the standard error of the forecasts is also considered as a means of assessing forecast uncertainty section 6 covers the analysis of forecasting motion data for two different auvs under wave excitation the three aforementioned methods are assessed with 2 variations on the parameters for each 2 time series forecasting 2 1 structure of a time series model in time series modelling the expected value of a state observation y ˆ t is expressed as a weighted sum of previous observations and forecast errors 1 y ˆ t i 1 p α i y t i j 1 q β j ε t j where p is the number of autoregression ar terms q is the number of moving average ma terms and ε y ˆ y n 0 σ ε 2 is the prediction error eq 1 is referred to as an arma p q model which assumes stationarity in the data i e it exhibits a long term mean this equation can be modified to account for nonstationary data a thorough reference on time series can be found in box et al 2016 the coefficients α i for i 1 p and β j for j 1 q can optimized via linear least squares these can be fitted at each time step in a control loop using a moving window of l historical state observations this approach was taken by from et al 2011 and woolfrey et al 2016 so that the values best reflected the current conditions 2 2 determination of model parameters several methods have been applied in literature to determine the number of parameters for p and q in eq 1 a popular method is to evaluate the root mean squared error rmse of the predictions for various models becker et al 2008 from et al 2011 woolfrey et al 2016 however it is well known that linear regression methods can overfit data to account for this the akaike information criterion aic can be used which includes a penalty term for the number of model parameters thereby promoting model parsimony this was the approach taken by yuen et al 2008 conversely the aic was criticized by schwarz 1978 as been unreliable for large sample sizes and instead proposed the bayesian information criterion bic this was used by yang et al 2008 for fitting parameters in their time series model for ship motion prediction however literature on time series modelling asserts that the model parameters are determined by the statistical properties of the data box et al 2016 namely the number of p terms is determined by the number of statistically significant partial autocorrelation values in the data and the number of q terms is given by the number of statistically significant autocorrelation values with this regard the correlograms for a sample of imu data for an auv under wave excitation is shown in fig 2 there a numerous autocorrelation values in the data but an infinite ma process is equivalent to a finite ar process box et al 2016 moreover the partial autocorrelation values show a sharp decline albeit with several significant values these two observations suggest a high order ar process an arma 40 0 model is applied in this paper as it was found to give satisfactory prediction results with some balance for model parsimony and although the data do not indicate it an arma 40 1 model may also help improve forecasts by correcting for the past prediction errors 2 3 producing forecasts with time series after optimizing the coefficients in eq 1 from et al 2011 and woolfrey et al 2016 used an iterative process to calculate predictions using an ar model 2 y ˆ t i t j 1 p α j y ˆ t i j t for i 1 l where l is the number of lead terms or forecast steps however through recursive substitution of y t i in eq 1 with its own arma model it is possible to arrive at an equivalent state space form box et al 2016 3 y ˆ t 1 t ϕ t y ˆ t t ψ t ε t where y ˆ t t y ˆ t t y ˆ t 1 t y ˆ t l 1 t y ˆ t l t ϕ t 0 l 1 i 0 α l 2 α 2 α 1 ψ t ψ 0 ψ 1 ψ l 1 ψ l t ψ α β is a function of the coefficients in eq 1 the advantage to this method is that the state propagation of eq 3 gives all the predictions across the forecast horizon moreover the application of a kf will correct both the current state estimate and the predictions when new sensor information is acquired the uncertainty propagation of this model is then readily calculated using 4 σ y t 1 t ϕ t σ y t t ϕ t σ ε 2 ψ t ψ t t where σ ε 2 is the variance of the 1 step ahead prediction errors eq 4 gives both the current state uncertainty as well as the forecast uncertainty the observation matrix for the kf is given as 5 h 1 0 1 l since future states cannot be observed 3 fourier series 3 1 superposition of sinusoids wave theory asserts that the undulation of a body of water can be expressed as a superposition of sinusoids dean and dalrymple 1991 indeed this assumption has been applied in many modelling and predictive control problems chung et al 1990 from et al 2011 kormushev and caldwell 2013 fernandéz and hollinger 2016 using this method the state equation for a system under periodic motion can be expressed as a discrete sum of m sinusoids 6 y ˆ t c 0 t i 1 m r i t sin θ i t 7 c 0 t i 1 m a i sin i ω t b i cos i ω t 8 θ i t i 0 t ω τ d τ ϕ i t eq 6 is the polar form and eq 7 is the rectangular form arrived at through trigonometric identities the coefficients in eq 7 can be initialized using a best linear unbiased blu estimate 9 β ˆ x t σ y 1 x 1 x t σ y 1 y 10 σ β x t σ y 1 x 1 where β ˆ c ˆ 0 a ˆ 1 a ˆ m b ˆ 1 b ˆ m t is the estimate of the coefficients y y t y t l t are prior sensor or state observations σ y is the uncertainty of said observations and x t 1 1 sin ω δ t sin ω l δ t sin m ω δ t sin m ω l δ t cos ω δ t cos ω l δ t cos m ω δ t cos m ω l δ t much like the time series application authors like chung et al 1990 and from et al 2011 optimized the coefficients for eq 7 using an unweighted form of eq 9 then forecasts were made recursively using 11 y ˆ t i t c ˆ j 1 m a ˆ j sin ω i δ t b ˆ j cos ω i δ t for i 1 l one flaw with this method is that the fundamental frequency ω is assumed to be known a priori it is possible to use historical information to initialize this term or even guess the parameter moreover eq 9 only optimizes for the amplitudes and phase shifts and not the frequency ω chung et al 1990 had recognized this and therefore devised a method to update the frequency based on an error gradient method 3 2 extended kalman filter ekf parker and anderson 1990 developed an ekf method to track hidden frequencies in noise based on the polar form of the fourier series eq 6 their results showed that it was able to sufficiently track the underlying frequency ω in a given data set yuen et al 2008 extended this method to produce forecasts of heart motion then bowthorpe and tavakoli 2016 successfully integrated these forecasts in to a predictive control strategy this same method is applied in this paper to predict auv motion under wave excitation the parameters for the state vector can be initialized from eq 9 x ˆ 0 c ˆ 0 0 r ˆ i 0 ω ˆ 0 θ ˆ i 0 t r ˆ i a ˆ i 2 b ˆ i 2 1 2 θ ˆ i atan 2 b ˆ i a ˆ i for i 1 m for the initial state uncertainty yuen et al 2008 and bowthorpe and tavakoli 2016 had opted for a diagonal matrix in this paper the uncertainty is determined by mapping eq 10 via the jacobian 12 σ x 0 x ˆ β ˆ σ β x ˆ β ˆ t σ w where σ w is additional uncertainty to account for loss of information through linearization the state propagation is given by 13 x ˆ t 1 t a x ˆ t t q where q n 0 σ q and the state propagation matrix is defined as 14 a i m 2 0 δ t 1 0 0 0 2 δ t 0 1 0 mδt 0 0 1 for the ekf the observation matrix is given by the partial derivative of eq 6 with respect to the state vector 15 h t i y x ˆ t i t x ˆ t i t 16 1 sin θ ˆ 1 sin θ ˆ m 0 r ˆ 1 cos θ ˆ 1 r ˆ m cos θ ˆ m the forecasts using the ekf method differ from eq 11 in that the intrinsic parameters and uncertainty must first be propagated 17 x ˆ t i t a i x ˆ t t 18 σ x t i t a i σ x t t a i t j 0 i 1 a j σ q a j t for i 1 l then the predictions of the actual state outcome and uncertainty are calculated as 19 y ˆ t i t f x ˆ t i t 20 σ y 2 t i t h t i σ x t i t h t i t 4 gaussian process regression both the time series and fourier series methods use deterministic mathematical models to explain covariance between sets of data this assumes that observations are generated according to a given mathematical model deviations errors are regarded as corruptions from noise gaussian processes gps on the other hand model a distribution over functions inferences about an expected output are generated from the covariance between nearby observations as can be seen from the time series analysis in section 2 2 the motion of a vessel under wave excitation exhibits statistically significant autocorrelation in time this property has been exploited in using gps to model time series data in a variety of natural phenomena respiratory data was predicted by brahim belhouari and bermak 2004 for respiratory data wind power forecasting by yan et al 2016 and multivariate physiological phenomena by dürichen et al 2015 roberts et al 2013 also offer a variety examples for periodic motion such as tide heights to stellar light curves the set of current state estimates y ˆ t t and future predicted values y ˆ t 1 t can be modelled via a joint gaussian distribution 21 y ˆ t t y ˆ t 1 t n μ t μ t 1 σ aa σ ab σ ab t σ bb where μ is a mean function and the covariance matrices between state observations are σ aa c o v a a σ ab c o v a b σ bb c o v b b and input spaces to the time series gp are a y ˆ t 1 t 1 y ˆ t l t l t b y ˆ t t y ˆ t l 1 t l 1 t for given inputs a b a prediction about future expected states given a window of historical state observations can then be made using 22 y ˆ t 1 t μ t 1 σ ab t σ aa 1 y ˆ t t μ t 23 σ y 2 t 1 t σ bb σ ab t σ aa 1 σ ab a kf can readily be applied to the state estimates from eqs 22 and 23 4 1 kernel functions the crux of the gp is in the kernel functions of the covariance matrix a variety of these can be found in work published by rasmussen and williams 2006 and roberts et al 2013 one useful property of the kernel functions is that additions and products can be constructed to model complex data 4 1 1 matérn the matérn function equates to a continuous time ar process rasmussen and williams 2006 roberts et al 2013 and hence is of particular interest here as can be seen from the correlogram in fig 2 auv motion under wave excitation has many statistically significant partial autocorrelation values the matérn kernel function is 24 c o v m a b h 2 1 γ ν 2 ν 1 2 ν δ b ν 2 ν δ where δ λ 1 a b γ is the gamma function and b is the 2nd order modified bessel function 4 1 2 rational quadratic this kernel function was combined with a periodic kernel byroberts et al 2013 to model changes in periodicity over time for stellar light curves a similar formulation is thus employed in this paper the kernel function is given as 25 c o v rq a b h 2 1 a b 2 α λ 2 α where h accounts for amplitude λ is a length or time scale and α is known as the index parameter 4 1 3 periodic rational quadratic periodicity can be introduced in to certain kernel functions by replacing a b 2 with sin 2 π a b t with periodic parameter t substituting this in to the rational quadratic kernel 36 becomes 26 c o v prq a b h 2 1 1 α λ 2 sin 2 π a b t α 4 2 mean functions mean functions influence the behaviour of the expected output in a gp model the mean function may be useful in accounting for steady disturbances in addition to the periodicity such as steady current flow the zero mean or even a constant mean function is the simplest 27 μ t c t assuming zero mean or constant is reasonable for local predictions as the kernel functions can account for complex behaviour however distant predictions are dominated by the mean it was found in this paper that other mean functions such as linear did not improve forecasts of the gp and often optimization of the hyperparameters did not converge as such no further considerations are made 5 forecast accuracy 5 1 root mean squared error rmse a conventional approach to evaluate prediction accuracy is to measure the rmse between the predicted state and the realized state observation 28 rmse n 1 y ˆ t t 1 y ˆ t t 2 however there are two disadvantages to this metric 1 it does not give a measure of prediction performance against the minimum standard of a last value predictor indeed it is possible to perform worse than this 2 it does not allow for comparison of a model across different dimensions in this case linear acceleration and angular velocity 5 2 theil s inequality coefficient in this paper theil s inequality coefficient theil 1966 is opted for over rmse this metric is given by the following equation 29 u 2 i y ˆ t t y ˆ t t i 2 y ˆ t t y ˆ t i t i 2 which can be regarded as a ratio of the predicted error over the actual change a value of u 0 would indicate a perfect prediction whereas u 1 means the model performs worse than a na ive last value predictor and unlike rmse this metric is dimensionless thus it is possible to compare a model s ability to predict the linear motion of a vehicle against angular motion 5 3 standard error of predictions forecast uncertainty can provide useful information in motion planning and control for instance probabilistic bounds have been considered in trajectory generation for robotic systems fang and williams 2014 from et al 2011 also attempted to minimize joint state uncertainty for predictive motion planning of manipulators on ship platforms evidently sound information about forecast uncertainty can provide a better basis for planning and control for example if the forecast uncertainty underestimates the prediction error this could lead to a false sense of security in applications that require collision avoidance conversely an overly conservative estimate may hinder planning exploration and control a useful metric is to take the average standardized prediction error sometimes referred to as the normalized estimation error squared nees li et al 2001 30 σ se 2 i n 1 y ˆ t i t i y ˆ t i t 2 σ 2 t i t where σ 2 t i t is the forecast uncertainty of the i th step ahead forecast the square root of eq 30 will give the number of standard deviations that the realized state outcome y ˆ t i t i is from the forecast mean y ˆ t i t thus when σ se 1 96 then the state observation exceeds the 95 confidence interval of the forecast this implies the prediction model is unable to sufficiently encompass the prediction errors 6 comparison of forecast models 6 1 data collection process data was collected from two different auvs designed for intervention tasks in shallow bathymetry the first is an auv prototype being developed for exploration under antarctic sea ice dubbed the antarctic auv a auv fig 3 the second is an auv manipulator system for high pressure water cleaning of bridge piles and submerged infrastructure dubbed the submerged pile inspection robot spir fig 6 raw sensor data was collected from an inertial measurement unit imu onboard each auv whilst they were subject to wave motion the linear motion is in m s2 and the angular motion is in rad s each of the auvs was placed in a test tank at separate time and left to float freely on the surface of the water waves were manually generated by using a large object to displace the water the tank measures 6 m in length and 4 m in width with the wavelength of 4 m matching the shorter side of the tank due to harmonic resonance the data were recorded at 50 hz 6 2 selection of model parameters 6 2 1 time series model parameters for the arma p q method were chosen based on analysing correlograms for samples of motion data fig 2 using values of p 30 produced capricious results in the forecast when coupled with a kf it was found that an arma 40 0 model produced stable forecasts up to 5 s ahead a lag length of l 250 5 s of historical data was used to solve the coefficients in eq 1 each time step this was then used to formulate the state propagation matrices in eq 3 various combinations of an arma 40 q model were also tested though prediction results did not improve an arma 40 1 is presented in this paper 6 2 2 fourier series the fourier series with ekf was implemented with m 5 and m 10 harmonics in general it was found that a higher number of harmonics lead to the method overfitting the model to noise to optimize the initial coefficients eq 9 was solved using a lag length of l 400 data points 8 s of historical data 6 2 3 gaussian process the hyperparameters for the kernel functions eqs 24 and 26 can be fitted via gradient descent optimization via the log likelihood function rasmussen and williams 2006 and roberts et al 2013 these were fitted with 600 samples within the data collected initial values were randomized and several attempts at optimization were conducted to ensure convergence in the result a moving window of l 200 2 s of historical observations were used for the input space for calculating the covariance matrices used in eqs 22 and 23 this was found to produce more accurate predictions than shorter windows 6 3 antarctic auv the a auv weighs approximately 17 kg the three prediction methods were tested on 60 s worth of imu data thirty 30 seconds worth of this data is shown in fig 4 forecasts were made in 0 02 s increments for a maximum of l 250 steps equating to a 5 s forecast lead 6 3 1 mean forecast accuracy results for theil s inequality coefficient eq 29 were averaged for 10 step intervals up to 5 s in total length which can be seen in table 1 by inspection it can be seen that the gpr with either a matérn or periodic kernel has better short term mean predictions than either time series or the fourier series methods the long term performance results of the arma 40 0 time series model has comparable performance to the gpr methods both of these also better captured the periodicity in the motion 1 2 s than the fourier series becker et al 2008 had claimed that an arma model performed better than a simple ar for predicting the unwanted tremor of a surgeon s hand during microsurgery the results of this analysis showed that extending the arma 40 0 to an arma 40 1 did not improve results in fact it can be seen in table 1 that the inclusion of the ma term over corrects the 1 step ahead predictions leading to poorer results this is to be expected from the analysis of the correlograms in section 2 fig 2 which indicated a high order ar p 0 process the fourier series with m 10 harmonics actually proved to have slightly better 1 step ahead predictions than time series this was also noted by from et al 2011 in their analysis of ship motion prediction however the long term forecasts are not as accurate and the method did not adequately track the periodicity in the data 6 3 2 forecast uncertainty the standard error of the forecasts eq 30 for the a auv motion data are plotted in table 2 for 10 step intervals the gpr with the periodic kernel function underestimates the prediction error for forecast horizons 1 s in length with observations outside the 3 σ or 99 97 confidence interval these generally improve for long term predictions with forecasts under this 3 σ range the fourier series overall appears to have good short term uncertainty bounds for m 10 harmonics although the long term uncertainty intervals encompass the realized state observation this usually falls within the 1 σ range 68 and hence could be regarded as too conservative the time series method overall had very poor prediction uncertainty in excess of 3 σ and thus state observations routinely fall outside the 99 97 confidence interval from et al 2011 had noted that the time series had low forecast error variance and opted for this over fourier series for their mpc problem however the findings here would suggest the forecast uncertainty of the time series is unreliable for the data used in this paper 6 4 submerged pile inspection robot spir the spir weighs approximately 45 kg fig 6 as with the a auv the different prediction methods were tested on 60 s worth of data a 30 s sample is shown in fig 7 as before forecasts were made at 0 2 s intervals for l 250 steps equating to a maximum 5 s lead time theil s inequality coefficient eq 29 and the standard errors eq 30 were calculated and averaged for every 10th step 6 4 1 mean forecast accuracy theil s inequality coefficient for the spir motion prediction is shown in table 4 it can be seen that this data proved much more difficult to predict for all the forecasting methods presented in this paper in particular theil s inequality coefficient u 1 for the surge motion with all the prediction methods tested this implies that in practice it would be better to use a last value predictor the gp methods had very accurate 1 step ahead predictions u 0 01 and the periodic kernel had generally good predictions for the dimensions other than surge for forecasts 2 s in length the matérn kernel performed poorly for long terms predictions on further analysis of the spir motion data it was found to be nonstationary this may explain the poor results of the forecasting methods compared to the a auv data ironically the fourier series with m 5 was better at forecasting surge motion than all the other models 6 4 2 forecast uncertainty the results of the forecast uncertainty table 5 also prove to be much worse overall for the spir motion data than the a auv again the time series is overconfident in its predictions with standard errors in excess of 3 σ and both the matérn and periodic kernel functions for the gp have significantly large standard errors for the predictions 6 5 performance summary based on the analysis of the different forecasting methods a summary of their different performance strengths is given in table 3 fourier series alone had the best short term forecast uncertainties although failed to capture periodicity time series appears to have good long term mean predictions and estimates of the periodicity in the data overall the gp with periodic kernel performed best with the stationary data 7 discussion 7 1 time series vs fourier series from et al 2011 stated that an ar time series model was better for predicting ship motion than fourier series conversely yuen et al 2008 concluded that fourier series using an ekf was better at predicting heart motion than ar the question was posed in the introduction as to whether the application of the ekf could improve forecasts for marine vessels under wave excitation over time series the results of this paper showed that an ar 40 model with state space form produced more accurate long term predictions than the ekf method with the data presented these results are to be expected as the ekf method was originally proposed by parker and anderson 1990 to track hidden frequencies in periodic data and not for producing forecasts per se 7 2 model parameters becker et al 2008 had found that using an arma model was better at predicting the periodic tremors of a surgeon s hand during teleoperated surgery compared to a simple ar analysis of the statistical properties for some of the motion data indicated a high order ar model moreover the results of the mean prediction accuracy showed that an arma 40 1 model did not significantly improve motion prediction for auvs over an ar 40 0 model in fact the additional ma term appeared to over correct the 1 step ahead predictions table 1 for the fourier series it was found that using m 10 harmonics produced the best overall results for all dof of vehicle motion with stationary data these results are commensurate with the m 8 harmonics that yuen et al 2008 used for heart motion prediction 7 3 forecast uncertainty the forecast uncertainty was considered a critical factor in this paper for evaluating a prediction model from et al 2011 had noted that the long term prediction errors had lower variance than that of fourier series the results in this paper showed that the forecast uncertainty for auv motion prediction is very small leading to large standard errors for the predictions table 2 5 the reason for this is clear the uncertainty propagation for the time series model eq 4 is a function of the 1 step ahead prediction error variance σ ε 2 thus a small variance in prediction error leads to overconfidence in the forecast uncertainty likewise the gp method also greatly underestimated prediction error when applied to the nonstationary motion data of the spir if these methods are to be applied in predictive control the forecast uncertainty would need to be manually increased to account for this overconfidence 7 4 vehicle geometry and data stationarity both the a auv and the spir motion data were collected in the same test tank however it was found that the a auv data exhibited stationarity whereas the spir did not as a consequence all the prediction models presented performed poorly when forecasting the spir motion data according to dean and dalrymple 1991 an unpropelled object floating in water is dominated by the particle accelerations and the pressure field as such the different geometry between the two vehicles may help explain the discrepancies in the observed motion both vehicles are neutrally buoyant and sit fully submerged in the water column the length of the waves during the data collection was approximately 4 m due to resonance with the 4 m width of the tank the wave height reached approximately 320 mm fig 9 illustrates the pressure gradients from the surrounding water on the a auv and spir from a passing wave because the body of the spir is longer than that of the a auv a minute net force would be generated by a passing wave this would cause it to drift over time with the propagation of the waves which was also observed during data collection the force in the x direction from this pressure field on a rectangular object is given as dean and dalrymple 1991 31 f x 2 ρ gh k sin θ sinh kh sinh k h d kcosh kh δ where 32 δ sin 1 2 kl x cos θ sin 1 2 kl y sin θ sin ω t and d is the draught depth of submersion for the vessel g is the gravitational acceleration h is the wavelength h is the wave height k is a constant l x l y is the length and width of the vessel respectively ρ is the fluid density θ is the angle of wave propagation w r t the vehicle and ω is the wave frequency the force being generated is a function of the vehicle heading relative to the wave propagation θ fig 10 shows a diagram comparing the spir and the a auv in the x y plane the spir s centre of mass does not align with the centre of volume as such any net wave forces on the body will cause a yaw moment and a subsequent change in θ over time fig 11 shows how there is an underlying curvature to the yaw motion data in fig 8 furthermore if the angle of the wave propagation with respect to the robot θ changes over time because of said yaw moment then the surge and sway forces will also drift with time this may account for the nonstationarity of the data conversely the body of the a auv is cylindrical in shape and will thus not incur any large yaw moments from passing waves the amplitude of the yaw motion data is mostly smaller than that of the spir moreover it has a constant zero mean fig 5 and hence exhibits stationarity 7 5 potential avenues to improve forecasting there are a couple of methods that can be used to deal with the nonstationary nature of the spir motion data the first is to use an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model box et al 2016 using this method the data is differenced until stationarity is achieved an arima p 1 q model for example would predict δ y ˆ instead of y ˆ another option is to use gpr with a nonstationary kernel function brahim belhouari and bermak 2004 showed good results for predicting respiratory data with a nonstationary kernel this may be a point of future research that said the time series and gp with periodic kernel performed better than a last value prediction for prediction horizons 2 5 s for all but the surge motion 8 conclusion there are many scenarios in which robotic systems are subject to disturbances which leads to periodic near sinusoidal behaviour both time series and fourier series have been successfully applied to predictive control strategies in previous literature however performance results in the prediction accuracy of each method differs depending on derivation parameters and application in this paper time series fourier series and gaussian process regression were applied to motion prediction of two small auvs designed for intervention tasks in shallow bathymetry mean forecast accuracy was assessed using theil s inequality coefficient which gives an agnostic measure of performance versus a naïve last value predictor furthermore the confidence interval of forecasts was studied for each model to determine if they could adequately capture uncertainty about the future state the results of the analysis showed that a gp combined with a periodic rational quadratic kernel function performed better than both the time series and fourier series for the short term mean prediction error and for the long term the gp had comparable performance to time series analysis of the forecast uncertainty revealed new and interesting insights the time series method had low forecast uncertainty as noted in prior research and thus was overconfident in its prediction estimate conversely the fourier series was the most conservative of the three methods the gp method was overconfident in the short term but provided the best confidence bounds for long term forecasts acknowledgements this work is supported in part by the australian research council arc linkage project

22441,a 3d experimental investigation on the effect of the ballasting on the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system is presented in the paper the tunnel immersion system consists of a tunnel element and two pontoons connected by suspension lines and moored with mooring lines tunnel pontoon motions and suspension mooring tensions subjected to beam irregular waves are measured synchronously the effect of the ballasting on the coupled responses of the system is examined quantitively considering various peak wave periods and significant wave heights particular attention is also paid to the effect of the wave runup on the system dynamics it is found that the ballasting would contribute to suppress the effect of the wave runup and to attenuate the roll resonance effect and thus to diminish the relative motions between the tunnel and pontoons and to reduce the occurrence probabilities of the slack and snap loadings on the suspension lines to avoid certain risk from the wave runup effect and the roll resonance effect it is recommended that the suspension lines not be released until the tunnel is ballasting during the practical operation keywords experimental investigation tunnel immersion system coupled dynamics ballasting wave runup effect 1 introduction to meet the acceleration of urbanization and the increasing traffic demand various underwater transportations have been constructed including mined tunnels shield tunnels immersed tunnels etc nowadays the immersed tunnels utilization is enhanced by its multiple advantages e g better quality and greater efficiency of the construction cost effectiveness for larger water depths and soft seedbed conditions good stability and serviceability under earthquake reduced environmental impact etc gursoy 1995 ingerslev and fasce 2012 the immersed tunnels are tunnels that consist of very large precast concrete or concrete filled steel tunnel sections elements the elements are usually prefabricated in shipyards and towed to the immersion location once the weather conditions are suitable a series of installation preparations will be conducted to the elements before its lowering including adjusting position mooring to the seabed suspending from the immersion rigs through connecting cables and ballasting to provide sufficient buoyancy resistance grantz 2001 during this preliminary installation the dynamic responses of the tunnel immersion system consisting a tunnel element and two pontoons connected by suspension lines and moored with mooring lines would have significant impact on the immersing stability the element positioning and also the security of the suspending and mooring lines which is one of the most crucial issues in the element immersion much work has been carried out on the in situ stability and seismic response of the tunnel elements aono et al 2004 ding et al 2006 anastasopoulos et al 2007 oorsouw 2010 regarding the tunnel immersion there are only a few studies on the analysis of the hydrodynamic responses of the tunnel element during its towing mooring and immersing zhou et al 2001 zhan and wang 2001 and xiao et al 2010 carried out experimental studies on the tensions in the mooring and suspension lines for the towing and immersion of the tunnel element across rivers under a few regular wave and current conditions chakrabarti et al 2008 and cozijn and heo 2009 performed both model tests and time domain simulation using motsim to investigate the motions of the tunnel during immersion but only limited numerical data were presented nagel 2011 conducted a 2d frequency domain analysis on the dynamic behavior of the tunnel element immersed 1 m below the free surface it was found that high forces of the hoisting cables occurred during motion resonance zuo and wang 2015 and yang et al 2017 applied 2d experimental tests and numerical model to investigate the motion of the tunnel element suspended by a moored barge for immersion depths varying from 10 m to 20 m under irregular waves song et al 2014 2015 performed experimental studies on dynamic responses of hoist ropes subjected to irregular waves it was found that during the freeboard elimination the suspension line undergo great dynamic tensions and frequent slacks huang et al 2016 also conducted experiments to obtain the motion of the tunnel under irregular waves during the preliminary immersion besides the wave excitations the motion of the immersed tunnel element is also significantly affected by floating immersion rigs through mechanical interaction suspension lines and hydrodynamic interaction furthermore the relative motion between the tunnel and rigs which could introduce dangerous situations during installation operation is also one of major considerations in the tunnel pontoon system design particularly during ballasting the mechanical parameters of the element varying with overweight would play an important role in the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system thus for a safe and effective immersion preparation in seas it is important to have a comprehensive exploration into the hydrodynamic and mechanical coupling mechanism of the system and the varied influence of correlative factors on it unfortunately most of reported literatures rarely analyze the synchronous motions of the tunnel element and the pontoons under irregular waves the relative motion and the coupling effects between the tunnel and pontoons is still remained to be investigated during the element ballasting another consideration is that during the ballasting process the wave runup at the tunnel surface would exceed the element freeboard smaller than 30 cm significantly this can exert huge impact forces on the tunnel element and consequently affect the coupled dynamics of the whole system since this strongly nonlinear phenomenon are difficult to be evaluated quantitatively by numerical simulation the most traditional and effective way is still to carry out experiments xiao et al 2014 in this paper a series of 3d experiments are conducted to investigate the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system in ballasting under beam irregular waves for assessing the coupling effect the tunnel rig motions and the suspension mooring tensions are measured synchronously the effect of the ballasting on the relative motion between the tunnel and pontoon is quantitively examined for various peak wave periods and significant wave heights it is worthy to note herein that there is almost no work has been conducted on experimental investigation for the effect of the ballasting on the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system moreover for the first time the wave runup effect on the coupled dynamics of the system between different overweight stages is examined in this experimental study the paper is arranged as section 2 gives detailed information to describe the experimental setup and analysis methods furthermore a modal analysis is provided to derive the system properties essential for further response investigations section 3 discusses different coupling behavior tunnel pontoon motion relative motion suspending and mooring tensions of the tunnel immersion system for different overweight stages and this section also investigates the effect of the wave runup on the coupling dynamics of the system finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 experiments 2 1 physical model of the tunnel immersion system the physical model of the tunnel immersion system consists of a tunnel element and two immersion rigs connected by suspension lines and moored to the basin bottom the geometrical and the structural characteristics of the floaters the suspension and mooring lines are defined based on the immersed tunnel of hong kong zhuhai macau link project only a brief summary of the experimental setup is provided in this section and detailed information can be referred to song et al 2018 during the preliminary immersion of the project the tunnel element experiences the lowering from small freeboard 30 cm to the freeboard eliminated with 0 overweight when the buoyancy equals to the gravity and finally 1 5 overweight after ballasting the dynamic responses of the 30 cm freeboard element have been investigated by song et al 2018 in this study it is focused on the comparison of the system dynamics between the overweight of the tunnel element η gravity buoyancy buoyancy as 0 0 for freeboard elimination and 1 5 after ballasting the whole model is scaled following the froude s law with a model scale of 1 60 considering the dimensions of the basin and tunnel element as well as the capacity of the wavemaker the tunnel element model is manufactured from acrylic and concrete with a ballasting cabin set internally to adjust the overweight the two immersion rigs are made of light wood consisting of two hollow and airtight cuboid floaters and a top deck the sketch of the models is shown in fig 1 the detailed geometrical and structural characteristic of tunnel element and pontoon are given in table 1 in consistent with the prototype the tunnel element is hold by two rigs through four suspension wires and each floater is moored on the bottom by four mooring lines the mechanical parameters of all the target and model lines are listed in table 2 in the experiments the stiff ropes combined with clump weights have been utilized for all the model lines to satisfy the geometric and mass similarities to maintain the elastic properties of the prototype lines the model lines are also calibrated using different sections of appropriate linear springs to match the tension deformation curves calculated by the equation 1 t m c p d p 2 δ s s n λ 3 where t m is the model tension and c p the elasticity modulus δs s the relative elongation and n 1 5 for the prototype wire it can be seen in fig 2 that the tension deformation curves of the model lines have an excellent agreement with the theoretical curves 2 2 experimental setup the experimental investigation is conducted in the 3d basin of the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology china the basin is 40 m long 24 m wide and 1 2 m deep a piston type wavemaker equipped with an active wave absorption control system is installed at one end of the basin at the other end of the basin a gravel beach covered with porous metallic strips is located at the other end to absorb waves and to minimize undesirable reflections additionally to achieve totally unidirectional incident waves wave absorbers are placed on two sides of the basin in parallel with the wave propagating direction to avoid lateral wave reflection fig 3 presents the sketch of the wave basin with the tunnel pontoon physical model installed in proper position the whole floating system consists of twelve mooring lines and four suspending lines as shown in fig 3 for each floater the four mooring lines are symmetrically placed along the x axis and arranged with an inclined 60 angle against the x axis during the tests the pretension on the mooring lines is set as 1n 216 kn in prototype in the model scale to achieve a better constraint on the floaters for the suspension wires the initial tension is set as 0n for 0 overweight and enlarged as 8 8n 1900 kn in prototype for 1 5 overweight 2 3 measuring equipment prior to the installation of the floating bodies the wave elevation and wave lengths are measured by wave probes of resistance type placed where the structure is to be installed the significant wave height and the wave peak period are checked till errors are within 5 to address the coupling effects of the tunnel pontoon system the movements of the tunnel pontoon and tensile forces in mooring suspension tensions lines are measured synchronously for each test the arrangement of the measuring system on the system is illustrated in fig 4 sixteen tensile gauges are arranged separately to measure the tensions on the mooring lines and suspension lines considering the symmetric configuration of the system under beam wave actions the 6 degrees of freedom of the tunnel and one pontoon the upward one in fig 3 a are measured using an electromagnetic motion system as shown in fig 4 two receiving sensors are fastened on the central surface of the tunnel element and the pontoon left in front view and the transmitter is fixed upon the tunnel pontoon system which conducts non contact measurement to record the real time six dofs of the tunnel in a 3d rectangular coordinate system as shown in fig 5 the local coordinate origins of tunnel pontoon are on the centroid of tunnel pontoon left in front view respectively the accuracy of the motion measuring apparatus is better than 1 mm for translations and 0 1 for rotations all the sampling rates of the measured data are 50 hz 2 4 wave conditions in the present study the scales for wave height and wave period are 1 60 and 1 7 74 respectively the prototype water depth is fixed at 36 m the jonswap type spectra is chosen to simulate the targeted random seas in the experiments which is given by 2 s ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 1 25 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 where ω is the circular wave frequency ω p the frequency at which the spectrum peaks g the acceleration due to gravity α the phillips constant 0 0081 γ the peakedness parameter 3 3 σ the width parameter where σ 0 07 for ω ω p σ 0 09 for ω ω p during the tests the spectrum peak period t p are simulated varying from 0 77s to 2 58s with significant wave height fixed at h s 3 33 cm the significant wave height varies from 1 67 cm to 5 00 cm with spectrum peak period fixed at t p 1 03s the characteristic parameters of the irregular waves in the experiments are listed in table 3 as proposed by the 17th international towing tank conference in 1984 a record length equal to 100 times the largest expected single wave period in the irregular waves is adopted to obtain proper spectral shapes and statistical values fig 6 gives the comparison between the measured and targeted spectra under wave conditions of h s 3 33 cm t p 0 77s 1 03s 1 55s and 2 58s and the figure shows that measured and target spectra match well 2 5 modal analysis the fully coupled tunnel pontoon system includes 18 modes of rigid body motions to evaluate the eigen properties of the coupled tunnel pontoon system ansys aqwa is used to perform the modal analysis of the system with frequency dependent added mass and damping this potential flow based radiation and diffraction program employs 3d green s function to simulate linearized hydrodynamic loads on floating rigid bodies and it has gained widespread recognition in solving the interactions among multiple floating bodies for its accuracy and efficiency results of the modal analysis for the coupled tunnel pontoon system for 1 5 overweight are provided in table 4 which lists 18 natural frequencies and eigenvectors the dominant coupled degrees of freedom in each eigenvector are marked in bold 3 results and discussion in this section results of the experimental investigation are presented firstly the synchronous motions of the tunnel element and the pontoon the measured one as shown in figs 3 and 4 are compared for different overweight stages of 0 and 1 5 then the relative motion and the tensile forces in the suspension lines and mooring lines are studied focusing on the effect of the overweight wave period and wave height finally special attention is paid on the effect of the wave runup on the system dynamics 3 1 motions of the tunnel element and the pontoon before quantitatively showing the effect of the overweight fig 7 gives the qualitive illustration of the time histories of the tunnel pontoon motions for η 0 0 and 1 5 to figure out the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tunnel pontoon system due to the roll resonance the wave condition is chosen to have the significant wave height of h s 3 33 cm and wave peak period close to the roll natural period t p 1 16s correspondingly the spectra of the tunnel pontoon motions are also obtained by fourier transform and plotted in fig 8 as indicated in figs 7 and 8 for η 0 0 and η 1 5 the sways of both the tunnel and pontoon are composed of a wave frequency motion and a low frequency motion this low frequency sway results from the action of the wave drift forces and corresponds to the in phase sway frequency of the tunnel pontoon at f 0 085 hz mode 2 the surges of both the tunnel and pontoon are dominated by a low frequency component of f 0 062 hz corresponding to the in phase surge frequency of the tunnel pontoon mode 1 while another small peak can be found in the pontoon s surge at f 0 45 hz in according to the anti phase surge of the two pontoons mode 10 moreover it is noted that the increase of overweight leads to a decrease in the tunnel s sway and surge but it limitedly affects those of the pontoon from fig 7 it can also be observed that the element ballasting exerts significant influence on the heave of the tunnel pontoon for η 0 0 the tunnel s downward displacement is much greater than the upward one with the heave s equilibrium position drift downward dramatically this can be associated with the noticeable wave runup over the tunnel surface and the lack of the restoring force furthermore due to the connecting suspension lines the heave of the pontoon is also affected and it presents similar features however this phenomenon vanishes when the element is ballasted to 1 5 overweight during which the heaves of the tunnel pontoon behave almost symmetric in both directions the upward displacement is slightly larger than the downward one this may demonstrate that the element ballasting could effectively attenuate the wave runup effect on the coupled tunnel pontoon system as shown in fig 8 the heaves of both the tunnel and pontoon are governed by the wave frequency component and they are also slightly affected by a low frequency component at f 0 139 hz which is close to the in phase heave frequency of the tunnel pontoon mode 4 with the enlarge of the overweight the low frequency heave of the tunnel pontoon is slightly reduced but their wave frequency heave is enlarged a bit fig 8 also reveals that the rolls of the tunnel and pontoon are dominated by wave frequency component and experience a decrease as a result of the element ballasting interestingly it is found that the pontoon s pitch has a greater peak value at f 1 16 hz than that at the wave peak frequency due to the response amplification close to the anti phase pitch of the two pontoons mode 13 in contrast the pitch of the tunnel is much smaller and it is governed by wave frequency component it can also be found that the increasing overweight introduces greater pitch for both the tunnel and pontoon in addition the tunnel s yaw is dominated by the low frequency component of f 0 116 hz which matches to the mode frequency of the in phase yaw of the tunnel and pontoon mode 3 while the pontoon s yaw shows a dominant peak at f 0 294 hz corresponding to the anti phase yaw of the two pontoons mode 5 and as indicated in fig 8 the low frequency yaw of the tunnel shows a reduction after ballasting but the pontoon s yaw is not affected significantly the maximum and minimum motions of the tunnel and pontoon are plotted against the wave peak period in fig 9 for overweight stages of 0 0 and 1 5 in order to highlight the effect of the roll resonance the wave period is normalized by the roll period t roll 1 16s and the relative wave period t t roll ranges from 0 66 to 2 22 the significant wave height is fixed at 3 33 cm the sway of the tunnel and pontoon are generally increased with the increase of the wave period it is found that due to the ballasting the tunnel s sway is diminished dramatically at t p t roll where the ballasting contributes to reduce the dominant low frequency component of the tunnel sway however the effect of the overweight on the pontoon s sway is found to be negligible from fig 9 it can also be seen that as the wave period is enlarged the tunnel surge is firstly increased and then is decreased forming a subtle local peak around t p t roll while the pontoon surge shows a gradual increasing trend additionally compared with the 0 overweight stage the tunnel pontoon surge are slightly reduced with η 1 5 for t p t roll with respect to the heave the tunnel and pontoon have similar trend against the wave period and overweight during the ballasting stage the heaves of the tunnel and pontoon are both increased with enlarged wave peak period for t p 1 2t roll and then stay constant for longer waves an increase in the overweight leads to smaller downward displacements of the tunnel pontoon but slightly larger upward displacements this can be attributed to the fact that the suspension lines pretensioned by ballast water have more effective restraint on the tunnel especially when it moves downward relative to the pontoon such behavior is evident for relatively short waves of t p t roll and is strongly related to the effect of the wave runup which will be further discussed in section 3 5 the rolls of both the tunnel and pontoons are increased with larger wave period and then they are decreased the peak values of the roll are observed at t p t roll 1 11 for η 0 0 and at t p t roll 0 89 for η 1 5 moreover the roll amplitudes of both the tunnel and pontoon are marginally affected by the increasing overweight except for a slight reduction with η 1 5 for t p t roll 0 89 1 11 as shown in fig 9 the magnitudes of the tunnel s pitch and yaw are small and within 1 deg and show a quite small variation as the peak wave period is increased with the enlarged overweight the pitch of the tunnel behaves more symmetric in both directions but the tunnel yaw shows no significant difference the pitch of the pontoon has a clear decreasing tendency with the increased wave peak period but it is limitedly affected by the overweight in addition for the pontoon s yaw it is decreased with larger overweight and significant peak values are observed at t p t roll 0 89 1 11 which could be related to the roll resonance effect fig 10 shows the variation of the maximum and minimum motions of the tunnel pontoon with the variation of significant wave height for different overweight stages the significant wave heights are selected to be 1 67 cm 5 00 cm and the same peak wave period t p 1 03s is chosen the results reveal that the motion amplitudes of the tunnel and pontoon are increased with the increase of the significant wave height for all six degrees of freedom it can be observed that the increasing tendency of the sway displacement becomes greater for higher waves especially along the wave propagation direction this can be closely associated with the existence of large mean drift forces as wave height increases yielding a greater offset of the sway equilibrium position besides the surge pitch and yaw of the pontoon show significant amplitudes in higher waves of h s 3 33 cm especially for η 0 0 this should be carefully treated during ballasting in case of the collision between the tunnel and pontoons with 0 26 m clearance comparing the cases of η 0 0 and 1 5 it is worthy to note that the most prominent influence of the ballasting takes place in the heave for the tunnel pontoon in the cases of η 0 0 as the wave height is enlarged the downward movements of the tunnel pontoon are increased with a faster trend but this does not occur in the upward displacements while for η 1 5 the increasing tendency becomes approximately linear for both the downward and upward displacements of the tunnel pontoon 3 2 relative motion between the tunnel and pontoon the relative motion between the tunnel and pontoon is defined in this paper as the tunnel motion minus the synchronous pontoon motion fig 11 displays the selected time history of the relative motion for η 0 0 1 5 for a representative sea state t p 1 16s h s 3 33 cm in general it can be found that the relative heave and relative roll are most sensitive to the element overweight followed by the relative sway the results show that the element ballasting with the increase of pretension on the suspension lines can effectively diminish the positive relative heave this corresponds to the reduction of the downward displacement gap between the tunnel and pontoon for η 1 5 as shown in fig 7 moreover the ballasting also has a significantly negative effect on the relative roll this is unexpected considering the small roll magnitude difference between the tunnel and pontoon as indicated in fig 7 this demonstrates that it is of great importance to analyze the synchronous relative motion between the tunnel and pontoon for a thorough understanding of the fully coupled dynamics of the system rather than only the comparison of the motion characteristics of the tunnel and pontoon based on the measurements in fig 11 the spectral results of the relative motion are depicted in fig 12 by comparing fig 12 with fig 8 it can be found that besides the wave frequency and low frequency components as in the absolute motions the relative heave also exhibits a high frequency peak at f 1 8 hz which can be related to the anti phase heave frequency of the tunnel and pontoons mode 17 analogous conclusions can be drawn for the relative roll which has a high frequency component of f 1 6 hz close to the anti phase roll frequency of the tunnel and pontoons mode 16 moreover due to the small amplitude of the tunnel surge pitch and yaw the relative surge pitch and yaw are very similar to those of the pontoon from fig 12 it can also be seen that with the increased overweight the low frequency components of the relative sway and relative surge are decreased but the wave frequency component is little affected moreover the wave frequency component of the relative pitch is enlarged after ballasting most importantly the spectral peaks of the relative heave and relative roll have a noteworthy reduction in wave frequency low frequency and also high frequency which means that both the in phase and anti phase heave and roll of the system diminish with the increased overweight the variation of the maximum values of the relative motion as function of t p t roll is depicted for η 0 0 and 1 5 in fig 13 in the case of η 1 5 the positive relative heave downward direction is much smaller than that of η 0 0 since the downward movement of the tunnel is dramatically reduced after ballasting due to the elimination of the wave runup effect similar trend can also be observed in the both directions of the relative roll as a result it may be concluded that the element ballasting can contribute to attenuate the coupling effect between the tunnel and pontoons especially for the relative heave and relative roll which would play a crucial role in dynamic suspension tensions interestingly it can be also found that the attenuation of these oscillations is most pronounced when the incident wave period close to the roll period t p 0 89 1 11t roll with reduction approaching 79 for the positive relative heave and 65 for the relative roll this demonstrates that the element ballasting significantly attenuates the influence of the roll resonance on the system dynamics consequently for η 0 0 the positive relative heave and relative roll tend to increase and then decrease with enlarged wave peak period exhibiting a great peak value at t p t roll but for η 1 5 the variations become much smoother fig 13 also shows that as the wave period is increased the relative sway fluctuates and it is relatively large for t p 1 3t roll meanwhile greater overweight leads to a smaller positive relative sway with a maximum reduction of 41 along the wave propagation direction which can be related to the reduced tunnel sway in fig 8 the relative surge varies little with increasing wave peak period for t p 1 3t roll and has an evident increasing trend with longer waves while a significant decreasing trend against the wave period can be seen in the relative pitch resulting from the surge and yaw of the pontoon the relative surge and relative yaw also show large peak values near the roll resonance period of t p t roll 0 89 1 11 it is also found that with the element ballasted these local peaks can be reduced by a significant level of 55 this verifies again the ballasting can contribute to attenuate the roll resonance effect of the system fig 14 compares the peak value of the relative motion for η 0 0 and 1 5 under various significant wave height h s 1 67 5 0 cm fig 14 reveals that the relative motion is increased for all the 6 dofs as the wave height is enlarged specifically the growing trend of the relative heave in downward direction positive and the relative roll is greatly intensified for h s 2 0 m this can be attributed to the enlarging phase lag and widened amplitude difference between the tunnel and pontoon due to higher waves this also happens to the relative surge and yaw which could arise high risk of collision between tunnel and pontoons meanwhile it is also found that with the increase of the overweight magnitudes of the relative heave relative roll relative surge and relative yaw show more evident reduction for h s 2 0 m this reveals again that the element ballasted to η 1 5 has an effective restraint on the coupling effect between the tunnel and pontoons 3 3 tensions in suspension lines fig 15 gives the time histories of the suspension tension during ballasting for different negative buoyancies of η 0 0 1 5 under wave condition of h s 3 33 cm t p 1 16s lines 1 and 3 are seaward and lines 2 and 4 are leeward to observe the slack and the snap load clearly a typical duration of 30s is zoomed in and it is presented from the completed time history of 160s it can be seen that for η 0 0 the suspension tension has continual zero moments over time this suggests that the slack of the suspension lines occurs frequently under freeboard elimination which is prone to incur the snap loading and high extreme tension on the suspension lines fortunately it can be observed that after ballasting the slack phenomenon of the suspension lines is weakened as it happens only due to some high waves with a much lower probability results of the corresponding spectral analysis are provided in fig 16 the suspension tensions show multi peak characteristics including a low frequency peak of f 0 139 hz corresponding to the in phase heave of the tunnel and pontoons mode 4 a peak of wave spectral frequency and a high frequency peak at f 1 8 hz and 2 37 hz which can be due to the dynamic amplification of mode 16 and 17 the anti phase heave and roll of the tunnel and pontoons the seaward lines have larger peak values than those of the leeward lines in the wave frequency and high frequency components compared with the case of η 0 0 the wave frequency components of the suspending tensions for η 1 5 get higher peak values with a narrower frequency range in the meantime the high frequency and low frequency suspension tension are decreased with the increase of the overweight which is expected since those of the relative roll and relative heave are significantly reduced as shown in fig 12 to provide an intuitive view of the effect of the ballasting on the slack phenomenon of the suspension line the occurrence probability of the relative slack on the suspension lines is statistically analyzed based on the experimental results it is defined herein that the relative slack occurs when one suspension line tension is smaller than 10 of the suspension line pretension of the ballasted element as 0 88n hence the slack probability is expressed as 3 f s l a c k n n n u m b e r f o r f f 0 n u m b e r o f d a t a where f represents the minimum tension on the four suspension lines f 0 is defined as the slack criterion of 10 of the suspension line pretension 0 88n and the number of the statistical data is 8192 for each set fig 17 shows the variation of the slack probability as function of wave peak period for η 0 0 and 1 5 with regard to the effect of the incident wave period on the ratio for η 0 0 the increase of t p up to 0 88t roll leads to a gradual reduction of the values of f slack the slack probability reaches a predominant peak of 0 64 at t p t roll which may be because of the drastic dynamic loading resulting from the significant coupling effect between the tunnel and pontoon induced by the roll resonance the f slack is limitedly changed with further increase of t p to 1 78t roll and tends to decrease with the increase of the wave peak period for t p 1 78t roll in the case of η 1 5 the f slack tends to increase and gets a small peak of 0 047 at t p t roll followed by a reduction till zero as seen from the curves for η 0 0 and 1 5 it is noted that the ballasting can effectively suppress the slack occurrence of the suspension lines with a much lower probability especially at the roll resonance period fig 18 presents the maximum tensions in the suspension lines f s f sy f s d and f sy d versus t p t roll for η 0 0 and 1 5 the subscripts s sy s d and sy d are used to denote the single line tension the synchronous total tension of four lines the dynamic tension for single line and for four lines absolute tension minus the pretension respectively the results indicate that f s f sy f s d and f sy d are all initially increased and then decreased with growing wave peak period exhibiting a local peak at t p t roll this can be associated with the roll resonance effect on the relative roll and heave as shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 18 a and b compared to the case of η 0 0 f s and f sy have slightly higher values with η 1 5 for t p t roll and for t p 1 1t roll their tension difference becomes larger but still less than the pretension resulting from the overweight the main reason can be found in fig 13 and fig 18 c d that after ballasting the relative motions are reduced significantly leading to smaller dynamic tension with a maximum 37 reduction for f s d and 51 for f sy d this also indicates again that the ballasting water of η 1 5 provides a satisfactory performance especially for the relative short waves of t p t roll to weaken the coupling effect of the system with only slight increase in the absolute suspension tensions fig 19 shows the effect of the wave height on the maximum tensions in the single suspension line and the synchronous total tensions in four suspension lines for η 0 0 and η 1 5 the wave conditions are h s 0 77 3 0 cm and t p 1 03s it can be seen that all the four tensions have a monotonically increasing trend with growing wave height in fig 19 c and d it is noted that for h s 3 33 cm the ballasting can reduce the dynamic tensions significantly and consequently the absolute suspension tensions f s and f sy are only slightly larger for η 1 5 than those of η 0 0 as indicated in fig 19 a and b however for higher waves of h s 4 cm the effect becomes marginal and f s and f sy are evidently increased after ballasting this demonstrates the ballasting seems to contribute more to the reduction of the dynamic tensions in the suspension lines for relatively small wave height 3 4 tensions in mooring lines of the tunnel pontoon fig 20 illustrates the time history of the mooring line tensions of the tunnel and pontoon for different negative buoyancies of η 0 0 1 5 under random wave excitations of t p 1 16s h s 3 33 cm line 7 and 8 are selected to present the seaward and leeward lines of the tunnel element while 14 and 15 for the seaward and leeward lines of the pontoon the corresponding spectral analysis results are given in fig 21 it can be observed that the mooring line tension of the tunnel is mainly controlled by the low frequency of f 0 085 hz corresponding to the in phase sway frequency of the tunnel and pontoon mode 2 combined with wave frequency in contrast except for the largest peak value in wave peak frequency the mooring tension spectra of the pontoon show four other peaks of frequency at f 0 085 hz in accordance with the 2nd mode in phase sway of the tunnel and pontoons f 0 23 hz with the 8th mode anti phase sway of the tunnel and pontoons f 0 40 hz with the 10th mode anti phase surge of the two pontoons and f 1 16 hz with the 13th mode anti phase pitch of the two pontoons of the coupled system respectively this reveals that the mooring line tension of the pontoon is more sensitive to the coupled motions of the system than that of the tunnel from the results of figs 20 21 it can be also concluded the ballasting could significantly reduce the low frequency component of the tunnel mooring tension which can be related to the tunnel sway in fig 8 however for the pontoon mooring tension a slight decrease is observed for most spectra peak values fig 22 shows the variation of the maximum mooring tensions of the tunnel and pontoon against t p t roll for η 0 0 and 1 5 it can be seen that the tensile forces in the mooring lines of the tunnel and pontoon have a general growth as the wave peak period is increased the mooring tensions of the tunnel subjected to short waves of t p t roll for η 1 5 are much less than those of η 0 0 while for longer waves it is not sensitive to overweight moreover it can be also observed that the ballasting has marginal influence on mooring line tension of the pontoon these features are consistent with those of the tunnel pontoon sway in fig 9 which indicates that the sway plays a leading role in the mooring line tensions the effect of the wave height on the maximum mooring tension of the tunnel and pontoon are compared with η 0 0 and η 1 5 in fig 23 the wave conditions are h s 0 77 3 0 cm and t p 1 03s it can be concluded that the increase of wave height results in larger mooring line tensions in addition the decreasing trend of the mooring tensions with the overweight is also slightly affected by the significant wave height 3 5 effect of the wave runup on the system dynamics note that the wave runup at the tunnel surface would exceed the element freeboard smaller than 0 5 cm in model scale significantly during the ballasting process as shown in fig 7 due to the occurrence of wave runup the equilibrium position of the tunnel s heave drifts downward greatly which affects the pontoon s heave through the connecting suspension lines and consequently their relative heave thus to quantify the wave runup effect on the hydrodynamic responses of the tunnel pontoon system the mean values of the tunnel pontoon s heaves m heave relative heave m r heave and synchronous suspending tension m fsy are plotted against t p t roll for η 0 0 1 5 in fig 24 comparing the tendency of the curves of m heave m r heave and m fsy in fig 24 it is found that the mean position drift of the tunnel s heave resulting from the wave runup occurrence has an important influence on the mean relative heave and thus the mean values of the synchronous tensions on the four suspension lines in cases of η 0 0 the mean heave values of the tunnel pontoon m heave relative heave m r heave and synchronous suspending tension m fsy all have a similar dependence on the wave period as the roll which tend to firstly increase and then decrease as the wave peak period enlarges exhibiting their peak values at t p t roll this is readily comprehensible that larger rolling oscillation leads to more drastic wave body interaction yielding stronger wave runup effect on the coupled dynamics of the system in addition the tunnel s mean heave is always greater than that of the pontoon and as a result m r heave is always positive which could have a positive effect on m fsy in contrast as the overweight is increased to 1 5 the wave runup effect is greatly attenuated leading to a significant decrease of downward displacements of the tunnel and pontoon the mean heave values of the tunnel and pontoon become negative which can be attributed to the fact that the restraint of the suspension lines results in the downward movement smaller than the upward movement as reported in section 3 1 as the wave peak period is enlarged the mean heave values of the tunnel pontoon are gradually increased and small peaks appear at t p 0 9t roll followed by a decrease resulting from the mean heave of the tunnel larger than that of the pontoon the mean relative heave is always negative and is expected to have a negative influence on the mean value of the synchronous total suspension tension therefore the increase of the wave peak period leads to a gradual reduction of m r heave and a growth of m fsy fig 25 provides the mean values of the tunnel pontoon heave the relative heave and the synchronous suspending tension versus the significant wave height for η 0 0 1 5 as shown in fig 25 a for η 0 0 larger wave height results in increasing positive mean heave values with an intensified tendency meanwhile the mean heave value of the tunnel grows twice as that of the pontoon leading to a greater relative heave in steeper waves this can be related to larger exceedance of the wave runup over the tunnel top resulting in an increasing mean value of the synchronous suspension tension as shown in fig 25 b however for η 1 5 the negative mean heave value has a slight increasing trend with the significant wave height leading to a gradual increase in the negative mean values of the relative heave accordingly the mean values of the synchronous suspending tension are observed to decrease with greater wave height overall it can be concluded that for η 0 0 the wave runup would provoke significant mean values of the relative heave and suspension tensions especially in waves of large amplitudes and roll resonance period luckily by ballasting the element to η 1 5 this worse effect can be eliminated due to the pretensioned suspension lines hence to avoid certain risk from the wave runup effect it is recommended that the connection of the tunnel element and pontoons not be converted to suspension lines from fixed buttress until the tunnel is ballasting 4 conclusion a 3d experimental study was conducted for investigating the hydrodynamic performance of the tunnel immersion system during the ballasting stage under beam irregular waves the main findings show 1 the mean position drift of the tunnel s heave resulting from the wave runup occurrence has a crucial influence on the mean relative heave and thus the mean values of synchronous suspending tensions 2 the element ballasting can effectively eliminate the wave runup effect on the dynamics of the tunnel immersion system increase of the overweight plays an important role in reducing mean values of the relative heave and synchronous suspending tensions 3 the larger the overweight is the less relative motion between floaters occurs and the smaller dynamic loading in the suspension lines is hence the element ballasting contributes to significantly reduce the occurring probabilities of the slack and snap loadings on the suspension lines 4 the ballasting diminishes the tunnel mooring tension for relatively short waves of t p t roll but it has marginal impact on the pontoon mooring tensions 5 the effect of the ballasting on system dynamics is strongly dependent on the wave excitations when the incident wave period is close to the roll resonance period the influence of the ballasting on the system dynamics is most pronounced meanwhile the impact of the variation of wave period and wave height on the system dynamics is weakened after ballasting it may be concluded that the tunnel is ballasted to 1 5 overweight provides a satisfactory performance to eliminate the wave runup effect and to attenuate the coupling of the immersion system to avoid certain risk from the wave runup effect and roll resonance effect it is recommended that the suspension lines not be released until the tunnel is ballasted during the practical operation acknowledgements the work is

22441,a 3d experimental investigation on the effect of the ballasting on the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system is presented in the paper the tunnel immersion system consists of a tunnel element and two pontoons connected by suspension lines and moored with mooring lines tunnel pontoon motions and suspension mooring tensions subjected to beam irregular waves are measured synchronously the effect of the ballasting on the coupled responses of the system is examined quantitively considering various peak wave periods and significant wave heights particular attention is also paid to the effect of the wave runup on the system dynamics it is found that the ballasting would contribute to suppress the effect of the wave runup and to attenuate the roll resonance effect and thus to diminish the relative motions between the tunnel and pontoons and to reduce the occurrence probabilities of the slack and snap loadings on the suspension lines to avoid certain risk from the wave runup effect and the roll resonance effect it is recommended that the suspension lines not be released until the tunnel is ballasting during the practical operation keywords experimental investigation tunnel immersion system coupled dynamics ballasting wave runup effect 1 introduction to meet the acceleration of urbanization and the increasing traffic demand various underwater transportations have been constructed including mined tunnels shield tunnels immersed tunnels etc nowadays the immersed tunnels utilization is enhanced by its multiple advantages e g better quality and greater efficiency of the construction cost effectiveness for larger water depths and soft seedbed conditions good stability and serviceability under earthquake reduced environmental impact etc gursoy 1995 ingerslev and fasce 2012 the immersed tunnels are tunnels that consist of very large precast concrete or concrete filled steel tunnel sections elements the elements are usually prefabricated in shipyards and towed to the immersion location once the weather conditions are suitable a series of installation preparations will be conducted to the elements before its lowering including adjusting position mooring to the seabed suspending from the immersion rigs through connecting cables and ballasting to provide sufficient buoyancy resistance grantz 2001 during this preliminary installation the dynamic responses of the tunnel immersion system consisting a tunnel element and two pontoons connected by suspension lines and moored with mooring lines would have significant impact on the immersing stability the element positioning and also the security of the suspending and mooring lines which is one of the most crucial issues in the element immersion much work has been carried out on the in situ stability and seismic response of the tunnel elements aono et al 2004 ding et al 2006 anastasopoulos et al 2007 oorsouw 2010 regarding the tunnel immersion there are only a few studies on the analysis of the hydrodynamic responses of the tunnel element during its towing mooring and immersing zhou et al 2001 zhan and wang 2001 and xiao et al 2010 carried out experimental studies on the tensions in the mooring and suspension lines for the towing and immersion of the tunnel element across rivers under a few regular wave and current conditions chakrabarti et al 2008 and cozijn and heo 2009 performed both model tests and time domain simulation using motsim to investigate the motions of the tunnel during immersion but only limited numerical data were presented nagel 2011 conducted a 2d frequency domain analysis on the dynamic behavior of the tunnel element immersed 1 m below the free surface it was found that high forces of the hoisting cables occurred during motion resonance zuo and wang 2015 and yang et al 2017 applied 2d experimental tests and numerical model to investigate the motion of the tunnel element suspended by a moored barge for immersion depths varying from 10 m to 20 m under irregular waves song et al 2014 2015 performed experimental studies on dynamic responses of hoist ropes subjected to irregular waves it was found that during the freeboard elimination the suspension line undergo great dynamic tensions and frequent slacks huang et al 2016 also conducted experiments to obtain the motion of the tunnel under irregular waves during the preliminary immersion besides the wave excitations the motion of the immersed tunnel element is also significantly affected by floating immersion rigs through mechanical interaction suspension lines and hydrodynamic interaction furthermore the relative motion between the tunnel and rigs which could introduce dangerous situations during installation operation is also one of major considerations in the tunnel pontoon system design particularly during ballasting the mechanical parameters of the element varying with overweight would play an important role in the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system thus for a safe and effective immersion preparation in seas it is important to have a comprehensive exploration into the hydrodynamic and mechanical coupling mechanism of the system and the varied influence of correlative factors on it unfortunately most of reported literatures rarely analyze the synchronous motions of the tunnel element and the pontoons under irregular waves the relative motion and the coupling effects between the tunnel and pontoons is still remained to be investigated during the element ballasting another consideration is that during the ballasting process the wave runup at the tunnel surface would exceed the element freeboard smaller than 30 cm significantly this can exert huge impact forces on the tunnel element and consequently affect the coupled dynamics of the whole system since this strongly nonlinear phenomenon are difficult to be evaluated quantitatively by numerical simulation the most traditional and effective way is still to carry out experiments xiao et al 2014 in this paper a series of 3d experiments are conducted to investigate the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system in ballasting under beam irregular waves for assessing the coupling effect the tunnel rig motions and the suspension mooring tensions are measured synchronously the effect of the ballasting on the relative motion between the tunnel and pontoon is quantitively examined for various peak wave periods and significant wave heights it is worthy to note herein that there is almost no work has been conducted on experimental investigation for the effect of the ballasting on the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system moreover for the first time the wave runup effect on the coupled dynamics of the system between different overweight stages is examined in this experimental study the paper is arranged as section 2 gives detailed information to describe the experimental setup and analysis methods furthermore a modal analysis is provided to derive the system properties essential for further response investigations section 3 discusses different coupling behavior tunnel pontoon motion relative motion suspending and mooring tensions of the tunnel immersion system for different overweight stages and this section also investigates the effect of the wave runup on the coupling dynamics of the system finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 experiments 2 1 physical model of the tunnel immersion system the physical model of the tunnel immersion system consists of a tunnel element and two immersion rigs connected by suspension lines and moored to the basin bottom the geometrical and the structural characteristics of the floaters the suspension and mooring lines are defined based on the immersed tunnel of hong kong zhuhai macau link project only a brief summary of the experimental setup is provided in this section and detailed information can be referred to song et al 2018 during the preliminary immersion of the project the tunnel element experiences the lowering from small freeboard 30 cm to the freeboard eliminated with 0 overweight when the buoyancy equals to the gravity and finally 1 5 overweight after ballasting the dynamic responses of the 30 cm freeboard element have been investigated by song et al 2018 in this study it is focused on the comparison of the system dynamics between the overweight of the tunnel element η gravity buoyancy buoyancy as 0 0 for freeboard elimination and 1 5 after ballasting the whole model is scaled following the froude s law with a model scale of 1 60 considering the dimensions of the basin and tunnel element as well as the capacity of the wavemaker the tunnel element model is manufactured from acrylic and concrete with a ballasting cabin set internally to adjust the overweight the two immersion rigs are made of light wood consisting of two hollow and airtight cuboid floaters and a top deck the sketch of the models is shown in fig 1 the detailed geometrical and structural characteristic of tunnel element and pontoon are given in table 1 in consistent with the prototype the tunnel element is hold by two rigs through four suspension wires and each floater is moored on the bottom by four mooring lines the mechanical parameters of all the target and model lines are listed in table 2 in the experiments the stiff ropes combined with clump weights have been utilized for all the model lines to satisfy the geometric and mass similarities to maintain the elastic properties of the prototype lines the model lines are also calibrated using different sections of appropriate linear springs to match the tension deformation curves calculated by the equation 1 t m c p d p 2 δ s s n λ 3 where t m is the model tension and c p the elasticity modulus δs s the relative elongation and n 1 5 for the prototype wire it can be seen in fig 2 that the tension deformation curves of the model lines have an excellent agreement with the theoretical curves 2 2 experimental setup the experimental investigation is conducted in the 3d basin of the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology china the basin is 40 m long 24 m wide and 1 2 m deep a piston type wavemaker equipped with an active wave absorption control system is installed at one end of the basin at the other end of the basin a gravel beach covered with porous metallic strips is located at the other end to absorb waves and to minimize undesirable reflections additionally to achieve totally unidirectional incident waves wave absorbers are placed on two sides of the basin in parallel with the wave propagating direction to avoid lateral wave reflection fig 3 presents the sketch of the wave basin with the tunnel pontoon physical model installed in proper position the whole floating system consists of twelve mooring lines and four suspending lines as shown in fig 3 for each floater the four mooring lines are symmetrically placed along the x axis and arranged with an inclined 60 angle against the x axis during the tests the pretension on the mooring lines is set as 1n 216 kn in prototype in the model scale to achieve a better constraint on the floaters for the suspension wires the initial tension is set as 0n for 0 overweight and enlarged as 8 8n 1900 kn in prototype for 1 5 overweight 2 3 measuring equipment prior to the installation of the floating bodies the wave elevation and wave lengths are measured by wave probes of resistance type placed where the structure is to be installed the significant wave height and the wave peak period are checked till errors are within 5 to address the coupling effects of the tunnel pontoon system the movements of the tunnel pontoon and tensile forces in mooring suspension tensions lines are measured synchronously for each test the arrangement of the measuring system on the system is illustrated in fig 4 sixteen tensile gauges are arranged separately to measure the tensions on the mooring lines and suspension lines considering the symmetric configuration of the system under beam wave actions the 6 degrees of freedom of the tunnel and one pontoon the upward one in fig 3 a are measured using an electromagnetic motion system as shown in fig 4 two receiving sensors are fastened on the central surface of the tunnel element and the pontoon left in front view and the transmitter is fixed upon the tunnel pontoon system which conducts non contact measurement to record the real time six dofs of the tunnel in a 3d rectangular coordinate system as shown in fig 5 the local coordinate origins of tunnel pontoon are on the centroid of tunnel pontoon left in front view respectively the accuracy of the motion measuring apparatus is better than 1 mm for translations and 0 1 for rotations all the sampling rates of the measured data are 50 hz 2 4 wave conditions in the present study the scales for wave height and wave period are 1 60 and 1 7 74 respectively the prototype water depth is fixed at 36 m the jonswap type spectra is chosen to simulate the targeted random seas in the experiments which is given by 2 s ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 1 25 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 2 where ω is the circular wave frequency ω p the frequency at which the spectrum peaks g the acceleration due to gravity α the phillips constant 0 0081 γ the peakedness parameter 3 3 σ the width parameter where σ 0 07 for ω ω p σ 0 09 for ω ω p during the tests the spectrum peak period t p are simulated varying from 0 77s to 2 58s with significant wave height fixed at h s 3 33 cm the significant wave height varies from 1 67 cm to 5 00 cm with spectrum peak period fixed at t p 1 03s the characteristic parameters of the irregular waves in the experiments are listed in table 3 as proposed by the 17th international towing tank conference in 1984 a record length equal to 100 times the largest expected single wave period in the irregular waves is adopted to obtain proper spectral shapes and statistical values fig 6 gives the comparison between the measured and targeted spectra under wave conditions of h s 3 33 cm t p 0 77s 1 03s 1 55s and 2 58s and the figure shows that measured and target spectra match well 2 5 modal analysis the fully coupled tunnel pontoon system includes 18 modes of rigid body motions to evaluate the eigen properties of the coupled tunnel pontoon system ansys aqwa is used to perform the modal analysis of the system with frequency dependent added mass and damping this potential flow based radiation and diffraction program employs 3d green s function to simulate linearized hydrodynamic loads on floating rigid bodies and it has gained widespread recognition in solving the interactions among multiple floating bodies for its accuracy and efficiency results of the modal analysis for the coupled tunnel pontoon system for 1 5 overweight are provided in table 4 which lists 18 natural frequencies and eigenvectors the dominant coupled degrees of freedom in each eigenvector are marked in bold 3 results and discussion in this section results of the experimental investigation are presented firstly the synchronous motions of the tunnel element and the pontoon the measured one as shown in figs 3 and 4 are compared for different overweight stages of 0 and 1 5 then the relative motion and the tensile forces in the suspension lines and mooring lines are studied focusing on the effect of the overweight wave period and wave height finally special attention is paid on the effect of the wave runup on the system dynamics 3 1 motions of the tunnel element and the pontoon before quantitatively showing the effect of the overweight fig 7 gives the qualitive illustration of the time histories of the tunnel pontoon motions for η 0 0 and 1 5 to figure out the hydrodynamic characteristics of the tunnel pontoon system due to the roll resonance the wave condition is chosen to have the significant wave height of h s 3 33 cm and wave peak period close to the roll natural period t p 1 16s correspondingly the spectra of the tunnel pontoon motions are also obtained by fourier transform and plotted in fig 8 as indicated in figs 7 and 8 for η 0 0 and η 1 5 the sways of both the tunnel and pontoon are composed of a wave frequency motion and a low frequency motion this low frequency sway results from the action of the wave drift forces and corresponds to the in phase sway frequency of the tunnel pontoon at f 0 085 hz mode 2 the surges of both the tunnel and pontoon are dominated by a low frequency component of f 0 062 hz corresponding to the in phase surge frequency of the tunnel pontoon mode 1 while another small peak can be found in the pontoon s surge at f 0 45 hz in according to the anti phase surge of the two pontoons mode 10 moreover it is noted that the increase of overweight leads to a decrease in the tunnel s sway and surge but it limitedly affects those of the pontoon from fig 7 it can also be observed that the element ballasting exerts significant influence on the heave of the tunnel pontoon for η 0 0 the tunnel s downward displacement is much greater than the upward one with the heave s equilibrium position drift downward dramatically this can be associated with the noticeable wave runup over the tunnel surface and the lack of the restoring force furthermore due to the connecting suspension lines the heave of the pontoon is also affected and it presents similar features however this phenomenon vanishes when the element is ballasted to 1 5 overweight during which the heaves of the tunnel pontoon behave almost symmetric in both directions the upward displacement is slightly larger than the downward one this may demonstrate that the element ballasting could effectively attenuate the wave runup effect on the coupled tunnel pontoon system as shown in fig 8 the heaves of both the tunnel and pontoon are governed by the wave frequency component and they are also slightly affected by a low frequency component at f 0 139 hz which is close to the in phase heave frequency of the tunnel pontoon mode 4 with the enlarge of the overweight the low frequency heave of the tunnel pontoon is slightly reduced but their wave frequency heave is enlarged a bit fig 8 also reveals that the rolls of the tunnel and pontoon are dominated by wave frequency component and experience a decrease as a result of the element ballasting interestingly it is found that the pontoon s pitch has a greater peak value at f 1 16 hz than that at the wave peak frequency due to the response amplification close to the anti phase pitch of the two pontoons mode 13 in contrast the pitch of the tunnel is much smaller and it is governed by wave frequency component it can also be found that the increasing overweight introduces greater pitch for both the tunnel and pontoon in addition the tunnel s yaw is dominated by the low frequency component of f 0 116 hz which matches to the mode frequency of the in phase yaw of the tunnel and pontoon mode 3 while the pontoon s yaw shows a dominant peak at f 0 294 hz corresponding to the anti phase yaw of the two pontoons mode 5 and as indicated in fig 8 the low frequency yaw of the tunnel shows a reduction after ballasting but the pontoon s yaw is not affected significantly the maximum and minimum motions of the tunnel and pontoon are plotted against the wave peak period in fig 9 for overweight stages of 0 0 and 1 5 in order to highlight the effect of the roll resonance the wave period is normalized by the roll period t roll 1 16s and the relative wave period t t roll ranges from 0 66 to 2 22 the significant wave height is fixed at 3 33 cm the sway of the tunnel and pontoon are generally increased with the increase of the wave period it is found that due to the ballasting the tunnel s sway is diminished dramatically at t p t roll where the ballasting contributes to reduce the dominant low frequency component of the tunnel sway however the effect of the overweight on the pontoon s sway is found to be negligible from fig 9 it can also be seen that as the wave period is enlarged the tunnel surge is firstly increased and then is decreased forming a subtle local peak around t p t roll while the pontoon surge shows a gradual increasing trend additionally compared with the 0 overweight stage the tunnel pontoon surge are slightly reduced with η 1 5 for t p t roll with respect to the heave the tunnel and pontoon have similar trend against the wave period and overweight during the ballasting stage the heaves of the tunnel and pontoon are both increased with enlarged wave peak period for t p 1 2t roll and then stay constant for longer waves an increase in the overweight leads to smaller downward displacements of the tunnel pontoon but slightly larger upward displacements this can be attributed to the fact that the suspension lines pretensioned by ballast water have more effective restraint on the tunnel especially when it moves downward relative to the pontoon such behavior is evident for relatively short waves of t p t roll and is strongly related to the effect of the wave runup which will be further discussed in section 3 5 the rolls of both the tunnel and pontoons are increased with larger wave period and then they are decreased the peak values of the roll are observed at t p t roll 1 11 for η 0 0 and at t p t roll 0 89 for η 1 5 moreover the roll amplitudes of both the tunnel and pontoon are marginally affected by the increasing overweight except for a slight reduction with η 1 5 for t p t roll 0 89 1 11 as shown in fig 9 the magnitudes of the tunnel s pitch and yaw are small and within 1 deg and show a quite small variation as the peak wave period is increased with the enlarged overweight the pitch of the tunnel behaves more symmetric in both directions but the tunnel yaw shows no significant difference the pitch of the pontoon has a clear decreasing tendency with the increased wave peak period but it is limitedly affected by the overweight in addition for the pontoon s yaw it is decreased with larger overweight and significant peak values are observed at t p t roll 0 89 1 11 which could be related to the roll resonance effect fig 10 shows the variation of the maximum and minimum motions of the tunnel pontoon with the variation of significant wave height for different overweight stages the significant wave heights are selected to be 1 67 cm 5 00 cm and the same peak wave period t p 1 03s is chosen the results reveal that the motion amplitudes of the tunnel and pontoon are increased with the increase of the significant wave height for all six degrees of freedom it can be observed that the increasing tendency of the sway displacement becomes greater for higher waves especially along the wave propagation direction this can be closely associated with the existence of large mean drift forces as wave height increases yielding a greater offset of the sway equilibrium position besides the surge pitch and yaw of the pontoon show significant amplitudes in higher waves of h s 3 33 cm especially for η 0 0 this should be carefully treated during ballasting in case of the collision between the tunnel and pontoons with 0 26 m clearance comparing the cases of η 0 0 and 1 5 it is worthy to note that the most prominent influence of the ballasting takes place in the heave for the tunnel pontoon in the cases of η 0 0 as the wave height is enlarged the downward movements of the tunnel pontoon are increased with a faster trend but this does not occur in the upward displacements while for η 1 5 the increasing tendency becomes approximately linear for both the downward and upward displacements of the tunnel pontoon 3 2 relative motion between the tunnel and pontoon the relative motion between the tunnel and pontoon is defined in this paper as the tunnel motion minus the synchronous pontoon motion fig 11 displays the selected time history of the relative motion for η 0 0 1 5 for a representative sea state t p 1 16s h s 3 33 cm in general it can be found that the relative heave and relative roll are most sensitive to the element overweight followed by the relative sway the results show that the element ballasting with the increase of pretension on the suspension lines can effectively diminish the positive relative heave this corresponds to the reduction of the downward displacement gap between the tunnel and pontoon for η 1 5 as shown in fig 7 moreover the ballasting also has a significantly negative effect on the relative roll this is unexpected considering the small roll magnitude difference between the tunnel and pontoon as indicated in fig 7 this demonstrates that it is of great importance to analyze the synchronous relative motion between the tunnel and pontoon for a thorough understanding of the fully coupled dynamics of the system rather than only the comparison of the motion characteristics of the tunnel and pontoon based on the measurements in fig 11 the spectral results of the relative motion are depicted in fig 12 by comparing fig 12 with fig 8 it can be found that besides the wave frequency and low frequency components as in the absolute motions the relative heave also exhibits a high frequency peak at f 1 8 hz which can be related to the anti phase heave frequency of the tunnel and pontoons mode 17 analogous conclusions can be drawn for the relative roll which has a high frequency component of f 1 6 hz close to the anti phase roll frequency of the tunnel and pontoons mode 16 moreover due to the small amplitude of the tunnel surge pitch and yaw the relative surge pitch and yaw are very similar to those of the pontoon from fig 12 it can also be seen that with the increased overweight the low frequency components of the relative sway and relative surge are decreased but the wave frequency component is little affected moreover the wave frequency component of the relative pitch is enlarged after ballasting most importantly the spectral peaks of the relative heave and relative roll have a noteworthy reduction in wave frequency low frequency and also high frequency which means that both the in phase and anti phase heave and roll of the system diminish with the increased overweight the variation of the maximum values of the relative motion as function of t p t roll is depicted for η 0 0 and 1 5 in fig 13 in the case of η 1 5 the positive relative heave downward direction is much smaller than that of η 0 0 since the downward movement of the tunnel is dramatically reduced after ballasting due to the elimination of the wave runup effect similar trend can also be observed in the both directions of the relative roll as a result it may be concluded that the element ballasting can contribute to attenuate the coupling effect between the tunnel and pontoons especially for the relative heave and relative roll which would play a crucial role in dynamic suspension tensions interestingly it can be also found that the attenuation of these oscillations is most pronounced when the incident wave period close to the roll period t p 0 89 1 11t roll with reduction approaching 79 for the positive relative heave and 65 for the relative roll this demonstrates that the element ballasting significantly attenuates the influence of the roll resonance on the system dynamics consequently for η 0 0 the positive relative heave and relative roll tend to increase and then decrease with enlarged wave peak period exhibiting a great peak value at t p t roll but for η 1 5 the variations become much smoother fig 13 also shows that as the wave period is increased the relative sway fluctuates and it is relatively large for t p 1 3t roll meanwhile greater overweight leads to a smaller positive relative sway with a maximum reduction of 41 along the wave propagation direction which can be related to the reduced tunnel sway in fig 8 the relative surge varies little with increasing wave peak period for t p 1 3t roll and has an evident increasing trend with longer waves while a significant decreasing trend against the wave period can be seen in the relative pitch resulting from the surge and yaw of the pontoon the relative surge and relative yaw also show large peak values near the roll resonance period of t p t roll 0 89 1 11 it is also found that with the element ballasted these local peaks can be reduced by a significant level of 55 this verifies again the ballasting can contribute to attenuate the roll resonance effect of the system fig 14 compares the peak value of the relative motion for η 0 0 and 1 5 under various significant wave height h s 1 67 5 0 cm fig 14 reveals that the relative motion is increased for all the 6 dofs as the wave height is enlarged specifically the growing trend of the relative heave in downward direction positive and the relative roll is greatly intensified for h s 2 0 m this can be attributed to the enlarging phase lag and widened amplitude difference between the tunnel and pontoon due to higher waves this also happens to the relative surge and yaw which could arise high risk of collision between tunnel and pontoons meanwhile it is also found that with the increase of the overweight magnitudes of the relative heave relative roll relative surge and relative yaw show more evident reduction for h s 2 0 m this reveals again that the element ballasted to η 1 5 has an effective restraint on the coupling effect between the tunnel and pontoons 3 3 tensions in suspension lines fig 15 gives the time histories of the suspension tension during ballasting for different negative buoyancies of η 0 0 1 5 under wave condition of h s 3 33 cm t p 1 16s lines 1 and 3 are seaward and lines 2 and 4 are leeward to observe the slack and the snap load clearly a typical duration of 30s is zoomed in and it is presented from the completed time history of 160s it can be seen that for η 0 0 the suspension tension has continual zero moments over time this suggests that the slack of the suspension lines occurs frequently under freeboard elimination which is prone to incur the snap loading and high extreme tension on the suspension lines fortunately it can be observed that after ballasting the slack phenomenon of the suspension lines is weakened as it happens only due to some high waves with a much lower probability results of the corresponding spectral analysis are provided in fig 16 the suspension tensions show multi peak characteristics including a low frequency peak of f 0 139 hz corresponding to the in phase heave of the tunnel and pontoons mode 4 a peak of wave spectral frequency and a high frequency peak at f 1 8 hz and 2 37 hz which can be due to the dynamic amplification of mode 16 and 17 the anti phase heave and roll of the tunnel and pontoons the seaward lines have larger peak values than those of the leeward lines in the wave frequency and high frequency components compared with the case of η 0 0 the wave frequency components of the suspending tensions for η 1 5 get higher peak values with a narrower frequency range in the meantime the high frequency and low frequency suspension tension are decreased with the increase of the overweight which is expected since those of the relative roll and relative heave are significantly reduced as shown in fig 12 to provide an intuitive view of the effect of the ballasting on the slack phenomenon of the suspension line the occurrence probability of the relative slack on the suspension lines is statistically analyzed based on the experimental results it is defined herein that the relative slack occurs when one suspension line tension is smaller than 10 of the suspension line pretension of the ballasted element as 0 88n hence the slack probability is expressed as 3 f s l a c k n n n u m b e r f o r f f 0 n u m b e r o f d a t a where f represents the minimum tension on the four suspension lines f 0 is defined as the slack criterion of 10 of the suspension line pretension 0 88n and the number of the statistical data is 8192 for each set fig 17 shows the variation of the slack probability as function of wave peak period for η 0 0 and 1 5 with regard to the effect of the incident wave period on the ratio for η 0 0 the increase of t p up to 0 88t roll leads to a gradual reduction of the values of f slack the slack probability reaches a predominant peak of 0 64 at t p t roll which may be because of the drastic dynamic loading resulting from the significant coupling effect between the tunnel and pontoon induced by the roll resonance the f slack is limitedly changed with further increase of t p to 1 78t roll and tends to decrease with the increase of the wave peak period for t p 1 78t roll in the case of η 1 5 the f slack tends to increase and gets a small peak of 0 047 at t p t roll followed by a reduction till zero as seen from the curves for η 0 0 and 1 5 it is noted that the ballasting can effectively suppress the slack occurrence of the suspension lines with a much lower probability especially at the roll resonance period fig 18 presents the maximum tensions in the suspension lines f s f sy f s d and f sy d versus t p t roll for η 0 0 and 1 5 the subscripts s sy s d and sy d are used to denote the single line tension the synchronous total tension of four lines the dynamic tension for single line and for four lines absolute tension minus the pretension respectively the results indicate that f s f sy f s d and f sy d are all initially increased and then decreased with growing wave peak period exhibiting a local peak at t p t roll this can be associated with the roll resonance effect on the relative roll and heave as shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 18 a and b compared to the case of η 0 0 f s and f sy have slightly higher values with η 1 5 for t p t roll and for t p 1 1t roll their tension difference becomes larger but still less than the pretension resulting from the overweight the main reason can be found in fig 13 and fig 18 c d that after ballasting the relative motions are reduced significantly leading to smaller dynamic tension with a maximum 37 reduction for f s d and 51 for f sy d this also indicates again that the ballasting water of η 1 5 provides a satisfactory performance especially for the relative short waves of t p t roll to weaken the coupling effect of the system with only slight increase in the absolute suspension tensions fig 19 shows the effect of the wave height on the maximum tensions in the single suspension line and the synchronous total tensions in four suspension lines for η 0 0 and η 1 5 the wave conditions are h s 0 77 3 0 cm and t p 1 03s it can be seen that all the four tensions have a monotonically increasing trend with growing wave height in fig 19 c and d it is noted that for h s 3 33 cm the ballasting can reduce the dynamic tensions significantly and consequently the absolute suspension tensions f s and f sy are only slightly larger for η 1 5 than those of η 0 0 as indicated in fig 19 a and b however for higher waves of h s 4 cm the effect becomes marginal and f s and f sy are evidently increased after ballasting this demonstrates the ballasting seems to contribute more to the reduction of the dynamic tensions in the suspension lines for relatively small wave height 3 4 tensions in mooring lines of the tunnel pontoon fig 20 illustrates the time history of the mooring line tensions of the tunnel and pontoon for different negative buoyancies of η 0 0 1 5 under random wave excitations of t p 1 16s h s 3 33 cm line 7 and 8 are selected to present the seaward and leeward lines of the tunnel element while 14 and 15 for the seaward and leeward lines of the pontoon the corresponding spectral analysis results are given in fig 21 it can be observed that the mooring line tension of the tunnel is mainly controlled by the low frequency of f 0 085 hz corresponding to the in phase sway frequency of the tunnel and pontoon mode 2 combined with wave frequency in contrast except for the largest peak value in wave peak frequency the mooring tension spectra of the pontoon show four other peaks of frequency at f 0 085 hz in accordance with the 2nd mode in phase sway of the tunnel and pontoons f 0 23 hz with the 8th mode anti phase sway of the tunnel and pontoons f 0 40 hz with the 10th mode anti phase surge of the two pontoons and f 1 16 hz with the 13th mode anti phase pitch of the two pontoons of the coupled system respectively this reveals that the mooring line tension of the pontoon is more sensitive to the coupled motions of the system than that of the tunnel from the results of figs 20 21 it can be also concluded the ballasting could significantly reduce the low frequency component of the tunnel mooring tension which can be related to the tunnel sway in fig 8 however for the pontoon mooring tension a slight decrease is observed for most spectra peak values fig 22 shows the variation of the maximum mooring tensions of the tunnel and pontoon against t p t roll for η 0 0 and 1 5 it can be seen that the tensile forces in the mooring lines of the tunnel and pontoon have a general growth as the wave peak period is increased the mooring tensions of the tunnel subjected to short waves of t p t roll for η 1 5 are much less than those of η 0 0 while for longer waves it is not sensitive to overweight moreover it can be also observed that the ballasting has marginal influence on mooring line tension of the pontoon these features are consistent with those of the tunnel pontoon sway in fig 9 which indicates that the sway plays a leading role in the mooring line tensions the effect of the wave height on the maximum mooring tension of the tunnel and pontoon are compared with η 0 0 and η 1 5 in fig 23 the wave conditions are h s 0 77 3 0 cm and t p 1 03s it can be concluded that the increase of wave height results in larger mooring line tensions in addition the decreasing trend of the mooring tensions with the overweight is also slightly affected by the significant wave height 3 5 effect of the wave runup on the system dynamics note that the wave runup at the tunnel surface would exceed the element freeboard smaller than 0 5 cm in model scale significantly during the ballasting process as shown in fig 7 due to the occurrence of wave runup the equilibrium position of the tunnel s heave drifts downward greatly which affects the pontoon s heave through the connecting suspension lines and consequently their relative heave thus to quantify the wave runup effect on the hydrodynamic responses of the tunnel pontoon system the mean values of the tunnel pontoon s heaves m heave relative heave m r heave and synchronous suspending tension m fsy are plotted against t p t roll for η 0 0 1 5 in fig 24 comparing the tendency of the curves of m heave m r heave and m fsy in fig 24 it is found that the mean position drift of the tunnel s heave resulting from the wave runup occurrence has an important influence on the mean relative heave and thus the mean values of the synchronous tensions on the four suspension lines in cases of η 0 0 the mean heave values of the tunnel pontoon m heave relative heave m r heave and synchronous suspending tension m fsy all have a similar dependence on the wave period as the roll which tend to firstly increase and then decrease as the wave peak period enlarges exhibiting their peak values at t p t roll this is readily comprehensible that larger rolling oscillation leads to more drastic wave body interaction yielding stronger wave runup effect on the coupled dynamics of the system in addition the tunnel s mean heave is always greater than that of the pontoon and as a result m r heave is always positive which could have a positive effect on m fsy in contrast as the overweight is increased to 1 5 the wave runup effect is greatly attenuated leading to a significant decrease of downward displacements of the tunnel and pontoon the mean heave values of the tunnel and pontoon become negative which can be attributed to the fact that the restraint of the suspension lines results in the downward movement smaller than the upward movement as reported in section 3 1 as the wave peak period is enlarged the mean heave values of the tunnel pontoon are gradually increased and small peaks appear at t p 0 9t roll followed by a decrease resulting from the mean heave of the tunnel larger than that of the pontoon the mean relative heave is always negative and is expected to have a negative influence on the mean value of the synchronous total suspension tension therefore the increase of the wave peak period leads to a gradual reduction of m r heave and a growth of m fsy fig 25 provides the mean values of the tunnel pontoon heave the relative heave and the synchronous suspending tension versus the significant wave height for η 0 0 1 5 as shown in fig 25 a for η 0 0 larger wave height results in increasing positive mean heave values with an intensified tendency meanwhile the mean heave value of the tunnel grows twice as that of the pontoon leading to a greater relative heave in steeper waves this can be related to larger exceedance of the wave runup over the tunnel top resulting in an increasing mean value of the synchronous suspension tension as shown in fig 25 b however for η 1 5 the negative mean heave value has a slight increasing trend with the significant wave height leading to a gradual increase in the negative mean values of the relative heave accordingly the mean values of the synchronous suspending tension are observed to decrease with greater wave height overall it can be concluded that for η 0 0 the wave runup would provoke significant mean values of the relative heave and suspension tensions especially in waves of large amplitudes and roll resonance period luckily by ballasting the element to η 1 5 this worse effect can be eliminated due to the pretensioned suspension lines hence to avoid certain risk from the wave runup effect it is recommended that the connection of the tunnel element and pontoons not be converted to suspension lines from fixed buttress until the tunnel is ballasting 4 conclusion a 3d experimental study was conducted for investigating the hydrodynamic performance of the tunnel immersion system during the ballasting stage under beam irregular waves the main findings show 1 the mean position drift of the tunnel s heave resulting from the wave runup occurrence has a crucial influence on the mean relative heave and thus the mean values of synchronous suspending tensions 2 the element ballasting can effectively eliminate the wave runup effect on the dynamics of the tunnel immersion system increase of the overweight plays an important role in reducing mean values of the relative heave and synchronous suspending tensions 3 the larger the overweight is the less relative motion between floaters occurs and the smaller dynamic loading in the suspension lines is hence the element ballasting contributes to significantly reduce the occurring probabilities of the slack and snap loadings on the suspension lines 4 the ballasting diminishes the tunnel mooring tension for relatively short waves of t p t roll but it has marginal impact on the pontoon mooring tensions 5 the effect of the ballasting on system dynamics is strongly dependent on the wave excitations when the incident wave period is close to the roll resonance period the influence of the ballasting on the system dynamics is most pronounced meanwhile the impact of the variation of wave period and wave height on the system dynamics is weakened after ballasting it may be concluded that the tunnel is ballasted to 1 5 overweight provides a satisfactory performance to eliminate the wave runup effect and to attenuate the coupling of the immersion system to avoid certain risk from the wave runup effect and roll resonance effect it is recommended that the suspension lines not be released until the tunnel is ballasted during the practical operation acknowledgements the work is

22442,the extreme significant sea wave height swell wave height and total wave height were determined for return periods of 10 25 50 and 100 years for seven stations in kuwaiti territorial waters based on measured data the measured wave data was obtained from kuwait meteorological department of the directorate general of civil aviation dgca the extreme wave analysis was carried out using gumbel and weibull distribution methods it was noticed that the weibull distribution is a better fit to the measured wave heights in kuwaiti territorial waters the result of the extreme significant sea wave height for 100 year return period ranges between 3 24 and 3 99 m while there is a large variation in the extreme significant swell wave height which ranges between 2 31 and 4 55 m furthermore the extreme significant total wave height varies from 3 37 to 4 25 m among these seven stations in kuwaiti waters the comparison between the present study and the prediction of the extreme wave heights based on hindcasted data by neelamani et al 2007 shows closer correlation of the results except for the north west part where there are some noticeable differences in the results the present study is important for optimal design of marine structures and coastal infrastructure development of kuwaiti islands keywords extreme waves kuwaiti territorial waters gumbel distribution weibull distribution significant wave height measured wave data 1 introduction nowadays there is an increase in marine and off shore structures all over the world thus the estimation of extreme wave condition is an important step to ensure optimal design and safety of such marine structures the extreme wave condition is expressed in terms of wave characteristics such as significant wave height which is the most important parameter in coastal structures design the aim of this paper is to avoid under either estimation of extreme wave height that leads to unsafe structures or over estimation of extreme wave height that leads to uneconomical structures this study is important for oil companies for the installation of offshore drilling platforms in kuwaiti territorial waters to explore and exploit crude oil well below the seabed the significant wave height is also an important parameter for sediment transport and coastal erosion it can be used to calculate the shoreline erosion ekphisutsuntorn et al 2010 which is present in kuwait for example the island qaruh is suffering from erosion in the east to the south part of its shoreline in kuwait most of the marine structures are over designed because there is not an actual application of an extreme wave height prediction in kuwaiti territorial waters in coastal structures design process unfortunately only a few researchers have studied the extreme wave heights in the arabian gulf especially in kuwait territorial waters kuwait is an arid country located in the northeastern corner of the arabian peninsula and at the northwestern corner of the arabian gulf as shown in fig 1 it has boundaries with iraq from the north and west and southern boundaries with saudi arabia the geographic coordinate system of kuwait is between longitudes of 46 30 and 48 30 east of the greenwich prime meridian and latitudes of 28 45 and 30 05 north of the equator kuwait has a total area of 17 818 square kilometers and a total area of territorial water about 7611 km2 as stated by the amiri decree on december 17 1967 kuwait has nine islands failaka boubyan maskan warba ouha um aimaradem um ai naml kubbar and qaruh kuwait coastal zone is a vital location because of its importance for residential commercial oil industry water resource and electrical generation purposes development projects in five of kuwait islands boubyan warba failaka maskan and aouha have been planned for tourism and marina construction purposes thus the estimation of the design wave height for different return periods is essential for optimal marine structure and coastal design in these locations until now most of the extreme wave height prediction for different return periods has been conducted based on hindcasted wave height data due to the difficulties of obtaining long term wave measurements data in kuwaiti territorial waters neelamani et al 2007 had carried out the estimation of the extreme wave height for different return periods based on hindcasted data using wam model in the present work the prediction of the extreme wave height in kuwaiti territorial waters is conducted based on measured wave data 2 literature review scientists and researchers all over the world have carried out many studies about extreme value prediction of waves gumbel 1958 extreme value distribution has been the most frequent method for the prediction of extreme wave heights and wind speed for different return periods st denis 1969 1973 suggested using gumbel s distribution for the prediction of extreme wave heights because of its good fit for a given set of data kimball 1960 and gringorten 1963 have examined using the suitable plotting formula for the extreme event predictions petrauskas and aagaard 1971 and jahns and wheeler 1973 have developed methods for extrapolating hindcast storm wave heights for the extreme wave height analysis the extreme wave height prediction procedure based on both gumbel and weibull distribution were clarified in kamphuis 2000 goda 1992 goda et al 1993 and mathiesen et al 1994 have studied several methods for the statistical analysis of extreme wave heights few researchers have studied wave modeling in the arabian gulf moeini et al 2010 conducted an extreme wave analysis at the northern coast of the arabian gulf based on measured and modeled wave data they observed that the prediction of extreme wave height using the numerically simulated wave data is more accurate than using modeled data for this study area moeini et al 2012 developed the simulation of wind wave in the arabian gulf using error prediction approach to avoid overestimation of extreme wave height they used the third generation swan model for wave hindcasting and compared the outputs with field measurements at two stations they recommended using this approach for long term time series of wave characteristics in the arabian gulf liao and kaihatu 2016 found out that significant wave heights at the arabian gulf are highly dependent on the wind fields and relatively dependent on the use of boundary conditions this research would be useful for the study of wave characteristics generated by winds in the arabian gulf area neelamani et al 2007 predicted the extreme wave heights and mean wave period for 19 locations in kuwaiti territorial waters for different return periods based on hindcasted wave data using a wam model for a total period of 12 years the study indicated that the extreme significant wave height in kuwaiti territorial water for 100 years return period varies from 1 86 to 4 02 m while the mean wave period ranges between 4 2 and 6 3 for the corresponding wave heights furthermore they concluded that weibull distribution is a better fit to the wave data in comparison to gumbel distribution in kuwaiti territorial water in the present study the prediction of extreme wave height for 7 marine stations in kuwaiti territorial water is conducted using measured data and then a comparison with neelamani et al 2007 results are made to explore the difference in the predicted extreme wave heights such study is not available and is the main motivation 3 methodology 3 1 data collection in this study the measured wave data was obtained from kuwait meteorological department of the directorate general of civil aviation dgca for 11 marine stations in kuwaiti territorial waters as shown in fig 2 however in this work the data from 7 marine stations are used for the study due to data availability these stations are beacon n6 beacon n28 south dolphin sea island buoy ahmadi oil pier ahmadi light vessel and umm mudayrah station table 1 shows the latitude longitude and the period of data available for each station the wave data used for the extreme wave analysis are sea wave height swell wave height total wave height and their corresponding wave periods the sea wave height is the height of wave due to local wind effect swell wave height is the wave height due to the waves travelling from far off locations the total wave height is the sum of both the wave heights 3 1 1 instrumentations the nortek acoustic wave and current sensors awac have been used for the wave measurements for all the marine stations in kuwaiti territorial water by kuwait meteorological department it is an accurate instrument which consists of a combination of acoustic doppler current profiler and directional wave gauge the awac measures three independent quantities which are pressure orbital velocities and acoustic surface tracking ast then these quantities are used to determine wave parameters the awac is usually used in water depths from 5 to 100 m fig 3 shows the awac instrument the measurement of wave height was done by the optimized acoustic surface tracking ast algorithms the ast is echo ranging to the surface with the vertically oriented transducer as shown in fig 4 the ast record which is a direct measure of the free surface is used to provide exactly the wave profile in addition wave parameters such as hmax h1 10 and tmean can be determined using ast according to time series analyses for more details see nortek acoustic wave and current meter awac manual 2005 3 2 procedure for extreme wave height analysis the extreme significant wave heights are estimated for different return periods using gumbel and weibull distribution the raw data includes the daily maximum sea wave height swell wave height and total wave of the measured data period for each station then the monthly maximum wave heights of each station are determined and arranged in descending order then the probability of exceedance q for each data point is calculated using the following expression 1 q i c 1 n c 2 where i is the ranking of data point n is the total number of data points c1 and c2 are coefficients for unbiased plotting position that is equal to 0 44 and 0 12 respectively for gumbel distribution while for weibull distribution c 1 0 2 0 27 α and c 2 0 2 0 23 α for the determination of the best value of α trial and error is used then the value of α that gives the highest regression coefficient value is chosen it is found that for n data points there are wave height values that are repeated many number of times and thus two processes of ranking are used in this work the first procedure depends on using the same ranking data i for the repeated wave height values whereas for the second procedure different ranking data i is used for repeated wave height values the two procedures give different results which will be discussed later notably the wave height values that are less than 0 5 m are excluded from the calculations by fixing 0 5 m wave height as threshold value for extreme wave height analysis a discussion for using gumbel and weibull distributions are shown in appendix a from kamphuis 2000 3 3 prediction of the wave height for the selected return period the probability of exceedance can be expressed in terms of return period as follows 2 q r t r where r is the recording interval associated with each data in years for the present work since the data used are the monthly maximum wave height then r 1 12 year and tr is return period in years according to gumbel distribution the predicted extreme wave height for different return period is calculated using the following equation 3 h t r γ β ln ln l t r l t r 1 while the prediction of the extreme wave height for different return period according to weibull distribution is calculated using the following equation 4 h t r γ β ln l t r 1 α where l is number of event year since the data used for the analysis is the monthly maximum wave height so l 12 the steps used to predict the extreme wave heights in kuwaiti territorial waters are summarized below 1 the monthly maximum wave height for the whole period of each station is determined 2 then for each station the monthly maximum wave heights are arranged in descending order 3 the probability of exceedance q is calculated for the data set of each station using eq 1 as mentioned above 4 the wave height is plotted versus the reduced variate ln ln 1 p for gumbel distribution and ln 1 q 1 α for weibull distribution 5 least square method is applied to obtain the best line fit then the slope and intercept are obtained to determine scale parameter β and location parameter γ for gumbel and weibull distribution 6 finally eqs 3 and 4 are used for predicting sea wave heights swell wave heights and total wave heights for return period of 10 25 50 and 100 years using both gumbel and weibull distribution 3 4 joint distribution of wave period and wave heights wave period is the second important wave parameter that should be predicted for cost effective design of different marine structures however the prediction of wave period is difficult thus joint distribution is used to relate the wave period to wave height joint distribution is simply the relation between wave periods and wave height via the combinations of greatest frequency for this purpose the following equation is used kamphuis 2000 5 t m e a n c 3 h s c 4 the value of c 3 and c 4 and the corresponding coefficient of regression r2 are obtained for the seven stations in kuwaiti territorial waters then c 3 and c 4 are used for predicting the mean wave period for wave height of any specific return period trials for predicting wave period are carried out leading to doubtful and non acceptable results a sample for the relation between significant wave height and mean wave period for swell wave height in station beacon n6 is presented in fig 5 the plot shows that the mean wave period increases then decreases as the significant wave height increases which is not acceptable according to the fact that the wave period usually increase as the wave height increases so the time period data is found to be not accurate thus the wave period prediction will not be carried out in this work 4 results and discussion gumbel distribution plots for sea wave height swell wave height and total wave height for beacon n6 station is provided in figs 6 8 respectively in addition the equation for the best line fit and the coefficient of regression are obtained in addition weibull distribution plot for sea wave height swell wave height and total wave height for the same station is given in figs 9 11 respectively in addition the equation for the best line fit and the coefficient of regression are obtained it is noted that α 1 3 is the best value for this set similar plots are obtained for the other 6 stations for the 1st procedure of ranking which uses the same ranking data i for the repeated wave height values the location parameter γ and scale parameter β according to gumbel and weibull distributions for the extreme total wave height are shown in figs 12 15 then these parameters are used in equations 3 and 4 respectively for extreme wave height prediction based on gumbel and weibull distribution for different return periods see fig 16 it is noted that for extreme sea wave height the coefficient of regression based on gumbel distribution ranges between 0 838 and 0 9 while for weibull distribution it ranges between 0 851 and 0 916 in addition the coefficient of regression for swell wave height based on gumbel distribution ranges between 0 852 and 0 952 however for weibull distribution it ranges between 0 894 and 0 962 similarly for total wave height the coefficient of regression based on gumbel distribution varies in the range from 0 817 to 0 898 however for weibull distribution these values varies between 0 836 and 0 913 thus coefficient of regression for the best line fit for most of the stations according to weibull distribution is higher than those using gumbel distribution the higher the value of r2 the more accurate and reliable the extreme value prediction is that is why weibull distribution is more recommended for wave height prediction in kuwaiti territorial waters however as mentioned before using the second procedure of ranking data which uses different ranking data i for the repeated wave height values gives different results the next plots show a comparison between the predicted total extreme wave height based on weibull distribution using the 1st and the 2nd method of data ranking on the 7 stations for different return periods the coefficient of regression of the best line fit for total the seven stations using the 2nd procedure of data ranking based on gumbel and weibull distribution is shown in figs 17 and 18 it can be seen that the coefficient of regression for the best line fit using the first procedure of data ranking is higher than those values using the second procedure thus using the first procedure of data ranking in extreme wave analysis for kuwaiti territorial waters is more accurate 5 comparison of results with predicted extreme total wave height using hind casted data the extreme wave heights for 19 locations in kuwaiti territorial waters were predicted by neelamani et al 2007 using hindcasted wave data for different return periods here one of the main objectives is to compare the predicted extreme total wave height using measured data obtained in this study with neelamani et al 2007 results fig 19 and table 2 show the 7 stations in this study and their nearby locations from neelamani et al 2007 in kuwaiti territorial waters the comparison of the predicted extreme total wave height results in kuwaiti territorial waters between the present study using measured data and neelamani et al 2007 locations using hind casted data based on gumbel distribution for different return periods is provided in fig 20 in addition similar plots based on weibull distribution are provided in fig 21 as shown in figs 20 and 21 location 17 18 north of failaka island from neelamani el al 2007 are expected to have wave heights less than 2 m in the long term because of the shallowness of water depth around failaka island however the predicted extreme wave height in beacon n6 station are expected to be more than 3 m and this due to the discontinuity of the maximum total wave height data for station beacon n6 from october 2015 through may 2016 the same problem with south dolphin station which is expected to have wave height more than 2 5 m for return period equals 10 years while location 16 west of failaka island was predicted to have wave height equals 2 m for the long term this difference in results may be due to errors in measurement and the discontinuity of the maximum total wave height data of that station from feb 2016 to april 2016 it is also to be noted that the northwestern part of the arabian gulf is shallow with spring tidal variations of about 4 5 m the predicted hindcasted data in such conditions may have some errors but it is not so in the measured data and hence noticeable difference between the extreme wave height prediction by neelamani et al 2007 and the present results based on field measurements we recommend the extreme wave height prediction based on the measured wave data for optimal design of different marine structures in these areas of kuwaiti territorial waters in contrast there is a good fit in the results between beacon m28 station and location 15 east of failaka island whereas the predicted extreme wave height value for tr equals 10 years in sea island buoy station is close to location 9 near main land it is the same for ahmadi oil pier station and location 8 also the comparison between neelamani et al 2007 and present extreme wave height prediction is good for location 2 n e qaruh island ahmadi light vessel and umm mudayrah stations especially in the long term with reference to table 4 3 the location parameter γ for the 7 marine stations using weibull distribution ranges between 0 579 and 0 915 while for locations in neelamani et al 2007 γ ranges between 0 988 and 1 033 in addition the shape parameter α in those locations ranges between 0 79 and 1 3 whereas α equals 1 3 for all stations in this study as mentioned above the coefficient of regression for the best line fit in neelamani el al 2007 ranges between 0 79 and 0 98 while it ranges between 0 836 and 0 913 in the present study based on the gumbel distribution present work and the results of neelamani et al 2007 compares well at beacon m28 station ahmadhi light vessel station and umm mudayrah station with difference of about 5 8 where as for other stations the difference is in the order of 10 50 the extreme wave height values are higher for all the stations based on the analysis using the measured data similar trends are observed in fig 17 as well based on weibull distribution the results of the present study will be useful for the optimal design of different types of marine structures planned offshore drilling platforms failaka and boubyan island development activities etc both for national and international construction companies 6 conclusions the extreme wave height including sea wave height swell wave height and total wave height in seven marine stations in kuwait territorial waters have been predicted for different return periods based on measured wave data from dgca kuwait the statistical analysis of the extreme wave heights that are used in the present study are gumbel and weibull distributions the main conclusions of this study are 1 the weibull distribution is recommended for the prediction of extreme wave height in kuwaiti territorial waters 2 in the extreme wave height analysis using the same ranking data i for the repeated wave height values leads to more accurate results for the design wave height prediction 3 the extreme significant sea wave height for 100 year return period ranges between 3 24 and 3 99 m while there is a large variation in the extreme significant swell wave height which ranges between 2 31 and 4 55 m the extreme significant total wave height varies from 3 37 to 4 25 m through these seven stations in kuwaiti waters 4 the results of the predicted extreme total wave

22442,the extreme significant sea wave height swell wave height and total wave height were determined for return periods of 10 25 50 and 100 years for seven stations in kuwaiti territorial waters based on measured data the measured wave data was obtained from kuwait meteorological department of the directorate general of civil aviation dgca the extreme wave analysis was carried out using gumbel and weibull distribution methods it was noticed that the weibull distribution is a better fit to the measured wave heights in kuwaiti territorial waters the result of the extreme significant sea wave height for 100 year return period ranges between 3 24 and 3 99 m while there is a large variation in the extreme significant swell wave height which ranges between 2 31 and 4 55 m furthermore the extreme significant total wave height varies from 3 37 to 4 25 m among these seven stations in kuwaiti waters the comparison between the present study and the prediction of the extreme wave heights based on hindcasted data by neelamani et al 2007 shows closer correlation of the results except for the north west part where there are some noticeable differences in the results the present study is important for optimal design of marine structures and coastal infrastructure development of kuwaiti islands keywords extreme waves kuwaiti territorial waters gumbel distribution weibull distribution significant wave height measured wave data 1 introduction nowadays there is an increase in marine and off shore structures all over the world thus the estimation of extreme wave condition is an important step to ensure optimal design and safety of such marine structures the extreme wave condition is expressed in terms of wave characteristics such as significant wave height which is the most important parameter in coastal structures design the aim of this paper is to avoid under either estimation of extreme wave height that leads to unsafe structures or over estimation of extreme wave height that leads to uneconomical structures this study is important for oil companies for the installation of offshore drilling platforms in kuwaiti territorial waters to explore and exploit crude oil well below the seabed the significant wave height is also an important parameter for sediment transport and coastal erosion it can be used to calculate the shoreline erosion ekphisutsuntorn et al 2010 which is present in kuwait for example the island qaruh is suffering from erosion in the east to the south part of its shoreline in kuwait most of the marine structures are over designed because there is not an actual application of an extreme wave height prediction in kuwaiti territorial waters in coastal structures design process unfortunately only a few researchers have studied the extreme wave heights in the arabian gulf especially in kuwait territorial waters kuwait is an arid country located in the northeastern corner of the arabian peninsula and at the northwestern corner of the arabian gulf as shown in fig 1 it has boundaries with iraq from the north and west and southern boundaries with saudi arabia the geographic coordinate system of kuwait is between longitudes of 46 30 and 48 30 east of the greenwich prime meridian and latitudes of 28 45 and 30 05 north of the equator kuwait has a total area of 17 818 square kilometers and a total area of territorial water about 7611 km2 as stated by the amiri decree on december 17 1967 kuwait has nine islands failaka boubyan maskan warba ouha um aimaradem um ai naml kubbar and qaruh kuwait coastal zone is a vital location because of its importance for residential commercial oil industry water resource and electrical generation purposes development projects in five of kuwait islands boubyan warba failaka maskan and aouha have been planned for tourism and marina construction purposes thus the estimation of the design wave height for different return periods is essential for optimal marine structure and coastal design in these locations until now most of the extreme wave height prediction for different return periods has been conducted based on hindcasted wave height data due to the difficulties of obtaining long term wave measurements data in kuwaiti territorial waters neelamani et al 2007 had carried out the estimation of the extreme wave height for different return periods based on hindcasted data using wam model in the present work the prediction of the extreme wave height in kuwaiti territorial waters is conducted based on measured wave data 2 literature review scientists and researchers all over the world have carried out many studies about extreme value prediction of waves gumbel 1958 extreme value distribution has been the most frequent method for the prediction of extreme wave heights and wind speed for different return periods st denis 1969 1973 suggested using gumbel s distribution for the prediction of extreme wave heights because of its good fit for a given set of data kimball 1960 and gringorten 1963 have examined using the suitable plotting formula for the extreme event predictions petrauskas and aagaard 1971 and jahns and wheeler 1973 have developed methods for extrapolating hindcast storm wave heights for the extreme wave height analysis the extreme wave height prediction procedure based on both gumbel and weibull distribution were clarified in kamphuis 2000 goda 1992 goda et al 1993 and mathiesen et al 1994 have studied several methods for the statistical analysis of extreme wave heights few researchers have studied wave modeling in the arabian gulf moeini et al 2010 conducted an extreme wave analysis at the northern coast of the arabian gulf based on measured and modeled wave data they observed that the prediction of extreme wave height using the numerically simulated wave data is more accurate than using modeled data for this study area moeini et al 2012 developed the simulation of wind wave in the arabian gulf using error prediction approach to avoid overestimation of extreme wave height they used the third generation swan model for wave hindcasting and compared the outputs with field measurements at two stations they recommended using this approach for long term time series of wave characteristics in the arabian gulf liao and kaihatu 2016 found out that significant wave heights at the arabian gulf are highly dependent on the wind fields and relatively dependent on the use of boundary conditions this research would be useful for the study of wave characteristics generated by winds in the arabian gulf area neelamani et al 2007 predicted the extreme wave heights and mean wave period for 19 locations in kuwaiti territorial waters for different return periods based on hindcasted wave data using a wam model for a total period of 12 years the study indicated that the extreme significant wave height in kuwaiti territorial water for 100 years return period varies from 1 86 to 4 02 m while the mean wave period ranges between 4 2 and 6 3 for the corresponding wave heights furthermore they concluded that weibull distribution is a better fit to the wave data in comparison to gumbel distribution in kuwaiti territorial water in the present study the prediction of extreme wave height for 7 marine stations in kuwaiti territorial water is conducted using measured data and then a comparison with neelamani et al 2007 results are made to explore the difference in the predicted extreme wave heights such study is not available and is the main motivation 3 methodology 3 1 data collection in this study the measured wave data was obtained from kuwait meteorological department of the directorate general of civil aviation dgca for 11 marine stations in kuwaiti territorial waters as shown in fig 2 however in this work the data from 7 marine stations are used for the study due to data availability these stations are beacon n6 beacon n28 south dolphin sea island buoy ahmadi oil pier ahmadi light vessel and umm mudayrah station table 1 shows the latitude longitude and the period of data available for each station the wave data used for the extreme wave analysis are sea wave height swell wave height total wave height and their corresponding wave periods the sea wave height is the height of wave due to local wind effect swell wave height is the wave height due to the waves travelling from far off locations the total wave height is the sum of both the wave heights 3 1 1 instrumentations the nortek acoustic wave and current sensors awac have been used for the wave measurements for all the marine stations in kuwaiti territorial water by kuwait meteorological department it is an accurate instrument which consists of a combination of acoustic doppler current profiler and directional wave gauge the awac measures three independent quantities which are pressure orbital velocities and acoustic surface tracking ast then these quantities are used to determine wave parameters the awac is usually used in water depths from 5 to 100 m fig 3 shows the awac instrument the measurement of wave height was done by the optimized acoustic surface tracking ast algorithms the ast is echo ranging to the surface with the vertically oriented transducer as shown in fig 4 the ast record which is a direct measure of the free surface is used to provide exactly the wave profile in addition wave parameters such as hmax h1 10 and tmean can be determined using ast according to time series analyses for more details see nortek acoustic wave and current meter awac manual 2005 3 2 procedure for extreme wave height analysis the extreme significant wave heights are estimated for different return periods using gumbel and weibull distribution the raw data includes the daily maximum sea wave height swell wave height and total wave of the measured data period for each station then the monthly maximum wave heights of each station are determined and arranged in descending order then the probability of exceedance q for each data point is calculated using the following expression 1 q i c 1 n c 2 where i is the ranking of data point n is the total number of data points c1 and c2 are coefficients for unbiased plotting position that is equal to 0 44 and 0 12 respectively for gumbel distribution while for weibull distribution c 1 0 2 0 27 α and c 2 0 2 0 23 α for the determination of the best value of α trial and error is used then the value of α that gives the highest regression coefficient value is chosen it is found that for n data points there are wave height values that are repeated many number of times and thus two processes of ranking are used in this work the first procedure depends on using the same ranking data i for the repeated wave height values whereas for the second procedure different ranking data i is used for repeated wave height values the two procedures give different results which will be discussed later notably the wave height values that are less than 0 5 m are excluded from the calculations by fixing 0 5 m wave height as threshold value for extreme wave height analysis a discussion for using gumbel and weibull distributions are shown in appendix a from kamphuis 2000 3 3 prediction of the wave height for the selected return period the probability of exceedance can be expressed in terms of return period as follows 2 q r t r where r is the recording interval associated with each data in years for the present work since the data used are the monthly maximum wave height then r 1 12 year and tr is return period in years according to gumbel distribution the predicted extreme wave height for different return period is calculated using the following equation 3 h t r γ β ln ln l t r l t r 1 while the prediction of the extreme wave height for different return period according to weibull distribution is calculated using the following equation 4 h t r γ β ln l t r 1 α where l is number of event year since the data used for the analysis is the monthly maximum wave height so l 12 the steps used to predict the extreme wave heights in kuwaiti territorial waters are summarized below 1 the monthly maximum wave height for the whole period of each station is determined 2 then for each station the monthly maximum wave heights are arranged in descending order 3 the probability of exceedance q is calculated for the data set of each station using eq 1 as mentioned above 4 the wave height is plotted versus the reduced variate ln ln 1 p for gumbel distribution and ln 1 q 1 α for weibull distribution 5 least square method is applied to obtain the best line fit then the slope and intercept are obtained to determine scale parameter β and location parameter γ for gumbel and weibull distribution 6 finally eqs 3 and 4 are used for predicting sea wave heights swell wave heights and total wave heights for return period of 10 25 50 and 100 years using both gumbel and weibull distribution 3 4 joint distribution of wave period and wave heights wave period is the second important wave parameter that should be predicted for cost effective design of different marine structures however the prediction of wave period is difficult thus joint distribution is used to relate the wave period to wave height joint distribution is simply the relation between wave periods and wave height via the combinations of greatest frequency for this purpose the following equation is used kamphuis 2000 5 t m e a n c 3 h s c 4 the value of c 3 and c 4 and the corresponding coefficient of regression r2 are obtained for the seven stations in kuwaiti territorial waters then c 3 and c 4 are used for predicting the mean wave period for wave height of any specific return period trials for predicting wave period are carried out leading to doubtful and non acceptable results a sample for the relation between significant wave height and mean wave period for swell wave height in station beacon n6 is presented in fig 5 the plot shows that the mean wave period increases then decreases as the significant wave height increases which is not acceptable according to the fact that the wave period usually increase as the wave height increases so the time period data is found to be not accurate thus the wave period prediction will not be carried out in this work 4 results and discussion gumbel distribution plots for sea wave height swell wave height and total wave height for beacon n6 station is provided in figs 6 8 respectively in addition the equation for the best line fit and the coefficient of regression are obtained in addition weibull distribution plot for sea wave height swell wave height and total wave height for the same station is given in figs 9 11 respectively in addition the equation for the best line fit and the coefficient of regression are obtained it is noted that α 1 3 is the best value for this set similar plots are obtained for the other 6 stations for the 1st procedure of ranking which uses the same ranking data i for the repeated wave height values the location parameter γ and scale parameter β according to gumbel and weibull distributions for the extreme total wave height are shown in figs 12 15 then these parameters are used in equations 3 and 4 respectively for extreme wave height prediction based on gumbel and weibull distribution for different return periods see fig 16 it is noted that for extreme sea wave height the coefficient of regression based on gumbel distribution ranges between 0 838 and 0 9 while for weibull distribution it ranges between 0 851 and 0 916 in addition the coefficient of regression for swell wave height based on gumbel distribution ranges between 0 852 and 0 952 however for weibull distribution it ranges between 0 894 and 0 962 similarly for total wave height the coefficient of regression based on gumbel distribution varies in the range from 0 817 to 0 898 however for weibull distribution these values varies between 0 836 and 0 913 thus coefficient of regression for the best line fit for most of the stations according to weibull distribution is higher than those using gumbel distribution the higher the value of r2 the more accurate and reliable the extreme value prediction is that is why weibull distribution is more recommended for wave height prediction in kuwaiti territorial waters however as mentioned before using the second procedure of ranking data which uses different ranking data i for the repeated wave height values gives different results the next plots show a comparison between the predicted total extreme wave height based on weibull distribution using the 1st and the 2nd method of data ranking on the 7 stations for different return periods the coefficient of regression of the best line fit for total the seven stations using the 2nd procedure of data ranking based on gumbel and weibull distribution is shown in figs 17 and 18 it can be seen that the coefficient of regression for the best line fit using the first procedure of data ranking is higher than those values using the second procedure thus using the first procedure of data ranking in extreme wave analysis for kuwaiti territorial waters is more accurate 5 comparison of results with predicted extreme total wave height using hind casted data the extreme wave heights for 19 locations in kuwaiti territorial waters were predicted by neelamani et al 2007 using hindcasted wave data for different return periods here one of the main objectives is to compare the predicted extreme total wave height using measured data obtained in this study with neelamani et al 2007 results fig 19 and table 2 show the 7 stations in this study and their nearby locations from neelamani et al 2007 in kuwaiti territorial waters the comparison of the predicted extreme total wave height results in kuwaiti territorial waters between the present study using measured data and neelamani et al 2007 locations using hind casted data based on gumbel distribution for different return periods is provided in fig 20 in addition similar plots based on weibull distribution are provided in fig 21 as shown in figs 20 and 21 location 17 18 north of failaka island from neelamani el al 2007 are expected to have wave heights less than 2 m in the long term because of the shallowness of water depth around failaka island however the predicted extreme wave height in beacon n6 station are expected to be more than 3 m and this due to the discontinuity of the maximum total wave height data for station beacon n6 from october 2015 through may 2016 the same problem with south dolphin station which is expected to have wave height more than 2 5 m for return period equals 10 years while location 16 west of failaka island was predicted to have wave height equals 2 m for the long term this difference in results may be due to errors in measurement and the discontinuity of the maximum total wave height data of that station from feb 2016 to april 2016 it is also to be noted that the northwestern part of the arabian gulf is shallow with spring tidal variations of about 4 5 m the predicted hindcasted data in such conditions may have some errors but it is not so in the measured data and hence noticeable difference between the extreme wave height prediction by neelamani et al 2007 and the present results based on field measurements we recommend the extreme wave height prediction based on the measured wave data for optimal design of different marine structures in these areas of kuwaiti territorial waters in contrast there is a good fit in the results between beacon m28 station and location 15 east of failaka island whereas the predicted extreme wave height value for tr equals 10 years in sea island buoy station is close to location 9 near main land it is the same for ahmadi oil pier station and location 8 also the comparison between neelamani et al 2007 and present extreme wave height prediction is good for location 2 n e qaruh island ahmadi light vessel and umm mudayrah stations especially in the long term with reference to table 4 3 the location parameter γ for the 7 marine stations using weibull distribution ranges between 0 579 and 0 915 while for locations in neelamani et al 2007 γ ranges between 0 988 and 1 033 in addition the shape parameter α in those locations ranges between 0 79 and 1 3 whereas α equals 1 3 for all stations in this study as mentioned above the coefficient of regression for the best line fit in neelamani el al 2007 ranges between 0 79 and 0 98 while it ranges between 0 836 and 0 913 in the present study based on the gumbel distribution present work and the results of neelamani et al 2007 compares well at beacon m28 station ahmadhi light vessel station and umm mudayrah station with difference of about 5 8 where as for other stations the difference is in the order of 10 50 the extreme wave height values are higher for all the stations based on the analysis using the measured data similar trends are observed in fig 17 as well based on weibull distribution the results of the present study will be useful for the optimal design of different types of marine structures planned offshore drilling platforms failaka and boubyan island development activities etc both for national and international construction companies 6 conclusions the extreme wave height including sea wave height swell wave height and total wave

22443,the present paper addresses armor wire lateral instability in flexible pipes and umbilicals analytical models are formulated for the lateral instability of armor wires with quasi rectangular or circular cross sections considering the armor wire axial rotation constrained by the adjacent layers or free respectively the axial rotational effects on the lateral instability of quasi rectangular and circular armor wires are discussed the present analytical model for quasi rectangular armor wire lateral instability is verified with availabe test data from literature indicating that it is reasonable to consider the quasi rectangular armor wire normal direction coinciding with the toroid normal direction even if a gap is formed in axial compression parametric studies are performed to investigate the effect of armor wire layer properties on the lateral stability limit this is followed by some useful suggestions for improving the design of armor wire layers against the lateral instability keywords flexible pipes umbilicals tensile armor wires lateral instability 1 introduction flexible pipes and umbilicals are crucial elements in offshore industry flexible pipes are widely applied for the transportation of hydrocarbons and production fluids in floating production systems for a typical unbonded flexible pipe the sealing is provided by the concentric polymeric layers the internal and external pressures are resisted by the interlocked metallic layers and the axial loads and torsion are carried by the helically wound tensile armor wire layers subsea umbilicals are the connective medium between the surface facilities and subsea equipment for transferring electrical power fiber optic signals hydraulic and chemical injection fluids which are achieved by a number of cables hydraulic hoses and metal tubes those functional components are helically wound and enclosed by the outer ring formed by the tensile armor wires and polymeric layers in most of the service life of flexible pipes large tensile loads are experienced which generate large contact forces between the armor wires and the underlying polymeric layer to mitigate the penetration of the armor wires into the polymeric layer the cross sections of the armor wires in flexible pipes are usually quasi rectangular as the contact forces can be more evenly distributed in contrast since umbilicals usually operate at a relatively low level of tension that problem is therefore not of great concern thus circular armor wires are commonly employed in umbilicals due to ease of fabrication despite the fact that tensile loads are the principal loads withstand by flexible pipes and umbilicals in most of their service life large axial compressive loads may also be experienced under certain scenarios e g due to the large heave of host platform during installation or operation worse still since the flexible pipe core may be empty or with very small internal pressure during installation or well shut down operations axial compressive loads may also be generated due to the reverse end cap effect this is especially of concern for the application of large diameter flexible pipes in deep water driven by large axial compressive loads the helical armor wires tend to deflect radially or transversely which may lead to the armor wire instability the armor wire instability in the radial direction also known as bird caging has been the subject of research among others by sousa et al 2012 rabelo et al 2015 sævik and thorsen 2017 li et al 2019c to prevent the formation of bird caging in flexible pipes high strength tapes are commonly applied over the armor wire layers to reinforce the radial constraint in contrast in industry practice of umbilicals the anti birdcage tapes are generally not employed thus only limited axial compression is allowed thereby restricting the feasibility of umbilical configuration and weather window for installation however for special purpose applications where large axial compression may be expected the anti birdcage tapes could also be considered for umbilicals garcía et al 2015 nevertheless although the displacements of the armor wires in the radial direction can be restrained to a certain extent by the anti birdcage tapes the risk of the armor wire lateral instability is still involved which hinders the potential application of flexible pipes and umbilicals in a harsh environment to date very little data has been published regarding the circular armor wire lateral instability in umbilicals garcía et al 2015 reported a qualification test of a submarine power cable using a test rig built by marintek concerning the circular armor wire lateral instability in combined axial compression and cyclic bending but no details were published on the other hand considerable attention has been paid to the quasi rectangular armor wire lateral instability in flexible pipes in an effort to reproduce the armor wire lateral instability and evaluate the load carrying capacity flexible pipes have been tested either offshore or onshore by means of the dip tests deep immersion performance tests hyperbaric chamber tests and mechanical tests custódio et al 2007 secher et al 2011 braga 2003 østergaard et al 2012b besides by establishing an eigenvalue problem custódio 2005 developed an analytical model for the prediction of the armor wire stability limit in flexible pipes under axisymmetric loading through a total strain energy approach tan et al 2006 developed an analytical tool to model the armor wire buckling and post buckling behaviors however no details were presented in addition some finite element models have been developed for flexible pipe armor wire instability in the straight pipe condition vaz and rizzo 2011 li 2014 yang et al 2015 gonzalez et al 2017 moreover caleyron et al 2017 developed a numerical model using periodic conditions which is applicable for the armor wire lateral instability study by establishing and solving a differential equation system as a boundary value problem a series of studies were presented by østergaard et al 2011 2012a b focusing on the armor wire lateral instability in flexible pipes subsequently based on the results generated by the differential equation system proposed by østergaard et al 2012b in the straight pipe condition paiva and vaz 2017 proposed an empirical model for the estimation of the armor wire lateral stability limit using symbolic regression besides sævik and ji 2014 simulated the armor wire in a flexible pipe subjected to axial compression associated with cyclic bending through a finite element code and good agreement with the test data of østergaard et al 2012b in terms of failure no failure observations was demonstrated additionally analytical models for the prediction of the armor wire lateral stability limit were presented by sævik and ji 2014 and li et al 2018 considering the straight pipe condition with no friction however the estimated lateral stability limits from both models are on the conservative side more recently it was demonstrated by li et al 2019b that the armor wire lateral instability may follow a periodic mode the corresponding lateral stability limit was evaluated through an analytical formulation and good agreement with existing test data was demonstrated afterwards an analytical model was developed by li et al 2019a to investigate the sliding and ultimate state of the armor wires in a flexible pipe subjected to axial compressive loads combined with cyclic bending considering the frictional effect the equilibrium path of an armor wire in a stable state as well as the critical longitudinal compressive load on a flexible pipe that may eventually cause the armor wires lateral instability after numerous bending cycles are evaluated in all abovementioned analytical and numerical studies of flexible pipes the rectangular armor wire normal direction and the toroid normal direction are assumed coincident note that for a flexible pipe subjected to large axial compressive loads the armor wires tend to expand radially and push the anti birdcage tapes which may generate a gap between the armor wires and the core especially when the armor annulus is flooded since the radial constraint from external water pressure vanishes in this respect it has been demonstrated by some researchers that the rectangular armor wire may rotate around its own axis due to the gap thus affecting the lateral instability limit brack et al 2005 tan et al 2006 custódio et al 2007 also api 17b 2014 recommends that the gap between the armor wires and the underlying layer generated by the axial compression should not exceed half of the armor wire thickness however considering that the axial rotation of the rectangular armor wire is strongly restricted by the contact effect from the adjacent layers whether such axial rotation could take place is disputable on the other hand for circular armor wires it is reasonable to consider them free to rotate since the geometric constraint from the adjacent layers vanishes the main purpose of this research has therefore been to investigate the potential impact of the armor wire axial rotation on the lateral instability mechanism analytial models are formulated for the lateral instability of quasi rectangular and circular armor wires whether axial rotation could take place in the quasi rectangular armor wire is discussed and verified with available test data from literature thereafter some suggestions are presented for improving the armor wire layer design against the lateral instability 2 field equations for a single armor wire 2 1 geometrical relations consider a flexible pipe or umbilical bent to a toroid with minor and major radii respectively denoted by r and r 1 κ see fig 1 parameterizing this toroid by the longitudinal coordinate u and the angular coordinate θ a point on the toroid in cartesian coordinates can be determined by 1 x u θ 1 κ r cos θ cos κ u 1 κ r sin θ 1 κ r cos θ sin κ u then the armor wire path can be represented by a directed curve on the toroid parameterize the curve by its arc length denoted by s and attach a local curvilinear coordinate triad of unit orthonormal vectors t n b on the curve representing the tangential normal and bi normal directions respectively see fig 1 the unit tangent vector can be given by 2 t x u d u d s x θ d θ d s by specifying a relation between u and θ an arbitrary curve on the toroid can be determined such relation is herein defined by the angle between the curve tangent and its projection in the longitudinal direction represented by ϕ as depicted in fig 1 accordingly the unit tangent vector can be alternatively expressed as 3 t x u x u cos ϕ x θ x θ sin ϕ substituting eq 1 into eq 3 the unit tangent vector can be obtained as 4 t cos ϕ sin κ u sin ϕ sin θ cos κ u sin ϕ cos θ cos ϕ cos κ u sin ϕ sin θ sin κ u besides comparing eq 2 and eq 3 the following

has been observed that the lateral stability limit corresponding to the global failure mode lies on the conservative side compared with available test data since it is obtained with the frictional effect disregarded on the other hand assuming that the global displacement component is restricted by the frictional resistance and the periodic displacement component is generated in cyclic bending it has been discovered that the stability limit corresponding to the periodic mode is in good agreement with available test data indicating that the armor wire lateral instability may actually occur in the periodic mode such trigonometric deflection mode has been further proved analytically by li et al 2019a considering the cyclic bending and friction mechanism note that the stability limit depends principally on the deflection mode thus in order to assess the critical compressive load that may trigger the armor wire lateral instability instead of modeling the frictional resistance and cyclic bending directly their effects are considered alternatively by assuming the armor wire deflecting in the periodic form such periodic deflection is herein described by the armor wire lay angle as the sum of the initial lay angle ϕ i plus a small perturbation parameter δ ϕ θ 21 ϕ ϕ i δ ϕ θ ϕ i c ϕ cos θ as a consequence the armor wire axial rotation should also be periodic due to symmetry which is assumed in the following form 22 ω θ c ω sin θ in which c ϕ and c ω are undetermined coefficients 3 analytical treatment 3 1 linearization through a perturbation technique the previously formulated six coupled love s differential equations for a curved beam have been solved analytically by li et al 2018 2019b li et al 2019a through the application of a perturbation technique which is based on the assumption that the ratio of the minor toroid radius to the major toroid radius as well as the armor wire lay angle variation are both small comparably by introducing an additional assumption that the armor wire axial rotation ω is also a small term the previously developed system of differential equations can be solved analytically in a similar process for the sake of convenience hereafter all the variables are expressed in terms of the angular coordinate θ instead of the armor wire arc length s by using eq 5b substituting eqs 21 and 22 into eqs 15a 15c considering both δ ϕ and ω as small terms and ignoring the higher order small terms the armor wire curvature components can be approximately evaluated by 23a κ g θ κ r cos ϕ i c ϕ sin ϕ i c ω sin 2 ϕ i sin θ r 23b κ n θ sin 2 ϕ i r κ cos 2 ϕ i c ϕ sin 2 ϕ i cos θ r 23c τ θ sin 2 ϕ i 2 r κ r sin 2 ϕ i 2 c ϕ cos 2 ϕ i c ω sin ϕ i cos θ r afterwards substituting eqs 16a 16c and 23a 23c into eqs 18a 18c the armor wire sectional moments in the tangential normal and bi normal directions can be approximately determined by 24a m t θ g j κ r sin 2 ϕ i 2 c ϕ cos 2 ϕ i c ω sin ϕ i cos θ r 24b m n θ e i n κ r cos ϕ i c ϕ sin ϕ i c ω sin 2 ϕ i sin θ r 24c m b θ e i b κ cos 2 ϕ i c ϕ sin 2 ϕ i cos θ r subsequently substituting eqs 23a 23b 24a 24c into eq 17d and ignoring the higher order small terms the external moment in the axial direction can be obtained as 25 m t θ κ r g j e i n sin 2 ϕ i cos ϕ i sin θ c ϕ sin ϕ i r 2 g j cos 2 ϕ i e i n sin 2 ϕ i sin θ c ω sin 2 ϕ i r 2 g j e i n sin 2 ϕ i sin θ thereafter substituting eqs 23a 23c 24a 24c into eqs 17f 17e and ignoring the higher order small terms the armor wire sectional forces in the normal and bi normal directions can be evaluated respectively by 26 p n θ κ r e i n e i b sin ϕ i cos 2 ϕ i sin θ c ϕ e i n 2 e i b sin 2 ϕ i cos ϕ i r 2 sin θ c ω e i n sin 3 ϕ i cos ϕ i r 2 sin θ 27 p b θ κ 2 r sin 2 ϕ i e i n e i b cos 2 ϕ i g j sin 2 ϕ i cos θ c ϕ sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n 2 e i b cos 2 ϕ i g j cos 2 ϕ i cos θ c ω sin 3 ϕ i r 2 e i n g j cos θ since the lateral instability may only occur when large axial compressive loads are applied it is reasonable to consider that the variation of the armor wire sectional force in the tangential direction induced by bending and displacement is much smaller than that induced by axial compression moreover as the frictional force is disregarded in the present context the tangential force is thus assumed approximately constant along the armor wire thereafter substituting eqs 23a 23c 26 27 into eqs 17b 17c and ignoring the higher order small terms the external loads in the armor wire normal and bi normal directions can be evaluated respectively as 28 p n p t sin 2 ϕ i r 29 p b θ κ r cos ϕ i p t p 2 c ϕ sin ϕ i p t p 3 c ω sin 2 ϕ i p t p 1 sin θ r in which p 1 p 2 and p 3 are constants corresponding to the armor wire characteristics 30 p 1 sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ i g j 31 p 2 sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ i 2 e i b cos 2 ϕ i g j sin 2 ϕ i 32 p 3 sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ i 4 e i b cos 2 ϕ i g j cos 2 ϕ i since the frictional force is disregarded the external load component in the circumferential direction should be zero thus according to fig 2 the following relation must hold 33 p n sin ω p b cos ω 0 making the external load components in eq 33 substituted with eqs 28 and 29 and ignoring the higher order small terms yields 34 κ r p t p 2 cot ϕ i c ϕ p t p 3 c ω p 1 sin ϕ i 0 3 2 lateral instability of a quasi rectangular armor wire for a quasi rectangular armor wire subjected to axial compression assuming that the axial rotation is triggered as illustrated in fig 2 left the external moment on the armor wire in the axial direction can be evaluated by 35 m t p u p p l o w w 2 cos ω where p u p and p l o w denote respectively the contact forces in the upper and lower interfaces with the adjacent layers which are both defined as positive besides the equilibrium condition of the forces in the radial direction is given by 36 p n cos ω p b sin ω p l o w p u p combining eqs 35 and 36 the external moment on the armor wire in the axial direction can be calculated alternatively as 37 m t p n cos ω p b sin ω w 2 cos ω p l o w w cos ω making p n and p b in eq 37 substituted with eqs 28 and 29 and ignoring the higher order small terms yields 38 m t p t sin 2 ϕ i 2 r p l o w w firstly let us consider the condition that the gap is sufficiently big so that the armor wire contacts the outer layer but does not contact the core under this circumstance p l o w is zero comparing eqs 25 and 38 and noting that p t is large in case of the lateral instability it can be seen that the generated torque as given by eq 38 is much larger than the required torque for equilibrium as given by eq 25 moreover if the gap is sufficiently small so that the armor wire contacts both the upper and lower borders formed by the adjacent layers p l o w needs to be considered noting that p l o w is a positive and p t represents the compressive load which is a negative from eq 38 it can be seen that the external constraint on the armor wire axial rotation would be even stronger when the armor wire contacts both the upper and lower borders thus it can be concluded that for a single quasi rectangular armor wire in axial compression the axial rotation is unlikely to be initiated even if a gap is formed however when large transverse deflections are generated the armor wire may rotate due to the lateral contact between the neighboring armor wires nevertheless it should be noted that the lateral contact may only take place when the armor wires are very close to the lateral instability failure or in the post failure stage thus to evaluate the lateral stability limit of quasi rectangular armor wires the armor wire lateral contact is herein disregarded and the armor wire normal direction is considered coinciding with the toroid normal direction i e ω 0 consequently applying c ω 0 into eq 34 yields 39 c ϕ κ r cot ϕ i p t p 2 p t p 3 substituting eq 39 into eq 21 the lay angle variation of the quasi rectangular armor wire subjected to axial compression can be obtained as 40 δ ϕ θ κ r cot ϕ i p t p 2 p t p 3 cos θ such an equilibrium path coincides with the periodic component of the armor wire transverse deflection on a frictionless toroid given by li et al 2019b substituting eq 39 and c ω 0 into eq 25 the external moment on the quasi rectangular armor wire in the axial direction can be given by 41 m t θ κ r cos ϕ i

generated by the adjacent layers and the frictional constraint on its axial rotation can be easily overcome in cyclic bending thus it is reasonable to consider that the circular armor wire is free to rotate in the axial direction i e m t 0 using eq 25 the following relation can be obtained 42 κ r 2 sin 2 ϕ i e i n g j c ϕ e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j cos 2 ϕ i c ω sin ϕ i e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j 0 combining eqs 34 and 42 and eliminating the terms of c ϕ yields 43 c ω κ r cos ϕ i 3 cos 2 ϕ i 2 sin 2 ϕ i g j e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j p t p 5 p t p 4 in which p 4 and p 5 are constants corresponding to the armor

thereafter substituting eq 43 into eq 22 the axial rotation of the circular armor wire can be obtained as 46 ω θ κ r cos ϕ i 3 cos 2 ϕ i 2 sin 2 ϕ i g j e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j p t p 5 p t p 4 sin θ consequently substituting eq 43 into eq 42 yields 47 c ϕ κ r cot ϕ i p t p 6 p t p 4 in which p 6 is a constant corresponding to the armor wire characteristics 48 p 6 2 g j sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n sin 2 ϕ

limit of a single armor wire 4 1 1 quasi rectangular armor wire first consider a single armor wire with a quasi rectangular cross section approximately 10 m m 3 m m helically wound over a toroid with lay angle equal to 30 the minor radius of the toroid is 0 1 m and young s modulus and poisson s ratio are 210 g p a and 0 3 respectively fig 3 and fig 4 respectively show the results of eqs 40 and 41 with a constant bending curvature κ 0 5 m 1 and different axial compressive loads p t 0 n 1000 n 2000 n 2500 n for the sake of comparison the lay angle variations of the armor wire at the loxodromic and geodesic curves on a toroid with a small bending curvature are approximately evaluated by li et al 2019a b 51 δ ϕ l o x θ κ r sin 2 ϕ i 2 cos θ 52 δ ϕ g e o θ κ r cot ϕ i cos θ from fig 3 it can be seen that the lay angle remains constant in the neutral plane θ 0 5 π 1 5 π and the maximum lay angle variations locate at the intrados θ π and extrados θ 0 2 π when the axial compression is relatively small the armor wire equilibrium path locates between the loxodromic and geodesic curves when the axial compression is larger than a critical value the armor wire tends to deflect in the opposite direction of geodesic curve besides fig 4 illustrates that no torque acts on the armor wire in the positions of intrados and extrados and the maximum torques locate at the neutral plane note that the present analytical model is only applicable to the stage prior to the lateral instability in the post buckling stage large armor wire deflection and pipe rotation are generated due to the material yielding of armor wire sections on both sides of the neutral plane which causes large lay angle variation in the neutral plane moreover for the quasi rectangular armor wire withstanding increasing axial compressive loads under different bending curvatures κ 1 m 1 1 2 m 1 1 4 m 1 the lay angle variation at θ π and the torque at θ 1 5 π are evaluated respectively from eqs 40 and 41 and illustrated respectively in fig 5 and fig 6 it can be noted that both the armor wire lay angle variation and the torque change monotonically with increasing axial compressive loads while the armor wire lay angle variation and torque are small when small axial compressive loads are experienced they tend to grow abruptly and asymptotically when the axial compressive load approaches p 3 2578 n under all the bending curvatures which is due to the singularity in eqs 40 and 41 when p t p 3 evidently large deflections generate large bending stresses in the armor wire which may cause the lateral instability failure due to material yielding thus the lateral stability limit of a quasi rectangular armor wire can be approximately evaluated by p 3 as given by eq 32 li et al 2019b note that within each pitch length the armor wire deflections in first half pitch 0 θ π and second half pitch π θ 2 π are symmetric thus the characteristic length is half pitch length 4 1 2 circular armor wire thereafter modify the previously discussed quasi rectangular armor wire to a circular armor wire with the same lay angle over the same toroid the cross sectional diameter of the circular armor wire is set to 6 m m so that the cross sectional areas of the quasi rectangular and circular armor wires are approximately equal using eqs 49 and 46 the lay angle variation and axial rotation of the circular armor wire subjected to different axial compressive loads p t 0 n 500 n 1000 n 1500 n and a constant bending curvature κ 0 5 m 1 are illustrated respectively in fig 7 and fig 8 the dashed lines in fig 7 represent the loxodromic and geodesic curves given by eqs 51 and 52 comparing figs 3 and 7 it can be noted that although the quasi rectangular and circular armor wires deflect in opposite directions for small axial compressive loads they tend to buckle in the same shape when large axial compressive loads are applied besides as there is no constraint on the circular armor wire axial rotation from fig 8 it can be seen that the circular armor wire rotates in opposite directions in front and behind the plane of bending and the maximum axial rotations are found at the neutral plane due to symmetry no axial rotations are generated in the circular armor wire at the intrados and extrados subsequently fig 9 depicts the lay angle variation at θ π and the axial rotation at θ 1 5 π in the circular armor wire withstanding increasing axial compressive loads under different bending curvatures κ 1 m 1 1 2 m 1 1 4 m 1 where the vertical dashed line represents the constant p 4 given by eq 50a similarly it can be observed that both the lay angle variation and axial rotation of the circular armor wire change monotonically and asymptotically when the axial compressive load approaches p 4 1569 n under all the bending curvatures which is due to the singularity in eqs 46 and 49 when p t p 4 comparing figs 5 and 9 it can be seen that the lateral deflection of the circular armor wire changes more gradually than that of the quasi rectangular armor wire note that the present analytical model is on the basis that the armor wire lay angle variation and axial rotation are both small terms however according to fig 9 it may not be reasonable to consider them as small terms for the circular armor wire when the axial compressive load is close to p 4 especially under large bending curvatures thus the present analytical model for a circular armor wire may not be accurate in case of large axial compressive loads and large bending curvatures and a circular armor wire may start yielding before the axial compressive load approaches p 4 nevertheless under small bending curvatures the lateral stability limit of a circular armor wire still can be approximately evaluated by p 4 as given by eq 50a 4 1 3 effect of axial rotational constraint for the sake of comparison let us assume that the quasi rectangular armor wire is free to rotate in the axial direction using the previously discussed quasi rectangular armor wire the corresponding lateral stability limit under this circumstance can be evaluated as p 4 1270 n evidently the lateral stability limit of the quasi rectangular armor wire decreases significantly when releasing the rotational degree of freedom in the axial direction on the other hand assume that the circular armor wire normal vector coincides with the toroid normal vector under this circumstance the corresponding lateral stability limit of the previously discussed circular armor wire can be evaluated as p 3 1458 n it is interesting to note that forcing the circular armor wire normal vector to coincide with the toroid normal vector reduces the lateral stability limit which is contrary to what is observed in the quasi rectangular armor wire the different effects of axial rotational constrant on the quasi rectangular and circular armor wires are due to the interaction of two mechanisms torque and bending stiffness for the circular armor wire the bending stiffness is constant in any direction forcing the circular armor wire normal vector to coincide with the toroid normal vector is equivalent to applying the torque given by eq 41 which facilitates the circular armor wire lateral deflection thus reducing the lateral stability limit on the other hand for the quasi rectangular armor wire releasing the rotational degree of freedom in the axial direction not only eliminates the torque but also generates axial rotation which reduces the bending stiffness about the toroid normal direction despite the fact that the first consequence retards the lateral deflection of the quasi rectangular armor wire the second consequence facilitates its lateral deflection significantly thus as a result of the combined action the lateral stability limit of the quasi rectangular armor wire decreases when releasing the axial rotational constraint 4 2 lateral stability limits of flexible pipes and umbilicals based on the abovementioned models for a single armor wire with quasi rectangular or circular cross sections the lateral stability limits of flexible pipes and umbilicals will now be evaluated consider that the axial loads are principally carried by the armor wire layers and the axial load carried by each armor wire is approximately identical ignore the transverse contact between the neighboring armor wires and assume that the radial expansions of the armor wires in axial compression are negligible consequently for flexible pipes constituted of quasi rectangular armor wires and umbilicals constituted of circular armor wires the critical longitudinal compressive loads that may cause the armor wire lateral instability can be evaluated respectively by 53 p f i x n p 3 cos ϕ i 54 p f r e e n p 4 cos ϕ i where n is the total number of armor wires and p 3 and p 4 are calculated using the mean radius of the armor wire layers the subscripts f i x and f r e e represent respectively the conditions when the armor wire normal direction is fixed in the toroid normal direction and when the armor wire is free to rotate to verify the declaration that the lateral stability limit of a quasi rectangular armor wire can be reasonably evaluated by considering its normal vector coinciding with the toroid normal vector the analytical predictions given by both eqs 53 and 54 are compared with available test data from literature a number of tests were conducted by braga 2003 and østergaard et al 2012b regarding the flexible pipe armor wire lateral instability applying longitudinal compressive loads associated with numerous bending cycles at atmospheric pressure more recently two flexible pipe samples were tested in the wet annulus condition through a horizontal flex compression hyperbaric chamber in the laboratory núcleo de estruturas oceânicas neo coppe applying hydrostatic pressure and cyclic bending the armor wire layer characteristics of abovementioned test samples are summarized in table 1 the test conditions and results are presented in table 2 where the equivalent axial compressive loads on those two flexible pipe samples tested in the hyperbaric chamber are calculated by multiplying the hydrostatic pressure by the cross sectional area of the fluid barrier layer fig 10 shows the comparison between the test data and the lateral stability limits given by eqs 53 and 54 while the lateral stability limits given by eq 53 agree well with all the test data it can be seen that eq 54 fails in the prediction of cases 11 15 16 17 it is important to note that in cases 16 and 17 the applied compressive loads are very close to the limit given by eq 53 and much larger than the limit given by eq 54 and yet no failures were triggered this can to some extent evidence that it is reasonable to evaluate the lateral stability limit of a quasi rectangular armor wire by considering its normal direction coinciding with the toroid normal direction thus the fact that the lateral instability failure is more susceptible under flooded annulus condition is not due to the potential armor wire axial rotation instead it is principally due to the decrease of frictional resistance with a smaller frictional resistance the armor wire is capable of more easily sliding in the lateral direction and hence may develop into the lateral instability failure with less bending cycles for the lateral instability of umbilicals constituted of circular armor wires unfortunately no test data is available in the literature to date thus further experimental verification is needed for the present analytcal model for the circular armor wire lateral instability 4 3 design recommendations to investigate how to improve the armor wire layer design against the lateral instability parametric studies are performed using the armor wire properties from an umbilical given by custódio and vaz 2002 see table 3 fig 11 shows the plots of eq 54 with increasing armor wire lay angles and different armor wire cross sectional diameters and fig 12 illustrates the results of eq 54 with increasing armor wire cross sectional diameters and different armor wire lay angles while changing the armor wire parameters the number of armor wires is modified correspondingly to keep the filling factors in both inner and outer armor wire layers approximately fixed from fig 11 it can be seen that for different circular armor wire cross sectional diameters the maximum lateral stability limits are always obtained when the lay angle is approximately 30 35 either increasing or decreasing the lay angle from this value reduces the circular armor wire lateral stability limit besides the results of fig 12 demonstrate that for different armor wire lay angles the umbilical lateral stability limit always increases monotonically with increasing armor wire cross sectional diameters nevertheless it needs to be noted that increasing the circular armor wire cross sectional size increases the umbilical weight and diameter which will in return increase the cost and operational difficulty to modify the circular armor wire size without significantly changing the weight filling factor and total thickness of the armor wire layers a feasible method could be taken by adjusting the number of armor wire layers correspondingly for instance to transform four circular armor wire layers into two circular armor wire layers following the abovementioned principles approximately one quarter of the armor wires with twice cross sectional diameter needs to be employed as illustrated in fig 13 through this method although the number of armor wires decreases the lateral stability limit of each armor wire increases dramatically according to eqs 50a and 54 it can be concluded that by transforming four circular armor wire layers into two circular armor wire layers using the suggested method the umbilical lateral stability limit is nearly quadrupled subsequently the efficiencies of circular and quasi rectangular armor wire cross sections in preventing the lateral instability failure are compared and discussed to transform circular armor wires to quasi rectangular armor wires without significantly changing the weight and filling factor of the armor wire layers the relation between the thickness of the quasi rectangular cross section and the diameter of the circular cross section can be approximately given by h d π 4 meanwhile the width lay angle and number of the quasi rectangular armor wires can be adjusted correspondingly by keeping the filling factor approximately fixed thence transforming the circular armor wires presented in table 3 to quasi rectangular armor wires using the suggested method the lateral stability limits of the armor wires with circular and quasi rectangular cross sections at different lay angles are evaluated respectively by eqs 53 and 54 and compared in fig 14 it can be observed that concerning the prevention of armor wire lateral instability it is more efficient to employ the armor wires with wide quasi rectangular cross sections the wider the quasi rectangular cross section is the larger the axial compressive load the armor wire is capable of withstanding thus for the applications of flexible pipes and umbilicals that large axial compression and significant bending cycles may be encountered it is recommended to employ wide quasi rectangular armor wires if in some applications it is preferable to employ circular armor wires due to available equipment or financial issue large size circular armor wires should be employed 5 conclusions in this work analytical models are formulated for the prediction of lateral stability limit of the armor wires with quasi rectangular or circular cross sections in flexible pipes and umbilicals the present study indicates that the axial rotations of quasi rectangular armor wires are strongly restrained by the contact with adjacent layers and is thus less possible to take place even if a gap is formed in axial compression this conclusion has been to some extent verified by comparing the present analytical models with available test data of flexible pipes on the other hand for circular armor wires it is reasonable to consider them free to rotate axially since the geometric constraint generated by the adjacent layers vanishes for the flexible pipes and umbilicals that may experience large axial compressive loads and bending cycles in their service life it is recommended to apply wide quasi rectangular armor wires rather than circular armor wires concerning the prevention of armor wire lateral instability the wider the quasi rectangular cross section is the larger the lateral stability limit can be obtained if in some applications it is preferable to employ circular armor wires due to available equipment or financial issue the lateral stability limit can be improved by employing the circular armor wires with large cross sectional size note that the present analytical model is based on a periodic instability mode different armor wire instability modes may exist whose effect on the stability limit deserves further investigations besides this model needs to be further improved by considering the stick slip phenomenon of armor wire sliding for the better evaluation of the armor wire lateral instability mechanism in both dry and wet annulus conditions moreover it needs to be noted that the applied perturbation technique may cause errors when large bending curvatures are experienced and large armor wire deflections are generated future study is needed to establish the validated application range for this analytical methodology lastly although the present analytical model for quasi rectangular armor wires has been verified by available test data of flexible pipes no test data regarding the circular armor wire lateral instability in subsea umbilicals is available in the literature thus further experimental verification is needed for the present analytical model concerning the circular armor wire lateral instability acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support from the national council for scientific and

22443,the present paper addresses armor wire lateral instability in flexible pipes and umbilicals analytical models are formulated for the lateral instability of armor wires with quasi rectangular or circular cross sections considering the armor wire axial rotation constrained by the adjacent layers or free respectively the axial rotational effects on the lateral instability of quasi rectangular and circular armor wires are discussed the present analytical model for quasi rectangular armor wire lateral instability is verified with availabe test data from literature indicating that it is reasonable to consider the quasi rectangular armor wire normal direction coinciding with the toroid normal direction even if a gap is formed in axial compression parametric studies are performed to investigate the effect of armor wire layer properties on the lateral stability limit this is followed by some useful suggestions for improving the design of armor wire layers against the lateral instability keywords flexible pipes umbilicals tensile armor wires lateral instability 1 introduction flexible pipes and umbilicals are crucial elements in offshore industry flexible pipes are widely applied for the transportation of hydrocarbons and production fluids in floating production systems for a typical unbonded flexible pipe the sealing is provided by the concentric polymeric layers the internal and external pressures are resisted by the interlocked metallic layers and the axial loads and torsion are carried by the helically wound tensile armor wire layers subsea umbilicals are the connective medium between the surface facilities and subsea equipment for transferring electrical power fiber optic signals hydraulic and chemical injection fluids which are achieved by a number of cables hydraulic hoses and metal tubes those functional components are helically wound and enclosed by the outer ring formed by the tensile armor wires and polymeric layers in most of the service life of flexible pipes large tensile loads are experienced which generate large contact forces between the armor wires and the underlying polymeric layer to mitigate the penetration of the armor wires into the polymeric layer the cross sections of the armor wires in flexible pipes are usually quasi rectangular as the contact forces can be more evenly distributed in contrast since umbilicals usually operate at a relatively low level of tension that problem is therefore not of great concern thus circular armor wires are commonly employed in umbilicals due to ease of fabrication despite the fact that tensile loads are the principal loads withstand by flexible pipes and umbilicals in most of their service life large axial compressive loads may also be experienced under certain scenarios e g due to the large heave of host platform during installation or operation worse still since the flexible pipe core may be empty or with very small internal pressure during installation or well shut down operations axial compressive loads may also be generated due to the reverse end cap effect this is especially of concern for the application of large diameter flexible pipes in deep water driven by large axial compressive loads the helical armor wires tend to deflect radially or transversely which may lead to the armor wire instability the armor wire instability in the radial direction also known as bird caging has been the subject of research among others by sousa et al 2012 rabelo et al 2015 sævik and thorsen 2017 li et al 2019c to prevent the formation of bird caging in flexible pipes high strength tapes are commonly applied over the armor wire layers to reinforce the radial constraint in contrast in industry practice of umbilicals the anti birdcage tapes are generally not employed thus only limited axial compression is allowed thereby restricting the feasibility of umbilical configuration and weather window for installation however for special purpose applications where large axial compression may be expected the anti birdcage tapes could also be considered for umbilicals garcía et al 2015 nevertheless although the displacements of the armor wires in the radial direction can be restrained to a certain extent by the anti birdcage tapes the risk of the armor wire lateral instability is still involved which hinders the potential application of flexible pipes and umbilicals in a harsh environment to date very little data has been published regarding the circular armor wire lateral instability in umbilicals garcía et al 2015 reported a qualification test of a submarine power cable using a test rig built by marintek concerning the circular armor wire lateral instability in combined axial compression and cyclic bending but no details were published on the other hand considerable attention has been paid to the quasi rectangular armor wire lateral instability in flexible pipes in an effort to reproduce the armor wire lateral instability and evaluate the load carrying capacity flexible pipes have been tested either offshore or onshore by means of the dip tests deep immersion performance tests hyperbaric chamber tests and mechanical tests custódio et al 2007 secher et al 2011 braga 2003 østergaard et al 2012b besides by establishing an eigenvalue problem custódio 2005 developed an analytical model for the prediction of the armor wire stability limit in flexible pipes under axisymmetric loading through a total strain energy approach tan et al 2006 developed an analytical tool to model the armor wire buckling and post buckling behaviors however no details were presented in addition some finite element models have been developed for flexible pipe armor wire instability in the straight pipe condition vaz and rizzo 2011 li 2014 yang et al 2015 gonzalez et al 2017 moreover caleyron et al 2017 developed a numerical model using periodic conditions which is applicable for the armor wire lateral instability study by establishing and solving a differential equation system as a boundary value problem a series of studies were presented by østergaard et al 2011 2012a b focusing on the armor wire lateral instability in flexible pipes subsequently based on the results generated by the differential equation system proposed by østergaard et al 2012b in the straight pipe condition paiva and vaz 2017 proposed an empirical model for the estimation of the armor wire lateral stability limit using symbolic regression besides sævik and ji 2014 simulated the armor wire in a flexible pipe subjected to axial compression associated with cyclic bending through a finite element code and good agreement with the test data of østergaard et al 2012b in terms of failure no failure observations was demonstrated additionally analytical models for the prediction of the armor wire lateral stability limit were presented by sævik and ji 2014 and li et al 2018 considering the straight pipe condition with no friction however the estimated lateral stability limits from both models are on the conservative side more recently it was demonstrated by li et al 2019b that the armor wire lateral instability may follow a periodic mode the corresponding lateral stability limit was evaluated through an analytical formulation and good agreement with existing test data was demonstrated afterwards an analytical model was developed by li et al 2019a to investigate the sliding and ultimate state of the armor wires in a flexible pipe subjected to axial compressive loads combined with cyclic bending considering the frictional effect the equilibrium path of an armor wire in a stable state as well as the critical longitudinal compressive load on a flexible pipe that may eventually cause the armor wires lateral instability after numerous bending cycles are evaluated in all abovementioned analytical and numerical studies of flexible pipes the rectangular armor wire normal direction and the toroid normal direction are assumed coincident note that for a flexible pipe subjected to large axial compressive loads the armor wires tend to expand radially and push the anti birdcage tapes which may generate a gap between the armor wires and the core especially when the armor annulus is flooded since the radial constraint from external water pressure vanishes in this respect it has been demonstrated by some researchers that the rectangular armor wire may rotate around its own axis due to the gap thus affecting the lateral instability limit brack et al 2005 tan et al 2006 custódio et al 2007 also api 17b 2014 recommends that the gap between the armor wires and the underlying layer generated by the axial compression should not exceed half of the armor wire thickness however considering that the axial rotation of the rectangular armor wire is strongly restricted by the contact effect from the adjacent layers whether such axial rotation could take place is disputable on the other hand for circular armor wires it is reasonable to consider them free to rotate since the geometric constraint from the adjacent layers vanishes the main purpose of this research has therefore been to investigate the potential impact of the armor wire axial rotation on the lateral instability mechanism analytial models are formulated for the lateral instability of quasi rectangular and circular armor wires whether axial rotation could take place in the quasi rectangular armor wire is discussed and verified with available test data from literature thereafter some suggestions are presented for improving the armor wire layer design against the lateral instability 2 field equations for a single armor wire 2 1 geometrical relations consider a flexible pipe or umbilical bent to a toroid with minor and major radii respectively denoted by r and r 1 κ see fig 1 parameterizing this toroid by the longitudinal coordinate u and the angular coordinate θ a point on the toroid in cartesian coordinates can be determined by 1 x u θ 1 κ r cos θ cos κ u 1 κ r sin θ 1 κ r cos θ sin κ u then the armor wire path can be represented by a directed curve on the toroid parameterize the curve by its arc length denoted by s and attach a local curvilinear coordinate triad of unit orthonormal vectors t n b on the curve representing the tangential normal and bi normal directions respectively see fig 1 the unit tangent vector can be given by 2 t x u d u d s x θ d θ d s by specifying a relation between u and θ an arbitrary curve on the toroid can be determined such relation is herein defined by the angle between the curve tangent and its projection in the longitudinal direction represented by ϕ as depicted in fig 1 accordingly the unit tangent vector can be alternatively expressed as 3 t x u x u cos ϕ x θ x θ sin ϕ substituting eq 1 into eq 3 the unit tangent vector can be obtained as 4 t cos ϕ sin κ u sin ϕ sin θ cos κ u sin ϕ cos θ cos ϕ cos κ u sin ϕ sin θ sin κ u besides comparing eq 2 and eq 3 the following relations can be identified 5a d u d s cos ϕ 1 κ r cos θ 5b d θ d s sin ϕ r assuming that the armor wire rotates in its axial direction and denoting the angle between the armor wire normal direction and the toroid normal direction by ω as depicted in fig 2 the triad of unit vectors on the armor wire can be calculated by 6 t n b 1 0 0 0 cos ω sin ω 0 sin ω cos ω t n 0 b 0 where n 0 is the toroid normal vector which can be expressed by 7 n 0 x u x θ x u x θ and b 0 is defined as 8 b 0 t n 0 applying eq 1 into eq 7 the toroid normal vector can be obtained as 9 n 0 cos θ cos κ u sin θ cos θ sin

14b κ n n d t d s t d n d s 14c τ n d b d s b d n d s substituting eqs 4 11 and 12 into eqs 14a 14c the geodesic curvature normal curvature and torsion of the armor wire can be obtained respectively as 15a κ g sin 2 ϕ κ r 2 cos θ r sin ω 1 κ r cos θ r cos ω sin 2 ϕ d ϕ d s κ r sin 2 ϕ cos ϕ sin θ cos ω cos θ sin ω 15b κ n sin 2 ϕ κ r 2 cos θ r cos ω 1 κ r cos θ r sin ω sin 2 ϕ d ϕ d s κ r sin 2 ϕ

curvature components denoted by κ g i κ n i τ i can thus be obtained by substituting κ 0 ω 0 and ϕ ϕ i into eqs 15a 15c respectively as 16a κ g i 0 16b κ n i sin 2 ϕ i r 16c τ i sin 2 ϕ i 2 r 2 3 equilibrium equations considering the armor wire as a thin curved beam the componentwise equilibrium equations of a curved beam derived by love 1944 can be applied 17a d p t d s κ n p n κ g p b p t 0

m b are deemed zero 2 4 constitutive equations considering that the armor wire cross sectional dimensions are small compared with the toroid diameter and the armor wire strains are small the following linear constitutive relations can thus be applied 18a m t g j τ τ i 18b m n e i n κ g κ g i 18c m b e i b κ n κ n i 18d p t e a ε where e g a i n i b j ε are respectively the young s modulus the shear

inertias can be given by 20a i n i b π d 4 64 20b j π d 4 32 2 5 periodic deflection two potential armor wire lateral instability modes global and periodic have been demonstrated by li et al 2019b it has been observed that the lateral stability limit corresponding to the global failure mode lies on the conservative side compared with available test data since it is obtained with the frictional effect disregarded on the other hand assuming that the global displacement component is restricted by the frictional resistance and the periodic displacement component is generated in cyclic bending it has been discovered that the stability limit corresponding to the periodic mode is in good agreement with available test data indicating that the armor wire lateral instability may actually occur in the periodic mode such trigonometric deflection mode has been further proved analytically by li et al 2019a considering the cyclic bending and friction mechanism note that the stability limit depends principally on the deflection mode thus in order to assess the critical compressive load that may trigger the armor wire lateral instability instead of modeling the frictional resistance and cyclic bending directly their effects are considered alternatively by assuming the armor wire deflecting in the periodic form such periodic deflection is herein described by the armor wire lay angle as the sum of the initial lay angle ϕ i plus a small perturbation parameter δ ϕ θ 21 ϕ ϕ i δ ϕ θ ϕ i c ϕ cos θ as a consequence the armor wire axial rotation should also be periodic due to symmetry which is assumed in the following form 22 ω θ c ω sin θ in which c ϕ and c ω are undetermined coefficients 3 analytical treatment 3 1 linearization through a perturbation technique the previously formulated six coupled love s differential equations for a curved beam have been solved analytically by li et al 2018 2019b li et al 2019a through the application of a perturbation technique which is based on the assumption that the ratio of the minor toroid radius to the major toroid radius as well as the armor wire lay angle variation are both small comparably by introducing an additional assumption that the armor wire axial rotation ω is also a small term the previously developed system of differential equations can be solved analytically in a similar process for the sake of convenience hereafter all the variables are expressed in terms of the angular coordinate θ instead of the armor wire arc length s by using eq 5b substituting eqs 21 and 22 into eqs 15a 15c considering both δ ϕ and ω as small terms and ignoring the higher order small terms the armor wire curvature components can be approximately evaluated by 23a κ g θ κ r cos ϕ i c ϕ sin ϕ i c ω sin 2 ϕ i sin θ r 23b κ n θ sin 2 ϕ i r κ cos 2 ϕ i c ϕ sin 2 ϕ i cos θ r 23c τ θ sin 2 ϕ i 2 r κ r sin 2 ϕ i 2 c ϕ cos 2 ϕ i c ω sin ϕ i cos θ r afterwards substituting eqs 16a 16c and 23a 23c into eqs 18a 18c the armor wire sectional moments in the tangential normal and bi normal directions can be approximately determined by 24a m t θ g j κ r sin 2 ϕ i 2 c ϕ cos 2 ϕ i c ω sin ϕ i cos θ r 24b m n θ e i n κ r cos ϕ i c ϕ sin ϕ i c ω sin 2 ϕ i sin θ r 24c m b θ e i b κ cos 2 ϕ i c ϕ sin 2 ϕ i cos θ r subsequently substituting eqs 23a 23b 24a 24c into eq 17d and ignoring the higher order small terms the external moment in the axial direction can be obtained as 25 m t θ κ r g j e i n sin 2 ϕ i cos ϕ i sin θ c ϕ sin ϕ i r 2 g j cos 2 ϕ i e i n sin 2 ϕ i sin θ c ω sin 2 ϕ i r 2 g j e i n sin 2 ϕ i sin θ thereafter substituting eqs 23a 23c 24a 24c into eqs 17f 17e and ignoring the higher order small terms the armor wire sectional forces in the normal and bi normal directions can be evaluated respectively by 26 p n θ κ r e i n e i b sin ϕ i cos 2 ϕ i sin θ c ϕ e i n 2 e i b sin 2 ϕ i cos ϕ i r 2 sin θ c ω e i n sin 3 ϕ i cos ϕ i r 2 sin θ 27 p b θ κ 2 r sin 2 ϕ i e i n e i b cos 2 ϕ i g j sin 2 ϕ i cos θ c ϕ sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n 2 e i b cos 2 ϕ i g j cos 2 ϕ i cos θ c ω sin 3 ϕ i r 2 e i n g j cos θ since the lateral instability may only occur when large axial compressive loads are applied it is reasonable to consider that the variation of the armor wire sectional force in the tangential direction induced by bending and displacement is much smaller than that induced by axial compression moreover as the frictional force is disregarded in the present context the tangential force is thus assumed approximately constant along the armor wire thereafter substituting eqs 23a 23c 26 27 into eqs 17b 17c and ignoring the higher order small terms the external loads in the armor wire normal and bi normal directions can be evaluated respectively as 28 p n p t sin 2 ϕ i r 29 p b θ κ r cos ϕ i p t p 2 c ϕ sin ϕ i p t p 3 c ω sin 2 ϕ i p t p 1 sin θ r in which p 1 p 2 and p 3 are constants corresponding to the armor wire characteristics 30 p 1 sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ i g j 31 p 2 sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ i 2 e i b cos 2 ϕ i g j sin 2 ϕ i 32 p 3 sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n 1 cos 2 ϕ i 4 e i b cos 2 ϕ i g j cos 2 ϕ i since the frictional force is disregarded the external load component in the circumferential direction should be zero thus according to fig 2 the following relation must hold 33 p n sin ω p b cos ω 0 making the external load components in eq 33 substituted with eqs 28 and 29 and ignoring the higher order small terms yields 34 κ r p t p 2 cot ϕ i c ϕ p t p 3 c ω p 1 sin ϕ i 0 3 2 lateral instability of a quasi rectangular armor wire for a quasi rectangular armor wire subjected to axial compression assuming that the axial rotation is triggered as illustrated in fig 2 left the external moment on the armor wire in the axial direction can be evaluated by 35 m t p u p p l o w w 2 cos ω where p u p and p l o w denote respectively the contact forces in the upper and lower interfaces with the adjacent layers which are both defined as positive besides the equilibrium condition of the forces in the radial direction is given by 36 p n cos ω p b sin ω p l o w p u p combining eqs 35 and 36 the external moment on the armor wire in the axial direction can be calculated alternatively as 37 m t p n cos ω p b sin ω w 2 cos ω p l o w w cos ω making p n and p b in eq 37 substituted with eqs 28 and 29 and ignoring the higher order small terms yields 38 m t p t sin 2 ϕ i 2 r p l o w w firstly let us consider the condition that the gap is sufficiently big so that the armor wire contacts the outer layer but does not contact the core under this circumstance p l o w is zero comparing eqs 25 and 38 and noting that p t is large in case of the lateral instability it can be seen that the generated torque as given by eq 38 is much larger than the required torque for equilibrium as given by eq 25 moreover if the gap is sufficiently small so that the armor wire contacts both the upper and lower borders formed by the adjacent layers p l o w needs to be considered noting that p l o w is a positive and p t represents the compressive load which is a negative from eq 38 it can be seen that the external constraint on the armor wire axial rotation would be even stronger when the armor wire contacts both the upper and lower borders thus it can be concluded that for a single quasi rectangular armor wire in axial compression the axial rotation is unlikely to be initiated even if a gap is formed however when large transverse deflections are generated the armor wire may rotate due to the lateral contact between the neighboring armor wires nevertheless it should be noted that the lateral contact may only take place when the armor wires are very close to the lateral instability failure or in the post failure stage thus to evaluate the lateral stability limit of quasi rectangular armor wires the armor wire lateral contact is herein disregarded and the armor wire normal direction is considered coinciding with the toroid normal direction i e ω 0 consequently applying c ω 0 into eq 34 yields 39 c ϕ κ r cot ϕ i p t p 2 p t p 3 substituting eq 39 into eq 21 the lay angle variation of the quasi rectangular armor wire subjected to axial compression can be obtained as 40 δ ϕ θ κ r cot ϕ i p t p 2 p t p 3 cos θ such an equilibrium path coincides with the periodic component of the armor wire transverse deflection on a frictionless toroid given by li et al 2019b substituting eq 39 and c ω 0 into eq 25 the external moment on the quasi rectangular armor wire in the axial direction can be given by 41 m t θ κ r cos ϕ i e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j cos 2 ϕ i p t p 2 p t p 3 e i n g j sin 2 ϕ i sin θ 3 3 lateral instability of a circular armor wire for a circular armor wire no geometric constraint on its axial rotation is generated by the adjacent layers and the frictional constraint on its axial rotation can be easily overcome in cyclic bending thus it is reasonable to consider that the circular armor wire is free to rotate in the axial direction i e m t 0 using eq 25 the following relation can be obtained 42 κ r 2 sin 2 ϕ i e i n g j c ϕ e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j cos 2 ϕ i c ω sin ϕ i e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j 0 combining eqs 34 and 42 and eliminating the terms of c ϕ yields 43 c ω κ r cos ϕ i 3 cos 2 ϕ i 2 sin 2 ϕ i g j e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j p t p 5 p t p 4 in which p 4 and p 5 are constants corresponding to the armor

thereafter substituting eq 43 into eq 22 the axial rotation of the circular armor wire can be obtained as 46 ω θ κ r cos ϕ i 3 cos 2 ϕ i 2 sin 2 ϕ i g j e i n sin 2 ϕ i g j p t p 5 p t p 4 sin θ consequently substituting eq 43 into eq 42 yields 47 c ϕ κ r cot ϕ i p t p 6 p t p 4 in which p 6 is a constant corresponding to the armor wire characteristics 48 p 6 2 g j sin 2 ϕ i r 2 e i n sin 2 ϕ

limit of a single armor wire 4 1 1 quasi rectangular armor wire first consider a single armor wire with a quasi rectangular cross section approximately 10 m m 3 m m helically wound over a toroid with lay angle equal to 30 the minor radius of the toroid is 0 1 m and young s modulus and poisson s ratio are 210 g p a and 0 3 respectively fig 3 and fig 4 respectively show the results of eqs 40 and 41 with a constant bending curvature κ 0 5 m 1 and different axial compressive loads p t 0 n 1000 n 2000 n 2500 n for the sake of comparison the lay angle variations of the armor wire at the loxodromic and geodesic curves on a toroid with a small bending curvature are approximately evaluated by li et al 2019a b 51 δ ϕ l o x θ κ r sin 2 ϕ i 2 cos θ 52 δ ϕ g e o θ κ r cot ϕ i cos θ from fig 3 it can be seen that the lay angle remains constant in the neutral plane θ 0 5 π 1 5 π and the maximum lay angle variations locate at the intrados θ π and extrados θ 0 2 π when the axial compression is relatively small the armor wire equilibrium path locates between the loxodromic and geodesic curves when the axial compression is larger than a critical value the armor wire tends to deflect in the opposite direction of geodesic curve besides fig 4 illustrates that no torque acts on the armor wire in the positions of intrados and extrados and the maximum torques locate at the neutral plane note that the present analytical model is only applicable to the stage prior to the lateral instability in the post buckling stage large armor wire deflection and pipe rotation are generated due to the material yielding of armor wire sections on both sides of the neutral plane which causes large lay angle variation in the neutral plane moreover for the quasi rectangular armor wire withstanding increasing axial compressive loads under different bending curvatures κ 1 m 1 1 2 m 1 1 4 m 1 the lay angle variation at θ π and the torque at θ 1 5 π are evaluated respectively from eqs 40 and 41 and illustrated respectively in fig 5 and fig 6 it can be noted that both the armor wire lay angle variation and the torque change monotonically with increasing axial compressive loads while the armor wire lay angle variation and torque are small when small axial compressive loads are experienced they tend to grow abruptly and asymptotically when the axial compressive load approaches p 3 2578 n under all the bending curvatures which is due to the singularity in eqs 40 and 41 when p t p 3 evidently large deflections generate large bending stresses in the armor wire which may cause the lateral instability failure due to material yielding thus the lateral stability limit of a quasi rectangular armor wire can be approximately evaluated by p 3 as given by eq 32 li et al 2019b note that within each pitch length the armor wire deflections in first half pitch 0 θ π and second half pitch π θ 2 π are symmetric thus the characteristic length is half pitch length 4 1 2 circular armor wire thereafter modify the previously discussed quasi rectangular armor wire to a circular armor wire with the same lay angle over the same toroid the cross sectional diameter of the circular armor wire is set to 6 m m so that the cross sectional areas of the quasi rectangular and circular armor wires are approximately equal using eqs 49 and 46 the lay angle variation and axial rotation of the circular armor wire subjected to different axial compressive loads p t 0 n 500 n 1000 n 1500 n and a constant bending curvature κ 0 5 m 1 are illustrated respectively in fig 7 and fig 8 the dashed lines in fig 7 represent the loxodromic and geodesic curves given by eqs 51 and 52 comparing figs 3 and 7 it can be noted that although the quasi rectangular and circular armor wires deflect in opposite directions for small axial compressive loads they tend to buckle in the same shape when large axial compressive loads are applied besides as there is no constraint on the circular armor wire axial rotation from fig 8 it can be seen that the circular armor wire rotates in opposite directions in front and behind the plane of bending and the maximum axial rotations are found at the neutral plane due to symmetry no axial rotations are generated in the circular armor wire at the intrados and extrados subsequently fig 9 depicts the lay angle variation at θ π and the axial rotation at θ 1 5 π in the circular armor wire withstanding increasing axial compressive loads under different bending curvatures κ 1 m 1 1 2 m 1 1 4 m 1 where the vertical dashed line represents the constant p 4 given by eq 50a similarly it can be observed that both the lay angle variation and axial rotation of the circular armor wire change monotonically and asymptotically when the axial compressive load approaches p 4 1569 n under all the bending curvatures which is due to the singularity in eqs 46 and 49 when p t p 4 comparing figs 5 and 9 it can be seen that the lateral deflection of the circular armor wire changes more gradually than that of the quasi rectangular armor wire note that the present analytical model is on the basis that the armor wire lay angle variation and axial rotation are both small terms however according to fig 9 it may not be reasonable to consider them as small terms for the circular armor wire when the axial compressive load is close to p 4 especially under large bending curvatures thus the present analytical model for a circular armor wire may not be accurate in case of large axial compressive loads and large bending curvatures and a circular armor wire may start yielding before the axial compressive load approaches p 4 nevertheless under small bending curvatures the lateral stability limit of a circular armor wire still can be approximately evaluated by p 4 as given by eq 50a 4 1 3 effect of axial rotational constraint for the sake of comparison let us assume that the quasi rectangular armor wire is free to rotate in the axial direction using the previously discussed quasi rectangular armor wire the corresponding lateral stability limit under this circumstance can be evaluated as p 4 1270 n evidently the lateral stability limit of the quasi rectangular armor wire decreases significantly when releasing the rotational degree of freedom in the axial direction on the other hand assume that the circular armor wire normal vector coincides with the toroid normal vector under this circumstance the corresponding lateral stability limit of the previously discussed circular armor wire can be evaluated as p 3 1458 n it is interesting to note that forcing the circular armor wire normal vector to coincide with the toroid normal vector reduces the lateral stability limit which is contrary to what is observed in the quasi rectangular armor wire the different effects of axial rotational constrant on the quasi rectangular and circular armor wires are due to the interaction of two mechanisms torque and bending stiffness for the circular armor wire the bending stiffness is constant in any direction forcing the circular armor wire normal vector to coincide with the toroid normal vector is equivalent to applying the torque given by eq 41 which facilitates the circular armor wire lateral deflection thus reducing the lateral stability limit on the other hand for the quasi rectangular armor wire releasing the rotational degree of freedom in the axial direction not only eliminates the torque but also generates axial rotation which reduces the bending stiffness about the toroid normal direction despite the fact that the first consequence retards the lateral deflection of the quasi rectangular armor wire the second consequence facilitates its lateral deflection significantly thus as a result of the combined action the lateral stability limit of the quasi rectangular armor wire decreases when releasing the axial rotational constraint 4 2 lateral stability limits of flexible pipes and umbilicals based on the abovementioned models for a single armor wire with quasi rectangular or circular cross sections the lateral stability limits of flexible pipes and umbilicals will now be evaluated consider that the axial loads are principally carried by the armor wire layers and the axial load carried by each armor wire is approximately identical ignore the transverse contact between the neighboring armor wires and assume that the radial expansions of the armor wires in axial compression are negligible consequently for flexible pipes constituted of quasi rectangular armor wires and umbilicals constituted of circular armor wires the critical longitudinal compressive loads that may cause the armor wire lateral instability can be evaluated respectively by 53 p f i x n p 3 cos ϕ i 54 p f r e e n p 4 cos ϕ i where n is the total number of armor wires and p 3 and p 4 are calculated using the mean radius of the armor wire layers the subscripts f i x and f r e e represent respectively the conditions when the armor wire normal direction is fixed in the toroid normal direction and when the armor wire is free to rotate to verify the declaration that the lateral stability limit of a quasi rectangular armor wire can be reasonably evaluated by considering its normal vector coinciding with the toroid normal vector the analytical predictions given by both eqs 53 and 54 are compared with available test data from literature a number of tests were conducted by braga 2003 and østergaard et al 2012b regarding the flexible pipe armor wire lateral instability applying longitudinal compressive loads associated with numerous bending cycles at atmospheric pressure more recently two flexible pipe samples were tested in the wet annulus condition through a horizontal flex compression hyperbaric chamber in the laboratory núcleo de estruturas oceânicas neo coppe applying hydrostatic pressure and cyclic bending the armor wire layer characteristics of abovementioned test samples are summarized in table 1 the test conditions and results are presented in table 2 where the equivalent axial compressive loads on those two flexible pipe samples tested in the hyperbaric chamber are calculated by multiplying the hydrostatic pressure by the cross sectional area of the fluid barrier layer fig 10 shows the comparison between the test data and the lateral stability limits given by eqs 53 and 54 while the lateral stability limits given by eq 53 agree well with all the test data it can be seen that eq 54 fails in the prediction of cases 11 15 16 17 it is important to note that in cases 16 and 17 the applied compressive loads are very close to the limit given by eq 53 and much larger than the limit given by eq 54 and yet no failures were triggered this can to some extent evidence that it is reasonable to evaluate the lateral stability limit of a quasi rectangular armor wire by considering its normal direction coinciding with the toroid normal direction thus the fact that the lateral instability failure is more susceptible under flooded annulus condition is not due to the potential armor wire axial rotation instead it is principally due to the decrease of frictional resistance with a smaller frictional resistance the armor wire is capable of more easily sliding in the lateral direction and hence may develop into the lateral instability failure with less bending cycles for the lateral instability of umbilicals constituted of circular armor wires unfortunately no test data is available in the literature to date thus further experimental verification is needed for the present analytcal model for the circular armor wire lateral instability 4 3 design recommendations to investigate how to improve the armor wire layer design against the lateral instability parametric studies are performed using the armor wire properties from an umbilical given by custódio and vaz 2002 see table 3 fig 11 shows the plots of eq 54 with increasing armor wire lay angles and different armor wire cross sectional diameters and fig 12 illustrates the results of eq 54 with increasing armor wire cross sectional diameters and different armor wire lay angles while changing the armor wire parameters the number of armor wires is modified correspondingly to keep the filling factors in both inner and outer armor wire layers approximately fixed from fig 11 it can be seen that for different circular armor wire cross sectional diameters the maximum lateral stability limits are always obtained when the lay angle is approximately 30 35 either increasing or decreasing the lay angle from this value reduces the circular armor wire lateral stability limit besides the results of fig 12 demonstrate that for different armor wire lay angles the umbilical lateral stability limit always increases monotonically with increasing armor wire cross sectional diameters nevertheless it needs to be noted that increasing the circular armor wire cross sectional size increases the umbilical weight and diameter which will in return increase the cost and operational difficulty to modify the circular armor wire size without significantly changing the weight filling factor and total thickness of the armor wire layers a feasible method could be taken by adjusting the number of armor wire layers correspondingly for instance to transform four circular armor wire layers into two circular armor wire layers following the abovementioned principles approximately one quarter of the armor wires with twice cross sectional diameter needs to be employed as illustrated in fig 13 through this method although the number of armor wires decreases the lateral stability limit of each armor wire increases dramatically according to eqs 50a and 54 it can be concluded that by transforming four circular armor wire layers into two circular armor wire layers using the suggested method the umbilical lateral stability limit is nearly quadrupled subsequently the efficiencies of circular and quasi rectangular armor wire cross sections in preventing the lateral instability failure are compared and discussed to transform circular armor wires to quasi rectangular armor wires without significantly changing the weight and filling factor of the armor wire layers the relation between the thickness of the quasi rectangular cross section and the diameter of the circular cross section can be approximately given by h d π 4 meanwhile the width lay angle and number of the quasi rectangular armor wires can be adjusted correspondingly by keeping the filling factor approximately fixed thence transforming the circular armor wires presented in table 3 to quasi rectangular armor wires using the suggested method the lateral stability limits of the armor wires with circular and quasi rectangular cross sections at different lay angles are evaluated respectively by eqs 53 and 54 and compared in fig 14 it can be observed that concerning the prevention of armor wire lateral instability it is more efficient to employ the armor wires with wide quasi rectangular cross sections the wider the quasi rectangular cross section is the larger the axial compressive load the armor wire is capable of withstanding thus for the applications of flexible pipes and umbilicals that large axial compression and significant bending cycles may be encountered it is recommended to employ wide quasi rectangular armor wires if in some applications it is preferable to employ circular armor wires due to available equipment or financial issue large size circular armor wires should be employed 5 conclusions in this work analytical models are formulated for the prediction of lateral stability limit of the armor wires with quasi rectangular or circular cross sections in flexible pipes and umbilicals the present study indicates that the axial rotations of quasi rectangular armor wires are strongly restrained by the contact with adjacent layers and is thus less possible to take place even if a gap is formed in axial compression this conclusion has been to some extent verified by comparing the present analytical models with available test data of flexible pipes on the other hand for circular armor wires it is reasonable to consider them free to rotate axially since the geometric constraint generated by the adjacent layers vanishes for the flexible pipes and umbilicals that may experience large axial compressive loads and bending cycles in their service life it is recommended to apply wide quasi rectangular armor wires rather than circular armor wires concerning the prevention of armor wire lateral instability the wider the quasi rectangular cross section is the larger the lateral stability limit can be obtained if in some applications it is preferable to employ circular armor wires due to available equipment or financial issue the lateral stability limit can be improved by employing the circular armor wires with large cross sectional size note that the present analytical model is based on a periodic instability mode different armor wire instability modes may exist whose effect on the stability limit deserves further investigations besides this model needs to be further improved by considering the stick slip phenomenon of armor wire sliding for the better evaluation of the armor wire lateral instability mechanism in both dry and wet annulus conditions moreover it needs to be noted that the applied perturbation technique may cause errors when large bending curvatures are experienced and large armor wire deflections are generated future study is needed to establish the validated application range for this analytical methodology lastly although the present analytical model for quasi rectangular armor wires has been verified by available test data of flexible pipes no test data regarding the circular armor wire lateral instability in subsea umbilicals is available in the literature thus further experimental verification is needed for the present analytical model concerning the circular armor wire lateral instability acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support from the national council for scientific and

column owc wave energy converter wec is one of the commonly utilized strategies to capture ocean wave energy an owc plant converts wave motion to reciprocating airflow which drives a self rectifying air turbine falcão and henriques 2015 a bidirectional impulse turbine is employed as the power take off pto system to owc because of its wide operating range and better starting characteristics compared to wells turbine setoguchi and takao 2006 as the ocean waves are random and irregular the turbine rotational speed changes according to the sea state affecting the pressure drop and flow rate across the turbine turbine induced damping affects compressibility of air inside the owc chamber and suppresses the motion of the water entrained in the chamber this alters the hydrodynamic performance of the system falcão 2002 kim et al 2001 the steady state performance of the impulse turbine was represented in many literatures liu et al 2017 2016 maeda et al 2001 through experimental and numerical analysis for the oscillating incident flow the quasi steady simulations show a good prediction of turbine characteristics liu et al 2016 however there is a significant difference in the performance of the turbine between acceleration and deceleration of wave ghisu et al 2016 hence the transient analysis is required considering this an unsteady simulation was carried out in the work of pereiras et al 2011 for a radial impulse turbine the passive flow driving model was used to analyze the transient performance of the impulse turbine using k ε closure model liu et al 2018 in the k ε model the production rate of turbulent dissipation p ε depends on the turbulent time scale as the flow approaches the stagnation point in a turbine passage the turbulent time scale becomes large which results in a very small value of turbulent dissipation production this spuriously increases the turbulent kinetic energy near the stagnation point thus the k ε model suffers from a defect called k 3 stagnation point anomaly durbin 1996 permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg and doubly fed induction generator dfig are types of generators that are widely used in wave energy converters however the application of pmsg is increased because of its simple design high torque to current ratio elimination of external excitation and high power factor a study on the operation of different types of generators for owc device was done by o sullivan and lewis 2011 from the study the pmsg was considered superior to other generators in terms of efficient conversion the conventional proportional integral derivative pid controllers are extensively utilized in pmsg control system because of its operational reliability and simplicity li et al 2010 the performance of fractional order pid controller is inconsistent with parameter uncertainty and external load disturbances yinxing et al 2015 this issue is extreme in the case of wec due to random incoming waves to overcome this difficulty nonlinear adaptive controllers or metaheuristic algorithms are used the nonlinear controllers such as feedback linearization mishra et al 2016 sliding mode control smc elgammal 2014 garrido

avoid stagnations in local solutions more operators are needed mirjalili et al 2014 jayabarathi et al 2016 the grouping mechanism in gwo was introduced by yang et al 2017 and it is named as grouped grey wolf optimization ggwo the grey wolves are split into two groups a cooperative hunting group and a random scout group yang et al 2017 the random scout group set out to deeper exploration and to avoid stagnation at local optima the ggwo is used for dfig based wind turbine in order to track the optimal power ggwo has minimum tracking error when compared to conventional methods like genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and moth flame optimization algorithm yang et al 2017 the present paper focuses on the unsteady analysis of the impulse turbine to acquire the turbine characteristics and optimal control design to improve the turbine performance coupled with pmsg based owc wec hence the objectives of this work are to find the aerodynamic performance and best efficiency point of the impulse turbine through urans analysis to tune and search for the optimal gains of the pid controller using grouped grey wolf optimization algorithm to analyze the robustness of the proposed controller under different wave conditions such as regular and irregular waves 2 numerical methodology the turbine geometry was adopted from the work of maeda et al 2001 the geometric specifications of the rotor blade rb and the guide vane gv are given in table 1 the geometry of the impulse turbine with guide vanes is shown in fig 1 the sinusoidal flow condition was used as inlet condition for transient simulations to evaluate the turbine performance the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equation was solved for a compressible ideal gas using a commercial code ansys cfx the k ω sst was used for turbulence closure with γ θ transition model the low reynolds number method was applied to resolve the boundary layer profile and y 2 with wall normal expansion ratio of 1 1 was maintained on blade surfaces computational mesh at the leading edge of the rotor is shown in fig 2 the second order backward euler scheme for time discretization and the high resolution schemes for advection terms were used the transient rotor stator interface was incorporated to simulate the relative motion between the rotor and stator for transient calculations frozen rotor simulations were used as an initial condition residuals were in the order of 10 5 for all simulations a single passage with the periodic boundary conditions was simulated to reduce the computational time the computational domain and the boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 a sinusoidal velocity profile with a turbulent intensity of 5 was given as inlet condition fig 4 an opening boundary condition was imposed at the exit allowing the bidirectional flow the rotational speed was set to 600 rpm and the frequency of the sinusoidal wave was 0 2hz for transient analysis the time step of 2 rotation of turbine was considered hence the time step is 5 10 4 seconds and the total computational time is 5 s the performance of the turbine under steady flow conditions was computed by

components are captured with the increase in time resolution for δt 0 01 s the pressure drop is lower when compared to higher time steps because the higher order unsteadiness is not captured in lower time steps the transient simulation results were compared with the experimental results of under sinusoidally oscillating flow conditions fig 7 shows the comparison of mean efficiency between numerical and experimental data over prediction of mean efficiency occurs at a higher flow coefficient and the maximum deviation from the experimental data 8 the measured uncertainty in efficiency is about 2 3 modeling of pmsg based owc wecs 3 1 modeling of owc wec the owc wec has a hollow chamber open to the waves the chamber creates an air pocket between the inner free surface elevation and turbine duct when the water oscillates inside the chamber a time varying pressure is created due to the action of the wave the air pocket is successively compressed and decompressed forcing the trapped air to flow across the turbine he et al 2013 the modeling of owc includes wave hydrodynamics and chamber hydrodynamics falcão and rodrigues 2002 they are explained below wave hydrodynamics

exploration and exploitation are balanced by swapping the positions between the hunting and scout group according to the current fitness function 4 3 1 prey encircling strategy exploration prey

otherwise it searches for the prey this is formulated as if a 1 the candidate solutions tend to converge to the prey if a 1 solutions diverge from the prey and search for the optimal position mirjalili et al 2014 4 5 random scout group the random scout group strategy set out to deeper exploration and to avoid stagnation at local optima it has only delta wolves δ 2 the scouts δ 2 will

the upper and lower bound of control variables the parameters used in ggwo are adapted from yang et al 2017 5 results and discussion 5 1 transient analysis the non dimensional parameters such as input coefficient c a torque coefficient c t and mean efficiency η obtained from transient simulation are shown in fig 12 the running characteristics of the impulse turbine under sinusoidal airflow condition can be represented by mean efficiency η m 25 η m 1 t 0 t 1 t o e ω d t t 1 t t o i ω d t 1 t 0 t δ p q d t where t 1 and t 2 are the exhalation and inhalation period t oe and t oi represents the exhalation and inhalation torque the peak flow coefficient for sinusoidal air flow is given as 26 φ v a u r where v a is the peak axial velocity the mean efficiency is plotted in fig 12 b the best efficiency point occurs at φ o p t 1 25 and the corresponding mean efficiency is η b e p 0 375 the objective is to maximize the time averaged turbine efficiency hence the turbine power at bep is a function of turbine rotational speed only henriques et al 2016 the axial flow machines are designed to work on a specific performance point since the turbine in the wave energy converters are subjected to a wide range of flow coefficient the off design performance is to be analyzed the deviation from the design point is depicted in figs 13 and 14 by plotting the exit flow angle at te of the rotor against the nominal flow angle β figs 13 and 14 shows the spanwise variation of the exit flow angle for different flow coefficients ϕ the nominal flow angle β at the rotor exit is 60 as the oscillating flow starts the flow coefficient ϕ varies from zero to a maximum at ϕ 0 5the flow angle deviation is high at the mid span because of the passage vortices developed inside the blade passage as the flow coefficient increases flow follows the blade passage and turbine operates near the design condition however the tip leakage losses also increase because of the mixing of casing passage vortex with the tip leakage flow at ϕ 1 25 exit flow angle β follows the nominal flow angle β figs 15 and 16 shows the total pressure loss coefficient at the rotor exit the local total pressure loss coefficient is defined as 27 c l o s s p 0 i n p 0 p 0 i n p e x i t where p 0in is the total pressure at the rotor inlet p 0 is the local total pressure and p exit is the static pressure at the rotor exit the 30 of the span is occupied by the hub passage vortex pv h loss cores and the tip leakage flow losses occupy 10 span the pressure loss coefficient is high for low flow coefficient ϕ 0 5 because of the passage vortices near the casing and the hub these vortices transport the end wall boundary layer flow from ps to ss of the rotor and produce loss cores at the exit of rotor figs 15 and 16 the total pressure loss in the tip region is higher than other span for all flow coefficients at higher flow coefficient tip leakage losses are high figs 14 and 15 due to higher pitchwise pressure gradient the mixing of tip leakage flow with the mainstream accounts for approximately 1 3 of the total aerodynamic loss denton 1993 the viscous dissipation δ from eq 11 is employed to compute the loss generation zones in the blade passage and it is non dimensionalized by the area averaged viscous dissipation at rotor exit schneider et al 2013 28 δ μ e f f u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u i x i u i x j the viscous dissipation at different axial locations within the rotor passage is shown in fig 16 at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 5 passage vortex loss cores start to develop and entrain into the midspan by the radial pressure gradient in the boundary layer the high loss generation rates are observed at the exit of the rotor fig 16 at higher flow coefficient ϕ 1 5 the negative angle of incidence is less and the development of secondary vortices inside the blade passage is significantly reduced however there is a strong interaction between the casing passage vortex and tip leakage flow at the rotor exit fig 17 the axial development of vortical flow structures inside the turbine passage for inhalation and exhalation is shown in video 1 5 2 convergence and statistical analysis of optimization algorithms the box and whisker plots in fig 18 represent the algorithm stability by checking the randomness of solutions the fitness function distribution is compared for different algorithms in 10 runs the proper tradeoff between exploration and exploitation through swapping of positions between hunting and scout group ensures the higher convergence stability for ggwo compared to other algorithms the convergence history for different algorithms is given in fig 19 pso and ga has a better exploration and exploitation ability in the early stages of the iteration process but gets trapped into the local optimum later ggwo has a better ability of exploration through prey encircling mechanism exploitation and escaping from local optimum points by random scout strategy table 2 shows the statistical results of the algorithms the mean and best value of ggwo is smaller than all other algorithms the lowest standard deviation and relative standard deviation indicates higher convergence stability the integral absolute error iae for different algorithms under regular and irregular waves are given in table 3 the simulation time for each case is t 50s and the fitness function is f i a e x t 0 t ω ω r e f i d i d r e f d t it is evident from table 3 that the ggwo achieves lowest iae value for regular and jonswap irregular wave because of better optimal values than other algorithms in precise the iae of ggwo is 40 4 35 4 31 7 and 4 86 lesser than ga pso aipso and gwo for regular wave for irregular waves jonswap the iae of ggwo is 14 65 8 21 22 84 and 22 275 lesser than ga pso aipso and gwo the optimized pid control gains for different algorithms are given in table 4 5 3 performance comparison of algorithms under regular wave h 1m t 10s at first sinusoidal regular waves were used to understand the error dynamics when different tuning algorithm is applied to pid controller fig 20 the control performance of each algorithm is evaluated under a regular wave of h 1m and t 10s the controlled rotational speed ω for different algorithms and the reference rotational speed corresponding to the bep are plotted in fig 20 a the simulation results for regular waves relative to best fit optimal values are obtained the comparison is made based on the accuracy in tracking the reference trajectory a good response is obtained in case of both the rotational speed tracking loop and d axis current loop the speed regulation loop guarantees the maximization of the mean efficiency of the turbine whereas the d axis current regulation emphasis the minimization of reactive power injected to the grid fig 20 b it can be noted that both the iae of speed and current for proposed control is within the acceptable range with minimum value ggwo 4 552 relative to other algorithms ga 7 649 the optimal gains of the proposed algorithm show rapid adaptation of bep tracking compared to other algorithm and maintain the optimal flow coefficient φ 1 25 for the maximum duration of the wave cycle fig 20 d 5 4 performance comparison of ggwo with pid zn under irregular wave hm 0 8m tp 5s it is essential to study the robustness of the controller under different inlet conditions thus the performance of owc wec is evaluated under irregular waves this study helps in determining the power extraction capability of the device for irregular waves the irregular waves are considered as infinite superimposed sinusoidal waves of random height phase and frequency this type of waves can be created using standard models specific to a sea state most of the models use few parameters to represent the sea states into the energy spectrum the sample irregular wave is generated using the jonswap spectrum fig 21 a with a significant height of 0 8m and a peak period of 5s is used fig 21 b shows the inner surface elevation inside the chamber due to incoming irregular wave that causes the difference in pressure across the turbine this produces the mass flow rate across the turbine as well the axial velocity fig 21 c depends on the geometry of the owc and frequency of the incoming wave in this case the proposed algorithm ggwo tuned controller produces optimum results by driving the turbine near the optimum speed ω ref fig 22 a the speed error is minimum comparatively with other tuning algorithm fig 22 c the proposed controller ggwo tuned maintains a mean φ 1 2693 fig 22 d for the time series of 40s whereas an uncontrolled owc device would operate at a φ 0 4371 for the same test irregular wave the mean flow coefficient for ga is φ 1 415 for pso φ 1 5175 for aipso φ 1 5175 and for gwo φ 1 3080 losses associated in operation at different flow coefficient are stated in section 5 1 thus it can be clearly observed that the proposed ggwo tuned pid controller operates close to the optimal φ for the entire time series the power quality to the grid can be improved by limiting the peak to average power ratio henriques et al 2016 the high peak to average power ratio implies that the turbine is operating in high flow coefficients at high energetic sea state the ggwo has a lower peak to average power ratio than other algorithms under both regular and irregular wave conditions table 5 to study the effectiveness of the rotor speed control the optimized controller was compared with the conventionally tuned pid under irregular wave generated using the jonswap spectrum the pid gains are tuned using ziegler nichols experimental method ziegler and nichols 1942 and compared with ggwo tuned pid as shown in fig 23 the test irregular wave in fig 21 a has a higher energetic region for a duration between 30s and 40s for the test irregular wave maximum axial velocity can reach up to 10 m s fig 21 b and the corresponding differential pressure δp can reach maximum up to 1 kpa during exhalation and 1 5 kpa during inhalation when the turbine is operated near the optimum speed the δp decreases fig 23 c the maximum reference speed can reach up to 100 rad s at the high energetic region ggwo tuned controller drives the turbine near the optimum speed ω ref and the speed error is minimum compared to the pid zn controller fig 23 a g the maximum speed error in ggwo tuned pid is 40 rad s whereas in pid zn is 100 rad s at high energetic state fig 23 g for ggwo tuned pid the mean flow coefficient is φ 1 2693 whereas for pid zn φ 1 1017 this shows fig 23 d that the proposed controller operates near the optimum flow coefficient reactive and active power control was achieved by controlling d axis and q axis current components respectively fig 23 e shows the direct current i d error ggwo tuned pid has lesser i d error compared to pid zn at higher energetic sea state hence for the proposed controller the direct current controlled reactive power is minimized fig 23 f the dimensionless blade loading coefficient is defined as ψ δ c u u r the low rotational speed indicates that the blade loading is high it is evident from fig 23 h legend of fig 23 h is same as fig 23 g the ggwo tuned controller produces higher torque compared to pid zn since the proposed controller drives the turbine near the optimum speed ω ref fig 23 i shows the variation of differential pressure versus flow rate the closed curve depicts the damping of the turbine to the airflow through the chamber the turbine aerodynamic efficiency and wave energy absorption are closely related through the turbine rotational speed the broader loop symbolizes the loss of energy in the work of compression sarmento et al 1990 the comparison of the proposed controller is made with the uncontrolled case to show the efficiency improvement and reduction in peak to average power ratio from fig 24 it is clear that the rotational speed of uncontrolled owc wec is much higher than that of reference speed which indicates that the turbine will not operate in its optimal flow coefficient thus operate at low efficiency and high peak to average power ratio the turbine efficiency for different controllers under regular and irregular conditions is given in table 6 the ggwo based controller increases the turbine efficiency to a maximum of 61 5 and 4 compared to the uncontrolled and pid zn controlled case respectively 6 conclusion the bi directional impulse turbine was simulated by urans method and the best efficiency point was predicted the rotor speed control strategy has been proposed to operate the turbine near the bep the best efficiency point predicted by the urans simulation can be used as a reference to all controllers for maximum efficiency tracking the conclusions are the urans analysis shows that the bep occurs at φ 1 25 because of the better balance between incidence and tip leakage losses ggwo algorithm is applied on wave energy converter for the best efficiency point tracking of an impulse turbine working under regular and irregular sea states results show that ggwo works with the minimum tracking error when compared to ga pso aipso and gwo the ggwo based controller increases efficiency by 61 5 and 4 compared to the uncontrolled and conventionally controlled case respectively it limits the peak to average power ratio by 38 6 compared to the uncontrolled case the controller robustness is tested for regular and irregular sea states for a wave climate common in the east coast of india

particle swarm optimization oscillating water column bi directional impulse turbine unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations grouped grey wolf optimizer 1 introduction oscillating water column owc wave energy converter wec is one of the commonly utilized strategies to capture ocean wave energy an owc plant converts wave motion to reciprocating airflow which drives a self rectifying air turbine falcão and henriques 2015 a bidirectional impulse turbine is employed as the power take off pto system to owc because of its wide operating range and better starting characteristics compared to wells turbine setoguchi and takao 2006 as the ocean waves are random and irregular the turbine rotational speed changes according to the sea state affecting the pressure drop and flow rate across the turbine turbine induced damping affects compressibility of air inside the owc chamber and suppresses the motion of the water entrained in the chamber this alters the hydrodynamic performance of the system falcão 2002 kim et al 2001 the steady state performance of the impulse turbine was represented in many literatures liu et al 2017 2016 maeda et al 2001 through experimental and numerical analysis for the oscillating incident flow the quasi steady simulations show a good prediction of turbine characteristics liu et al 2016 however there is a significant difference in the performance of the turbine between acceleration and deceleration of wave ghisu et al 2016 hence the transient analysis is required considering this an unsteady simulation was carried out in the work of pereiras et al 2011 for a radial impulse turbine the passive flow driving model was used to analyze the transient performance of the impulse turbine using k ε closure model liu et al 2018 in the k ε model the production rate of turbulent dissipation p ε depends on the turbulent time scale as the flow approaches the stagnation point in a turbine passage the turbulent time scale becomes large which results in a very small value of turbulent dissipation production this spuriously increases the turbulent kinetic energy near the stagnation point thus the k ε model suffers from a defect called k 3 stagnation point anomaly durbin 1996 permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg and doubly fed induction generator dfig are types of generators that are widely used in wave energy converters however the application of pmsg is increased because of its simple design high torque to current ratio elimination of external excitation and high power factor a study on the operation of different types of generators for owc device was done by o sullivan and lewis 2011 from the study the pmsg was considered superior to other generators in terms of efficient conversion the conventional proportional integral derivative pid controllers are extensively utilized in pmsg control system because of its operational reliability and simplicity li et al 2010 the performance of fractional order pid controller is inconsistent with parameter uncertainty and external load disturbances yinxing et al 2015 this issue is extreme in the case of wec due to random incoming waves to overcome this difficulty nonlinear adaptive controllers or metaheuristic algorithms are used the nonlinear controllers such as feedback linearization mishra et al 2016 sliding mode control smc elgammal 2014 garrido et al 2012 backstepping mishra et al 2018 are realized for owc device with wells turbine and dfig a wide variety of metaheuristic algorithms inspired by biological evolution or animals has been proposed to solve the complex engineering problems particle swarm optimization pso and fractional particle swarm optimization fpso were used to enhance the performance of dfig controllers through tuning of pi parameters under regular wave condition mzoughi et al 2017 one of the latest bio inspired techniques called grey wolf optimization gwo mimicking the hierarchy of grey wolves was proposed in the work of mirjalili et al 2014 the gwo has inherent advantages over other heuristic algorithms such as i appropriate tradeoff between exploration and exploitation ii efficient global convergence iii efficient performance in an unknown environment however in the gwo algorithm prey encircling mechanism exhibits exploration to some extent for the deeper exploration of global optimal point and to avoid stagnations in local solutions more operators are needed mirjalili et al 2014 jayabarathi et al 2016 the grouping mechanism in gwo was introduced by yang et al 2017 and it is named as grouped grey wolf optimization ggwo the grey wolves are split into two groups a cooperative hunting group and a random scout group yang et al 2017 the random scout group set out to deeper exploration and to avoid stagnation at local optima the ggwo is used for dfig based wind turbine in order to track the optimal power ggwo has minimum tracking error when compared to conventional methods like genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso and moth flame optimization algorithm yang et al 2017 the present paper focuses on the unsteady analysis of the impulse turbine to acquire the turbine characteristics and optimal control design to improve the turbine performance coupled with pmsg based owc wec hence the objectives of this work are to find the aerodynamic performance and best efficiency point of the impulse turbine through urans analysis to tune and search for the optimal gains of the pid controller using grouped grey wolf optimization algorithm to analyze the robustness of the proposed controller under different wave conditions such as regular and irregular waves 2 numerical methodology the turbine geometry was adopted from the work of maeda et al 2001 the geometric specifications of the rotor blade rb and the guide vane gv are given in table 1 the geometry of the impulse turbine with guide vanes is shown in fig 1 the sinusoidal flow condition was used as inlet condition for transient simulations to evaluate the turbine performance the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equation was solved for a compressible ideal gas using a commercial code ansys cfx the k ω sst was used for turbulence closure with γ θ transition model the low reynolds number method was applied to resolve the boundary layer profile and y 2 with wall normal expansion ratio of 1 1 was maintained on blade surfaces computational mesh at the leading edge of the rotor is shown in fig 2 the second order backward euler scheme for time discretization and the high resolution schemes for advection terms were used the transient rotor stator interface was incorporated to simulate the relative motion between the rotor and stator for transient calculations frozen rotor simulations were used as an initial condition residuals were in the order of 10 5 for all simulations a single passage with the periodic boundary conditions was simulated to reduce the computational time the computational domain and the boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 a sinusoidal velocity profile with a turbulent intensity of 5 was given as inlet condition fig 4 an opening boundary condition was imposed at the exit allowing the bidirectional flow the rotational speed was set to 600 rpm and the frequency of the sinusoidal wave was 0 2hz for transient analysis the time step of 2 rotation of turbine was considered hence the time step is 5 10 4 seconds and the total computational time is 5 s the performance of the turbine under steady flow conditions was computed by the following non dimensional parameters 1 input coefficient c a 2 δ p q ρ a v a 2 u r 2 b l r z v a 2 torque coefficient c t 2 t o ρ a v a 2 u r 2 b l r z r r 3 flow coefficient ϕ v a u r 4

locations fig 5 were compared and the difference in velocity profiles between 4 million and 2 million elements was indistinct time step independent study is shown in fig 6 the higher harmonic components are captured with the increase in time resolution for δt 0 01 s the pressure drop is lower when compared to higher time steps because the higher order unsteadiness is not captured in lower time steps the transient simulation results were compared with the experimental results of under sinusoidally oscillating flow conditions fig 7 shows the comparison of mean efficiency between numerical and experimental data over prediction of mean efficiency occurs at a higher flow coefficient and the maximum deviation from the experimental data 8 the measured uncertainty in efficiency is about 2 3 modeling of pmsg based owc wecs 3 1 modeling of owc wec the owc wec has a hollow chamber open to the waves the chamber creates an air pocket between the inner free surface elevation and turbine duct when the water oscillates inside the chamber a time varying pressure is created due to the action of the wave the air pocket is successively compressed and decompressed forcing the trapped air to flow across the turbine he et al 2013 the modeling of owc includes wave hydrodynamics and chamber hydrodynamics falcão and rodrigues 2002 they are explained below wave hydrodynamics since the ocean waves are random in nature it is necessary to analyze the turbine performance under irregular flow conditions jonswap spectrum is used to simulate deep ocean waves the development of

flow coefficient φ opt the variations in the rotor speed sway the aerodynamic efficiency of the turbine the turbine rotational speed controls the flow rate and the pressure drop it induces damping on the air spring and influences the motion of water entrained in the capture chamber henriques et al 2016 hence it influences the hydrodynamic efficiency of the chamber the rotational speed of pmsg is controlled through a machine side converter consisting of back to back voltage source converter vsc the grid side converter maintains the dc link voltage and delivers the generated active power to the grid through dc link the reference reactive power q ref is kept zero for unit power factor the difference between measured reactive power q s and q ref is given to the pid controller to generate the q axis reference current i qref the control scheme is given in fig 9 4 1 control problem the primary problem associated with wave energy turbines is rapid variations in the speed due to wave action the rotational speed control through generator side vsc should respond quickly to these rapid turbine inlet velocity variations in order to get better dynamic performance pid gains must be well tuned

percentage of success is used to observe the search status of the swarm at every iteration and the inertia weights are adapted dynamically nickabadi et al 2011 a low success percentage represents the exploration of global optimum and not converging a high success percentage implies the convergence of particles towards the optimum point the success value for the ith particle at iteration k is given

coefficient vectors a and c the encircling coefficient vector a is linearly decreased from 2 to 0 over the course of iteration and r 1 r 2 are random vectors in 0 1 4 3 2 hunting group strategy exploration the hunting operation will be performed by cooperative hunting group guided by α in the search space the location of the optimum prey is unknown the alpha first best solution beta and delta have adequate information about the possible prey position the ω wolves will update their position according to the positions of α β and δ wolves the equations of hunting strategy are yang et al

4 attacking the prey exploitation the value of encircling coefficient vector a is linearly varied from 2 to 0 over the iteration when the wolves are in the circle of the prey wolves attack the prey otherwise it searches for the prey this is formulated as if a 1 the candidate solutions tend to converge to the prey if a 1 solutions diverge from the prey and search for the optimal position mirjalili et al 2014 4 5 random scout group the random scout group strategy set out to deeper exploration and to avoid stagnation at local optima it has only delta wolves δ 2 the scouts δ 2 will randomly search for prey and its position is swapped with cooperative hunting group the scout position can be updated as yang et al 2017 24 x t 1 x p t r δ 2 r δ 2 is a random scout vector limits in the upper and lower bound of control variables the parameters used in ggwo are adapted from yang et al 2017 5 results and discussion 5 1 transient analysis the non dimensional parameters such as input coefficient c a torque coefficient c t and mean efficiency η obtained from transient simulation are shown in fig 12 the running characteristics of the impulse turbine under sinusoidal airflow condition can be represented by mean efficiency η m 25 η m 1 t 0 t 1 t o e ω d t t 1 t t o i ω d t 1 t 0 t δ p q d t where t 1 and t 2 are the exhalation and inhalation period t oe and t oi represents the exhalation and inhalation torque the peak flow coefficient for sinusoidal air flow is given as 26 φ v a u r where v a is the peak axial velocity the mean efficiency is plotted in fig 12 b the best efficiency point occurs at φ o p t 1 25 and the corresponding mean efficiency is η b e p 0 375 the objective is to maximize the time averaged turbine efficiency hence the turbine power at bep is a function of turbine rotational speed only henriques et al 2016 the axial flow machines are designed to work on a specific performance point since the turbine in the wave energy converters are subjected to a wide range of flow coefficient the off design performance is to be analyzed the deviation from the design point is depicted in figs 13 and 14 by plotting the exit flow angle at te of the rotor against the nominal flow angle β figs 13 and 14 shows the spanwise variation of the exit flow angle for different flow coefficients ϕ the nominal flow angle β at the rotor exit is 60 as the oscillating flow starts the flow coefficient ϕ varies from zero to a maximum at ϕ 0 5the flow angle deviation is high at the mid span because of the passage vortices developed inside the blade passage as the flow coefficient increases flow follows the blade passage and turbine operates near the design condition however the tip leakage losses also increase because of the mixing of casing passage vortex with the tip leakage flow at ϕ 1 25 exit flow angle β follows the nominal flow angle β figs 15 and 16 shows the total pressure loss coefficient at the rotor exit the local total pressure loss coefficient is defined as 27 c l o s s p 0 i n p 0 p 0 i n p e x i t where p 0in is the total pressure at the rotor inlet p 0 is the local total pressure and p exit is the static pressure at the rotor exit the 30 of the span is occupied by the hub passage vortex pv h loss cores and the tip leakage flow losses occupy 10 span the pressure loss coefficient is high for low flow coefficient ϕ 0 5 because of the passage vortices near the casing and the hub these vortices transport the end wall boundary layer flow from ps to ss of the rotor and produce loss cores at the exit of rotor figs 15 and 16 the total pressure loss in the tip region is higher than other span for all flow coefficients at higher flow coefficient tip leakage losses are high figs 14 and 15 due to higher pitchwise pressure gradient the mixing of tip leakage flow with the mainstream accounts for approximately 1 3 of the total aerodynamic loss denton 1993 the viscous dissipation δ from eq 11 is employed to compute the loss generation zones in the blade passage and it is non dimensionalized by the area averaged viscous dissipation at rotor exit schneider et al 2013 28 δ μ e f f u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u i x i u i x j the viscous dissipation at different axial locations within the rotor passage is shown in fig 16 at low flow coefficient ϕ 0 5 passage vortex loss cores start to develop and entrain into the midspan by the radial pressure gradient in the boundary layer the high loss generation rates are observed at the exit of the rotor fig 16 at higher flow coefficient ϕ 1 5 the negative angle of incidence is less and the development of secondary vortices inside the blade passage is significantly reduced however there is a strong interaction between the casing passage vortex and tip leakage flow at the rotor exit fig 17 the axial development of vortical flow structures inside the turbine passage for inhalation and exhalation is shown in video 1 5 2 convergence and statistical analysis of optimization algorithms the box and whisker plots in fig 18 represent the algorithm stability by checking the randomness of solutions the fitness function distribution is compared for different algorithms in 10 runs the proper tradeoff between exploration and exploitation through swapping of positions between hunting and scout group ensures the higher convergence stability for ggwo compared to other algorithms the convergence history for different algorithms is given in fig 19 pso and ga has a better exploration and exploitation ability in the early stages of the iteration process but gets trapped into the local optimum later ggwo has a better ability of exploration through prey encircling mechanism exploitation and escaping from local optimum points by random scout strategy table 2 shows the statistical results of the algorithms the mean and best value of ggwo is smaller than all other algorithms the lowest standard deviation and relative standard deviation indicates higher convergence stability the integral absolute error iae for different algorithms under regular and irregular waves are given in table 3 the simulation time for each case is t 50s and the fitness function is f i a e x t 0 t ω ω r e f i d i d r e f d t it is evident from table 3 that the ggwo achieves lowest iae value for regular and jonswap irregular wave because of better optimal values than other algorithms in precise the iae of ggwo is 40 4 35 4 31 7 and 4 86 lesser than ga pso aipso and gwo for regular wave for irregular waves jonswap the iae of ggwo is 14 65 8 21 22 84 and 22 275 lesser than ga pso aipso and gwo the optimized pid control gains for different algorithms are given in table 4 5 3 performance comparison of algorithms under regular wave h 1m t 10s at first sinusoidal regular waves were used to understand the error dynamics when different tuning algorithm is applied to pid controller fig 20 the control performance of each algorithm is evaluated under a regular wave of h 1m and t 10s the controlled rotational speed ω for different algorithms and the reference rotational speed corresponding to the bep are plotted in fig 20 a the simulation results for regular waves relative to best fit optimal values are obtained the comparison is made based on the accuracy in tracking the reference trajectory a good response is obtained in case of both the rotational speed tracking loop and d axis current loop the speed regulation loop guarantees the maximization of the mean efficiency of the turbine whereas the d axis current regulation emphasis the minimization of reactive power injected to the grid fig 20 b it can be noted that both the iae of speed and current for proposed control is within the acceptable range with minimum value ggwo 4 552 relative to other algorithms ga 7 649 the optimal gains of the proposed algorithm show rapid adaptation of bep tracking compared to other algorithm and maintain the optimal flow coefficient φ 1 25 for the maximum duration of the wave cycle fig 20 d 5 4 performance comparison of ggwo with pid zn under irregular wave hm 0 8m tp 5s it is essential to study the robustness of the controller under different inlet conditions thus the performance of owc wec is evaluated under irregular waves this study helps in determining the power extraction capability of the device for irregular waves the irregular waves are considered as infinite superimposed sinusoidal waves of random height phase and frequency this type of waves can be created using standard models specific to a sea state most of the models use few parameters to represent the sea states into the energy spectrum the sample irregular wave is generated using the jonswap spectrum fig 21 a with a significant height of 0 8m and a peak period of 5s is used fig 21 b shows the inner surface elevation inside the chamber due to incoming irregular wave that causes the difference in pressure across the turbine this produces the mass flow rate across the turbine as well the axial velocity fig 21 c depends on the geometry of the owc and frequency of the incoming wave in this case the proposed algorithm ggwo tuned controller produces optimum results by driving the turbine near the optimum speed ω ref fig 22 a the speed error is minimum comparatively with other tuning algorithm fig 22 c the proposed controller ggwo tuned maintains a mean φ 1 2693 fig 22 d for the time series of 40s whereas an uncontrolled owc device would operate at a φ 0 4371 for the same test irregular wave the mean flow coefficient for ga is φ 1 415 for pso φ 1 5175 for aipso φ 1 5175 and for gwo φ 1 3080 losses associated in operation at different flow coefficient are stated in section 5 1 thus it can be clearly observed that the proposed ggwo tuned pid controller operates close to the optimal φ for the entire time series the power quality to the grid can be improved by limiting the peak to average power ratio henriques et al 2016 the high peak to average power ratio implies that the turbine is operating in high flow coefficients at high energetic sea state the ggwo has a lower peak to average power ratio than other algorithms under both regular and irregular wave conditions table 5 to study the effectiveness of the rotor speed control the optimized controller was compared with the conventionally tuned pid under irregular wave generated using the jonswap spectrum the pid gains are tuned using ziegler nichols experimental method ziegler and nichols 1942 and compared with ggwo tuned pid as shown in fig 23 the test irregular wave in fig 21 a has a higher energetic region for a duration between 30s and 40s for the test irregular wave maximum axial velocity can reach up to 10 m s fig 21 b and the corresponding differential pressure δp can reach maximum up to 1 kpa during exhalation and 1 5 kpa during inhalation when the turbine is operated near the optimum speed the δp decreases fig 23 c the maximum reference speed can reach up to 100 rad s at the high energetic region ggwo tuned controller drives the turbine near the optimum speed ω ref and the speed error is minimum compared to the pid zn controller fig 23 a g the maximum speed error in ggwo tuned pid is 40 rad s whereas in pid zn is 100 rad s at high energetic state fig 23 g for ggwo tuned pid the mean flow coefficient is φ 1 2693 whereas for pid zn φ 1 1017 this shows fig 23 d that the proposed controller operates near the optimum flow coefficient reactive and active power control was achieved by controlling d axis and q axis current components respectively fig 23 e shows the direct current i d error ggwo tuned pid has lesser i d error compared to pid zn at higher energetic sea state hence for the proposed controller the direct current controlled reactive power is minimized fig 23 f the dimensionless blade loading coefficient is defined as ψ δ c u u r the low rotational speed indicates that the blade loading is high it is evident from fig 23 h legend of fig 23 h is same as fig 23 g the ggwo tuned controller produces higher torque compared to pid zn since the proposed controller drives the turbine near the optimum speed ω ref fig 23 i shows the variation of differential pressure versus flow rate the closed curve depicts the damping of the turbine to the airflow through the chamber the turbine aerodynamic efficiency and wave energy absorption are closely related through the turbine rotational speed the broader loop symbolizes the loss of energy in the work of compression sarmento et al 1990 the comparison of the proposed controller is made with the uncontrolled case to show the efficiency improvement and reduction in peak to average power ratio from fig 24 it is clear that the rotational speed of uncontrolled owc wec is much higher than that of reference speed which indicates that the turbine will not operate in its optimal flow coefficient thus operate at low efficiency and high peak to average power ratio the turbine efficiency for different controllers under regular and irregular conditions is given in table 6 the ggwo based controller increases the turbine efficiency to a maximum of 61 5 and 4 compared to the uncontrolled and pid zn controlled case respectively 6 conclusion the bi directional impulse turbine was simulated by urans method and the best efficiency point was predicted the rotor speed control strategy has been proposed to operate the turbine near the bep the best efficiency point predicted by the urans simulation can be used as a reference to all controllers for maximum efficiency tracking the conclusions are the urans analysis shows that the bep occurs at φ 1 25 because of the better balance between incidence and tip leakage losses ggwo algorithm is applied on wave energy converter for the best efficiency point tracking of an impulse turbine working under regular and irregular sea states results show that ggwo works with the minimum tracking error when compared to ga pso aipso and gwo the ggwo based controller increases efficiency by 61 5 and 4 compared to the uncontrolled and conventionally controlled case respectively it limits the peak to average power ratio by 38 6 compared to the uncontrolled case the controller robustness is tested for regular and irregular sea states for a wave climate common in the east coast of india
