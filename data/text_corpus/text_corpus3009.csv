15045,geosmin synthase geoa and 2 mib cyclase mic are key biosynthetic genes responsible for the production of taste and odour t o compounds geosmin and 2 mib these t o compounds are becoming an increasing global problem for drinking water supplies it is thought that geosmin and 2 mib may be linked to or exacerbated by a variety of different environmental and nutrient triggers however to the best of our knowledge no studies to date have evaluated the combined effects of seasonality temperature and nutrient concentrations on geoa and mic copy numbers in conjunction with t o concentrations in this study environmental triggers behind geosmin and 2 mib production were investigated in nine reservoirs across wales u k between july 2019 august 2020 the abundance of geoa and mic were quantified through quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr temporal changes in geoa and geosmin concentrations revealed geoa to be an indicator of monthly geosmin concentrations although only when geosmin concentrations exceeded 100 ng l 1 model analysis of a reservoir with elevated geosmin concentrations revealed geoa to be significantly associated with mean temperature p 0 001 and the nutrients dissolved reactive silicate p 0 001 dissolved iron p 0 001 total inorganic nitrogen to phosphorous ratio tin tp p 0 001 and ammonium to nitrate ratio nh4 no3 p 0 001 sulphate also demonstrated a significant positive linear relationship with geoa p 0 001 for mic analysis nh4 no3 was significantly associated with mic p 0 05 and an association with dissolved reactive silicate was also observed p 0 084 within this study we also report extreme variance in gene copy numbers between the study seasons no consistent relationship could be determined for mic copy numbers ml 1 and 2 mib ng l 1 the findings from this study indicate that tin tp and nh4 no3 serve as good predictors for elevated geoa and mic along with negative linear relationships observed for mean temperature and dissolved reactive silicate overall our findings demonstrate the importance of nutrient concentrations nutrient ratios and temperature for evidence based predictive capacity of taste and odour events

taste and odour data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction taste and odour t o are the primary sensory considerations used by customers to assess the quality of drinking water kehoe et al 2015 odorous or unpalatable t o compounds in treated drinking water can erode customer trust in water quality and generate complaints to water companies worldwide webber et al 2015 although these compounds pose no risk to human health sotero martins et al 2021 significant costly treatment of drinking water is required to remove them adsorption by activated carbon is considered an effective measure in the removal of t o compounds kim et al 2014 however rodriguez 2018 estimated that to remove 15 ng l 1 of a t o compound at a flow rate of 40 million gallons per day 5077 kg of powdered activated carbon pac would be required with pac having a market cost of around 1 2 2 kg 1 alhashimi and aktas 2017 this is very costly geosmin trans 1 10 dimethyl trans 9 decalol and 2 mib 2 methylisoborneol are the most common compounds associated with t o complaints worldwide clercin and druschel 2019 echenique et al 2006 hayes and burch 1989 menezes et al 2020 perkins et al 2019 van rensburg et al 2016 these compounds are produced by a variety of distantly related bacteria including actinobacteria cyanobacteria and proteobacteria watson 2003 but cyanobacteria are considered to be the main producers of the volatile t o compounds in aquatic environments suurnäkki et al 2015 cyanobacteria have also established important connections with other phytoplankton for example bar yosef et al 2010 revealed a close relationship between other phytoplankton capable of alkaline phosphatase ap production and the cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin this cyanotoxin stimulates algae to produce aps used to access orthophosphate from organic phosphorous which in turn facilitates cyanobacterial growth bar yosef et al 2010 this is supported by olsen et al 2017 who suggested that specifically diatoms influence geosmin and 2 mib production as demonstrated by stronger correlations between 2 mib production and diatom abundance as compared to cyanobacterial abundance this is consistent with previous findings that link diatoms with the proliferation of geosmin and 2 mib izaguirre and taylor 1998 schrader et al 2011 sugiura et al 2004 1998 geosmin and 2 mib exist as an irregular sesquiterpenoid and a monoterpene respectively watson and juttner 2019 geosmin and 2 mib are produced along the metabolic pathways for isoprenoid synthesis involved in the 2 methylerythritol 4 phosphate isoprenoid mep pathway the mevalonate pathway and the leucine pathway jüttner and watson 2007 the molecular foundation of geosmin production is from the geosmin synthase gene geoa which encodes for a bi functional domain enzyme in a two step mg2 dependant reaction churro et al 2020 the n terminal part of the enzyme causes the ionization and cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate fpp into germacradienol whilst the c terminal part facilitates the protonation cyclization and fragmentation of the precursor germacradienol molecules into geosmin and acetone watson et al 2016 for the biosynthesis of 2 mib in cyanobacteria there are two metabolic steps firstly a s adenosylmethionine dependant methylation of the monoterpene precursor geranyl diphosphate gpp to 2 methyl gpp catalysed by geranyl diphosphate 2 methyltransferase gppmt and secondly further cyclization of 2 methyl gpp to 2 mib catalysed by 2 mib cyclase mic forming a putative operon fig 2 giglio et al 2011 discovery of the geoa and mic genes has enabled biomolecular methods like quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr to become available to monitor their abundance cane and watt 2003 dickschat et al 2007 giglio et al 2011 gust et al 2003 komatsu et al 2008 wang and cane 2008 however to the best of our knowledge no primers currently developed target all geosmin and 2 mib producing cyanobacteria geosmin and 2 mib are recalcitrant to conventional drinking water treatment procedures such as clarification filtration and oxidation using chlorine srinivasan and sorial 2011 with both compounds exhibiting extremely low odour thresholds 1 3 ng l 1 for geosmin and 6 3 ng l 1 for 2 mib young et al 1996 it is of vital importance that water companies remove the source of these compounds through mitigative measures before proceeding to water treatment in order to avoid customer dissatisfaction and ultimately complaints this is of particular concern considering that climate change can promote cyanobacterial bloom formation which in turn has the potential to lead to more t o events worldwide davis et al 2009 taranu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 warming can selectively encourage cyanobacterial growth as they have higher optimal growth temperatures compared to eukaryotic algae zhang et al 2017 shen et al 2022 found that warmer temperatures favored cyanobacterial growth leading to an increase in t o compounds however lower temperatures 15 c have also been shown to promote the expression levels of geoa and mic genes compared to 25 c and 35 c shen et al 2022 jeong et al 2021 reported that pseudanabaena yagii produced 2 mib during the summer season and released 2 mib under low temperature conditions in the autumn many studies have focused on the environmental triggers for geosmin and 2 mib production saadoun et al 2001 journey et al 2013 oh et al 2017 clercin and druschel 2019 individual studies have focused on geoa and mic copy numbers in relation to seasonal occurrences of benthic production of geosmin and 2 mib gaget et al 2020 the transcription of the genes in response to temperature shen et al 2022 and developing early detection methods chiu et al 2016 john et al 2018 suurnäkki et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no studies to date have evaluated the combined effects of seasonality temperature and nutrient concentrations on geoa and mic copy numbers together kutovaya and watson 2014 developed taxon specific pcr and qpcr assays for the early detection of geosmin however they were unable to determine any correlations between gene expression temperature and nutrient concentrations usual nutrients implicated in the production of geosmin and 2 mib are nitrogen and phosphorous harris et al 2016 further molot et al 2014 proposed a critical role of ferrous iron and sulphate for cyanobacterial bloom formation yet neither ferrous iron nor sulphate have been evaluated in relation to geosmin and 2 mib production before here we assess the associations between seasonality temperature and nutrients and the production of geosmin and 2 mib in reservoir drinking water we employ quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr to quantify the gene abundance of geoa and mic in nine reservoirs across wales u k using a newly developed reverse mic primer to aid the detection of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria findings are discussed with relevance to triggers for and prediction of t o events in drinking water supply 2 materials and methods 2 1 defining a t o event for geosmin customer complaints start at 7 ng l 1 and for 2 mib customer complaints start at 12 ng l 1 simpson and macleod 1991 according to dŵr cymru welsh water increased sampling frequency on reservoir water begins when geosmin is 5 ng l 1 and 2 mib is 2 5 ng l 1 when concentrations are 10 ng l 1 for geosmin and 5 ng l 1 for 2 mib granular activated carbon gac filters are turned on if the drinking water treatment works have the facilities if no gac is present powdered activated carbon pac dosing at low levels commences and customer complaints are checked daily reversion back to normal operation is only authorised once at least 3 samples are below 10 ng l 1 for geosmin and 5 ng l 1 for 2 mib for the purposes of this study an event is defined as a concentration measurement 10 ng l 1 for geosmin and 5 ng l 1 for 2 mib 2 2 sample locations between

1st may 31st summer june 1st august 31st autumn september 1st november 30th and winter december 1st february 28th two gams were performed for the response variable geoa 16s copies ml 1 the first only included data from reservoir 1 the second all other 8 reservoirs with an additional explanatory variable of reservoir reservoir 1 was modelled independently from other reservoirs as this reservoir was the only one to experience high geosmin concentrations according to the gc msms data reservoir was re levelled to have the reference reservoir as reservoir 5 as this was the reservoir with the lowest range of gesomin concentrations for the response variable mic 16s copies ml 1 one gam included all 9 reservoirs with an additional explanatory variable of reservoir reservoir 5 was again the reference level as this was the reservoir with the lowest range of 2 mib concentrations the decision to use nutrient ratios nh4 no3 and tin tp was chosen as opposed to using concentrations of nutrients tp nox nh4 tin by comparing model fit and efficiency using akaike information criterion aic from models containing either nutrient fractions or nutrient ratios to avoid multicollinearity nutrient ratios produced a better model fit and explained a greater variation in the data than using actual concentrations of nutrients in question explanatory variables were selected according to the aic using a

were not found to be significantly non linearly associated with mic 16s copy numbers ml 1 up to concentrations of 8 ng l 1 as depicted by the horizontal estimated smooth function in appendix d 5a nh4 no3 had a significantly non linear relationship with mic 16s copy numbers ml 1 p 0 1 showing a positive trend with low ratios of nh4 no3 between 0 00 0 07 and at higher ratios 0 18 appendix d 5b an inhibitory effect of nh4 no3 on mic 16s copy numbers ml 1 was observed between 0 07 0 18 4 discussion this is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate variations in geoa and mic abundance between different seasons this is also the first study to report the associations between iron sulphate and dissolved reactive silicate with geoa and mic copy numbers in relation to t o levels significant correlations were determined between geoa and geosmin concentrations by month and by season whereas no relationships could be deduced from correlations observed between mic and 2 mib concentrations by month or by season geoa was deemed to be a suitable indicator of geosmin concentrations but only when geosmin concentrations were elevated 100 ng l 1 as seen in reservoir 1 from this study indicators of heightened geoa abundance between reservoirs experiencing elevated geosmin concentrations and non elevated concentration were negative linear relationships with mean temperature and dissolved reactive silicate both nutrient ratios tin tp and nh4 no3 were significantly associated with the abundance of geoa tin tp generally had the greatest effect on geoa abundance at low ratios with inhibitory effects witnessed at intermediate levels for tin tp ratios which were suppressed at higher tin tp ratios model analysis also revealed that when nh4 no3 ratios were high geoa abundance was also high in addition the positive linear relationships between sulphate and dissolved iron with geoa in a reservoir experiencing geosmin events should not be ignored although no correlations between mic and 2 mib concentrations could be determined model analysis revealed the significance of a negative linear relationship with mic and dissolved reactive silicate and a smoothed relationship with nh4 no3 a limitation of this study was the frequency of sampling monthly which was a constraint of the water industry project paerl et al 2022 demonstrated that a large change in geosmin concentration can occur on a week to week basis during spring summer and pochiraju et al 2021 reported that geosmin concentration may decline by 12 within a week hence monthly monitoring may miss significant spikes in geoa and geosmin concentrations similarly monthly monitoring of mic and 2 mib may miss spikes in 2 mib concentrations or the resuspension of underlying sediment containing cyanobacterial species containing the mic gene it is therefore suggested that weekly or at least biweekly monitoring should be implemented by water companies to facilitate suitable accuracy in predictive capacity 4 1 triggers of geosmin events of the nine reservoirs studied reservoir 1 showed the most elevated geosmin concentrations considered to be significant events and hence was chosen for modelling triggers of geoa prevalence relating to geosmin concentrations findings from this study identified geoa to be a suitable indicator of geosmin concentrations although significant correlations were only apparent when geosmin concentrations had a large range with high maximum concentrations 420 ng l 1 in accordance with this previous studies that have reported significant correlations between geoa and geosmin also had large ranges of concentrations with elevated maximum concentrations 105 ng l 1 su et al 2013 102 ng l 1 tsao et al 2014 103 ng l 1 otten et al 2016 in addition jørgensen et al 2016 were unable to detect geoa from surface and bottom waters that had geosmin concentrations of 1 4 and 5 8 ng l 1 respectively in contrast gaget et al 2020 found low correlations between geoa and geosmin with geosmin concentrations up to 18 ng l 1 this highlights the need for physical and chemical parameters to be measured in parallel with qpcr to better monitor changes in geoa prevalence in the absence of elevated geosmin concentrations 15 ng l 1 for reservoirs experiencing mild geosmin concentrations 15 ng l 1 and elevated geosmin concentrations 420 ng l 1 negative relationships existed between mean temperatures dissolved reactive sillicate and geoa abundance similarly shen et al 2022 found geoa gene expression to be higher at 15 c than at 25 c and 35 c this was consistent with findings from zhang et al 2009 that showed geosmin production by lyngbya kuetzingii was maximal at low temperature 10 c while saadoun schrader and blevins 2001 suggested that at low temperatures more geosmin was synthesized by anabaena sp negative relationships with geoa and dissolved reactive silicate could be used as a gauge for diatom formation as depletion of dissolved reactive silicate is usually an indicator of diatom production of silicified cell walls containing amorphous silica frustules shimizu et al 2001 negative relationships between dissolved reactive silicate and geoa points towards a potential mutualistic symbiotic relationships between the two phytoplankton olsen chislock and wilson 2016 found that t o production throughout their study may have been linked to synedra sp being used as a substrate for cyanobacterial growth and the proliferation of t o compounds in addition to mean temperature and dissolved reactive silicate geosmin and both nutrient ratios tin tp and nh4 no3 ratios were good indicators for elevated geoa levels in a reservoir experiencing geosmin events and reservoirs with mild geosmin concentrations this coincides with the findings of howard 2020 who suggested that low tn tp favoured the growth and dominance of cyanobacteria whilst low no3 nh4 promoted the production of t o compounds from this study both low tin tp and high nh4 no3 ratios were shown to be significant in relation to geoa abundance interestingly at intermediate ratios of tin tp the abundance of geoa was reduced below the average value of expected geoa cyanobacteria have been reported to assimilate nh4 more efficiently than no3 hampel et al 2018 and no3 has been shown to have inhibitory effects on the production of t o compounds for example geosmin in dolichospermum saadoun et al 2001 tin tp ratios revealed that low levels of tin tp favoured geoa abundance in reservoirs experiencing extreme and mild geosmin concentrations however at intermediate ratios the response of geoa was inhibited below the average value and when tin tp was high the response of geoa was regained youn et al 2020 found that cyanobacterial community composition affected geosmin levels when nitrogen concentrations were high changing to a high tn tp non nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria dominated regained geoa levels in this study after an intermediate inhibitory effect of heightened tin tp may reveal a transition from nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria to non nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria non nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria typically prefer a high tn tp ratio whereas nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria are more commonly observed in water columns experiencing low tn tp elliott and may 2008 vrede et al 2009 here we support these findings and identify high nh4 in proportion to low no3 to be a key trigger in causing elevations in reservoirs experiencing mild and extreme geosmin concentrations with a 0 1 nh4 no3 ratio threshold therefore the most useful water chemistry parameters were the ratio ammonium to nitrate which was previously found in analysing drinking water reservoirs in wales and england perkins et al 2019 ammonium data from this study fell within the limits set out by perkins et al 2019 0 00 0 30 mg l 1 dissolved iron and sulphate were both significantly positively associated with geoa for a reservoir experiencing geosmin events molot et al 2014 proposed that the availability of ferrous iron fe2 regulates the ability of cyanobacteria to compete with other phytoplankton counterparts to assert dominance cyanobacteria also possess siderophores to readily convert ferric iron fe3 to usable fe2 forms in fe limited environments wilhelm and trick 1994 in combination with dissolved iron sulphate reduction to sulphide can limit fe2 diffusion rates from anoxic sediments due to insoluble iron sulphide formation molot et al 2014 the increase of sulphate concentrations can thus promote the availability of fe2 for cyanobacterial dominance assertion however a negative significant relationship with dissolved reactive silicate may pose as a better early indicator for elevated geoa shown in this study 4 2 mic and 2 mib concentrations in this study no relationship between mic and 2 mib concentrations could be determined by month or by season however this was likely due to the low concentrations of 2 mib detected throughout most of this study period 0 57 58 ng l 1 chiu et al 2016 found that mic gene levels in some open water samples were below the limit of detection despite 2 mib being detected they proposed that this was likely a result of 2 mib production not being indigenous to the pelagic region e g originating from benthic cyanobacteria which diffused 2 mib to the open water sampling site hence why no mic genes were detected low concentrations of 2 mib observed throughout this study despite high levels of mic detected could be due to sediment resuspension suspending benthic species containing mic another possible reason for poor correlation is the periodicity of sampling as 2 mib is lost more readily from the water column compared to geosmin owing to a higher volatility and biodegradation cho 2007 li et al 2012 both t o compounds are associated with the thylakoid and cytoplasmic membrane proteins although 2 mib is less closely bound and more easily excreted than geosmin wu and juttner 1988 for mic the nh4 no3 ratio was considered a better indicator of elevated mic gene levels in the water column than 2 mib concentrations along with a negative linear relationship with dissolved reactive silicate both low and high nh4 no3 ratios revealed the greatest partial effect seen on mic levels with intermediate ratios inhibiting the levels of mic this could be explained by the preference of cyanobacteria for nh4 when cyanobacteria absorb nh4 they immediately incorporate it into amino acids whereas they require enzymatic reduction to use no3 kim et al 2017 thus cyanobacteria that use nh4 prior to no3 may experience inhibition of no3 uptake dortch 1990 before being able to produce the enzymes capable of reducing no3 to no2 then finally to nh4 dissolved reactive silicate was also a significant proxy for elevated mic this supports additional studies that have linked diatoms to 2 mib production izaguirre and taylor 1998 schrader et al 2011 sugiura et al 2004 1998 although many studies have only been able to identify a correlation between 2 mib and diatoms olsen et al 2016 additional research is required to understand the relationship 4 3 qpcr primer specificity for mic and geoa in silico testing comparing established primer sets mibs02f and mibs02r chiu et al 2017 mtcf and mtcr wang et al 2011 mib3324f and mib4050r suurnäkki et al 2015 mib3313f and mib4226r suurnäkki et al 2015 for mic quantification revealed a lack of universality appendix a 3 the designed reverse primer mibahr from this study in combination with mibs02f chiu et al 2017 allowed for the detection of 30 cyanobacterial strains that possess mic appendix a 3 seven more strains compared to the original primer set appendix a 3 mibs02f and mibs02r chiu et al 2016 capturing a larger proportion of cyanobacteria that possess the mic gene enabled us to better quantify mic present in the water body from this study however wang et al 2011 stated that more than 40 cyanobacteria species have been identified to produce 2 mib this would imply that the mic 16s copy numbers ml 1 recorded in this study may be underestimated thus the lack of universality in primers used for mic detection would indicate that the data reported here is not fully representational of all cyanobacteria that possess the mic gene in the water column likewise the geoa qpcr primers used in this study namely geo799f john et al 2018 and geo982r suurnäkki et al 2015 were not universal for future reference forward primer geo799f should be used in conjunction with the reverse primer geo927r john et al 2018 if taxon specificity is required to see which producers are present and how much geoa they contribute to this would require multiple sets of taxon specific primers with differing protocols devi et al 2021 4 4 seasonal influence of t o compounds in accordance with oh et al 2017 geosmin was predicted to have the potential of causing drinking water problems in all seasons this can be reaffirmed by winter 2019 results from this study when geosmin concentrations were low during winter 2020 0 4 log10 ng l 1 an uncoupling of the relationship occurred illustrated by a slight negative association model analysis on a reservoir experiencing geosmin events revealed significant differences between geoa levels during all seasons when compared to summer 2019 dzialowski et al 2009 found that elevated geosmin concentrations were not necessarily confined to summer months and heightened concentrations of geosmin were found during the winter in some studied reservoirs like this study for mic levels autumn 2019 was the only significant season when compared to winter 2019 this was likely due to the 2 mib event 58 ng l 1 witnessed in reservoir 7 during this time 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that geoa copy numbers can be implemented as a suitable direct proxy for geosmin concentrations during periods of elevated geosmin concentrations through modelling the response of geoa in parallel with physical and chemical water parameters it can be concluded that geoa also has suitable predictive applications for geosmin concentrations 4 ng l 1 from these data nutrient ratios tin tp and nh4 no3 were better predictors of 2 mib events than 2 mib concentrations negative linear relationships between geoa and dissolved reactive silicate and mean temperature should also be considered as variables for inclusion in modelling t o event prediction therefore a combined molecular dataset with water chemistry data provides a powerful predictor of geosmin based t o events however frequency of samples taken needs to be at least bi weekly to ensure that fluctuations seen in nutrients gene levels and t o concentrations are detected and are fully representative of the water body sample type should also be considered in relation to 2 mib producing species i e sediment samples to ensure benthic communities are assessed for mic abundance to evaluate geoa response to high and low extremes in tin tp ratios metabarcoding should be implemented to allow species composition to be assessed in relation to n fixing and non n fixing cyanobacteria declaration of competing interest the

15045,geosmin synthase geoa and 2 mib cyclase mic are key biosynthetic genes responsible for the production of taste and odour t o compounds geosmin and 2 mib these t o compounds are becoming an increasing global problem for drinking water supplies it is thought that geosmin and 2 mib may be linked to or exacerbated by a variety of different environmental and nutrient triggers however to the best of our knowledge no studies to date have evaluated the combined effects of seasonality temperature and nutrient concentrations on geoa and mic copy numbers in conjunction with t o concentrations in this study environmental triggers behind geosmin and 2 mib production were investigated in nine reservoirs across wales u k between july 2019 august 2020 the abundance of geoa and mic were quantified through quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr temporal changes in geoa and geosmin concentrations revealed geoa to be an indicator of monthly geosmin concentrations although only when geosmin concentrations exceeded 100 ng l 1 model analysis of a reservoir with elevated geosmin concentrations revealed geoa to be significantly associated with mean temperature p 0 001 and the nutrients dissolved reactive silicate p 0 001 dissolved iron p 0 001 total inorganic nitrogen to phosphorous ratio tin tp p 0 001 and ammonium to nitrate ratio nh4 no3 p 0 001 sulphate also demonstrated a significant positive linear relationship with geoa p 0 001 for mic analysis nh4 no3 was significantly associated with mic p 0 05 and an association with dissolved reactive silicate was also observed p 0 084 within this study we also report extreme variance in gene copy numbers between the study seasons no consistent relationship could be determined for mic copy numbers ml 1 and 2 mib ng l 1 the findings from this study indicate that tin tp and nh4 no3 serve as good predictors for elevated geoa and mic along with negative linear relationships observed for mean temperature and dissolved reactive silicate overall our findings demonstrate the importance of nutrient concentrations nutrient ratios and temperature for evidence based predictive capacity of taste and odour events

taste and odour data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction taste and odour t o are the primary sensory considerations used by customers to assess the quality of drinking water kehoe et al 2015 odorous or unpalatable t o compounds in treated drinking water can erode customer trust in water quality and generate complaints to water companies worldwide webber et al 2015 although these compounds pose no risk to human health sotero martins et al 2021 significant costly treatment of drinking water is required to remove them adsorption by activated carbon is considered an effective measure in the removal of t o compounds kim et al 2014 however rodriguez 2018 estimated that to remove 15 ng l 1 of a t o compound at a flow rate of 40 million gallons per day 5077 kg of powdered activated carbon pac would be required with pac having a market cost of around 1 2 2 kg 1 alhashimi and aktas 2017 this is very costly geosmin trans 1 10 dimethyl trans 9 decalol and 2 mib 2 methylisoborneol are the most common compounds associated with t o complaints worldwide clercin and druschel 2019 echenique et al 2006 hayes and burch 1989 menezes et al 2020 perkins et al 2019 van rensburg et al 2016 these compounds are produced by a variety of distantly related bacteria including actinobacteria cyanobacteria and proteobacteria watson 2003 but cyanobacteria are considered to be the main producers of the volatile t o compounds in aquatic environments suurnäkki et al 2015 cyanobacteria have also established important connections with other phytoplankton for example bar yosef et al 2010 revealed a close relationship between other phytoplankton capable of alkaline phosphatase ap production and the cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin this cyanotoxin stimulates algae to produce aps used to access orthophosphate from organic phosphorous which in turn facilitates cyanobacterial growth bar yosef et al 2010 this is supported by olsen et al 2017 who suggested that specifically diatoms influence geosmin and 2 mib production as demonstrated by stronger correlations between 2 mib production and diatom abundance as compared to cyanobacterial abundance this is consistent with previous findings that link diatoms with the proliferation of geosmin and 2 mib izaguirre and taylor 1998 schrader et al 2011 sugiura et al 2004 1998 geosmin and 2 mib exist as an irregular sesquiterpenoid and a monoterpene respectively watson and juttner 2019 geosmin and 2 mib are produced along the metabolic pathways for isoprenoid synthesis involved in the 2 methylerythritol 4 phosphate isoprenoid mep pathway the mevalonate pathway and the leucine pathway jüttner and watson 2007 the molecular foundation of geosmin production is from the geosmin synthase gene geoa which encodes for a bi functional domain enzyme in a two step mg2 dependant reaction churro et al 2020 the n terminal part of the enzyme causes the ionization and cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate fpp into germacradienol whilst the c terminal part facilitates the protonation cyclization and fragmentation of the precursor germacradienol molecules into geosmin and acetone watson et al 2016 for the biosynthesis of 2 mib in cyanobacteria there are two metabolic steps firstly a s adenosylmethionine dependant methylation of the monoterpene precursor geranyl diphosphate gpp to 2 methyl gpp catalysed by geranyl diphosphate 2 methyltransferase gppmt and secondly further cyclization of 2 methyl gpp to 2 mib catalysed by 2 mib cyclase mic forming a putative operon fig 2 giglio et al 2011 discovery of the geoa and mic genes has enabled biomolecular methods like quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr to become available to monitor their abundance cane and watt 2003 dickschat et al 2007 giglio et al 2011 gust et al 2003 komatsu et al 2008 wang and cane 2008 however to the best of our knowledge no primers currently developed target all geosmin and 2 mib producing cyanobacteria geosmin and 2 mib are recalcitrant to conventional drinking water treatment procedures such as clarification filtration and oxidation using chlorine srinivasan and sorial 2011 with both compounds exhibiting extremely low odour thresholds 1 3 ng l 1 for geosmin and 6 3 ng l 1 for 2 mib young et al 1996 it is of vital importance that water companies remove the source of these compounds through mitigative measures before proceeding to water treatment in order to avoid customer dissatisfaction and ultimately complaints this is of particular concern considering that climate change can promote cyanobacterial bloom formation which in turn has the potential to lead to more t o events worldwide davis et al 2009 taranu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 warming can selectively encourage cyanobacterial growth as they have higher optimal growth temperatures compared to eukaryotic algae zhang et al 2017 shen et al 2022 found that warmer temperatures favored cyanobacterial growth leading to an increase in t o compounds however lower temperatures 15 c have also been shown to promote the expression levels of geoa and mic genes compared to 25 c and 35 c shen et al 2022 jeong et al 2021 reported that pseudanabaena yagii produced 2 mib during the summer season and released 2 mib under low temperature conditions in the autumn many studies have focused on the environmental triggers for geosmin and 2 mib production saadoun et al 2001 journey et al 2013 oh et al 2017 clercin and druschel 2019 individual studies have focused on geoa and mic copy numbers in relation to seasonal occurrences of benthic production of geosmin and 2 mib gaget et al 2020 the transcription of the genes in response to temperature shen et al 2022 and developing early detection methods chiu et al 2016 john et al 2018 suurnäkki et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no studies to date have evaluated the combined effects of seasonality temperature and nutrient concentrations on geoa and mic copy numbers together kutovaya and watson 2014 developed taxon specific pcr and qpcr assays for the early detection of geosmin however they were unable to determine any correlations between gene expression temperature and nutrient concentrations usual nutrients implicated in the production of geosmin and 2 mib are nitrogen and phosphorous harris et al 2016 further molot et al 2014 proposed a critical role of ferrous iron and sulphate for cyanobacterial bloom formation yet neither ferrous iron nor sulphate have been evaluated in relation to geosmin and 2 mib production before here we assess the associations between seasonality temperature and nutrients and the production of geosmin and 2 mib in reservoir drinking water we employ quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr to quantify the gene abundance of geoa and mic in nine reservoirs across wales u k using a newly developed reverse mic primer to aid the detection of 2 mib producing cyanobacteria findings are discussed with relevance to triggers for and prediction of t o events in drinking water supply 2 materials and methods 2 1 defining a t o event for geosmin customer complaints start at 7 ng l 1 and for 2 mib customer complaints start at 12 ng l 1 simpson and macleod 1991 according to dŵr cymru welsh water increased sampling frequency on reservoir water begins when geosmin is 5 ng l 1 and 2 mib is 2 5 ng l

present powdered activated carbon pac dosing at low levels commences and customer complaints are checked daily reversion back to normal operation is only authorised once at least 3 samples are below 10 ng l 1 for geosmin and 5 ng l 1 for 2 mib for the purposes of this study an event is defined as a concentration measurement 10 ng l 1 for geosmin and 5 ng l 1 for 2 mib 2 2 sample locations between july 2019 august 2020 500 ml of reservoir water was collected using bankside sampling water depth max 0 5 m once a month for molecular and water chemistry analysis at 28 sampling sites across nine

included data from reservoir 1 the second all other 8 reservoirs with an additional explanatory variable of reservoir reservoir 1 was modelled independently from other reservoirs as this reservoir was the only one to experience high geosmin concentrations according to the gc msms data reservoir was re levelled to have the reference reservoir as reservoir 5 as this was the reservoir with the lowest range of gesomin concentrations for the response variable mic 16s copies ml 1 one gam included all 9 reservoirs with an additional explanatory variable of reservoir reservoir 5 was again the reference

nh4 tin by comparing model fit and efficiency using akaike information criterion aic from models containing either nutrient fractions or nutrient ratios to avoid multicollinearity nutrient ratios

were not found to be significantly non linearly associated with mic 16s copy numbers ml 1 up to concentrations of 8 ng l 1 as depicted by the horizontal estimated smooth function in appendix d 5a nh4

inhibitory effect of nh4 no3 on mic 16s copy numbers ml 1 was observed between 0 07 0 18 4 discussion this is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate variations in geoa and mic abundance between different seasons this is also the first study to report the associations between iron sulphate and dissolved reactive silicate with geoa and mic copy numbers in relation to t o levels significant correlations were determined between geoa and geosmin concentrations by month and by season whereas no relationships could be deduced from correlations observed between mic and 2 mib concentrations by month or by season geoa was deemed to be a suitable indicator of geosmin concentrations but only when geosmin concentrations were elevated 100 ng l 1 as seen in reservoir 1 from this study indicators of heightened geoa abundance between reservoirs experiencing elevated geosmin concentrations and non elevated concentration were negative linear relationships with mean temperature and dissolved reactive silicate both nutrient ratios tin tp and nh4 no3 were significantly associated with the abundance of geoa tin tp generally had the greatest effect on geoa abundance at low ratios with inhibitory effects witnessed at intermediate levels for tin tp ratios which were suppressed at higher tin tp ratios model analysis also revealed that when nh4 no3 ratios were high geoa abundance was also high in addition the positive linear relationships between sulphate and dissolved iron with geoa in a reservoir experiencing geosmin events should not be ignored although no correlations between mic and 2 mib concentrations could be determined model analysis revealed the significance of a negative linear relationship with mic and dissolved reactive silicate and a smoothed relationship with nh4 no3 a limitation of this study was the frequency of sampling monthly which was a constraint of the water industry project paerl et al 2022 demonstrated that a large change in geosmin concentration can occur on a week to week basis during spring summer and pochiraju et al 2021 reported that geosmin concentration may decline by 12 within a week hence monthly monitoring may miss significant spikes in geoa and geosmin concentrations similarly monthly monitoring of mic and 2 mib may miss spikes in 2 mib concentrations or the resuspension of underlying sediment containing cyanobacterial species containing the mic gene it is therefore suggested that weekly or at least biweekly monitoring should be implemented by water companies to facilitate suitable accuracy in predictive capacity 4 1 triggers of geosmin events of the nine reservoirs studied reservoir 1 showed the most elevated geosmin concentrations considered to be significant events and hence was chosen for modelling triggers of geoa prevalence relating to geosmin concentrations findings from this study identified geoa to be a suitable indicator of geosmin concentrations although significant correlations were only apparent when geosmin concentrations had a large range with high maximum concentrations 420 ng l 1 in accordance with this previous studies that have reported significant correlations between geoa and geosmin also had large ranges of concentrations with elevated maximum concentrations 105 ng l 1 su et al 2013 102 ng l 1 tsao et al 2014 103 ng l 1 otten et al 2016 in addition jørgensen et al 2016 were unable to detect geoa from surface and bottom waters that had geosmin concentrations of 1 4 and 5 8 ng l 1 respectively in contrast gaget et al 2020 found low correlations between geoa and geosmin with geosmin concentrations up to 18 ng l 1 this highlights the need for physical and chemical parameters to be measured in parallel with qpcr to better monitor changes in geoa prevalence in the absence of elevated geosmin concentrations 15 ng l 1 for reservoirs experiencing mild geosmin concentrations 15 ng l 1 and elevated geosmin concentrations 420 ng l 1 negative relationships existed between mean temperatures dissolved reactive sillicate and geoa abundance similarly shen et al 2022 found geoa gene expression to be higher at 15 c than at 25 c and 35 c this was consistent with findings from zhang et al 2009 that showed geosmin production by lyngbya kuetzingii was maximal at low temperature 10 c while saadoun schrader and blevins 2001 suggested that at low temperatures more geosmin was synthesized by anabaena sp negative relationships with geoa and dissolved reactive silicate could be used as a gauge for diatom formation as depletion of dissolved reactive silicate is usually an indicator of diatom production of silicified cell walls containing amorphous silica frustules shimizu et al 2001 negative relationships between dissolved reactive silicate and geoa points towards a potential mutualistic symbiotic relationships between the two phytoplankton olsen chislock and wilson 2016 found that t o production throughout their study may have been linked to synedra sp being used as a substrate for cyanobacterial growth and the proliferation of t o compounds in addition to mean temperature and dissolved reactive silicate geosmin and both nutrient ratios tin tp and nh4 no3 ratios were good indicators for elevated geoa levels in a reservoir experiencing geosmin events and reservoirs with mild geosmin concentrations this coincides with the findings of howard 2020 who suggested that low tn tp favoured the growth and dominance of cyanobacteria whilst low no3 nh4 promoted the production of t o compounds from this study both low tin tp and high nh4 no3 ratios were shown to be significant in relation to geoa abundance interestingly at intermediate ratios of tin tp the abundance of geoa was reduced below the average value of expected geoa cyanobacteria have been reported to assimilate nh4 more efficiently than no3 hampel et al 2018 and no3 has been shown to have inhibitory effects on the production of t o compounds for example geosmin in dolichospermum saadoun et al 2001 tin tp ratios revealed that low levels of tin tp favoured geoa abundance in reservoirs experiencing extreme and mild geosmin concentrations however at intermediate ratios the response of geoa was inhibited below the average value and when tin tp was high the response of geoa was regained youn et al 2020 found that cyanobacterial community composition affected geosmin levels when nitrogen concentrations were high changing to a high tn tp non nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria dominated regained geoa levels in this study after an intermediate inhibitory effect of heightened tin tp may reveal a transition from nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria to non nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria non nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria typically prefer a high tn tp ratio whereas nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria are more commonly observed in water columns experiencing low tn tp elliott and may 2008 vrede et al 2009 here we support these findings and identify high nh4 in proportion to low no3 to be a key trigger in causing elevations in reservoirs experiencing mild and extreme geosmin concentrations with a 0 1 nh4 no3 ratio threshold therefore the most useful water chemistry parameters were the ratio ammonium to nitrate which was previously found in analysing drinking water reservoirs in wales and england perkins et al 2019 ammonium data from this study fell within the limits set out by perkins et al 2019 0 00 0 30 mg l 1 dissolved iron and sulphate were both significantly positively associated with geoa for a reservoir experiencing geosmin events molot et al 2014 proposed that the availability of ferrous iron fe2 regulates the ability of cyanobacteria to compete with other phytoplankton counterparts to assert dominance cyanobacteria also possess siderophores to readily convert ferric iron fe3 to usable fe2 forms in fe limited environments wilhelm and trick 1994 in combination with dissolved iron sulphate reduction to sulphide can limit fe2 diffusion rates from anoxic sediments due to insoluble iron sulphide formation molot et al 2014 the increase of sulphate concentrations can thus promote the availability of fe2 for cyanobacterial dominance assertion however a negative significant relationship with dissolved reactive silicate may pose as a better early indicator for elevated geoa shown in this study 4 2 mic and 2 mib concentrations in this study no relationship between mic and 2 mib concentrations could be determined by month or by season however this was likely due to the low concentrations of 2 mib detected throughout most of this study period 0 57 58 ng l 1 chiu et al 2016 found that mic gene levels in some open water samples were below the limit of detection despite 2 mib being detected they proposed that this was likely a result of 2 mib production not being indigenous to the pelagic region e g originating from benthic cyanobacteria which diffused 2 mib to the open water sampling site hence why no mic genes were detected low concentrations of 2 mib observed throughout this study despite high levels of mic detected could be due to sediment resuspension suspending benthic species containing mic another possible reason for poor correlation is the periodicity of sampling as 2 mib is lost more readily from the water column compared to geosmin owing to a higher volatility and biodegradation cho 2007 li et al 2012 both t o compounds are associated with the thylakoid and cytoplasmic membrane proteins although 2 mib is less closely bound and more easily excreted than geosmin wu and juttner 1988 for mic the nh4 no3 ratio was considered a better indicator of elevated mic gene levels in the water column than 2 mib concentrations along with a negative linear relationship with dissolved reactive silicate both low and high nh4 no3 ratios revealed the greatest partial effect seen on mic levels with intermediate ratios inhibiting the levels of mic this could be explained by the preference of cyanobacteria for nh4 when cyanobacteria absorb nh4 they immediately incorporate it into amino acids whereas they require enzymatic reduction to use no3 kim et al 2017 thus cyanobacteria that use nh4 prior to no3 may experience inhibition of no3 uptake dortch 1990 before being able to produce the enzymes capable of reducing no3 to no2 then finally to nh4 dissolved reactive silicate was also a significant proxy for elevated mic this supports additional studies that have linked diatoms to 2 mib production izaguirre and taylor 1998 schrader et al 2011 sugiura et al 2004 1998 although many studies have only been able to identify a correlation between 2 mib and diatoms olsen et al 2016 additional research is required to understand the relationship 4 3 qpcr primer specificity for mic and geoa in silico testing comparing established primer sets mibs02f and mibs02r chiu et al 2017 mtcf and mtcr wang et al 2011 mib3324f and mib4050r suurnäkki et al 2015 mib3313f and mib4226r suurnäkki et al 2015 for mic quantification revealed a lack of universality appendix a 3 the designed reverse primer mibahr from this study in combination with mibs02f chiu et al 2017 allowed for the detection of 30 cyanobacterial strains that possess mic appendix a 3 seven more strains compared to the original primer set appendix a 3 mibs02f and mibs02r chiu et al 2016 capturing a larger proportion of cyanobacteria that possess the mic gene enabled us to better quantify mic present in the water body from this study however wang et al 2011 stated that more than 40 cyanobacteria species have been identified to produce 2 mib this would imply that the mic 16s copy numbers ml 1 recorded in this study may be underestimated thus the lack of universality in primers used for mic detection would indicate that the data reported here is not fully representational of all cyanobacteria that possess the mic gene in the water column likewise the geoa qpcr primers used in this study namely geo799f john et al 2018 and geo982r suurnäkki et al 2015 were not universal for future reference forward primer geo799f should be used in conjunction with the reverse primer geo927r john et al 2018 if taxon specificity is required to see which producers are present and how much geoa they contribute to this would require multiple sets of taxon specific primers with differing protocols devi et al 2021 4 4 seasonal influence of t o compounds in accordance with oh et al 2017 geosmin was predicted to have the potential of causing drinking water problems in all seasons this can be reaffirmed by winter 2019 results from this study when geosmin concentrations were low during winter 2020 0 4 log10 ng l 1 an uncoupling of the relationship occurred illustrated by a slight negative association model analysis on a reservoir experiencing geosmin events revealed significant differences between geoa levels during all seasons when compared to summer 2019 dzialowski et al 2009 found that elevated geosmin concentrations were not necessarily confined to summer months and heightened concentrations of geosmin were found during the winter in some studied reservoirs like this study for mic levels autumn 2019 was the only significant season when compared to winter 2019 this was likely due to the 2 mib event 58 ng l 1 witnessed in reservoir 7 during this time 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that geoa copy numbers can be implemented as a suitable direct proxy for geosmin concentrations during periods of elevated geosmin concentrations through modelling the response of geoa in parallel with physical and chemical water parameters it can be concluded that geoa also has suitable predictive applications for geosmin concentrations 4 ng l 1 from these data nutrient ratios tin tp and nh4 no3 were better predictors of 2 mib events than 2 mib concentrations negative linear relationships between geoa and dissolved reactive silicate and mean temperature should also be considered as variables for inclusion in modelling t o event prediction therefore a combined molecular dataset with water chemistry data provides a powerful predictor of geosmin based t o events however frequency of samples taken needs to be at least bi weekly to ensure that fluctuations seen in nutrients gene levels and t o concentrations are detected and are fully representative of the water body sample type should also be considered in relation to 2 mib producing species i e sediment samples to ensure benthic communities are assessed for mic abundance to evaluate geoa response to high and low extremes in tin tp ratios metabarcoding should be implemented to allow species composition to be assessed in relation to n fixing and non n fixing cyanobacteria declaration of competing interest the

15046,the ecological behavior of bacteriophages phages the most abundant biological entity in wastewater treatment systems is poorly understood especially that of temperate phages here the temporal dynamics of lytic and temperate phages in a laboratory scale activated sludge reactor with a sludge bulking issue was investigated using coupled sludge metagenomic and viromic analyses the lysogenic fragments prophages identified were widely distributed in the reconstructed metagenome assembled genomes 61 7 n 227 however only 12 3 of the identified prophages experienced lysogenic lytic switching and the abundance contribution of prophages to free virus communities was only 0 02 0 3 indicating low activity of temperate phages although the sludge community changed dramatically during reactor

phages are viruses recognized as the most abundant and diverse biological entities on earth and are critical members of microbial communities brum et al 2016 wang et al 2018 there are two main types of phages namely virulent phages and temperate phages virulent phages infect the host to induce the host cell to produce progeny phages which eventually lead to host cell death temperate phages can integrate their dna into host chromosomes prophages and replicate synchronously with the host genome replication which constitutes the lysogenic cycle but they can also enter a lytic cycle under certain conditions proliferating and lysing host cells due to the great plate count anomaly the limitations of host dependent phage isolation have long hampered the understanding of phage ecology in aquatic ecosystems the rapid development of culture independent molecular techniques especially metagenomics recent years has facilitated a more comprehensive understanding of phage diversity dynamics and phage host interactions in various aquatic ecosystems particularly mainly marine liu et al 2021 motlagh et al 2017 rossi et al 2022 suttle 2005 however most studies on phage ecology have focused on the dynamics of lytic phages although lysogeny is frequently detected in natural communities scientific studies on the dynamics of temperate phages are scarce biological wastewater treatment bwt is the most widely applied technology for wastewater treatment and is based on the metabolic process of the bacterial community to remove pollutants in such unique man made ecosystems free virus like particles vlps mainly phages are approximately 10 times more abundant than bacteria with an estimated concentration of 108 1010 particles per milliliter du et al 2021 otawa et al 2007 wu and liu 2009 which is higher than in any other natural aquatic ecosystem numerous efforts have been made to better understand the factors and mechanisms that regulate the microbial community in bwt systems some evidence suggests that top down control of phage activity may also affect the bwt microbial community and treatment performance shapiro et al 2010 demonstrated that phage host dynamics may drive certain community changes in a bioreactor that treats industrial wastewater barr et al 2010 found that lytic infection could lead to performance changes in phosphorus removal in an activated sludge bioreactor these studies shed light on lytic dynamics however there is little scientific information on temperate dynamics in bwt systems tang et al 2022 for temperate phages lysogenic infection can alter host fitness whereas lytic infection can inhibit host replication harrison and brockhurst 2017 therefore it is speculated that lysogenic lytic switching may affect the microbial community in bwt but the extent of this effect and what drives the switching are unclear studies on the temporal dynamics of temperate phages in bwt systems are expected to answer these questions in this study we examined the temporal dynamics of both lytic and temperate phages in a laboratory scale activated sludge system in which a longstanding problem associated with the activated sludge process called filamentous sludge bulking occurred during the operation with the development of sludge bulking the composition and performance of the sludge microbial community changed dramatically providing a good opportunity to explore phage host dynamics in complex bwt ecosystems herein we sequenced the metagenomes of activated sludge and free vlps viromes and performed coupled bioinformatics analysis to unravel phage dynamics to reveal temperate phage dynamics lysogenic fractions prophages were identified from bacterial genomes reconstructed from sludge metagenomes kim and bae 2018 rossi et al 2022 and the scale of lysogenic lytic transition of temperate phages was measured by mapping virome reads to lysogenic fragments this study contributes to a better understanding of phage dynamics patterns in the bwt system particularly the lysogenic lytic switching rules of temperate phages 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of the activated sludge system in this study a laboratory scale

analyzed using qiime 2 briefly raw fastq data was merged using flash and quality filtered using trimmomatic magoč and salzberg 2011 operational taxonomic units otus were identified by clustering the assembled sequences at 97 similarity level using uparse edgar 2013 the taxonomic classification of representative sequences from individual otus was performed using the rdp classifier based on the silva database with a confidence threshold of 80 wang et al 2007 raw sequencing data were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive under bioproject accession number prjna731282 2 4 metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis genomic dna libraries were constructed and sequenced on an illumina hiseq platform illumina at novogene co ltd to generate sludge metagenomes and viromes i e viral metagenomes from vlps raw sequencing data were deposited in ncbi under bioproject numbers prjna870978 and prjna870701 metawrap was used to generate assembled contigs and high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags from raw metagenomic sequencing reads uritskiy et al 2018 briefly the raw data were initially trimmed and contamination was removed using the metawrap read qc module the clean reads of sludge metagenomes and viromes were then cross assembled with the metawrap assembly module using megahit respectively for sludge metagenomes the assembled contigs were further binned with the metawrap binning module using the three binning tools maxbin2 metabat2 and concoct the multiple binning predictions were then consolidated into a new and improved bin set using the metawrap bin refinement module the genome taxonomy was assigned using gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2020 virsorter2 guo et al 2021 and deepvirfinder ren et al 2020 were used to identify viral phage sequences from the assembled viromes after deduplication the identified viral contigs length 3000 nt were pooled and clustered at 95 average nucleotide identity over 80 of the contig length to yield unique viral seeds https github com simroux clustergenomes each viral seed was considered a viral population or a free virus genotype fvg martins et al 2018 lysogenic fragments were identified from each mag using virsorter2 followed by quality control with checkv to filter out those with not determined quality and no viral genes detected nayfach et al 2021 rossi et al 2022 the obtained sequences length 3000 nt were clustered as described above to generate prophage genotypes prgs bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 was used to map virome reads back to the viral contigs fvgs and prgs and the number of reads per kb of contig sequence per million reads of sample rpkm was calculated to estimate the abundance of viral contigs a viral contig was considered present in a free virus community only when at least 75 of its length was covered by the reads retrieved from that community martins et al 2018 the open reading frames orfs of fvgs and prgs were predicted using metagenemark zhu et al 2010 then all predicted orfs were compared against the eggnog database 5 0 using eggnog mapper v2 huerta cepas et al 2019 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg mapper https www genome jp kegg mapper html was used to reconstruct kegg pathway maps from the kegg orthology output the abundance of annotated orfs in each free virus community was computed as the rpkm value for each orf containing fragment virhostmatcher and wish which are two methods based on the oligonucleotide frequency measure onf were used to predict the hosts of free virus contigs fvgs ahlgren et al 2017 galiez et al 2017 to increase host prediction accuracy we restricted the possible hosts to 2523 prokaryotic genomes recovered from activated sludge processes with a gtdb taxonomy assignment including 285 mags 10 contamination and 70 completeness recovered from the metagenomic data in this study 2039 as mags reported by ye et al 2020 and 199 activated sludge prokaryotic genomes downloaded from the integrated microbial genomes and microbiomes database table s1 pairwise onf distances were computed between all fvgs and host genomes using virhostmatcher and the predicted host with the lowest distance score to the query fvg sequence was chosen wish was run using the default parameters against the same host genome dataset finally the lowest common ancestor of the two predictions was considered as the host the hosts of the lysogenic fragments prgs were considered taxa of the corresponding mags 2 5 enumeration of free viruses the sludge liquor 0 5 ml was diluted 100 times with sterile water after shaking and cascade filtration of the diluted liquor using a method similar to that for vlp dna extraction virus particles in the 0 22 µm filtrate were intercepted onto a 0 02 µm filter whatman anodisc 25 mm diameter cytiva inc marlborough ma usa the filter was then stained with sybr gold thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma usa in the dark for 15 min du et al 2021 an inverted fluorescence microscope ix73 olympus corp tokyo japan was used to observe the vlps to determine the biomass of the phages in the sludge samples fig s3a indicates viruses as the most numerous tiny dots whereas bacteria are shown to be larger with definite shapes and edges the number of phages in each sample was counted in at least 10 randomly selected fields 2 6 statistical analysis data statistics and visualization were performed using r 4 1 0 version and originpro 2022b version α diversity principal coordinate analysis pcoa and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means upgma were performed using vegan and ggplot2 packages differentially abundant otus among phases were identified using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method p 0 01 and lda score 3 5 bi et al 2021 chen et al 2021a segata et al 2011 spearman s correlation analysis was performed to test the correlation between filamentous bacteria at the genus level and svi values procrustes test pcoa based was used to evaluate the relationship between viral and bacterial community patterns in r using the vegan package heat maps of taxa at the family level and the corresponding free phages were generated using the pheatmap package the correlation between environmental factors and fvg and prg composition was calculated using the mantel test with spearman s rank correlation coefficient n perm 9999 regression analysis based on prg abundance integrase abundance and mlss was performed to reveal the correlations between microbial density and the lysogenic lytic switch of temperate phages differential abundance analysis of cog categories between non bulking and bulking phases was performed using stamp software parks et al 2014 3 results 3 1 sludge characteristics and system performance during the approximately two month operation with microbial monitoring the sludge load was kept below 0 3 kg cod kg mlss d for a period of time text s1 such a low sludge load may lead to filamentous bulking jenkins et al 2003 scruggs and randall 1998 as expected the sludge settling performance deteriorated gradually during the operation and the svi value increased from 71 to 212 ml g indicating that sludge bulking occurred in the system fig s4 the sludge concentration varied during the operation with mlss ranging from 3700 to 5100 mg l fig s4 microscopic examination revealed the dominance of filamentous microorganisms in the bulking sludge during the non bulking phase svi 130 ml g the sludge exhibited an irregular dense structure with few filaments when svi 130 ml g which represented the bulking phase numerous mycelia extended from sludge flocs with sludge bulking development cod and tp removal showed no apparent change whereas the removal rates of tn and nh4 n decreased remarkably fig s5 these findings are consistent with previous observations in a full scale wastewater treatment plant where filamentous bulking had no apparent adverse effects on cod and phosphorus removal whereas the nitrogen removal performance deteriorated wang et al 2014 3 2 bacterial community dynamics high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to characterize the dynamics of the sludge bacterial community during the operation period twelve bacterial communities including seven non bulking activated sludge n as communities and five bulking activated sludge b as communities were sequenced the n as communities shared a comparable bacterial diversity which was notably higher than that of the b as communities fig s6 hierarchical cluster analysis and pcoa at the phylum and genus levels respectively showed differences between the b as and n as community structures fig 1 a b these results highlight dramatic fluctuations in the sludge bacterial community a total of 12 genera especially paludibacter and kouleothrix were enriched in the b as communities whereas the relative abundance of 17 genera declined significantly lda score 3 5 fig 1c among those enriched in the b as communities kouleothrix 0 7 5 7 family roseiflexaceae is noteworthy as it is a filamentous bacterium associated with sludge bulking deepnarain et al 2015 kragelund et al 2007 martins et al 2003 microscopic examination confirmed that the dominant filamentous microorganisms in the bulking sludge exhibited typical characteristics of kouleothrix such as straight or long slightly curved filaments clustered in bundles adonadaga and martienssen 2015 in addition the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae relatives decreased from 1 3 to 0 5 which may be associated with the deterioration of nitrogen removal performance in the bulking phase 3 3 free virus dynamics according to staining based enumeration vlp concentration in the activated sludge system during operation was consistent with previous reports ranging from 3 2 109 to 4 7 109 particles per ml fig s3b the dynamics of the free viral community structure were determined using viromic analysis metagenomic sequencing of 12 vlps 7 in the non bulking phase and 5 in the bulking phase yielded approximately 162 gb of high quality virome data with an average of 13 5 gb per sample cross assembly of all virome reads generated 24 540 fvgs table s2 according to the rpkm of each fvg in the different samples only 1517 were shared among all vlp samples more fvgs appeared in the non bulking phase and the relative abundance rpkm of fvgs decreased from an average of 72 630 in the non bulking phase to an average of 46 630 in the bulking phase similar to the bacterial community pcoa showed that the community structure of the free virus in the bulking phase was also evidently different from that in the non bulking phase fig 2 a procrustes rotation showed significant coupling m2 0 257 r 0 86 p 0 001 between the viral and microbial ordinations fig 2b because the uncultured majority of environmental prokaryotes and viruses may severely limit homology based viral host prediction ahlgren et al 2017 oligonucleotide frequency based tools i e wish and virhostmatcher were employed to predict hosts of the viral genotypes among the fvgs obtained 51 11 n 12 542 could be linked to a putative host the predicted hosts spanned 34 bacterial phyla with bacteroidota n 4935 39 35 chloroflexota n 2575 20 53 and proteobacteria n 2104 16 78 being the most common hosts fig 2c compared to that in the non bulking phase the proportion of bacteroidota associated fvgs was higher in the bulking phase whereas those of proteobacteria planctomycetota myxococcota and verrucomicrobiota were lower fig 2c at the family taxonomic level of putative hosts the relative abundance rpkm of most corresponding viruses fluctuated continuously but their rpkm values in the bulking phase were significantly lower than those in the non bulking phase which may be related to the different nutritional or metabolic statuses of the host under different sludge conditions fig 2d weinbauer 2004 furthermore the free virus community was dominated by viruses presumed to infect several dominant bacterial families such as saprospiraceae rhodocyclaceae burkholderiaceae competibacteraceae and chitinophagaceae supporting the ecological rule that more hosts imply more viruses fig 2d paez espino et al 2016 rodriguez brito et al 2010 although paludibacteraceae were abundant 3 5 15 0 in the bacterial community their corresponding viruses remained at low abundance levels average rpkm value of 12 6 implying that paludibacteraceae phages may have small burst sizes which is the number of phages released from an infected cell 3 4 temperate phage dynamics owing to the lysogenic lifestyle of temperate phages individual bacterial genomes reconstructed in situ from metagenomic data may carry incorporated prophage genomes which provide the opportunity to study temperate phages in complex ecosystems such as the bwt microbiome kim and bae 2018 rossi et al 2022 in this study we sequenced 12 sludge metagenomes from different sampling times yielding 161 gb of high quality data with an average of 13 4 gb of data per sample the metawrap pipeline was used for metagenomic cross assembly and binning and 227 refined mags were obtained with a threshold of 70 completeness and 5 contamination fig s8 based on virsorter2 and checkv there were 61 7 of mags n 140 carrying lysogenic fractions 3 kb n 300 referred to as prgs table s3 which were identified as lysogens prgs were widely distributed in the mags of 17 phyla mainly proteobacteria n 69 planctomycetota n 63 bacteroidota n 54 and chloroflexota n 53 fig 3 a the abundance rpkm of prgs in the free virus community was calculated by mapping the metagenomic reads of vlps to prgs which were used to estimate the scale of the lysogenic lytic transition in this study only 12 3 of prgs n 37 from 20 lysogens experienced lysogenic lytic switching i e nonzero rpkm values and they are referred to as active prgs the summed prg rpkm value in each sample 6 9 195 7 fig 3b was much lower than that of fvgs 35 892 5 107 821 3 and the abundance ratio rpkmprg rpkmfvg was only 0 02 0 3 indicating that prophages contributed little to the abundance of free virus communities accordingly most prophages appeared inactive during the entire operation period of the activated sludge bioreactor the most active prgs were those in the family micavibrionaceae average rpkm value of 22 5 unclassified alphaproteobacteria in ncbi taxonomy followed by verrucomicrobiaceae 8 4 uba10185 7 7 candidate division wwe3 in ncbi taxonomy ga0077529 6 8 planctomycetaceae in ncbi taxonomy saprospiraceae 6 1 and propionibacteriaceae 5 4 consistent with that observed for the sludge bacterial community and free virus community the active prg community i e lytic phages derived from prophage induction in the free virus community showed marked differences under different sludge conditions fig 3c the mean rpkm of active prgs was much higher in the non bulking phase 118 0 than in the bulking phase 21 3 furthermore non bulking viromes contained more integrase genes than bulking viromes fig 3b these results indicate that the frequency of lysogenic lytic switching decreased with sludge bulking to examine the effect of temperate phage dynamics on the free virus community seven host families with corresponding active prgs and fvgs that met the requirements of statistical analysis i e more than half of the samples at each phase with rpkm 0 table s3 were selected for subsequent analysis taking the dynamics of active prgs associated with a host family as independent variables the corresponding free phage dynamics were predicted using linear regression on the dynamics of active prgs associated with a host family as independent variables fig s9 active prgs derived from four families competibacteraceae dermatophilaceae propionibacteriaceae and palsa 1005 unclassified betaproteobacteria in ncbi taxonomy showed good prediction performance r2 0 65 fig s9 furthermore the rpkm ratio of prgs to fvgs in three families propionibacteriaceae palsa 1005 and ld1 unclassified bacteroidetes in ncbi taxonomy was higher than 20 in some samples these results highlight the regulation of lysogenic lytic switching in free phages that target certain host bacteria moreover the relationship between active temperate phages and their hosts was explored according to the abundance changes in five host families and the corresponding active prgs more than half of the samples at each phase having the relative abundance 0 it was found that the relative abundance of all five families was positively correlated with the rpkm of the corresponding active prgs table s4 3 5 environmental factors associated with phage dynamics a mantel test was performed to explore the effects of reactor operation parameters on viral communities both the free virus and active temperate phage communities were significantly correlated with the sludge characteristics including the biomass concentration mlss and mlvss and sludge settling performance svi mantel test p 0 01 fig 4 a furthermore linear regression analysis showed a strong positive correlation between integrase gene abundance and mlss pearson s r 0 89 p 0 009 fig 4b and between prg abundance summed rpkm and mlss pearson s r 0 89 p 0 001 fig 4b indicating more frequent lysogenic lytic switching with an increase in microbial density 3 6 functional profiles of virus encoded genes only 15 4 41 394 out of 268 623 of the fvg orfs had eggnog annotations while 42 9 2069 out of 4818 of the prg orfs were annotated fvg and prg orfs were distributed across 23 and 22 cog functional classes respectively demonstrating their high diversity with functional annotations the predicted orfs were assigned mainly to cog categories critical for viral reproduction and transcription including l m and k table s5 most cazy affiliated orfs belong to glycoside hydrolases ghs and glycosyltransferases gts table s5 a high frequency of ghs has been observed in sludge viromes chen et al 2021b ghs may digest capsules to facilitate viral infection whereas gts may glucosylate phage dna to protect it from host restriction endonuclease systems chen et al 2021b the abundance of cazy affiliated fvg orfs in non bulking samples was significantly higher than that in bulking samples t test p 0 01 fig s10 according to kegg mapping the predicted genes were involved in various metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate metabolism carbon fixation glycan metabolism and cofactor and vitamin metabolism revealing a repertoire of potential auxiliary metabolic genes amgs in free and integrated phages however the active prgs carried few amgs in addition several orfs associated with anticbiotic resistance tolc ko k12340 htra ko k04771 were identified in prgs table s5 4 discussion in this study the temporal dynamics of both free phages and temperate phages in a laboratory scale activated sludge reactor with a sludge bulking issue were explored using coupled bioinformatic analysis based on sludge and viral metagenomic data the lysogenic fragments identified in the reconstructed bacterial genomes 5 contamination and 70 completeness were widely distributed in 61 7 of mags even with more stringent predictions the proportion of lysogeny was still about 60 while the loose prediction with high false positive risk could reach more than 90 fig s8 these results suggest the prevalence of lysogens in the activated sludge microbiota the percentage of lysogeny observed 61 7 is higher than that reported in many other aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2021 tuttle and buchan 2020 but comparable to that in dense bacteria habitats such as animal guts soils and anaerobic digestion process jansson and wu 2022 kim and bae 2018 rossi et al 2022 as free phage particles are constantly washed out with the treated effluent whereas prophages and their hosts in activated sludge processes are retained in the system lysogeny may protect phages from decay during the activated sludge process shapiro and kushmaro 2011 furthermore the carriage of prophages may improve the fitness and competitiveness of hosts in the activated sludge microbiome for example the identified prophages provide a pool of amgs related to multiple metabolic pathways which may modulate host metabolism to supply metabolic benefits moreover when surrounded by numerous phages here 3 2 4 7 109 particles per ml lysogenization may be a natural way of resisting infection by activated sludge bacteria superinfection immunity this would confer lysogens especially those with multiple different prophages a competitive advantage by lysing susceptible competitors harrison and brockhurst 2017 however it is also possible that the proportion of lysogens was overestimated due to the limitations of genome resolved metagenomics athough metawrap refines binning predictions with single copy gene numbers the resulting bins do not represent the genomes of single individuals in a community or even individual strains uritskiy et al 2018 thus there may be several non lysogens phylogenetically close to lysogens in the sludge microbiota which may be good hosts for lytic infection and may contribute to the mass production of free phage particles in the activated sludge microbiota although the lysogens were widely distributed most of the prophages identified here were inactive during reactor operation because the microbial density in the activated sludge system is higher than that in natural aquatic ecosystems this observation is plausible according to the piggyback the winner prediction which states that lysogeny is favored in dense communities knowles et al 2016 however it cannot be ruled out that inactive prophages are mainly cryptic prophages that have lost the genes necessary for virion production due to genome rearrangements and gradual decay wang et al 2010 in addition the continuously low abundance rpkm of active prophages suggests that the free phage community in the reactor consisted mainly of virulent phages rather than temperate phages furthermore a short residence time may lead to rapid turnover of free viruses in the sludge system parada et al 2006 which could promote the enrichment of virulent phages capable of rapid reproduction for example those with abundant hosts or large burst sizes although the contribution to the entire free virus community is limited the activity of temperate phages may play an important role in regulating the abundance of free phages targeting certain host bacteria fig s9 according to our data the sludge properties especially those related to the microbial density mlss and mlvss were key operating parameters that affect the composition of free virus and active temperate phage communities fig 4a we also found that phages targeting dominant sludge bacteria dominated the free virus community therefore viral infections in the reactor appeared to be density dependent i e more microbes more viruses several studies have shown that the phage abundance is positively correlated with host density in various environments brum et al 2016 kim and bae 2018 liang et al 2020 shapiro et al 2010 demonstrated that plaque forming unit concentrations were correlated with the abundance of host related taxa in a full scale membrane bioreactor active temperate phages also exhibited density dependent dynamics the abundances of both active prophages and virome encoded integrase genes were significantly and positively correlated with mlss fig 4b specifically positive correlations were found between the abundance of some hosts and the corresponding active temperate phages table s4 accordingly in the activated sludge system active temperate phages appeared to prefer lytic replication with increased biomass implying that the microbial density was an important regulator of the lysogenic lytic switching a low abundance of both free viruses and active temperate phages was observed in the sludge bulking phase this may be related to the host physiological status which is crucial for viral infection and proliferation as it influences phage adsorption replication lytic activity and lytic lysogenic switching brum et al 2016 weinbauer 2004 in this study the low sludge loading led to a fierce competition for resources among microorganisms in the activated sludge especially during the bulking phase this compresses the ecological niches of many other bacteria which may deteriorate their physiological conditions thus decreasing the yield of viruses massive prophage induction followed the sudden lysis of a large fraction of functional bacteria is assumed to be a potential trigger for process failures shapiro and kushmaro 2011 pure culture based experiments have proven that various environmental stress factors such as ph temperature and organic carbon in wastewater treatment processes can induce prophages from ammonia oxidizing bacteria choi et al 2010 in this study during reactor operation the bacterial community fluctuated dramatically accompanied by filamentous bulking and deterioration in nitrogen removal which could lead to significant changes in the physicochemical environment of the sludge system as demonstrated by the chemical composition analysis of the dissolved organic matter unpublished data however the metagenomic analysis showed that no considerable prophage induction events occurred in the reactor in contrast the environmental conditions in actual wastewater treatment plants may be more complex than those of our synthetic wastewater based reactor which warrants further research 5 conclusions in this study the temporal dynamics of lytic and temperate phages were simultaneously tracked in a laboratory scale activated sludge reactor our results showed that viral dynamics were microbial density dependent in the sludge microbiota temperate phages were widely distributed but less active during the operation period although the sludge community changed dramatically during reactor operation no massive prophage induction events were detected further research is required to understand which physicochemical factors or changes in operating conditions can cause significant prophage induction in bwt processes authors contributions all authors intellectually contributed to and agreed to

15046,the ecological behavior of bacteriophages phages the most abundant biological entity in wastewater treatment systems is poorly understood especially that of temperate phages here the temporal dynamics of lytic and temperate phages in a laboratory scale activated sludge reactor with a sludge bulking issue was investigated using coupled sludge metagenomic and viromic analyses the lysogenic fragments prophages identified were widely distributed in the reconstructed metagenome assembled genomes 61 7 n 227 however only 12 3 of the identified prophages experienced lysogenic lytic switching and the abundance contribution of prophages to free virus communities was only 0 02 0 3 indicating low activity of temperate phages although the sludge community changed dramatically during reactor

phages are viruses recognized as the most abundant and diverse biological entities on earth and are critical members of microbial communities brum et al 2016 wang et al 2018 there are two main types of phages namely virulent phages and temperate phages virulent phages infect the host to induce the host cell to produce progeny phages which eventually lead to host cell death temperate phages can integrate their dna into host chromosomes prophages and replicate synchronously with the host genome replication which constitutes the lysogenic cycle but they can also enter a lytic cycle under certain conditions proliferating and lysing host cells due to the great plate count anomaly the limitations of host dependent phage isolation have long hampered the understanding of phage ecology in aquatic ecosystems the rapid development of culture independent molecular techniques especially metagenomics recent years has facilitated a more comprehensive understanding of phage diversity dynamics and phage host interactions in various aquatic ecosystems particularly mainly marine liu et al 2021 motlagh et al 2017 rossi et al 2022 suttle 2005 however most studies on phage ecology have focused on the dynamics of lytic phages although lysogeny is frequently detected in natural communities scientific studies on the dynamics of temperate phages are scarce biological wastewater treatment bwt is the most widely applied technology for wastewater treatment and is based on the metabolic process of the bacterial community to remove pollutants in such unique man made ecosystems free virus like particles vlps mainly phages are approximately 10 times more abundant than bacteria with an estimated concentration of 108 1010 particles per milliliter du et al 2021 otawa et al 2007 wu and liu 2009 which is higher than in any other natural aquatic ecosystem numerous efforts have been made to better understand the factors and mechanisms that regulate the microbial community in bwt systems some evidence suggests that top down control of phage activity may also affect the bwt microbial community and treatment performance shapiro et al 2010 demonstrated that phage host dynamics may drive certain community changes in a bioreactor that treats industrial wastewater barr et al 2010 found that lytic infection could lead to performance changes in phosphorus removal in an activated sludge bioreactor these studies shed light on lytic dynamics however there is little scientific information on temperate dynamics in bwt systems tang et al 2022 for temperate phages lysogenic infection can alter host fitness whereas lytic infection can inhibit host replication harrison and brockhurst 2017 therefore it is speculated that lysogenic lytic switching may affect the microbial community in bwt but the extent of this effect and what drives the switching are unclear studies on the temporal dynamics of temperate phages in bwt systems are expected to answer these questions in this study we examined the temporal dynamics of both lytic and temperate phages in a laboratory scale activated sludge system in which a longstanding problem associated with the activated sludge process called filamentous sludge bulking occurred during the operation with the development of sludge bulking the composition and performance of the sludge microbial community changed dramatically providing a good opportunity to explore phage host dynamics in complex bwt ecosystems herein we sequenced the metagenomes of activated sludge and free vlps viromes and performed coupled bioinformatics analysis to unravel phage dynamics to reveal temperate phage dynamics lysogenic fractions prophages were identified from bacterial genomes reconstructed from sludge metagenomes kim and bae 2018 rossi et al 2022 and the scale of lysogenic lytic transition of temperate phages was measured by mapping virome reads to lysogenic fragments this study contributes to a better understanding of phage dynamics patterns in the bwt system particularly the lysogenic lytic switching rules of temperate phages 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of the activated sludge system in this study a laboratory scale

every 4 5 d using standard methods to evaluate the wastewater treatment performance of the reactor brewer 1989 in addition activated sludge properties including the mlss mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volume index svi were measured brewer 1989 for microbial analysis approximately 250 ml of sludge liquor was collected from the aerobic tank for sludge and vlp dna extraction and virus enumeration 2 2 sample processing and dna extraction the total genomic dna of the activated sludge was extracted using a fastdna spin kit mp bio irvine ca usa equipped with a fastprep 24 bead beating system mp bio according to the manufacturer s instructions for vlp dna extraction 200 ml of sludge liquor was vigorously shaken for 30 min to desorb viruses from sludge flocs

assembled sequences at 97 similarity level using uparse edgar 2013 the taxonomic classification of representative sequences from individual otus was performed using the rdp classifier based on the silva database with a confidence threshold of 80 wang et al 2007 raw sequencing data were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive under bioproject accession number prjna731282 2 4 metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis genomic dna libraries were constructed and sequenced on an illumina hiseq platform illumina at novogene co ltd to generate sludge metagenomes and viromes i e viral metagenomes from vlps raw sequencing data were deposited in ncbi under bioproject numbers prjna870978 and prjna870701 metawrap was used to generate assembled contigs and high quality metagenome assembled genomes mags from raw metagenomic sequencing reads uritskiy et al 2018 briefly the raw data were initially trimmed and contamination was removed using the metawrap read qc module the clean reads of sludge metagenomes and viromes were then cross assembled with the metawrap assembly module using megahit respectively for sludge metagenomes the assembled contigs were further binned with the metawrap binning module using the three binning tools maxbin2 metabat2 and concoct the multiple binning predictions were then consolidated into a new and improved bin set using the metawrap bin refinement module the genome taxonomy was assigned using gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2020 virsorter2 guo et al 2021 and deepvirfinder ren et al 2020 were used to identify viral phage sequences from the assembled viromes after deduplication the identified viral contigs length 3000 nt were pooled and clustered at 95 average nucleotide identity over 80 of the contig length to yield unique viral seeds https github com simroux clustergenomes each viral seed was considered a viral population or a free virus genotype fvg martins et al 2018 lysogenic fragments were identified from each mag using virsorter2 followed by quality control with checkv to filter out those with not determined quality and no viral genes detected nayfach et al 2021 rossi et al 2022 the obtained sequences length 3000 nt were clustered as described above to generate prophage genotypes prgs bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 was used to map virome reads back to the viral contigs fvgs and prgs and the number of reads per kb of contig sequence per million reads of sample rpkm was calculated to estimate the abundance of viral contigs a viral contig was considered present in a free virus community only when at least 75 of its length was covered by the reads retrieved from that community martins et al 2018 the open reading frames orfs of fvgs and prgs were predicted using metagenemark zhu et al 2010 then all predicted orfs were compared against the eggnog database 5 0 using eggnog mapper v2 huerta cepas et al 2019 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg mapper https www genome jp kegg mapper html was used to reconstruct kegg pathway maps from the kegg orthology output the abundance of annotated orfs in each free virus community was computed as the rpkm value for each orf containing fragment virhostmatcher and wish which are two methods based on the oligonucleotide frequency measure onf were used to predict the hosts of free virus contigs fvgs ahlgren et al 2017 galiez et al 2017 to increase host prediction accuracy we restricted the possible hosts to 2523 prokaryotic genomes recovered from activated sludge processes with a gtdb taxonomy assignment including 285 mags 10 contamination and 70 completeness recovered from the metagenomic data in this study 2039 as mags reported by ye et al 2020 and 199 activated sludge prokaryotic genomes downloaded from the integrated microbial genomes and microbiomes database table s1 pairwise onf distances were computed between all fvgs and host genomes using virhostmatcher and the predicted host with the lowest distance score to the query fvg sequence was chosen wish was run using the default parameters against the same host genome dataset finally the lowest common ancestor of the two predictions was considered as the host the hosts of the lysogenic fragments prgs were considered taxa of the corresponding mags 2 5 enumeration of free viruses the sludge liquor 0 5 ml was diluted 100 times with sterile water after shaking and cascade filtration of the diluted liquor using a method similar to that for vlp dna extraction virus particles in the 0 22 µm filtrate were intercepted onto a 0 02 µm filter whatman anodisc 25 mm diameter cytiva inc marlborough ma usa the filter was then stained with sybr gold thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma usa in the dark for 15 min du et al 2021 an inverted fluorescence microscope ix73 olympus corp tokyo japan was used to observe the vlps to determine the biomass of the phages in the sludge samples fig s3a indicates viruses as the most numerous tiny dots whereas bacteria are shown to be larger with definite shapes and edges the number of phages in each sample was counted in at least 10 randomly selected fields 2 6 statistical analysis data statistics and visualization were performed using r 4 1 0 version and originpro 2022b version α diversity principal coordinate analysis pcoa and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means upgma were performed using vegan and ggplot2 packages differentially abundant otus among phases were identified using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method p 0 01 and lda score 3 5 bi et al 2021 chen et al 2021a segata et al 2011 spearman s correlation analysis was performed to test the correlation between filamentous bacteria at the genus level and svi values procrustes test pcoa based was used to evaluate the relationship between viral and bacterial community patterns in r using the vegan package heat maps of taxa at the family level and the corresponding free phages were generated using the pheatmap package the correlation between environmental factors and fvg and prg composition was calculated using the mantel test with spearman s rank correlation coefficient n perm 9999 regression analysis based on prg abundance integrase abundance and mlss was performed to reveal the correlations between microbial density and the lysogenic lytic switch of temperate phages differential abundance analysis of cog categories between non bulking and bulking phases was performed using stamp software parks et al 2014 3 results 3 1 sludge characteristics and system performance during the approximately two month operation with microbial monitoring the sludge load was kept below 0 3 kg cod kg mlss d for a period of time text s1 such a low sludge load may lead to filamentous bulking jenkins et al 2003 scruggs and randall 1998 as expected the sludge settling performance deteriorated gradually during the operation and the svi value increased from 71 to 212 ml g indicating that sludge bulking occurred in the system fig s4 the sludge concentration varied during the operation with mlss ranging from 3700 to 5100 mg l fig s4 microscopic examination revealed the dominance of filamentous microorganisms in the bulking sludge during the non bulking phase svi 130 ml g the sludge exhibited an irregular dense structure with few filaments when svi 130 ml g which represented the bulking phase numerous mycelia extended from sludge flocs with sludge bulking development cod and tp removal showed no apparent change whereas the removal rates of tn and nh4 n decreased remarkably fig s5 these findings are consistent with previous observations in a full scale wastewater treatment plant where filamentous bulking had no apparent adverse effects on cod and phosphorus removal whereas the nitrogen removal performance deteriorated wang et al 2014 3 2 bacterial community dynamics high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to characterize the dynamics of the sludge bacterial community during the operation period twelve bacterial communities including seven non bulking activated sludge n as communities and five bulking activated sludge b as communities were sequenced the n as communities shared a comparable bacterial diversity which was notably higher than that of the b as communities fig s6 hierarchical cluster analysis and pcoa at the phylum and genus levels respectively showed differences between the b as and n as community structures fig 1 a b these results highlight dramatic fluctuations in the sludge bacterial community a total of 12 genera especially paludibacter and kouleothrix were enriched in the b as communities whereas the relative abundance of 17 genera declined significantly lda score 3 5 fig 1c among those enriched in the b as communities kouleothrix 0 7 5 7 family roseiflexaceae is noteworthy as it is a filamentous bacterium associated with sludge bulking deepnarain et al 2015 kragelund et al 2007 martins et al 2003 microscopic examination confirmed that the dominant filamentous microorganisms in the bulking sludge exhibited typical characteristics of kouleothrix such as straight or long slightly curved filaments clustered in bundles adonadaga and martienssen 2015 in addition the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae relatives decreased from 1 3 to 0 5 which may be associated with the deterioration of nitrogen removal performance in the bulking phase 3 3 free virus dynamics according to staining based enumeration vlp concentration in the activated sludge system during operation was consistent with previous reports ranging from 3 2 109 to 4 7 109 particles per ml fig s3b the dynamics of the free viral community structure were determined using viromic analysis metagenomic sequencing of 12 vlps 7 in the non bulking phase and 5 in the bulking phase yielded approximately 162 gb of high quality virome data with an average of 13 5 gb per sample cross assembly of all virome reads generated 24 540 fvgs table s2 according to the rpkm of each fvg in the different samples only 1517 were shared among all vlp samples more fvgs appeared in the non bulking phase and the relative abundance rpkm of fvgs decreased from an average of 72 630 in the non bulking phase to an average of 46 630 in the bulking phase similar to the bacterial community pcoa showed that the community structure of the free virus in the bulking phase was also evidently different from that in the non bulking phase fig 2 a procrustes rotation showed significant coupling m2 0 257 r 0 86 p 0 001 between the viral and microbial ordinations fig 2b because the uncultured majority of environmental prokaryotes and viruses may severely limit homology based viral host prediction ahlgren et al 2017 oligonucleotide frequency based tools i e wish and virhostmatcher were employed to predict hosts of the viral genotypes among the fvgs obtained 51 11 n 12 542 could be linked to a putative host the predicted hosts spanned 34 bacterial phyla with bacteroidota n 4935 39 35 chloroflexota n 2575 20 53 and proteobacteria n 2104 16 78 being the most common hosts fig 2c compared to that in the non bulking phase the proportion of bacteroidota associated fvgs was higher in the bulking phase whereas those of proteobacteria planctomycetota myxococcota and verrucomicrobiota were lower fig 2c at the family taxonomic level of putative hosts the relative abundance rpkm of most corresponding viruses fluctuated continuously but their rpkm values in the bulking phase were significantly lower than those in the non bulking phase which may be related to the different nutritional or metabolic statuses of the host under different sludge conditions fig 2d weinbauer 2004 furthermore the free virus community was dominated by viruses presumed to infect several dominant bacterial families such as saprospiraceae rhodocyclaceae burkholderiaceae competibacteraceae and chitinophagaceae supporting the ecological rule that more hosts imply more viruses fig 2d paez espino et al 2016 rodriguez brito et al 2010 although paludibacteraceae were abundant 3 5 15 0 in the bacterial community their corresponding viruses remained at low abundance levels average rpkm value of 12 6 implying that paludibacteraceae phages may have small burst sizes which is the number of phages released from an infected cell 3 4 temperate phage dynamics owing to the lysogenic lifestyle of temperate phages individual bacterial genomes reconstructed in situ from metagenomic data may carry incorporated prophage genomes which provide the opportunity to study temperate phages in complex ecosystems such as the bwt microbiome kim and bae 2018 rossi et al 2022 in this study we sequenced 12 sludge metagenomes from different sampling times yielding 161 gb of high quality data with an average of 13 4 gb of data per sample the metawrap pipeline was used for metagenomic cross assembly and binning and 227 refined mags were obtained with a threshold of 70 completeness and 5 contamination fig s8 based on virsorter2 and checkv there were 61 7 of mags n 140 carrying lysogenic fractions 3 kb n 300 referred to as prgs table s3 which were identified as lysogens prgs were widely distributed in the mags of 17 phyla mainly proteobacteria n 69 planctomycetota n 63 bacteroidota n 54 and chloroflexota n 53 fig 3 a the abundance rpkm of prgs in the free virus community was calculated by mapping the metagenomic reads of vlps to prgs which were used to estimate the scale of the lysogenic lytic transition in this study only 12 3 of prgs n 37 from 20 lysogens experienced lysogenic lytic switching i e nonzero rpkm values and they are referred to as active prgs the summed prg rpkm value in each sample 6 9 195 7 fig 3b was much lower than that of fvgs 35 892 5 107 821 3 and the abundance ratio rpkmprg rpkmfvg was only 0 02 0 3 indicating that prophages contributed little to the abundance of free virus communities accordingly most prophages appeared inactive during the entire operation period of the activated sludge bioreactor the most active prgs were those in the family micavibrionaceae average rpkm value of 22 5 unclassified alphaproteobacteria in ncbi taxonomy followed by verrucomicrobiaceae 8 4 uba10185 7 7 candidate division wwe3 in ncbi taxonomy ga0077529 6 8 planctomycetaceae in ncbi taxonomy saprospiraceae 6 1 and propionibacteriaceae 5 4 consistent with that observed for the sludge bacterial community and free virus community the active prg community i e lytic phages derived from prophage induction in the free virus community showed marked differences under different sludge conditions fig 3c the mean rpkm of active prgs was much higher in the non bulking phase 118 0 than in the bulking phase 21 3 furthermore non bulking viromes contained more integrase genes than bulking viromes fig 3b these results indicate that the frequency of lysogenic lytic switching decreased with sludge bulking to examine the effect of temperate phage dynamics on the free virus community seven host families with corresponding active prgs and fvgs that met the requirements of statistical analysis i e more than half of the samples at each phase with rpkm 0 table s3 were selected for subsequent analysis taking the dynamics of active prgs associated with a host family as independent variables the corresponding free phage dynamics were predicted using linear regression on the dynamics of active prgs associated with a host family as independent variables fig s9 active prgs derived from four families competibacteraceae dermatophilaceae propionibacteriaceae and palsa 1005 unclassified betaproteobacteria in ncbi taxonomy showed good prediction performance r2 0 65 fig s9 furthermore the rpkm ratio of prgs to fvgs in three families propionibacteriaceae palsa 1005 and ld1 unclassified bacteroidetes in ncbi taxonomy was higher than 20 in some samples these results highlight the regulation of lysogenic lytic switching in free phages that target certain host bacteria moreover the relationship between active temperate phages and their hosts was explored according to the abundance changes in five host families and the corresponding active prgs more than half of the samples at each phase having the relative abundance 0 it was found that the relative abundance of all five families was positively correlated with the rpkm of the corresponding active prgs table s4 3 5 environmental factors associated with phage dynamics a mantel test was performed to explore the effects of reactor operation parameters on viral communities both the free virus and active temperate phage communities were significantly correlated with the sludge characteristics including the biomass concentration mlss and mlvss and sludge settling performance svi mantel test p 0 01 fig 4 a furthermore linear regression analysis showed a strong positive correlation between integrase gene abundance and mlss pearson s r 0 89 p 0 009 fig 4b and between prg abundance summed rpkm and mlss pearson s r 0 89 p 0 001 fig 4b indicating more frequent lysogenic lytic switching with an increase in microbial density 3 6 functional profiles of virus encoded genes only 15 4 41 394 out of 268 623 of the fvg orfs had eggnog annotations while 42 9 2069 out of 4818 of the prg orfs were annotated fvg and prg orfs were distributed across 23 and 22 cog functional classes respectively demonstrating their high diversity with functional annotations the predicted orfs were assigned mainly to cog categories critical for viral reproduction and transcription including l m and k table s5 most cazy affiliated orfs belong to glycoside hydrolases ghs and glycosyltransferases gts table s5 a high frequency of ghs has been observed in sludge viromes chen et al 2021b ghs may digest capsules to facilitate viral infection whereas gts may glucosylate phage dna to protect it from host restriction endonuclease systems chen et al 2021b the abundance of cazy affiliated fvg orfs in non bulking samples was significantly higher than that in bulking samples t test p 0 01 fig s10 according to kegg mapping the predicted genes were involved in various metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate metabolism carbon fixation glycan metabolism and cofactor and vitamin metabolism revealing a repertoire of potential auxiliary metabolic genes amgs in free and integrated phages however the active prgs carried few amgs in addition several orfs associated with anticbiotic resistance tolc ko k12340 htra ko k04771 were identified in prgs table s5 4 discussion in this study the temporal dynamics of both free phages and temperate phages in a laboratory scale activated sludge reactor with a sludge bulking issue were explored using coupled bioinformatic analysis based on sludge and viral metagenomic data the lysogenic fragments identified in the reconstructed bacterial genomes 5 contamination and 70 completeness were widely distributed in 61 7 of mags even with more stringent predictions the proportion of lysogeny was still about 60 while the loose prediction with high false positive risk could reach more than 90 fig s8 these results suggest the prevalence of lysogens in the activated sludge microbiota the percentage of lysogeny observed 61 7 is higher than that reported in many other aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2021 tuttle and buchan 2020 but comparable to that in dense bacteria habitats such as animal guts soils and anaerobic digestion process jansson and wu 2022 kim and bae 2018 rossi et al 2022 as free phage particles are constantly washed out with the treated effluent whereas prophages and their hosts in activated sludge processes are retained in the system lysogeny may protect phages from decay during the activated sludge process shapiro and kushmaro 2011 furthermore the carriage of prophages may improve the fitness and competitiveness of hosts in the activated sludge microbiome for example the identified prophages provide a pool of amgs related to multiple metabolic pathways which may modulate host metabolism to supply metabolic benefits moreover when surrounded by numerous phages here 3 2 4 7 109 particles per ml lysogenization may be a natural way of resisting infection by activated sludge bacteria superinfection immunity this would confer lysogens especially those with multiple different prophages a competitive advantage by lysing susceptible competitors harrison and brockhurst 2017 however it is also possible that the proportion of lysogens was overestimated due to the limitations of genome resolved metagenomics athough metawrap refines binning predictions with single copy gene numbers the resulting bins do not represent the genomes of single individuals in a community or even individual strains uritskiy et al 2018 thus there may be several non lysogens phylogenetically close to lysogens in the sludge microbiota which may be good hosts for lytic infection and may contribute to the mass production of free phage particles in the activated sludge microbiota although the lysogens were widely distributed most of the prophages identified here were inactive during reactor operation because the microbial density in the activated sludge system is higher than that in natural aquatic ecosystems this observation is plausible according to the piggyback the winner prediction which states that lysogeny is favored in dense communities knowles et al 2016 however it cannot be ruled out that inactive prophages are mainly cryptic prophages that have lost the genes necessary for virion production due to genome rearrangements and gradual decay wang et al 2010 in addition the continuously low abundance rpkm of active prophages suggests that the free phage community in the reactor consisted mainly of virulent phages rather than temperate phages furthermore a short residence time may lead to rapid turnover of free viruses in the sludge system parada et al 2006 which could promote the enrichment of virulent phages capable of rapid reproduction for example those with abundant hosts or large burst sizes although the contribution to the entire free virus community is limited the activity of temperate phages may play an important role in regulating the abundance of free phages targeting certain host bacteria fig s9 according to our data the sludge properties especially those related to the microbial density mlss and mlvss were key operating parameters that affect the composition of free virus and active temperate phage communities fig 4a we also found that phages targeting dominant sludge bacteria dominated the free virus community therefore viral infections in the reactor appeared to be density dependent i e more microbes more viruses several studies have shown that the phage abundance is positively correlated with host density in various environments brum et al 2016 kim and bae 2018 liang et al 2020 shapiro et al 2010 demonstrated that plaque forming unit concentrations were correlated with the abundance of host related taxa in a full scale membrane bioreactor active temperate phages also exhibited density dependent dynamics the abundances of both active prophages and virome encoded integrase genes were significantly and positively correlated with mlss fig 4b specifically positive correlations were found between the abundance of some hosts and the corresponding active temperate phages table s4 accordingly in the activated sludge system active temperate phages appeared to prefer lytic replication with increased biomass implying that the microbial density was an important regulator of the lysogenic lytic switching a low abundance of both free viruses and active temperate phages was observed in the sludge bulking phase this may be related to the host physiological status which is crucial for viral infection and proliferation as it influences phage adsorption replication lytic activity and lytic lysogenic switching brum et al 2016 weinbauer 2004 in this study the low sludge loading led to a fierce competition for resources among microorganisms in the activated sludge especially during the bulking phase this compresses the ecological niches of many other bacteria which may deteriorate their physiological conditions thus decreasing the yield of viruses massive prophage induction followed the sudden lysis of a large fraction of functional bacteria is assumed to be a potential trigger for process failures shapiro and kushmaro 2011 pure culture based experiments have proven that various environmental stress factors such as ph temperature and organic carbon in wastewater treatment processes can induce prophages from ammonia oxidizing bacteria choi et al 2010 in this study during reactor operation the bacterial community fluctuated dramatically accompanied by filamentous bulking and deterioration in nitrogen removal which could lead to significant changes in the physicochemical environment of the sludge system as demonstrated by the chemical composition analysis of the dissolved organic matter unpublished data however the metagenomic analysis showed that no considerable prophage induction events occurred in the reactor in contrast the environmental conditions in actual wastewater treatment plants may be more complex than those of our synthetic wastewater based reactor which warrants further research 5 conclusions in this study the temporal dynamics of lytic and temperate phages were simultaneously tracked in a laboratory scale activated sludge reactor our results showed that viral dynamics were microbial density dependent in the sludge microbiota temperate phages were widely distributed but less active during the operation period although the sludge community changed dramatically during reactor operation no massive prophage induction events were detected further research is required to understand which physicochemical factors or changes in operating conditions can cause significant prophage induction in bwt processes authors contributions all authors intellectually contributed to and agreed to

is an attractive option for treatment of dissolved organic matter dom in landfill leachate but concerns remain over the energy efficiency and formation of oxidation byproducts clo3 and clo4 in this study eo treatment of landfill leachates was carried out using representative active and nonactive anode materials cell configurations and current densities size exclusion chromatograms coupled with 2d synchronous and asynchronous correlation analysis showed that the sensitivity of dom fractions to eo degradation was dependent on the anode material the nonactive boron doped diamond bdd anode demonstrated the best performance for dom oxidation the humic acid like fraction ha 2 5 20 kda predominated the visible absorbance of landfill leachates at λ 400 nm and it generally had the highest reaction rates except the occurrence of the ph induced denaturation and precipitation of the proteinaceous biopolymer fraction bp 20 kda during the eo treatment of landfill leachate with bdd anode the uv absorbance spectra of landfill leachates at wavelengths 400 nm were affected by the formation of free chlorine instead the decrease of abs420 was found to be a good indicator of the shift of the oxidation from predominantly ha fraction to the proteinaceous bp fraction the behavior of the abs420 parameter was also indicative of the transition from the energy efficient oxidation of dom to the dominance of side reactions of chlorine evolution and the subsequent formation of clo3 and clo4 these findings suggest that the eo treatment of landfill leachate can be optimized by adjusting the current density with feedback signals from the online monitoring of abs420 to achieve a trade off between degradation of dom and control of clo3 and clo4 graphical abstract image graphical abstract

introduction sanitary landfilling is still the most effective economical and environmentally acceptable method to dispose of municipal and industrial solid waste in countries worldwide however an inevitable and unpleasant consequence of this practice is the generation of leachate which is usually characterized by high concentrations of dissolved organic matter dom high salinity and high toxicity levels teng et al 2021 leachates discharged from aged landfills tend to have high levels of bio refractory organic matter e g humic like substances jiang et al 2022 which necessitates the implementation of physio chemical treatment processes in combination with biological treatment processes in recent years the electrochemical oxidation eo treatment has been shown to be promising for landfill leachate due to its high efficacy in degrading refractory dom and lack of need to store additional chemicals deng and englehardt 2007 deng et al 2020 golwala et al 2022 guo et al 2022 mandal et al 2017 teng et al 2021 in eo treatment dom can be degraded by direct oxidation on the anode surface via anodic electro transfer reaction and or indirect oxidation by in situ electrogenerated oxidants e g oh cl hclo clo o3 or s2o8 2 chiang et al 1995 comninellis 1994 deng et al 2020 mandal et al 2017 the anodic material plays a crucial role in determining the types yields and rates of generation of the oxidants depending on whether the surface adsorbed oh can interact with the material to form the so called higher oxide electrodes be categorized as active electrodes e g graphite platinum iro2 and ruo2 and nonactive electrodes e g boron doped diamond bdd panizza and cerisola 2009 sun et al 2021 although both active and nonactive electrodes have been applied for treatment of landfill leachate the degradation kinetics of dom have been mainly evaluated based on the changes of bulk water quality parameters such as chemical oxidation demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc and changes of the uv absorbance and fluorescence spectra feng et al 2021 fernandes et al 2016 moreira et al 2016 panizza and martinez huitle 2013 zhang et al 2020 based on the data of size exclusion chromatography coupled with diode array absorbance fluorescence and organic carbon detectors sec dad fld ocd our recent study revealed that the characteristics of leachate dom from different landfills possessed a high similarity in terms of their uv absorbance spectra fluorescence fingerprints and molecular weight mw distribution jiang et al 2022 however the degradation kinetics of the major sec fractions of leachate dom have not been compared between the eo with active or nonactive electrodes in addition the post processing of the sec chromatograms with two dimensional correlation analysis 2dcos can provide more information concerning gradual changes of dom as a function of mw with increasing reaction time aftab and hur 2019 besides dom degradation rates the energy efficiency and formation of oxidation byproducts are the major concerns for the application and optimization of eo process for an eo process under mass transport control the maximum oxidation rate of dom i e reactor duty can be defined via the concept of the limiting current density ilim which is dependent only on the dom concentration and hydrodynamic conditions panizza and cerisola 2009 when the applied current density iappl is lower than ilim increasing current density would increase the oxidation rates of dom components however when iappl exceeds the ilim the current efficiency decreases because a portion of the current is wasted on the oxygen or chlorine evolution reactions owing to the high chloride concentration in landfill leachate consideration must also be given to the production of chlorate and perchlorate ions during the eo process utilizing bdd anodes and other electrode materials pérez et al 2012 yang et al 2019 yang 2020 in order to achieve a trade off between the oxidation of dom and the energy consumption or the generation of undesired oxyhalides the iappl may need to be adjusted in multiple steps so that it does not exceed the instantaneous ilim panizza et al 2008 because it is difficult to determine a priori the instantaneous ilim it is necessary to develop surrogate indicators suitable for optimization and control of eo treatment of landfill leachate or other matrices this work aims to quantify the changes of dom fractions and formation of oxyhalides during electrochemical treatment of landfill leachate with representative active and nonactive anode materials and to develop spectroscopic indicators for online optimization and control of eo treatment sec dad fld ocd chromatograms coupled with 2dcos analysis were used to characterize the degradation behavior and kinetics of leachate dom fractions effect of current density and mass ratios of doc cl on the degradation of dom energy consumption and production of oxyhalides were investigated in detail for the nonactive bdd anode materials the changes of absorbance spectra of landfill leachate during its electrochemical treatment were further analyzed in order to develop absorbance based spectroscopic indicators suitable for fast and reliable optimization and online control of eo treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 landfill leachate samples leachate sample a was collected from a municipal solid waste landfill located near the city of zunyi in guizhou province china this leachate was treated by the a2o activated sludge process leachate sample b was collected from another landfill in ziyang sichuan province this sample represents the concentrate generated in reverse osmosis ro membrane leachate treatment water quality parameters of these landfill leachates are summarized in table s1 these landfill leachate samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and stored at 4 c to preserve the wastewater 2 2 electrochemical oxidation experiments eo experiments were conducted in batches at room temperature 22 25 c the undivided electrochemical cell was filled with 120 ml of landfill leachate and stirred at 600 rpm with a magnetic stirrer fig s1a no additional background electrolyte was added to the leachate the electrolysis current was controlled by an external power supply to investigate the effect of anode material ti ti sno2 sb2o5 ti ruo2 iro2 graphite and bdd film were used as anodes a ti cathode was employed in all experiments both the anodes and cathodes were rectangular plates with dimensions of 5 cm 2 5 cm active geometric area 12 5 cm2 which were placed parallel with a constant inter electrode distance of 2 cm these eo experiments were performed at an applied current density of 30 ma cm2 to treat with leachate a given that the diffusion of hydrogen and oxygen might affect the oxidation efficiency another configuration was set up using a proton exchange membrane nafion n 117 membrane 0 180 mm thick 0 90 mequiv g exchange capacity to divide the electrochemical cell into dual chambers fig s1b both chambers were filled with 120 ml of leachate a these eo experiments were conducted with bdd film anode and ti cathode at a current density of 30 ma cm2 to investigate the effects of current density on the degradation of dom energy consumption and formation of oxidation byproducts the eo treatment of leachate a were performed using bdd film anode and ti cathode in undivided electrochemical cell with the current densities ranging from 10 to 50 ma cm2 in addition the eo treatments with a constant current density of 30 ma cm2 were performed on the mixtures of leachate a and b this was done to explore the effect of the concentrations of dom and chloride on the formation of chlorate and perchlorate 2 3 analytical methods the sec dad fld ocd system was assembled by coupling an agilent 1260 hplc system with a diode array detector dad agilent 1290 infinity ii g7117b a fluorescence detector fld agilent 1260 infinity ii g1721b and an online organic carbon detector turbo sievers m9sec toc analyzer suez cai et al 2020 a size exclusion column 20 mm 250 mm packed with tsk hw 50s resin material was installed for molecular weight separation and the mobile phase was prepared as a 1 5 g l na2hpo4 2h2o 2 5 g l kh2po4 phosphate buffer the flow rate of mobile phase was set at 1 0 ml min and the injection volume was 500 μl for each sample the dad parameters were set from 200 nm to 400 nm or 500 nm with a 2 nm wavelength increment for a multiple absorbance scan the fld was run for a multi emission scan with the em wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 500 nm and the ex wavelength fixed at 230 nm or for a multi excitation scan with the ex wavelength ranging from 200 nm to 400 nm and the em wavelength fixed at 460 nm the fld had a reference diode to record the light intensity passing through the flow cells for automatic correction of inner filter effects in fluorescence spectra molecular weights of the sec chromatograms were calibrated via the organic carbon detector fig s2 the 2d synchronous syn and asynchronous asyn correlation analyses were conducted to post process the sec ocd chromatograms of dom as a function of reaction time during the electrochemical oxidation treatment using the publicly downloadable program 2dshige aftab and hur 2019 noda and ozaki 2005 with necessary dilutions of leachate samples the agilent 8453 uv visible spectrophotometer was used to record the uv vis absorbance spectra and the ion chromatography ics 5000 dionex usa with as 19 column was used to determine the concentrations of cl clo2 clo3 and clo4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and identification of dom components in landfill leachates figs 1 and s3 illustrate the sec dad fld ocd chromatograms of the biologically treated landfill leachate and the ro concentrated landfill leachate samples as well as their mixed solutions despite their different origins dom in these two landfill leachates possessed similar characteristics in terms of their uv vis absorbance spectra fluorescence fingerprints and mw distribution which can be classified into five major fractions including the biopolymers bp 20 kda humic like acids ha 2 5 20 kda fulvic like acids fa 1 4 2 5 kda building blocks of humic substances bb 0 45 1 4 kda and low molecular weight substances lmws 0 45 kda huber et al 2011 jiang et al 2022 the biopolymer fraction showed relatively weak protein like fluorescence at ex230 em340 nm and contributed to 3 5 and 18 4 of doc concentration in leachate a and b respectively the ha fraction showed the highest uv absorbance at 254 nm and predominantly contributed to the visible absorbance at λ 400 nm this fraction also contributed to 59 5 and 43 0 of doc in leachate a and b respectively it may be further subdivided to the ha i and ha ii fractions with ha ii fraction exhibiting dual excitation fluorescence peaks at em 440 nm whilst ha i showing no fluorescence the fa fraction possessed the characteristic triple excitation peaks of landfill leachate with ex wavelengths at 250 nm 310 nm and 365 nm and em wavelength at 460 nm jiang et al 2022 the bb fraction also exhibited humic like fluorescence peaks similar to those of ha ii fraction for the lmws fraction the intense peak with uv absorbance 240 nm was attributed to the π π transition of nitrate while the minor peak in the sec ocd chromatogram was attributed to the residual carbonate that had not been completely removed by the inorganic carbon degassing module of ocd cai et al 2020 3 2 effects of anode material and cell configuration on dom degradation 3 2 1 effects of anode material on mw changes of dom components fig 2 shows the sec ocd chromatograms and the corresponding 2d syn and asyn correlation analyses of the eo treated landfill leachate using representative anode materials with increasing reaction time fig s4 further displays the differential sec ocd chromatograms compared to the original landfill leachate as a reference in the 2d syn correlation maps the peaks located on the diagonal line are referred to as auto peaks which are always positive and their intensities represent the overall variation extent against the external perturbation variable i e the reaction time in the 2d asyn correlation maps the cross peaks which are positioned off the diagonal lines with positive or negative signs indicate the occurrence of simultaneous or opposite changes of chromatogram peaks the peaks intensities and signs in the 2d syn and asyn maps were summarized in table s2 and the variation trends and sequences of dom components determined according to the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 in general concentrations of the bp ha and fa fractions exhibited a decreasing trend with the exception of the data for the ti ruo2 iro2 anode which showed an increase of the fa fraction the concentrations of the bb fraction increased in all cases except that of the bdd film anode the ti anode and ti sno2 sb2o5 anodes had similar patterns in their 2d syn maps but not in their 2d asyn maps whereas the ti sno2 sb2o5 and ti ruo2 iro2 anodes exhibited dissimilar 2d syn maps but comparable 2d asyn maps the dom degradation sequence for the ti anode followed the order of bp ha fa whereas the sequences of ti sno2 sb2o5 and ti ruo2 iro2 were ha bp fa and ha bp respectively the 2d syn and asyn maps suggest that the performance of the graphite and bdd film anodes was distinct from that of the ti based anodes which exhibited dom degradation sequences of ha fa bp and ha fa bb bp 3 2 2 effects of anode material on the degradation kinetics of dom fractions the observed changes of the dom fractions caused by the electrochemical oxidation were quantified further using their peak areas in the sec ocd chromatograms and normalized as c c0 fig 3a e for the bp fractions fig 3a the ti and bdd film anodes could reach 90 removal at a 12 h treatment time the removal could be described by a pseudo first order kinetic model throughout the process in contrast there was an initial 4 h lag stage for the other anodes especially for the ti sno2 sb2o5 anode after the initial lag phase ended the decrease of doc in the second stage could be described by a pseudo first order kinetic model for the ha and fa fractions fig 3b and c only the bdd film anode was able to achieve 95 removal rate and followed the pseudo first order kinetic model throughout the process the other anodes removed ha or fa fractions primarily in the initial stage 4 h and thereafter entered a stable stage as shown in fig 3d increases of the bb fraction were observed for the ti and ti sno2 sb2o5 anodes and graphite this behavior was not explained by the kinetic models due to the highest contribution of the ha fraction to the overall doc concentration the removal of total doc for all anodes fig 3e was comparable to that of the ha fraction the apparent degradation rate constants of the corresponding pseudo first order kinetics were summarized for all dom fractions fig 3f these rates are comparable with the degradation sequences as provided by the 2d syn and asyn maps in fig 2 the differences in the changes of the sec chromatograms of leachate dom during the eo treatment can be attributed to the different pathways of oxidation characteristic for these active and nonactive anode materials these pathways are mediated by i reactions with physisorbed oh radicals generated as a result of water oxidation and ii reactions with chemisorbed active oxygen electrogenerated by the transition of oxygen from the absorbed oh radicals to the lattice of oxide anode comninellis 1994 panizza and cerisola 2009 panizza and martinez huitle 2013 the nonactive bdd film anode may oxidize dom primarily via the physisorbed oh radicals on its surface and it also allows a significant fraction of oh radicals to migrate from the surface and oxidize dom in the bulk solution deng et al 2020 due to the strong oxidation ability of oh radicals the electrochemical oxidation with the bdd film anode exhibited the highest rate constants for doc elimination fig 3f the active anodes of ti sno2 sb2o5 and ti ruo2 iro2 material oxidize dom via their reactions with chemisorbed active oxygen panizza and martinez huitle 2013 typically only selective and partial oxidation of dom that resulted in the formation of intermediates as manifested by the observed increases of the bb fractions was observed with these anodes in the presence of high cl concentrations the active anodes can produce free chlorine more readily than the nonactive bdd anode via the volmer heyrovsky mechanism yang 2020 yang et al 2016 compared to the bp fraction the humic like fractions are relatively more abundant in the phenolic moieties and have a higher electron donating capacity aeschbacher et al 2012 consequently the initial lag stage of the electrochemical oxidation of bp with graphite and the ti sno2 sb2o5 or ti ruo2 iro2 anodes can be attributed to the competitive consumption of the chemisorbed active oxygen and free chorine by the electron donating phenolic moieties in the ha fraction fig 3a vs fig 3b the electrochemical oxidation of the ha fraction with the bdd anode shows that the rate constant for ha is higher than those for the other fractions however the ti anode exhibited an exceptionally high removal efficiency for the fractions of large mw biopolymer molecules this may be a result of the acidic denaturation and precipitation of the proteinaceous bp fraction because the electrochemical oxidation leachate dom with the ti anode resulted in an increase in the cell voltage and generated much more h via water electrolysis in all the bdd film anode demonstrated the best performance in terms of the rate and efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate dom 3 2 3 comparison between scc and dcc configuration the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate with the bdd film anode was examined using further undivided single chamber scc and dual chamber configurations dcc effects of these modes of treatment were compared based on the sec ocd chromatograms fig s5 and variations of the doc concentrations of the sec fractions fig s6 fig 4 summarizes the degradation kinetics and reaction rate constants that characterize the pseudo first order kinetics of the oxidation of dom in the scc anode and dcc anode reactions the results demonstrate that the dcc reactor showed a higher reaction rate constant for the mineralization of the bp fraction in contrast the ssc reactors had somewhat higher reaction rate constants in the elimination of the humic like fractions ha fa and bb and the total doc concentration after 8 hours treatment both scc and dcc configurations had almost the same level of dom removal intriguingly the dcc cathode was also capable of removing 60 of the bp fraction whilst the other fractions did not undergo any significant changes in the cathodic compartment fig s6 the acidic and alkaline ph developed in the anodic and cathodic compartment of the dcc reactor are likely to have resulted in the denaturation and precipitation of proteinaceous biopolymers but in practical terms the observed enhancement of the removal of the bp fraction was not necessarily desirable because this fraction is readily biodegradable jiang et al 2022 the data show that the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate using a dcc configuration may not offer sufficient economical and other benefits especially given the potential fouling of the proton exchange membrane 3 3 optimization and control of the electrochemical oxidation with bdd film anode 3 3 1 relationships between current density reaction rate and energy efficiency figs 5a and s7 illustrate the degradation kinetics of dom total doc and its sec ocd fractions for the eo treatment of leachate a under a set of current densities ranging from 10 ma cm2 to 50 ma cm2 fig 5b summarizes the corresponding pseudo first order reaction rate constants increasing the current density from 10 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 was observed to significantly accelerate the mineralization of dom with a nearly proportional rise in the reaction rate constants of total doc at 30 ma cm2 the time necessary to mineralize dom to c c0 0 3 was reduced from 6 h at 10 ma cm2 to 2 8 h this trend was consistent with the expected formation of oh radicals available for direct dom oxidation at increased current densities however the degradation of dom was not significantly accelerated by further increase of the current density to 50 ma cm2 and only a small increment in the rate constants was observed particularly for the bp and bb fractions the current efficiency of the eo process is affected by the local concentration of oh relative to dom concentration at the anode surface and thus there is a limiting current density ilim depending on the mass transport of dom to the anode surface i e dom concentration and hydrodynamic conditions gherardini et al 2001 panizza and cerisola 2009 panizza et al 2008 figs 5c and s8 show the mineralization of dom and changes of its sec fractions as a function of energy consumption respectively the plots could be separated into two distinct stages characterized by c c0 inflection points in the range of c c0 0 1 0 3 in the first stage the steep slopes suggest that the energy consumption was mostly distributed to the mineralization of dom for the current density at 10 ma cm2 the normalized dom concentration c c0 declined approximately linearly as a function of energy consumption r2 0 98 indicating that the applied current density iappl was continuously lower than the instantaneous ilim in this stage in the second stage the flat slopes of the plots suggest that the iappl became much higher than the instantaneous ilim as the results of decreasing dom concentrations when the current density increased the plots shifted towards a larger energy consumption for instance to achieve a c c0 0 3 threshold the energy consumption at 50 ma cm2 was 111 87 kwh m3 which is 3 24 times of the corresponding value at 10 ma cm2 thus the majority of energy was consumed in this stage by side reactions of oxygen and chlorine evolution panizza et al 2008 to achieve an acceptably high reaction rate and energy efficiency the eo treatment should be carried with a continuous or multi step decrease of current density ensuring that the iappl does not exceed the instantaneous ilim for instance when c c0 is 0 5 a 30 ma cm2 current density can be applied but when c c0 decreases from 0 5 to 0 3 the current density can be decreased to 20 ma cm2 when c c0 is less than 0 3 a lower current density should be adopted to reduce side reactions however the online monitoring of doc changes requires complicated and expensive instruments with needs of replenishing chemical reagents and the spectroscopic surrogate indicators should be further developed to optimize and control the eo processes 3 3 2 development of spectroscopic indicators for process optimization the changes of the uv vis absorbance spectra of the diluted landfill leachate with increasing eo treatment time when using the bdd film anode operated at varying current densities are illustrated in figs 6a and s9 these figures show that the absorbance intensity decreased primarily at wavelengths 240 nm however a nearly symmetrical peak located in the wavelength range 250 nm to 330 nm and a maximum at 290 nm was observed to emerge and then vanished with increasing oxidation time similar phenomena were also observed for the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate with ti ruo2 or ti tio2 ruo2 anodes in prior studies pinhedo et al 2005 xiao et al 2013 but their explanations of this absorbance band as the n π transition of carboxylic groups or the π π transition of the phenolic groups are debatable inferred from the differential absorbance spectra produced by the ph titration and sec dad analysis figs s10 and s11 this absorbance band at λ 290 nm should be associated with the generation of free chlorine hclo clo pka 7 5 at 25 c as results of the side reactions of chlorine evolution when iappl ilim consistently the occurrence of absorbance band at λ 290 nm became more pronounced when the current densities increased from 10 ma cm2 to 50 ma cm2 the insert of fig 6a thus the emergence of the absorbance band at 290 nm can be used as an indicator of the occurrence of chlorine evolution reactions for the online monitoring the uv absorbance of non diluted landfill leachates usually exceeded the range of reliable absorbance measurements and it is also affected by the formation of hclo clo thus the absorbance at 420 nm visible wavelength abs420 was chosen to reflect changes of the properties of landfill leachate dom particularly the behavior of its ha fraction in addition abs420 can be easily and economically monitored by a miniaturized spectrophotometer using the 420 nm blue light led as the light source figs 6b and s12 illustrates changes of doc concentrations of leachate dom and its sec components as a function of the decrease of abs420 these changes can be separated into two distinct stages during the initial stage the decrease of doc concentration and that of its ha fraction were linearly correlated with abs420 decreases particularly at a 10 ma cm2 current density at the end of the linear range a 90 drop in abs420 correlated with a 65 80 mineralization of bulk doc or ha fraction however the degradation of the large mw bp fraction mainly occurred in the second stage and meanwhile the side reactions of oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution predominated over the energy consumption fig 6c these inflections in the plots of doc removal or energy consumption vs the decrease of abs420 coincided with the emergency of the absorbance band at λ 290 nm i e formation of free chlorine formation of clo3 and clo4 as a function of the decrease of abs420 for the eo treatment of landfill leachates with bdd anode are shown in fig s13 respectively fig 7 further demonstrates the variations of the concentrations of chlorine species normalized by the initial chloride concentration cl 0 these plots consistently show two distinct stages with the inflection points at about 90 decrease of abs420 nm in the initial stage the normalized chloride concentration cl cl 0 declined gradually to as low as 0 8 and meanwhile the yields of clo2 clo3 and clo4 were negligible compared to the losses of cl this can be explained by that the electrochemically generated reactive oxygen species and chlorine species were consumed in their reactions with leachate dom especially the ha fractions which suppressed the pathways of the formation of hclo clo species in this stage the losses of cl might be related to the generation of organochlorine species once these dom fractions were mostly degraded i e the applied current density iappl was much larger than the instantaneous ilim the side reactions of oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution became prevalent long et al 2021 pérez et al 2012 free chlorine hclo clo will undergo a combination of direct electron transfer and oh mediated oxidation to form clo3 and clo4 long et al 2021 yang et al 2019 yang 2020 it can be seen that with further decreases in abs420 in the second stage some plots of cl cl 0 clo3 cl 0 and clo4 cl 0 exhibited almost vertical slopes referring to the plots of the eo treatment of leachate a using the bdd anode with a current density of 30 ma cm2 bdd 30 leachate a increasing the current density had promoted the yields of clo3 and clo4 while decreasing the current density had suppressed the yields of clo3 and clo4 on the other hand when increasing the mass ratios of doc cl from 0 142 leachate a to 0 437 leachate b the yields of clo3 and clo4 could also be significantly suppressed these results show that the decrease of abs420 during the eo treatment of landfill leachate can be used to indicate i the shift of oxidation from predominantly humic substances to the large mw biopolymers ii the occurrence of side reactions of oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution and iii the substantial formation of chlorate and perchlorate the inflection points of the decreases of abs420 for each current density can be inferred from the occurrence of an absorbance band at λ 290 nm i e formation of chlorine 4 conclusions the sec dad fld ocd chromatograms were used to investigate the degradation behaviors of dom fractions during the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachates with different anode materials reaction chamber design and current densities the humic like ha fraction generally had the highest reaction rates except for the occurrence of the ph induced denaturation and precipitation of the large mw proteinaceous bp fraction the absorbance of leachate at 420 nm abs420 was found to be a good surrogate parameter for dom concentration especially the ha fraction and the decrease of abs420 can be used to indicate the shift from the energy efficient oxidation of dom to the side reactions of chlorine evolution as well as the subsequent formation of chlorate and perchlorate to achieve a compromise between dom degradation rate and energy efficiency the eo treatment of landfill leachate with bdd anode can be optimized by adjusting the current density with the online monitoring of abs420 ensuring that the iappl does not exceed the instantaneous ilim declaration of

is an attractive option for treatment of dissolved organic matter dom in landfill leachate but concerns remain over the energy efficiency and formation of oxidation byproducts clo3 and clo4 in this study eo treatment of landfill leachates was carried out using representative active and nonactive anode materials cell configurations and current densities size exclusion chromatograms coupled with 2d synchronous and asynchronous correlation analysis showed that the sensitivity of dom fractions to eo degradation was dependent on the anode material the nonactive boron doped diamond bdd anode demonstrated the best performance for dom oxidation the humic acid like fraction ha 2 5 20 kda predominated the visible absorbance of landfill leachates at λ 400 nm and it generally had the highest reaction rates except the occurrence of the ph induced denaturation and precipitation of the proteinaceous biopolymer fraction bp 20 kda during the eo treatment of landfill leachate with bdd anode the uv absorbance spectra of landfill leachates at wavelengths 400 nm were affected by the formation of free chlorine instead the decrease of abs420 was found to be a good indicator of the shift of the oxidation from predominantly ha fraction to the proteinaceous bp fraction the behavior of the abs420 parameter was also indicative of the transition from the energy efficient oxidation of dom to the dominance of side reactions of chlorine evolution and the subsequent formation of clo3 and clo4 these findings suggest that the eo treatment of landfill leachate can be optimized by adjusting the current density with feedback signals from the online monitoring of abs420 to achieve a trade off between degradation of dom and control of clo3 and clo4 graphical abstract image graphical abstract

introduction sanitary landfilling is still the most effective economical and environmentally acceptable method to dispose of municipal and industrial solid waste in countries worldwide however an inevitable and unpleasant consequence of this practice is the generation of leachate which is usually characterized by high concentrations of dissolved organic matter dom high salinity and high toxicity levels teng et al 2021 leachates discharged from aged landfills tend to have high levels of bio refractory organic matter e g humic like substances jiang et al 2022 which necessitates the implementation of physio chemical treatment processes in combination with biological treatment processes in recent years the electrochemical oxidation eo treatment has been shown to be promising for landfill leachate due to its high efficacy in degrading refractory dom and lack of need to store additional chemicals deng and englehardt 2007 deng et al 2020 golwala et al 2022 guo et al 2022 mandal et al 2017 teng et al 2021 in eo treatment dom can be degraded by direct oxidation on the anode surface via anodic electro transfer reaction and or indirect oxidation by in situ electrogenerated oxidants e g oh cl hclo clo o3 or s2o8 2 chiang et al 1995 comninellis 1994 deng et al 2020 mandal et al 2017 the anodic material plays a crucial role in determining the types yields and rates of generation of the oxidants depending on whether the surface adsorbed oh can interact with the material to form the so called higher oxide electrodes be categorized as active electrodes e g graphite platinum iro2 and ruo2 and nonactive electrodes e g boron doped diamond bdd panizza and cerisola 2009 sun et al 2021 although both active and nonactive electrodes have been applied for treatment of landfill leachate the degradation kinetics of dom have been mainly evaluated based on the changes of bulk water quality parameters such as chemical oxidation demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc and changes of the uv absorbance and fluorescence spectra feng et al 2021 fernandes et al 2016 moreira et al 2016 panizza and martinez huitle 2013 zhang et al 2020 based on the data of size exclusion chromatography coupled with diode array absorbance fluorescence and organic carbon detectors sec dad fld ocd our recent study revealed that the characteristics of leachate dom from different landfills possessed a high similarity in terms of their uv absorbance spectra fluorescence fingerprints and molecular weight mw distribution jiang et al 2022 however the degradation kinetics of the major sec fractions of leachate dom have not been compared between the eo with active or nonactive electrodes in addition the post processing of the sec chromatograms with two dimensional correlation analysis 2dcos can provide more information concerning gradual changes of dom as a function of mw with increasing reaction time aftab and hur 2019 besides dom degradation rates the energy efficiency and formation of oxidation byproducts are the major concerns for the application and optimization of eo process for an eo process under mass transport control the maximum oxidation rate of dom i e reactor duty can be defined via the concept of the limiting current density ilim which is dependent only on the dom concentration and hydrodynamic conditions panizza and cerisola 2009 when the applied current density iappl is lower than ilim increasing current density would increase the oxidation rates of dom components however when iappl exceeds the ilim the current efficiency decreases because a portion of the current is wasted on the oxygen or chlorine evolution reactions owing to the high chloride concentration in landfill leachate consideration must also be given to the production of chlorate and perchlorate ions during the eo process utilizing bdd anodes and other electrode materials pérez et al 2012 yang et al 2019 yang 2020 in order to achieve a trade off between the oxidation of dom and the energy consumption or the generation of undesired oxyhalides the iappl may need to be adjusted in multiple steps so that it does not exceed the instantaneous ilim panizza et al 2008 because it is difficult to determine a priori the instantaneous ilim it is necessary to develop surrogate indicators suitable for optimization and control of eo treatment of landfill leachate or other matrices this work aims to quantify the changes of dom fractions and formation of oxyhalides during electrochemical treatment of landfill leachate with representative active and nonactive anode materials and to develop spectroscopic indicators for online optimization and control of eo treatment sec dad fld ocd chromatograms coupled with 2dcos analysis were used to characterize the degradation behavior and kinetics of leachate dom fractions effect of current density and mass ratios of doc cl on the degradation of dom energy consumption and production of oxyhalides were investigated in detail for the nonactive bdd anode materials the changes of absorbance spectra of landfill leachate during its electrochemical treatment were further analyzed in order to develop absorbance based spectroscopic indicators suitable for fast and reliable optimization and online control of eo treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 landfill leachate samples leachate sample a was collected from a municipal solid waste landfill located near the city of zunyi in guizhou province china this leachate was treated by the a2o activated sludge process leachate sample b was collected from another landfill in ziyang sichuan province this sample represents the concentrate generated in reverse osmosis ro membrane leachate treatment water quality parameters of these landfill leachates are summarized in table s1 these landfill leachate samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and stored at 4 c to preserve the wastewater 2 2 electrochemical oxidation experiments eo experiments were conducted in batches at room temperature 22 25 c the undivided electrochemical cell was filled with 120 ml of landfill leachate and stirred at 600 rpm with a magnetic stirrer fig s1a no additional background electrolyte was added to the leachate the electrolysis current was controlled by an external power supply to investigate the effect of anode material ti ti sno2 sb2o5 ti ruo2 iro2 graphite and bdd film were used as anodes a ti cathode was employed in all experiments both the anodes and cathodes were rectangular plates with dimensions of 5 cm 2 5 cm active geometric area 12 5 cm2 which were placed parallel with a constant inter electrode distance of 2 cm these eo experiments were performed at an applied current density of 30 ma cm2 to treat with leachate a given that the diffusion of hydrogen and oxygen might affect the oxidation efficiency another configuration was set up using a proton exchange membrane nafion n 117 membrane 0 180 mm thick 0 90 mequiv g exchange capacity to divide the electrochemical cell into dual chambers fig s1b both chambers were filled with 120 ml of leachate a these eo experiments were conducted with bdd film anode and ti cathode at a current density of 30 ma cm2 to investigate the effects of current density on the degradation of dom energy consumption and formation of oxidation byproducts the eo treatment of leachate a were performed using bdd film anode and ti cathode in undivided electrochemical cell with the current densities ranging from 10 to 50 ma cm2 in addition the eo treatments with a constant current density of 30 ma cm2 were performed on the mixtures of leachate a and b this was done to explore the effect of the concentrations of dom and chloride on the formation of chlorate and perchlorate 2 3 analytical methods the sec dad fld ocd system was assembled by coupling an agilent 1260 hplc system with a diode array detector dad agilent 1290 infinity ii g7117b a fluorescence detector fld agilent 1260 infinity ii g1721b and an online organic carbon detector turbo sievers m9sec toc analyzer suez cai et al 2020 a size exclusion column 20 mm 250 mm packed with tsk hw 50s resin material was installed for molecular weight separation and the mobile phase was prepared as a 1 5 g l na2hpo4 2h2o 2 5 g l kh2po4 phosphate buffer the flow rate of mobile phase was set at 1 0 ml min and the injection volume was 500 μl for each sample the dad parameters were set from 200 nm to 400 nm or 500 nm with a 2 nm wavelength increment for a multiple absorbance scan the fld was run for a multi emission scan with the em wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 500 nm and the ex wavelength fixed at 230 nm or for a multi excitation scan with the ex wavelength ranging from 200 nm to 400 nm and the em wavelength fixed at 460 nm the fld had a reference diode to record the light intensity passing through the flow cells for automatic correction of inner filter effects in fluorescence spectra molecular weights of the sec chromatograms were calibrated via the organic carbon detector fig s2 the 2d synchronous syn and asynchronous asyn correlation analyses were conducted to post process the sec ocd chromatograms of dom as a function of reaction time during the electrochemical oxidation treatment using the publicly downloadable program 2dshige aftab and hur 2019 noda and ozaki 2005 with necessary dilutions of leachate samples the agilent 8453 uv visible spectrophotometer was used to record the uv vis absorbance spectra and the ion chromatography ics 5000 dionex usa with as 19 column was used to determine the concentrations of cl clo2 clo3 and clo4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and identification of dom components in landfill leachates figs 1 and s3 illustrate the sec dad fld ocd chromatograms of the biologically treated landfill leachate and the ro concentrated landfill leachate samples as well as their mixed solutions despite their different origins dom in these two landfill leachates possessed similar characteristics in terms of their uv vis absorbance spectra fluorescence fingerprints and mw distribution which can be classified into five major fractions including the biopolymers bp 20 kda humic like acids ha 2 5 20 kda fulvic like acids fa 1 4 2 5 kda building blocks of humic substances bb 0 45 1 4 kda and low molecular weight substances lmws 0 45 kda huber et al 2011 jiang et al 2022 the biopolymer fraction showed relatively weak protein like fluorescence at ex230 em340 nm and contributed to 3 5 and 18 4 of doc concentration in leachate a and b respectively the ha fraction showed the highest uv absorbance at 254 nm and predominantly contributed to the visible absorbance at λ 400 nm this fraction also contributed to 59 5 and 43 0 of doc in leachate a and b respectively it may be further subdivided to the ha i and ha ii fractions with ha ii fraction exhibiting dual excitation fluorescence peaks at em 440 nm whilst ha i showing no fluorescence the fa fraction possessed the characteristic triple excitation peaks of landfill leachate with ex wavelengths at 250 nm 310 nm and 365 nm and em wavelength at 460 nm jiang et al 2022 the bb fraction also exhibited humic like fluorescence peaks similar to those of ha ii fraction for the lmws fraction the intense peak with uv absorbance 240 nm was attributed to the π π transition of nitrate while the minor peak in the sec ocd chromatogram was attributed to the residual carbonate that had not been completely removed by the inorganic carbon degassing module of ocd cai et al 2020 3 2 effects of anode material and cell configuration on dom degradation 3 2 1 effects of anode material on mw changes of dom components fig 2 shows the sec ocd chromatograms and the corresponding 2d syn and asyn correlation analyses of the eo treated landfill leachate using representative anode materials with increasing reaction time fig s4 further displays the differential sec ocd chromatograms compared to the original landfill leachate as a reference in the 2d syn correlation maps the peaks located on the diagonal line are referred to as auto peaks which are always positive and their intensities represent the overall variation extent against the external perturbation variable i e the reaction time in the 2d asyn correlation maps the cross peaks which are positioned off the diagonal lines with positive or negative signs indicate the occurrence of simultaneous or opposite changes of chromatogram peaks the peaks intensities and signs in the 2d syn and asyn maps were summarized in table s2 and the variation trends and sequences of dom components determined according to the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 in general concentrations of the bp ha and fa fractions exhibited a decreasing trend with the exception of the data for the ti ruo2 iro2 anode which showed an increase of the fa fraction the concentrations of the bb fraction increased in all cases except that of the bdd film anode the ti anode and ti sno2 sb2o5 anodes had similar patterns in their 2d syn maps but not in their 2d asyn maps whereas the ti sno2 sb2o5 and ti ruo2 iro2 anodes exhibited dissimilar 2d syn maps but comparable 2d asyn maps the dom degradation sequence for the ti anode followed the order of bp ha fa whereas the sequences of ti sno2 sb2o5 and ti ruo2 iro2 were ha bp fa and ha bp respectively the 2d syn and asyn maps suggest that the performance of the graphite and bdd film anodes was distinct from that of the ti based anodes which exhibited dom degradation sequences of ha fa bp and ha fa bb bp 3 2 2 effects of anode material on the degradation kinetics of dom fractions the observed changes of the dom fractions caused by the electrochemical oxidation were quantified further using their peak areas in the sec ocd chromatograms and normalized as c c0 fig 3a e for the bp fractions fig 3a the ti and bdd film anodes could reach 90 removal at a 12 h treatment time the removal could be described by a pseudo first order kinetic model throughout the process in contrast there was an initial 4 h lag stage for the other anodes especially for the ti sno2 sb2o5 anode after the initial lag phase ended the decrease of doc in the second stage could be described by a pseudo first order kinetic model for the ha and fa fractions fig 3b and c only the bdd film anode was able to achieve 95 removal rate and followed the pseudo first order kinetic model throughout the process the other anodes removed ha or fa fractions primarily in the initial stage 4 h and thereafter entered a stable stage as shown in fig 3d increases of the bb fraction were observed for the ti and ti sno2 sb2o5 anodes and graphite this behavior was not explained by the kinetic models due to the highest contribution of the ha fraction to the overall doc concentration the removal of total doc for all anodes fig 3e was comparable to that of the ha fraction the apparent degradation rate constants of the corresponding pseudo first order kinetics were summarized for all dom fractions fig 3f these rates are comparable with the degradation sequences as provided by the 2d syn and asyn maps in fig 2 the differences in the changes of the sec chromatograms of leachate dom during the eo treatment can be attributed to the different pathways of oxidation characteristic for these active and nonactive anode materials these pathways are mediated by i reactions with physisorbed oh radicals generated as a result of water oxidation and ii reactions with chemisorbed active oxygen electrogenerated by the transition of oxygen from the absorbed oh radicals to the lattice of oxide anode comninellis 1994 panizza and cerisola 2009 panizza and martinez huitle 2013 the nonactive bdd film anode may oxidize dom primarily via the physisorbed oh radicals on its surface and it also allows a significant fraction of oh radicals to migrate from the surface and oxidize dom in the bulk solution deng et al 2020 due to the strong oxidation ability of oh radicals the electrochemical oxidation with the bdd film anode exhibited the highest rate constants for doc elimination fig 3f the active anodes of ti sno2 sb2o5 and ti ruo2 iro2 material oxidize dom via their reactions with chemisorbed active oxygen panizza and martinez huitle 2013 typically only selective and partial oxidation of dom that resulted in the formation of intermediates as manifested by the observed increases of the bb fractions was observed with these anodes in the presence of high cl concentrations the active anodes can produce free chlorine more readily than the nonactive bdd anode via the volmer heyrovsky mechanism yang 2020 yang et al 2016 compared to the bp fraction the humic like fractions are relatively more abundant in the phenolic moieties and have a higher electron donating capacity aeschbacher et al 2012 consequently the initial lag stage of the electrochemical oxidation of bp with graphite and the ti sno2 sb2o5 or ti ruo2 iro2 anodes can be attributed to the competitive consumption of the chemisorbed active oxygen and free chorine by the electron donating phenolic moieties in the ha fraction fig 3a vs fig 3b the electrochemical oxidation of the ha fraction with the bdd anode shows that the rate constant for ha is higher than those for the other fractions however the ti anode exhibited an exceptionally high removal efficiency for the fractions of large mw biopolymer molecules this may be a result of the acidic denaturation and precipitation of the proteinaceous bp fraction because the electrochemical oxidation leachate dom with the ti anode resulted in an increase in the cell voltage and generated much more h via water electrolysis in all the bdd film anode demonstrated the best performance in terms of the rate and efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate dom 3 2 3 comparison between scc and dcc configuration the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate with the bdd film anode was examined using further undivided single chamber scc and dual chamber configurations dcc effects of these modes of treatment were compared based on the sec ocd chromatograms fig s5 and variations of the doc concentrations of the sec fractions fig s6 fig 4 summarizes the degradation kinetics and reaction rate constants that characterize the pseudo first order kinetics of the oxidation of dom in the scc anode and dcc anode reactions the results demonstrate that the dcc reactor showed a higher reaction rate constant for the mineralization of the bp fraction in contrast the ssc reactors had somewhat higher reaction rate constants in the elimination of the humic like fractions ha fa and bb and the total doc concentration after 8 hours treatment both scc and dcc configurations had almost the same level of dom removal intriguingly the dcc cathode was also capable of removing 60 of the bp fraction whilst the other fractions did not undergo any significant changes in the cathodic compartment fig s6 the acidic and alkaline ph developed in the anodic and cathodic compartment of the dcc reactor are likely to have resulted in the denaturation and precipitation of proteinaceous biopolymers but in practical terms the observed enhancement of the removal of the bp fraction was not necessarily desirable because this fraction is readily biodegradable jiang et al 2022 the data show that the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate using a dcc configuration may not offer sufficient economical and other benefits especially given the potential fouling of the proton exchange membrane 3 3 optimization and control of the electrochemical oxidation with bdd film anode 3 3 1 relationships between current density reaction rate and energy efficiency figs 5a and s7 illustrate the degradation kinetics of dom total doc and its sec ocd fractions for the eo treatment of leachate a under a set of current densities ranging from 10 ma cm2 to 50 ma cm2 fig 5b summarizes the corresponding pseudo first order reaction rate constants increasing the current density from 10 ma cm2 to 30 ma cm2 was observed to significantly accelerate the mineralization of dom with a nearly proportional rise in the reaction rate constants of total doc at 30 ma cm2 the time necessary to mineralize dom to c c0 0 3 was reduced from 6 h at 10 ma cm2 to 2 8 h this trend was consistent with the expected formation of oh radicals available for direct dom oxidation at increased current densities however the degradation of dom was not significantly accelerated by further increase of the current density to 50 ma cm2 and only a small increment in the rate constants was observed particularly for the bp and bb fractions the current efficiency of the eo process is affected by the local concentration of oh relative to dom concentration at the anode surface and thus there is a limiting current density ilim depending on the mass transport of dom to the anode surface i e dom concentration and hydrodynamic conditions gherardini et al 2001 panizza and cerisola 2009 panizza et al 2008 figs 5c and s8 show the mineralization of dom and changes of its sec fractions as a function of energy consumption respectively the plots could be separated into two distinct stages characterized by c c0 inflection points in the range of c c0 0 1 0 3 in the first stage the steep slopes suggest that the energy consumption was mostly distributed to the mineralization of dom for the current density at 10 ma cm2 the normalized dom concentration c c0 declined approximately linearly as a function of energy consumption r2 0 98 indicating that the applied current density iappl was continuously lower than the instantaneous ilim in this stage in the second stage the flat slopes of the plots suggest that the iappl became much higher than the instantaneous ilim as the results of decreasing dom concentrations when the current density increased the plots shifted towards a larger energy consumption for instance to achieve a c c0 0 3 threshold the energy consumption at 50 ma cm2 was 111 87 kwh m3 which is 3 24 times of the corresponding value at 10 ma cm2 thus the majority of energy was consumed in this stage by side reactions of oxygen and chlorine evolution panizza et al 2008 to achieve an acceptably high reaction rate and energy efficiency the eo treatment should be carried with a continuous or multi step decrease of current density ensuring that the iappl does not exceed the instantaneous ilim for instance when c c0 is 0 5 a 30 ma cm2 current density can be applied but when c c0 decreases from 0 5 to 0 3 the current density can be decreased to 20 ma cm2 when c c0 is less than 0 3 a lower current density should be adopted to reduce side reactions however the online monitoring of doc changes requires complicated and expensive instruments with needs of replenishing chemical reagents and the spectroscopic surrogate indicators should be further developed to optimize and control the eo processes 3 3 2 development of spectroscopic indicators for process optimization the changes of the uv vis absorbance spectra of the diluted landfill leachate with increasing eo treatment time when using the bdd film anode operated at varying current densities are illustrated in figs 6a and s9 these figures show that the absorbance intensity decreased primarily at wavelengths 240 nm however a nearly symmetrical peak located in the wavelength range 250 nm to 330 nm and a maximum at 290 nm was observed to emerge and then vanished with increasing oxidation time similar phenomena were also observed for the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachate with ti ruo2 or ti tio2 ruo2 anodes in prior studies pinhedo et al 2005 xiao et al 2013 but their explanations of this absorbance band as the n π transition of carboxylic groups or the π π transition of the phenolic groups are debatable inferred from the differential absorbance spectra produced by the ph titration and sec dad analysis figs s10 and s11 this absorbance band at λ 290 nm should be associated with the generation of free chlorine hclo clo pka 7 5 at 25 c as results of the side reactions of chlorine evolution when iappl ilim consistently the occurrence of absorbance band at λ 290 nm became more pronounced when the current densities increased from 10 ma cm2 to 50 ma cm2 the insert of fig 6a thus the emergence of the absorbance band at 290 nm can be used as an indicator of the occurrence of chlorine evolution reactions for the online monitoring the uv absorbance of non diluted landfill leachates usually exceeded the range of reliable absorbance measurements and it is also affected by the formation of hclo clo thus the absorbance at 420 nm visible wavelength abs420 was chosen to reflect changes of the properties of landfill leachate dom particularly the behavior of its ha fraction in addition abs420 can be easily and economically monitored by a miniaturized spectrophotometer using the 420 nm blue light led as the light source figs 6b and s12 illustrates changes of doc concentrations of leachate dom and its sec components as a function of the decrease of abs420 these changes can be separated into two distinct stages during the initial stage the decrease of doc concentration and that of its ha fraction were linearly correlated with abs420 decreases particularly at a 10 ma cm2 current density at the end of the linear range a 90 drop in abs420 correlated with a 65 80 mineralization of bulk doc or ha fraction however the degradation of the large mw bp fraction mainly occurred in the second stage and meanwhile the side reactions of oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution predominated over the energy consumption fig 6c these inflections in the plots of doc removal or energy consumption vs the decrease of abs420 coincided with the emergency of the absorbance band at λ 290 nm i e formation of free chlorine formation of clo3 and clo4 as a function of the decrease of abs420 for the eo treatment of landfill leachates with bdd anode are shown in fig s13 respectively fig 7 further demonstrates the variations of the concentrations of chlorine species normalized by the initial chloride concentration cl 0 these plots consistently show two distinct stages with the inflection points at about 90 decrease of abs420 nm in the initial stage the normalized chloride concentration cl cl 0 declined gradually to as low as 0 8 and meanwhile the yields of clo2 clo3 and clo4 were negligible compared to the losses of cl this can be explained by that the electrochemically generated reactive oxygen species and chlorine species were consumed in their reactions with leachate dom especially the ha fractions which suppressed the pathways of the formation of hclo clo species in this stage the losses of cl might be related to the generation of organochlorine species once these dom fractions were mostly degraded i e the applied current density iappl was much larger than the instantaneous ilim the side reactions of oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution became prevalent long et al 2021 pérez et al 2012 free chlorine hclo clo will undergo a combination of direct electron transfer and oh mediated oxidation to form clo3 and clo4 long et al 2021 yang et al 2019 yang 2020 it can be seen that with further decreases in abs420 in the second stage some plots of cl cl 0 clo3 cl 0 and clo4 cl 0 exhibited almost vertical slopes referring to the plots of the eo treatment of leachate a using the bdd anode with a current density of 30 ma cm2 bdd 30 leachate a increasing the current density had promoted the yields of clo3 and clo4 while decreasing the current density had suppressed the yields of clo3 and clo4 on the other hand when increasing the mass ratios of doc cl from 0 142 leachate a to 0 437 leachate b the yields of clo3 and clo4 could also be significantly suppressed these results show that the decrease of abs420 during the eo treatment of landfill leachate can be used to indicate i the shift of oxidation from predominantly humic substances to the large mw biopolymers ii the occurrence of side reactions of oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution and iii the substantial formation of chlorate and perchlorate the inflection points of the decreases of abs420 for each current density can be inferred from the occurrence of an absorbance band at λ 290 nm i e formation of chlorine 4 conclusions the sec dad fld ocd chromatograms were used to investigate the degradation behaviors of dom fractions during the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachates with different anode materials reaction chamber design and current densities the humic like ha fraction generally had the highest reaction rates except for the occurrence of the ph induced denaturation and precipitation of the large mw proteinaceous bp fraction the absorbance of leachate at 420 nm abs420 was found to be a good surrogate parameter for dom concentration especially the ha fraction and the decrease of abs420 can be used to indicate the shift from the energy efficient oxidation of dom to the side reactions of chlorine evolution as well as the subsequent formation of chlorate and perchlorate to achieve a compromise between dom degradation rate and energy efficiency the eo treatment of landfill leachate with bdd anode can be optimized by adjusting the current density with the online monitoring of abs420 ensuring that the iappl does not exceed the instantaneous ilim declaration of

from those in the surrounding media niu et al 2021 studies have further explored the biofilm on the surface of microplastics and other media and found that their community structures are different niu et al 2021 in addition kirstein et al 2018 found that different types of mps were selective to microorganisms that is microorganisms closely attached to the surface of different types of mps had endemic community structures seeley et al 2020 found that petroleum based mps not only affected the microbial community on the microplastic surface but also significantly affected the microbial community structure and nitrogen transformation process in the surrounding sediments to sum up most research only studied the characteristics of microbial communities on the surface of mps and the similarities and differences of microbial communities on different types of mps at present the research on mps degradation potential of microbial communities on the surface of mps is very limited the complete removal of complex polymer pollutants in the natural environment often requires the joint action of different kinds of microorganisms akbari et al 2021 gu et al 2022 li et al 2022 meyer cifuentes et al 2020 singh et al 2016 wang et al 2019 therefore it is the key link to reveal the degradation law of mps in natural water to systematically clarify the cooperative degradation mechanism of mps degrading bacteria to mps compared with the research on mps in a freshwater environment the research on mps in the marine environment is very leading wagner et al 2014 despite this at present the research in the marine field only discusses the microbial degradation of biodegradable mps from the perspective of microbial community synergy meyer cifuentes et al 2020 as for the synergistic degradation of microbial communities in petroleum based refractory mps the researchers tried to explain it by using the method of reference species niu et al 2021 it has to be said that this method has promoted the research on the synergistic degradation of microbial communities in petroleum based mps to some extent but it may over amplify the potential mps degrading bacterial community in general the research on microbial synergistic degradation of petroleum based microplastics pe and pp is still in the initial stage in natural environments the knowledge of the pe pp degrading flora is rare such as their ecological characteristics are unknown the species and abundance of different types of petroleum based microplastics degrading flora are unknown and their distribution in natural rivers is also unknown understanding the composition and distribution of pe pp degrading bacteria in the natural river is important for the management and control of microplastic pollution in this study potential pe pp degrading bacterial communities were enriched and screened via outdoor and indoor culture experiments for 1150 days 1 to analyze the diversity and abundance of potential pe pp degrading bacterial communities in microplastic biofilms 2 to discuss the ecological characteristics of pe pp degrading bacteria and 3 to explore the distribution characteristics of pe pp degrading bacteria in natural rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 outdoor in situ experiment an in situ experimental site s was set up in december 2018 in the qinhuai river nanjing where additives containing commercial microplastics pp and pe were sealed in a wire mesh and placed 1 0 m below the overlying water noted as s1 and 0 5 m below the sediments noted as s2 of the river after 2 years the microplastics in the overlying water and sediments were sampled and the biofilms of microplastics were extracted following the method of meyer cifuentes et al 2020 a portion of the biofilm was used for dna extraction and high throughput sequencing and the other portion was used as the source of microorganisms for indoor experiments fig 1 2 2 indoor enrichment experiment pe and pp sigma aldrich america used in indoor experiments are pure resin products without additives with a thickness of 0 55 mm the inorganic salt medium kannahi and sudha 2013 with 2 g l membranous pp mps and pe mps as the only carbon source was used as the enrichment medium table s1 stationary culture at 28 for 21 days is one cycle noted as tn n is the number of cycles that have been cultured unless otherwise specified all cultures were carried out in this condition the biofilms obtained from outdoor experiments were inoculated separately into 10 ml of enrichment medium according to the type of environmental medium and the type of microplastic for incubation specifically 0 01 tryptone 1 glucose noted as 1 and 0 01 tryptone noted as 2 were added to the medium in the first incubation cycle to stimulate microbial growth at the end of each cycle of incubation 1 ml of enrichment solution was aspirated and added to 9 ml of new enrichment medium and a new cycle of incubation was started under the above conditions fig 1 a total of 20 cycles of indoor experiments were conducted and dna extraction and high throughput sequencing were performed separately for the enriched bacteria in the 21st day of t0 t8 t12 t16 and t20 and in days 0 3 7 14 and 21 of t20 2 3 collection of environmental samples in this study the overlying water noted as 1 and sediment noted as 2 samples were collected in 9 sites a h and s across the qinhuai river in nanjing jiangsu china in march 2022 table s2 before collecting each sample the water sampler and sediments bucket were cleaned with river water to clean the residues in the instrument samples were placed in glass containers and stored at 4 c and transported back to the laboratory for subsequent dna extraction and physicochemical index monitoring 2 4 dna extraction and sequencing dna extraction and high throughput sequencing were performed concerning the method of niu et al 2021 in particular the microplastics were initially washed to remove impurities before dna extraction from the microplastic surface biofilm and the colonies were centrifuged before dna extraction from the indoor culture colonies all sequence data obtained in this study were deposited in the sequence read archive sra of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under accession number prjna889246 2 5 characterization of microplastic degradation properties in this study the degradation characteristics of pe pp were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy ftir confocal laser scanning microscope clsm gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms and gel permeation chromatography gpc see text s1 in supporting material for details 2 6 screening of pe pp degrading bacteria microbial communities tend to be simple under the stress of a single carbon source goldford et al 2018 if otus can grow independently with a single carbon source from mps and their relative abundance continues to increase it indicates that otus may have a gene that metabolizes a single carbon source from mps the resuscitation mechanism of microorganisms in enrichment culture means that enrichment culture helps some species adapt and grow on the culture medium and then contributes to the resuscitation of dormant bacteria mu et al 2018a based on the above theories this study identified pe pp degrading bacteria at the otu level otus that were present in all sequencing cycles and remained stable or increasing in relative abundance were defined as core pe pp degrading bacteria c bacteria otus that were below the detection line or silent in the early part of the sequencing cycle and appeared in the later part of the sequencing cycle and their relative abundance remained stable or increased were defined as recovering pe pp degrading bacteria r bacteria c bacteria and r bacteria are collectively referred to as empirical pe pp degrading bacteria d bacteria table 1 in addition the bacteria that have been proven to have the ability to degrade pe pp in freshwater environments are defined as indicatory pe pp degrading bacteria table 2 2 7 identification of pe pp degradation in natural rivers the otu sequences of environmental samples were compared with the otu sequences of the screened d bacteria and a similarity greater than or equal to 97 was considered that this otu was present in the environment thus testing the distribution of d bacteria in natural freshwater environments 2 8 statistical analysis for better visualization all thermal maps in this study were processed with log10 original data 1 for the original data in this study past software https folk uio no ohammer past was used to calculate chao 1 index invsimpson index and the goods coverage of microbial samples in five sequencing cycles in this study principal co ordinates analysis pcoa was used to reveal the β diversity of microbial communities and multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test the significance of microbial community differences in this study r package vegan calculated the spearman correlation coefficient among microorganisms otu and used gephi 0 9 1 http gephi guthub io software combined with the identified pe pp degrading bacteria in mps to analyze and compare the co occurrence network of enriched bacteria in different cycles and the same cycle and different culture time among them the nodes and edges with a p value less than 0 001 and an r value greater than 0 6 are selected for the result analysis of the co occurrence network different roles of each topological node were identified using zi and pi values redundancy analysis rda was performed to evaluate the relationship between the environmental parameters of sediments and the d bacteria using canoco 5 with 999 permutations http www canoco5 com 3 results and discussion 3 1 pe pp were degraded by the enriched bacterial community after the enrichment culture the originally smooth surface of pe pp became rough and showed various complex morphologies such as crack like and pore like fig 2 a and the carbonyl functional groups appeared on its surface fig 2b the above phenomenon is one of the empirical evidence of microbial degradation of microplastics sturm et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b zhou et al 2020 microplastics and the microorganisms colonizing them constitute a unique ecological niche the plastisphere li et al 2021 microplastics can serve as both a substrate for microbial colonization and a carbon source for microorganisms nanthini devi 2021 mughini gras et al 2021 the biofilm on the pe pp surface was visually characterized in this study fig 2c the biofilm on the pe pp surface was dominated by live bacteria indicating a high metabolic activity the presence of dead bodies indicates that on the one hand some bacteria start to die due to limited space and nutrition and on the other hand it may be a natural death due to the growth cycle of the bacteria the presence of extracellular polymer further confirmed that pe pp underwent microbial degradation the density of bacteria on the pe pp surface increased indicating that the microorganisms could better colonize the pe pp surface as the enrichment experiment progressed compared with the samples in the in situ environment tu et al 2020 the microorganisms on the surface of pe pp after enrichment were sparse which implies the difficulty of petroleum based microplastic degradation in addition the results of gc ms of the culture solution revealed the presence of straight chain alkanes and olefins from c19 to c30 in the culture solution fig 2d gpc results showed that the relative molecular masses of the microplastics all decreased after enrichment culture fig 2e based on both of the results it is speculated that the mechanism of microbial degradation of pe pp may be random chain breaking which was consistent with their pyrolysis mechanism goedecke et al 2020 in conclusion the enrichment experiments in this study were successful and microbial degradation of pe pp occurred 3 2 characteristics of the enriched bacterial community the goods coverage index of the enriched microbial communities was all close to 1 fig 3 a indicating that the sequencing depth is reasonable and the depth has covered all the species in the samples the chao 1 index fig 3b and invsimpson fig 3c index of the enriched microbial communities was significantly lower than that of t0 which indicated that the enrichment experiment had a targeted selection of microorganisms and the enrichment experiment was successful however chao 1 and invsimpson index increased slightly at t16 and seemed to increase more obviously at t20 fig 3b c it shows that some bacteria that can use microplastics as a carbon source are revived and their diversity is improved the ability of microorganisms to utilize different carbon sources is different some carbon sources can be utilized directly e g glucose while some substances need a certain adaptation period before they can be utilized the former is known as a fast acting carbon source and the latter is known as a late acting carbon source liu et al 2012 a culture system with microplastics as the only carbon source implies that the microorganisms have only a late acting carbon source the microbial community tends to be simple under the action of a single late acting carbon source goldford et al 2018 and therefore its diversity decreases significantly in the early stages as the enrichment cycle progressed the microbial community under single carbon source stress underwent directional selection shi et al 2022 and some of the bacteria capable of using microplastics as a carbon source were recovered showing a slight increase in diversity pcoa analysis based on the grouping of microplastic types showed that the enriched microbial communities clustered into different groups on the first principal component axis fig s1a suggesting that the microplastic type may be an important factor contributing to the variability of microbial communities the apparent aggregation of microorganisms further suggests that microplastics are selective for microorganisms di pippo et al 2020 wu et al 2019 the overlap of different groups in t20 is presumed to be a convergence of structure and function due to microbial recovery interestingly pcoa results based on microbial source grouping showed a gradual homogenization of microbial communities from different sources as the enrichment cycle progressed fig s1b suggesting that microbial source may not be a critical factor affecting microplastic enrichment flora compared to microplastic type 3 3 characteristics of pe pp degrading bacterial community most of the reported studies on mps degrading bacteria have been conducted using the dominant abundance method kaur et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a while the degradation rate and efficiency of microplastics especially petroleum based microplastics are extremely low and their degrading bacteria may have low abundance properties montazer et al 2020 sánchez 2019 the dominant abundance method for screening degrading bacteria of petroleum based microplastics most likely did not screen out the key groups of bacteria that are involved in their degradation during the screening process this study is the first to apply the relevant theory of microbial ecology to the identification of pe pp degrading bacteria after enrichment there was more than one identifiable taxon in each group indicating that multiple taxa in each group were able to grow independently under conditions of an additional single carbon source this suggests that the genes and pathways that enable each group to metabolize a single applied carbon source of pe pp are distributed across multiple taxa in the community and are not present only in the best competing species goldford et al 2018 enrichment cultures can help certain species to adapt and grow on the medium and contribute to the recovery of dormant bacteria mu et al 2018b based on the above theory this study screened c bacteria and r bacteria based on the variation of otu abundance figs 4 a b and s2 and most of the corresponding genera of c bacteria and r bacteria have been proved to have microplastics degradation potential delacuvellerie et al 2019 devi et al 2019b tables s3 s6 although both pe and pp are non polar crystalline polymers unique methyl side chains of pp result in better rigidity strength and heat resistance making pp more resistant to degradation than pe more types of pp degrading bacteria were screened in this study than pe figs 4b and s2 but in lower abundance than pe fig 5 a probably due to the more diverse microbial interactions required for the degradation of pp due to its refractory nature s2 provided more d bacteria than s1 fig 5a presumably because the sediment environment has a stronger potential for pe pp degradation r bacteria were much more diverse and abundant than c bacteria figs 4b s2 and 5a most c bacteria were more abundant at the beginning of the succession while most r bacteria varied irregularly in abundance but increased in abundance at day 21 figs 4c and s3 according to which it can be speculated that c bacteria are likely to be the bacteria that break the rate limiting step of pe pp degradation while r bacteria are most likely to be the bacteria that can metabolize pe pp secondary products the higher abundance and diversity of r bacteria in biofilms suggest the presence of many rare or low abundance bacteria in natural rivers that may be potential pe pp degrading bacteria or pe pp degrading bacteria to be activated while the lower abundance and diversity of c bacteria support the slow degradation rate of pp and pe in waters compared with biodegradable plastics there is remain much requirement for the biodegradation research of pe pp due to the low abundance of degrading bacteria in its rate limiting step which is more difficult to be tapped priority effects of microbial community construction include ecological niche preemption ecological niche facilitative modification and ecological niche inhibitory modification debray et al 2022 based on it it is known that c bacteria has an ecological niche promoting effect on r bacteria and microplastic degradation intermediates produced by c bacteria after breaking through the microplastic rate limiting step are faster acting carbon sources than microplastics and the simultaneous presence of both carbon sources causes secondary growth of the microbial community lee et al 2003 the abundance of the empirical core pe pp degrading genus was higher than that of the empirical core degrading otus fig 5c d and the abundance of the core pe pp degrading otus alone was higher than that of the indicatory degrading bacteria genus fig 5c d comparing the types of the indicatory degrading genera the empirical core degrading otus and the empirical core degrading genera it was found that the degrading bacteria screened in this study were more diverse and more abundant fig 5d e this indicates that pe pp degrading bacteria were successfully enriched in this study and the smaller taxonomic units corresponding to the degrading genera may not always have degrading effects on microplastics and the way of screening microplastic degrading bacteria at the genus level in the existing studies may exaggerate their degrading effects 3 4 ecological characteristics of pe pp degrading bacterial community as the enrichment time advanced the number of nodes of d bacteria gradually increased and were distributed across functional modules fig 6 a d indicating that the number of d bacteria with significant relevance to the microbial community gradually increased and their functions were diverse according to the within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi the number of connected nodes high inter module connectivity gradually increased as the enrichment cycle progressed fig 6e which also indicates the success of the enrichment experiment betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a point is located in the middle of other point pairs in the graph emphasizing the ability of a point to regulate and control other points representing the connection between nodes and functional modules rajasingh and rajan 2009 statistical analysis revealed that the standard betweenness centrality of c bacteria was generally higher than that of the r bacteria fig 6g this result indicated that the dominant role of c bacteria was stronger than that of r bacteria and c bacteria were likely to be the bacteria dominating the key step of pe pp degradation the standard betweenness centrality of c bacteria showed an overall increasing trend and the rise gradually increased with the enrichment cycle fig 6f this result indicates that the regulatory capacity of c bacteria in the whole community is increasing as the enrichment cycle continues to advance the standard betweenness centrality of r bacteria showed an overall trend of early decline and later increase fig 6f it was speculated that r bacteria might play a role in the subsequent link of microplastic degradation the change in the number of nodes indicates the selection of different degrading bacteria for different stages of microplastics at the early stage of succession the number of nodes and edges of pe pp degrading bacteria showed an upward trend and the network became denser fig s4a b which indicated that the connection between microorganisms was getting closer and closer the late succession tends to stabilize or decrease fig s4a b indicating that the growth state of microorganisms may be in a stable phase at this time and that the pre degradation acting bacteria and nascent r bacteria are less correlated with other bacteria or not yet established peng et al 2015 there was an overall upward trend in the degree of c bacteria as the incubation days were extended fig s4a b indicating that the individual value of c bacteria increased with succession cárdenas et al 2012 3 5 distribution characteristics of pe pp degrading bacterial community in natural river although d bacteria were obtained only from the site s after 20 cycles of indoor culture screening they were detected in both the overlying waters and sediments of the qinhuai river it is indicated that d bacteria should occupy a certain ecological niche in natural lakes despite their relative abundance is as low as averagely 0 05148 fig 7 a the relative abundance of c bacteria 0 0188 was lower than that of r bacteria 0 08416 fig 7a indicating that pe pp degrading bacteria are widely present in the environment but low abundance and breaking through the rate limiting step of microplastic degradation remains a difficult task ji et al 2022 it is noteworthy that the abundance of pe pp degrading bacteria in sediment samples was higher than their abundance in the overlying water fig 7b especially the e2 sample contained significantly higher d bacteria than the other samples fig 7a suggesting that the sediment may have shaped a more suitable environment for microplastic degrading bacteria than the overlying water and it is speculated that there may be hot zones for microplastic degradation in the natural freshwater environment the co occurrence network analysis was performed based on the grouping of overlying water and sediment otus data respectively fig s7 it was found that d bacteria were present in each functional module but most d bacteria tended to be in the same functional module fig s7 indicating that d bacteria were correlated with all elements in the natural microbial community but their functions had some similarities statistics revealed that the standard betweenness centrality of both c bacteria and r bacteria was higher in the sediment environment than in the overlying water environment and the standard betweenness centrality of c bacteria in the sediment environment was higher than that of r bacteria fig 7c river and lake sediments are the most important sites for microplastic deposition yang et al 2021 after microplastics enter the river water the colonization of surrounding microorganisms and heterogeneous aggregation with other impurities cause microplastics to form an agglomerate which accelerates the settlement of microplastics in the overlying water and eventually achieves accumulation in the sediment fazey and ryan 2016 kooi et al 2017 microbial communities on the surface of microplastics promote the degradation of microplastics and this promotion ability is stronger in deep sediments niu et al 2021 the results of this study reaffirm that the sediment environment has a high potential for microplastic degradation different environmental factors shape unique microbial communities redundancy analysis of physicochemical factors and d bacteria in sediments was performed to reveal the correlation between environmental factors and d bacteria the results showed a positive correlation between all the nitrogen and phosphorus indicators and e2 with ammonia nitrogen having the greatest influence and strongest effect fig 7d therefore it can be speculated that eutrophic areas may have a facilitating effect on the degradation of microplastics nitrogen plays an important role in the growth and development of microorganisms from the molecular state of n2 to complex nitrogen containing compounds that can be used by different microorganisms nitrogen cycling in the environment is mainly driven by microorganisms in the environment and the presence of microplastics alters the nitrogen cycling process in sediments seeley et al 2020 shen et al 2022 nitrogen is a factor that cannot be neglected to resolve the fugitive characteristics and degradation mechanisms of microplastics however previous studies are often limited to the environmental conditions prominent in the study areas while nitrogen is neglected for example salinity gradients in estuaries are an important factor but the influence of nitrogen should also be considered qiang et al 2021 overall the results of this study suggest that pe pp degrading bacteria are widely present in natural freshwater environments although their abundance is low and a eutrophic sediment environment may have a higher degradation potential however due to the extremely low abundance of pe pp degrading bacteria and the gaps in studies related to the degradation mechanism of pe pp the degrading strains have not been isolated in this study the metabolites and synergistic co metabolic pathways have not been further analyzed which are necessary ways to further demonstrate the prevalence of degrading bacteria and their metabolic activity this problem is also the focus and difficulty of future research on the degradation of petroleum based microplastics 4 conclusion to date the degradation of carbon chain microplastics pe and pp by bacterial communities is unclear and their distribution characteristics in natural rivers are unknown in this study a combination of field in situ experiments and indoor enrichment experiments was conducted for 1150 days the empirical core pe pp degrading bacterial community and resuscitated pe pp degrading bacterial community were screened according to the abundance variation of otus the own characteristics of pe pp degrading bacteria and their distribution in natural rivers were resolved which provided a new basis for the degradation of typical carbon chain microplastics the enriched bacterial communities were shown to be capable of pe pp degradation by sem ftir clsm gc ms and gpc a significant decrease in the chao 1 index and invsimpson index of the bacterial communities after incubation demonstrated that the bacteria was enriched the abundance and diversity of r bacteria were higher than that of c bacteria but the intermediary centrality of c bacteria was higher indicating that despite the widespread presence of pe pp degrading bacteria to be activated in natural rivers breaking the degradation rate limiting step is still crucial the pp degrading bacteria were more diverse than pe while the abundance was lower than that of pe indicating that refractory microplastics require more diverse microbial interactions for degradation biofilms from sediment sources were enriched with a higher abundance of pe pp degrading bacteria suggesting that river sediments have greater potential for pe pp degradation the abundance of the empirical otus was higher than that of the indicatory degrading genera and the abundance and species of the genera corresponding to the empirical otus were more than that of the indicatory degrading genera indicating that the pe pp degrading bacterial communities screened in this study had higher diversity although the abundance of pe pp degrading bacteria in natural rivers was extremely low they were widely distributed with higher degradation abundance and intermediary centrality in sediments and inorganic nitrogen was significantly correlated with the distribution of degrading bacteria indicating that eutrophic sediments have a greater potential for microplastic degradation this study provides a new approach to the degradation of carbon chain microplastics and its findings may provide a basis for future

15048,carbon chain microplastics polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp are the main types of refractory organics compared to heterochain microplastics pe pp degrading bacterial community and their distribution characteristics in natural rivers are unclear in this study the field in situ experiment and indoor enrichment experiment with pe pp resin as only carbon sources were conducted for a total period of 1150 days the microbial degradation of pure pe pp resin was determined by sem ftir clsm gc ms and gpc the chao 1 index and invsimpson index of the bacterial community significantly reduced after a series of incubation demonstrating that the bacterial community was selectively enriched empirical core pe pp degrading bacteria c bacteria and resuscitated pe pp degrading bacteria r bacteria were screened based on the variation of the abundance of otus and co occurrence analysis displayed that c bacteria presented higher betweenness centrality than r bacteria the higher abundance and diversity of r bacteria in biofilms suggest the presence of many rare or low abundance bacteria in natural rivers that may be potential pe pp degrading bacteria or pe pp degrading bacteria to be activated while the lower abundance and diversity of c bacteria support the slow degradation rate of pe and pp in waters compared to the isolated and indicatory pe pp degrading bacterial genera the c bacteria otus or genera enriched in this study displayed higher richness and abundance enriched pe pp degrading bacteria occurred in all sampled sites of the qinhuai river with higher abundance and standard betweenness centrality in sediments averaging 0 01354 and 0 44421 respectively than those in overlying water averaging 0 00536 and 0 17571 respectively while the highest abundance of degrading bacteria presented in the eutrophic sediments inorganic nitrogen was determined to be significantly correlated with the distribution of pe pp degrading bacteria in sediments via redundancy analysis this study provides a new perspective on the natural degradation potential of carbon chain microplastics by microbial communities in rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics polyethylene polypropylene degrading bacterial community natural rive data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction because of its high molecular weight strong cc single bond strong hydrophobic surface and amorphous crystal structure the petroleum based carbon chain microplastic is difficult to degrade and becomes the main body of plastic pollution in the environment auta et al 2018 ding et al 2022 after the related plastic products are broken in the environment millions of small plastic particles are formed among which the particles with a size less than 5 mm are defined as microplastics mps jambeck et al 2015 in 2004 the concept of microplastics was formally put forward and its widespread distribution in global marine waters and sediments was reported thompson et al 2004 and the pollution problem in mps immediately aroused great concern and discussion all over the world with the increasing number of research reports mps have been found to exist widely in water sediments and aquatic organisms of marine and terrestrial freshwater systems and the trend is increasing day by day niu et al 2021 russell and webster 2021 yuan et al 2022 mp pollution will cause great hidden dangers to human health and water ecological security and it is urgent to control mp pollution in water bodies the micro biodegradation of mps is the fundamental way to realize the removal of mps in the natural environment as the most widely distributed organism in nature bacteria have rapid reproduction various nutritional types strong adaptability and great microplastics degradation potential up to now many studies have isolated high efficiency mps degrading strains which can degrade different types of mps such as polyethylene terephthalate pet polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp from the natural environment auta et al 2018 paço et al 2017 seeley et al 2020 a small amount of research has been carried out on some intermediate products and enzyme activities of the degradation of heterochain polymer plastics yoshida et al 2016 there are various kinds of reported mps degrading bacteria which are distributed in many categories of bacteria and fungi yang et al 2014 yu et al 2015 indicating that the distribution of mps degrading bacteria in the natural environment is extensive el shafei et al 1998 paço et al 2017 yoshida et al 2016 usually the microbial community on the surface of mps is the direct source of potential mps degrading bacteria in recent years research on microbial communities on the surface of mps has gradually increased meyer cifuentes et al 2020 niu et al 2023 zettler et al 2013 it has been generally confirmed that the microbial communities in the surface biofilm of mps are different from those in the surrounding media niu et al 2021 studies have further explored the biofilm on the surface of microplastics and other media and found that their community structures are different niu et al 2021 in addition kirstein et al 2018 found that different types of mps were selective to microorganisms that is microorganisms closely attached to the surface of different types of mps had endemic community structures seeley et al 2020 found that petroleum based mps not only affected the microbial community on the microplastic surface but also significantly affected the microbial community structure and nitrogen transformation process in the surrounding sediments to sum up most research only studied the characteristics of microbial communities on the surface of mps and the similarities and differences of microbial communities on different types of mps at present the research on mps degradation potential of microbial communities on the surface of mps is very limited the complete removal of complex polymer pollutants in the natural environment often requires the joint action of different kinds of microorganisms akbari et al 2021 gu et al 2022 li et al 2022 meyer cifuentes et al 2020 singh et al 2016 wang et al 2019 therefore it is the key link to reveal the degradation law of mps in natural water to systematically clarify the cooperative degradation mechanism of mps degrading bacteria to mps compared with the research on mps in a freshwater environment the research on mps in the marine environment is very leading wagner et al 2014 despite this at present the research in the marine field only discusses the microbial degradation of biodegradable mps from the perspective of microbial community synergy meyer cifuentes et al 2020 as for the synergistic degradation of microbial communities in petroleum based refractory mps the researchers tried to explain it by using the method of reference species niu et al 2021 it has to be said that this method has promoted the research on the synergistic degradation of microbial communities in petroleum based mps to some extent but it may over amplify the potential mps degrading bacterial community in general the research on microbial synergistic degradation of petroleum based microplastics pe and pp is still in the initial stage in natural environments the knowledge of the pe pp degrading flora is rare such as their ecological characteristics are unknown the species and abundance of different types of petroleum based microplastics degrading flora are unknown and their distribution in natural rivers is also unknown understanding the composition and distribution of pe pp degrading bacteria in the natural river is important for the management and control of microplastic pollution in this study potential pe pp degrading bacterial communities were enriched and screened via outdoor and indoor culture experiments for 1150 days 1 to analyze the diversity and abundance of potential pe pp degrading bacterial communities in microplastic biofilms 2 to discuss the ecological characteristics of pe pp degrading bacteria and 3 to explore the distribution characteristics of pe pp degrading bacteria in natural rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 outdoor in situ experiment an in situ experimental site s was set up in december 2018 in the qinhuai river nanjing where additives containing commercial microplastics pp and pe were sealed in a wire mesh and placed 1 0 m below the overlying water noted as s1 and 0 5 m below the sediments noted as s2 of the river after 2 years the microplastics in the overlying water and sediments were sampled and the biofilms of microplastics were extracted following the method of meyer cifuentes et al 2020 a portion of the biofilm was used for dna extraction and high throughput sequencing and the other portion was used as the source of microorganisms for indoor experiments fig 1 2 2 indoor enrichment experiment pe and pp sigma aldrich america used in indoor experiments are pure resin products without additives with a thickness of 0 55 mm the inorganic salt medium kannahi and sudha 2013 with 2 g l membranous pp mps and pe mps as the only carbon source was used as the enrichment medium table s1 stationary culture at 28 for 21 days is one cycle noted as tn n is the number of cycles that have been cultured unless otherwise specified all cultures were carried out in this condition the biofilms obtained from outdoor experiments were inoculated separately into 10 ml of enrichment medium according to the type of environmental medium and the type of microplastic for incubation specifically 0 01 tryptone 1 glucose noted as 1 and 0 01 tryptone noted as 2 were added to the medium in the first incubation cycle to stimulate microbial growth at the end of each cycle of incubation 1 ml of enrichment solution was aspirated and added to 9 ml of new enrichment medium and a new cycle of incubation was started under the above conditions fig 1 a total of 20 cycles of indoor experiments were conducted and dna extraction and high throughput sequencing were performed separately for the enriched bacteria in the 21st day of t0 t8 t12 t16 and t20 and in days 0 3 7 14 and 21 of t20 2 3 collection of environmental samples in this study the overlying water noted as 1 and sediment noted as 2 samples were collected in 9 sites a h and s across the qinhuai river in nanjing jiangsu china in march 2022 table s2 before collecting each sample the water sampler and sediments bucket were cleaned with river water to clean the residues in the instrument samples were placed in glass containers and stored at 4 c and transported back to the laboratory for subsequent dna extraction and physicochemical index monitoring 2 4 dna extraction and sequencing dna extraction and high throughput sequencing were performed concerning the method of niu et al 2021 in particular the microplastics were initially washed to remove impurities before dna extraction from the microplastic surface biofilm and the colonies were centrifuged before dna extraction from the indoor culture colonies all sequence data obtained in this study were deposited in the sequence read archive sra of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under accession number prjna889246 2 5 characterization of microplastic degradation properties in this study the degradation characteristics of pe pp were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy ftir confocal laser scanning microscope clsm gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms and gel permeation chromatography gpc see text s1 in supporting material for details 2 6 screening of pe pp degrading bacteria microbial communities tend to be simple under the stress of a single carbon source goldford et al 2018 if otus can grow independently with a single carbon source from mps and their relative abundance continues to increase it indicates that otus may have a gene that metabolizes a single carbon source from mps the resuscitation mechanism of microorganisms in enrichment culture means that enrichment culture helps some species adapt and grow on the culture medium and then contributes to the resuscitation of dormant bacteria mu et al 2018a based on the above theories this study identified pe pp degrading bacteria at the otu level otus that were present in all sequencing cycles and remained stable or increasing in relative abundance were defined as core pe pp degrading bacteria c bacteria otus that were below the detection line or silent in the early part of the sequencing cycle and appeared in the later part of the sequencing cycle and their relative abundance remained stable or increased were defined as recovering pe pp degrading bacteria r bacteria c bacteria and r bacteria are collectively referred to as empirical pe pp degrading bacteria d bacteria table 1 in addition the bacteria that have been proven to have the ability to degrade pe pp in freshwater environments are defined as indicatory pe pp degrading bacteria table 2 2 7 identification of pe pp degradation in natural rivers the otu sequences of environmental samples were compared with the otu sequences of the screened d bacteria and a similarity greater than or equal to 97 was considered that this otu was present in the environment thus testing the distribution of d bacteria in natural freshwater environments 2 8 statistical analysis for better visualization all thermal maps in this study were processed with log10 original data 1 for the original data in this study past software https folk uio no ohammer past was used to calculate chao 1 index invsimpson index and the goods coverage of microbial samples in five sequencing cycles in this study principal co ordinates analysis pcoa was used to reveal the β diversity of microbial communities and multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test the significance of microbial community differences in this study r package vegan calculated the spearman correlation coefficient among microorganisms otu and used gephi 0 9 1 http gephi guthub io software combined with the identified pe pp degrading bacteria in mps to analyze and compare the co occurrence network of enriched bacteria in different cycles and the same cycle and different culture time among them the nodes and edges with a p value less than 0 001 and an r value greater than 0 6 are selected for the result analysis of the co occurrence network different roles of each topological node were identified using zi and pi values redundancy analysis rda was performed to evaluate the relationship between the environmental parameters of sediments and the d bacteria using canoco 5 with 999 permutations http www canoco5 com 3 results and discussion 3 1 pe pp were degraded by the enriched bacterial community after the enrichment culture the originally smooth surface of pe pp became rough and showed various complex morphologies such as crack like and pore like fig 2 a and the carbonyl functional groups appeared on its surface fig 2b the above phenomenon is one of the empirical evidence of microbial degradation of microplastics sturm et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b zhou et al 2020 microplastics and the microorganisms colonizing them constitute a unique ecological niche the plastisphere li et al 2021 microplastics can serve as both a substrate for microbial colonization and a carbon source for microorganisms nanthini devi 2021 mughini gras et al 2021 the biofilm on the pe pp surface was visually characterized in this study fig 2c the biofilm on the pe pp surface was dominated by live bacteria indicating a high metabolic activity the presence of dead bodies indicates that on the one hand some bacteria start to die due to limited space and nutrition and on the other hand it may be a natural death due to the growth cycle of the bacteria the presence of extracellular polymer further confirmed that pe pp underwent microbial degradation the density of bacteria on the pe pp surface increased indicating that the microorganisms could better colonize the pe pp surface as the enrichment experiment progressed compared with the samples in the in situ environment tu et al 2020 the microorganisms on the surface of pe pp after enrichment were sparse which implies the difficulty of petroleum based microplastic degradation in addition the results of gc ms of the culture solution revealed the presence of straight chain alkanes and olefins from c19 to c30 in the culture solution fig 2d gpc results showed that the relative molecular masses of the microplastics all decreased after enrichment culture fig 2e based on both of the results it is speculated that the mechanism of microbial degradation of pe pp may be random chain breaking which was consistent with their pyrolysis mechanism goedecke et al 2020 in conclusion the enrichment experiments in this study were successful and microbial degradation of pe pp occurred 3 2 characteristics of the enriched bacterial community the goods coverage index of the enriched microbial communities was all close to 1 fig 3 a indicating that the sequencing depth is reasonable and the depth has covered all the species in the samples the chao 1 index fig 3b and invsimpson fig 3c index of the enriched microbial communities was significantly lower than that of t0 which indicated that the enrichment experiment had a targeted selection of microorganisms and the enrichment experiment was successful however chao 1 and invsimpson index increased slightly at t16 and seemed to increase more obviously at t20 fig 3b c it shows that some bacteria that can use microplastics as a carbon source are revived and their diversity is improved the ability of microorganisms to utilize different carbon sources is different some carbon sources can be utilized directly e g glucose while some substances need a certain adaptation period before they can be utilized the former is known as a fast acting carbon source and the latter is known as a late acting carbon source liu et al 2012 a culture system with microplastics as the only carbon source implies that the microorganisms have only a late acting carbon source the microbial community tends to be simple under the action of a single late acting carbon source goldford et al 2018 and therefore its diversity decreases significantly in the early stages as the enrichment cycle progressed the microbial community under single carbon source stress underwent directional selection shi et al 2022 and some of the bacteria capable of using microplastics as a carbon source were recovered showing a slight increase in diversity pcoa analysis based on the grouping of microplastic types showed that the enriched microbial communities clustered into different groups on the first principal component axis fig s1a suggesting that the microplastic type may be an important factor contributing to the variability of microbial communities the apparent aggregation of microorganisms further suggests that microplastics are selective for microorganisms di pippo et al 2020 wu et al 2019 the overlap of different groups in t20 is presumed to be a convergence of structure and function due to microbial recovery interestingly pcoa results based on microbial source grouping showed a gradual homogenization of microbial communities from different sources as the enrichment cycle progressed fig s1b suggesting that microbial source may not be a critical factor affecting microplastic enrichment flora compared to microplastic type 3 3 characteristics of pe pp degrading bacterial community most of the reported studies on mps degrading bacteria have been conducted using the dominant abundance method kaur et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a while the degradation rate and efficiency of microplastics especially petroleum based microplastics are extremely low and their degrading bacteria may have low abundance properties montazer et al 2020 sánchez 2019 the dominant abundance method for screening degrading bacteria of petroleum based microplastics most likely did not screen out the key groups of bacteria that are involved in their degradation during the screening process this study is the first to apply the relevant theory of microbial ecology to the identification of pe pp degrading bacteria after enrichment there was more than one identifiable taxon in each group indicating that multiple taxa in each group were able to grow independently under conditions of an additional single carbon source this suggests that the genes and pathways that enable each group to metabolize a single applied carbon source of pe pp are distributed across multiple taxa in the community and are not present only in the best competing species goldford et al 2018 enrichment cultures can help certain species to adapt and grow on the medium and contribute to the recovery of dormant bacteria mu et al 2018b based on the above theory this study screened c bacteria and r bacteria based on the variation of otu abundance figs 4 a b and s2 and most of the corresponding genera of c bacteria and r bacteria have been proved to have microplastics degradation potential delacuvellerie et al 2019 devi et al 2019b tables s3 s6 although both pe and pp are non polar crystalline polymers unique methyl side chains of pp result in better rigidity strength and heat resistance making pp more resistant to degradation than pe more types of pp degrading bacteria were screened in this study than pe figs 4b and s2 but in lower abundance than pe fig 5 a probably due to the more diverse microbial interactions required for the degradation of pp due to its refractory nature s2 provided more d bacteria than s1 fig 5a presumably because the sediment environment has a stronger potential for pe pp degradation r bacteria were much more diverse and abundant than c bacteria figs 4b s2 and 5a most c bacteria were more abundant at the beginning of the succession while most r bacteria varied irregularly in abundance but increased in abundance at day 21 figs 4c and s3 according to which it can be speculated that c bacteria are likely to be the bacteria that break the rate limiting step of pe pp degradation while r bacteria are most likely to be the bacteria that can metabolize pe pp secondary products the higher abundance and diversity of r bacteria in biofilms suggest the presence of many rare or low abundance bacteria in natural rivers that may be potential pe pp degrading bacteria or pe pp degrading bacteria to be activated while the lower abundance and diversity of c bacteria support the slow degradation rate of pp and pe in waters compared with biodegradable plastics there is remain much requirement for the biodegradation research of pe pp due to the low abundance of degrading bacteria in its rate limiting step which is more difficult to be tapped priority effects of microbial community construction include ecological niche preemption ecological niche facilitative modification and ecological niche inhibitory modification debray et al 2022 based on it it is known that c bacteria has an ecological niche promoting effect on r bacteria and microplastic degradation intermediates produced by c bacteria after breaking through the microplastic rate limiting step are faster acting carbon sources than microplastics and the simultaneous presence of both carbon sources causes secondary growth of the microbial community lee et al 2003 the abundance of the empirical core pe pp degrading genus was higher than that of the empirical core degrading otus fig 5c d and the abundance of the core pe pp degrading otus alone was higher than that of the indicatory degrading bacteria genus fig 5c d comparing the types of the indicatory degrading genera the empirical core degrading otus and the empirical core degrading genera it was found that the degrading bacteria screened in this study were more diverse and more abundant fig 5d e this indicates that pe pp degrading bacteria were successfully enriched in this study and the smaller taxonomic units corresponding to the degrading genera may not always have degrading effects on microplastics and the way of screening microplastic degrading bacteria at the genus level in the existing studies may exaggerate their degrading effects 3 4 ecological characteristics of pe pp degrading bacterial community as the enrichment time advanced the number of nodes of d bacteria gradually increased and were distributed across functional modules fig 6 a d indicating that the number of d bacteria with significant relevance to the microbial community gradually increased and their functions were diverse according to the within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi the number of connected nodes high inter module connectivity gradually increased as the enrichment cycle progressed fig 6e which also indicates the success of the enrichment experiment betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a point is located in the middle of other point pairs in the graph emphasizing the ability of a point to regulate and control other points representing the connection between nodes and functional modules rajasingh and rajan 2009 statistical analysis revealed that the standard betweenness centrality of c bacteria was generally higher than that of the r bacteria fig 6g this result indicated that the dominant role of c bacteria was stronger than that of r bacteria and c bacteria were likely to be the bacteria dominating the key step of pe pp degradation the standard betweenness centrality of c bacteria showed an overall increasing trend and the rise gradually increased with the enrichment cycle fig 6f this result indicates that the regulatory capacity of c bacteria in the whole community is increasing as the enrichment cycle continues to advance the standard betweenness centrality of r bacteria showed an overall trend of early decline and later increase fig 6f it was speculated that r bacteria might play a role in the subsequent link of microplastic degradation the change in the number of nodes indicates the selection of different degrading bacteria for different stages of microplastics at the early stage of succession the number of nodes and edges of pe pp degrading bacteria showed an upward trend and the network became denser fig s4a b which indicated that the connection between microorganisms was getting closer and closer the late succession tends to stabilize or decrease fig s4a b indicating that the growth state of microorganisms may be in a stable phase at this time and that the pre degradation acting bacteria and nascent r bacteria are less correlated with other bacteria or not yet established peng et al 2015 there was an overall upward trend in the degree of c bacteria as the incubation days were extended fig s4a b indicating that the individual value of c bacteria increased with succession cárdenas et al 2012 3 5 distribution characteristics of pe pp degrading bacterial community in natural river although d bacteria were obtained only from the site s after 20 cycles of indoor culture screening they were detected in both the overlying waters and sediments of the qinhuai river it is indicated that d bacteria should occupy a certain ecological niche in natural lakes despite their relative abundance is as low as averagely 0 05148 fig 7 a the relative abundance of c bacteria 0 0188 was lower than that of r bacteria 0 08416 fig 7a indicating that pe pp degrading bacteria are widely present in the environment but low abundance and breaking through the rate limiting step of microplastic degradation remains a difficult task ji et al 2022 it is noteworthy that the abundance of pe pp degrading bacteria in sediment samples was higher than their abundance in the overlying water fig 7b especially the e2 sample contained significantly higher d bacteria than the other samples fig 7a suggesting that the sediment may have shaped a more suitable environment for microplastic degrading bacteria than the overlying water and it is speculated that there may be hot zones for microplastic degradation in the natural freshwater environment the co occurrence network analysis was performed based on the grouping of overlying water and sediment otus data respectively fig s7 it was found that d bacteria were present in each functional module but most d bacteria tended to be in the same functional module fig s7 indicating that d bacteria were correlated with all elements in the natural microbial community but their functions had some similarities statistics revealed that the standard betweenness centrality of both c bacteria and r bacteria was higher in the sediment environment than in the overlying water environment and the standard betweenness centrality of c bacteria in the sediment environment was higher than that of r bacteria fig 7c river and lake sediments are the most important sites for microplastic deposition yang et al 2021 after microplastics enter the river water the colonization of surrounding microorganisms and heterogeneous aggregation with other impurities cause microplastics to form an agglomerate which accelerates the settlement of microplastics in the overlying water and eventually achieves accumulation in the sediment fazey and ryan 2016 kooi et al 2017 microbial communities on the surface of microplastics promote the degradation of microplastics and this promotion ability is stronger in deep sediments niu et al 2021 the results of this study reaffirm that the sediment environment has a high potential for microplastic degradation different environmental factors shape unique microbial communities redundancy analysis of physicochemical factors and d bacteria in sediments was performed to reveal the correlation between environmental factors and d bacteria the results showed a positive correlation between all the nitrogen and phosphorus indicators and e2 with ammonia nitrogen having the greatest influence and strongest effect fig 7d therefore it can be speculated that eutrophic areas may have a facilitating effect on the degradation of microplastics nitrogen plays an important role in the growth and development of microorganisms from the molecular state of n2 to complex nitrogen containing compounds that can be used by different microorganisms nitrogen cycling in the environment is mainly driven by microorganisms in the environment and the presence of microplastics alters the nitrogen cycling process in sediments seeley et al 2020 shen et al 2022 nitrogen is a factor that cannot be neglected to resolve the fugitive characteristics and degradation mechanisms of microplastics however previous studies are often limited to the environmental conditions prominent in the study areas while nitrogen is neglected for example salinity gradients in estuaries are an important factor but the influence of nitrogen should also be considered qiang et al 2021 overall the results of this study suggest that pe pp degrading bacteria are widely present in natural freshwater environments although their abundance is low and a eutrophic sediment environment may have a higher degradation potential however due to the extremely low abundance of pe pp degrading bacteria and the gaps in studies related to the degradation mechanism of pe pp the degrading strains have not been isolated in this study the metabolites and synergistic co metabolic pathways have not been further analyzed which are necessary ways to further demonstrate the prevalence of degrading bacteria and their metabolic activity this problem is also the focus and difficulty of future research on the degradation of petroleum based microplastics 4 conclusion to date the degradation of carbon chain microplastics pe and pp by bacterial communities is unclear and their distribution characteristics in natural rivers are unknown in this study a combination of field in situ experiments and indoor enrichment experiments was conducted for 1150 days the empirical core pe pp degrading bacterial community and resuscitated pe pp degrading bacterial community were screened according to the abundance variation of otus the own characteristics of pe pp degrading bacteria and their distribution in natural rivers were resolved which provided a new basis for the degradation of typical carbon chain microplastics the enriched bacterial communities were shown to be capable of pe pp degradation by sem ftir clsm gc ms and gpc a significant decrease in the chao 1 index and invsimpson index of the bacterial communities after incubation demonstrated that the bacteria was enriched the abundance and diversity of r bacteria were higher than that of c bacteria but the intermediary centrality of c bacteria was higher indicating that despite the widespread presence of pe pp degrading bacteria to be activated in natural rivers breaking the degradation rate limiting step is still crucial the pp degrading bacteria were more diverse than pe while the abundance was lower than that of pe indicating that refractory microplastics require more diverse microbial interactions for degradation biofilms from sediment sources were enriched with a higher abundance of pe pp degrading bacteria suggesting that river sediments have greater potential for pe pp degradation the abundance of the empirical otus was higher than that of the indicatory degrading genera and the abundance and species of the genera corresponding to the empirical otus were more than that of the indicatory degrading genera indicating that the pe pp degrading bacterial communities screened in this study had higher diversity although the abundance of pe pp degrading bacteria in natural rivers was extremely low they were widely distributed with higher degradation abundance and intermediary centrality in sediments and inorganic nitrogen was significantly correlated with the distribution of degrading bacteria indicating that eutrophic sediments have a greater potential for microplastic degradation this study provides a new approach to the degradation of carbon chain microplastics and its findings may provide a basis for future

15049,ultraviolet uv radiation is a well implemented process for water disinfection the development of emergent uv sources such as light emitting diodes leds has afforded new possibilities for advanced oxidation processes the emission wavelength is considered to be an important factor for photo chemical processes in terms of both biological damage and energetic efficiency as the inactivation mechanisms and mode of action may differ according to the wavelength that is applied in addition these processes merit exploration for inactivating emerging pathogens such as marine vibrios that are important bacteria to control in maritime activities the main goal of this study was to compare the disinfection efficacy of several uv led driven processes with different modes of action first the effect of uv leds was assessed at different uv ranges uv a uv b or uv c second the possible enhancement of a combination with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or peroxymonosulfate salt hso5 was investigated under two different application strategies i e simultaneous or sequential the results obtained indicate a high sensitivity of vibrio alginolyticus to uv radiation especially under uv b kobs 0 24 cm2 mj and uv c kobs 1 47 cm2 mj irradiation the highest inactivation rate constants were obtained for uv hso5 kobs cm2 mj 0 0007 uv a 0 39 uv b 1 79 uv c with respect to uv h2o2 kobs cm2 mj 0 0006 uv a 0 26 uv b and 1 54 uv c processes however regrowth was avoided only with uv h2o2 additionally the disinfection enhancement caused by a chemical addition was more evident in the order uv a uv b uv c by applying h2o2 10 mg l or hso5 2 5 mg l in a sequential mode before the uv negligible effects were obtained in comparison with the simultaneous application finally promising electrical energy per order eeo values were obtained as follows uv hso5 eeo kwh m3 1 68 uv a 0 20 uv b 0 04 uv c and uv h2o2 eeo kwh m3 2 15 uv a 0 32 uv b 0 04 uv c demonstrating the potential of uv leds for disinfection in particular activities such as the aquaculture industry or maritime transport graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet led marine bacteria aquaculture ballast water reactivation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ultraviolet disinfection is a conventional option for inactivating a variety of waterborne organisms bolton and cotton 2008 song et al 2016 its effectiveness for abating a wide variety of detrimental microorganisms has opened its field of application to other particular activities such as marine aquaculture summerfelt 2003 or ballast water treatment hess erga et al 2019 uv technology has traditionally been employed at a monochromatic λ 254 nm or polychromatic 200 400 nm emission with low or medium pressure mercury lamps nonetheless in the search for uv light sources that are more sustainable the light emitting diodes leds have demonstrated effectiveness as a promising alternative to mercury lamps chen et al 2017 umar et al 2019 additionally uv leds are a mercury free uv source that has gained significance according to the minamata convention on mercury unep 2019 the development of leds as a uv source has also afforded new possibilities for advanced water treatment processes in terms of photocatalytic or photochemical processes this is due to its ability to obtain a tailored emission spectrum along with the greater freedom for reactor design because of the distribution of multiple leds along the photo reactor jeon et al 2022 jo and tayade 2014 martín sómer et al 2018 romero martínez et al 2022 photocatalytic methods have shown promising results in disinfection levchuk et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2020b however their efficiency can be significantly affected by the relatively high salinity of the marine environment that lessens disinfection effectiveness levchuk et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2017 and thus raises concerns about the viability of this type of treatment in such a complex water matrix porcar santos et al 2020 on the other hand photochemical processes uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv o3 or uv chlorine have revealed promising results for water treatment over the last years miklos et al 2018 uv h2o2 processes have been widely studied in terms of disinfection specifically under uv c or solar irradiation feng et al 2020 giannakis et al 2016 moreno andrés et al 2016 the use of persulfate salts specifically peroxymonosulfate salt as hso5 has also shown encouraging results for bacteria inactivation as it is able to achieve inactivation levels similar to those of uv h2o2 berruti et al 2021 guerra rodríguez et al 2022 moreno andrés et al 2019 qi et al 2020 however although h2o2 or hso5 are favourable oxidizing chemicals in photo assisted processes their implementation still presents some concerns in terms of environmental sustainability being the electricity a relevant parameter pesqueira et al 2022 accordingly as uv leds are expected to increase in electrical efficiency they would be a promising technology for the water energy nexus jeon et al 2022 martín sómer et al 2023 the inactivation mechanisms and mode of action of uv h2o2 or uv hso5 may differ according to the wavelength that is applied in this regard intracellular mechanisms might prevail over extracellular mechanisms as the emission wavelength increases berruti et al 2022 feng et al 2020 giannakis et al 2022 accordingly the emission wavelength is considered to be an important factor for ensuring a proper evaluation of photo chemical processes in terms of both biological damage and energetic efficiency in parallel there is a lack of an integrative and comparative study of specific emission wavelengths in the three main uv ranges uv a 315 400 nm uv b 280 315 nm and uv c 200 280 nm the majority of the research in this area has been focused on an urban wastewater matrix and less attention has been paid to other relevant water matrices that requires disinfection such as seawater aguilar et al 2018 hess erga et al 2019 qi et al 2020 in addition the bacterial indicators selected to address the different inactivation processes are usually the typical indicators related to fecal pollution such as escherichia coli qi et al 2020 rubio et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 nonetheless the survival of e coli is negatively correlated with salinity giannakis et al 2014 as seawater ecosystems are a hostile environment for fecal bacteria belkin et al 2005 thus the regrowth of specific marine bacteria becomes relevant after disinfection processes hess erga et al 2010 moreno andrés et al 2018 wennberg et al 2013 however the inactivation of marine bacteria together with the underlying bacterial inactivation mechanisms and the influence of inorganic ions in seawater has not often been examined wang et al 2021 vibrio species family vibrionaceae are ubiquitously present in estuarine and marine environments baker austin et al 2017 reen et al 2006 in fact the genus vibrio is considered as a bacterial indicator in some international policies such as the regulation d 2 of the ballast water management convention imo 2004 although many species of the genus vibrio are not pathogenic there are four species of relevance that have emerged as opportunistic human pathogens and emergent pathogens of aquaculture species baker austin et al 2017 v cholerae v vulnificus v parahaemolyticus and v alginolyticus in this study v alginolyticus was selected as the target bacterium for inactivation experiments it is an overlooked bacterium that is recognized as an emerging human pathogen but also associated with disease in a wide variety of fish crustaceans or bivalves baker austin et al 2017 reen et al 2006 in addition their occurrence in ballast waters khandeparker et al 2020 where they might exhibit resistance to beta lactam antibiotics ng et al 2018 along with their relationship with harmful algal blooms bellés garulera et al 2016 make it an important bacterium to control due to the risk of pathogen emergence from environmental sources although a number previous studies have considered the uv mediated inactivation of the vibrio species table s1 the specific uv inactivation performance of v alginolyticus has been less studied in this regard photochemical processes used against the marine pathogen v alginolyticus are worth exploring to do so this study compared the disinfection efficacy of several uv led driven processes with different modes of action firstly the effect of uv leds in different uv ranges were assessed uv a λmax 365 nm uv b λmax 300 nm or uv c λmax 275 nm secondly the possible enhancement of a combination of these uv leds with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or peroxymonosulfate salt hso5 was investigated under two different strategies of application i e simultaneously or in a sequential mode finally in order to provide a wide ranging idea of the viability of these processes regrowth and considerations about the energy efficiency are also presented in this regard the wavelength effect as well as the optimization of uv dose for marine water disinfection are the main motivation of this study 2 material and methods 2 1 microbiological procedures the bacterium v alginolyticus cect 521t atcc 17749 was selected as the target microorganism for the different inactivation tests v alginolyticus typical in marine environments is considered as an emergent pathogen as previously indicated a pure strain isolated from spoiled trachurus trachurus causing food poisoning was acquired from the spanish type culture collection cect university of valencia the pure bacterial strain from a lyophilized culture was reactivated and preserved in water glycerol 50 50 at 35 c for each set of experiments the reactivation of each vial was performed from a frozen stock that was also used in previous studies moreno andrés et al 2020a briefly each vial was resuspended in marine broth panreac applichem and incubated aerobically at 30 c for 24 h after two cycles the subculture was considered metabolically active thus it was subjected to a centrifugation process at 3000 rpm for ten minutes which allowed the separation of the marine broth supernatant from the cells in the pellet form bacterial cells were then transferred to actual seawater thereby obtaining an inoculum ready for experimentation it was subsequently diluted to create a working solution for the experiments that ensured an initial concentration of approximately 106 cfu ml 1 bacterial survival after treatment was assessed with standard plate counts in triplicate with thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose tcbs agar vwr chemicals after the incubation period 30 c 24 h colonies were counted in order to ensure a measurable number of cfus 15 150 tenfold dilutions were plated the detection limit was 10 cfu ml 1 analyses were performed in triplicate using a variation coefficient of less than 30 as the acceptance criteria 2 2 uv led reactor a collimated beam reactor equipped with uv led technology photolab led275 0 01 300 0 03 365 1cb apria systems s l spain was used for the experimentation the photoreactor was equipped with three uv led devices emitting at three different wavelengths distinguished by uv a 1200 mw 365 370 nm λmax 365 nm uv b 32 mw 295 305 nm λmax 300 nm or uv c 10 5 mw 265 285 nm λmax 275 nm the photoreactor contains a collimator tube with a collimator lens with a diameter of 5 08 cm and focal length of 6 cm the treatment was applied to samples in petri dishes with a diameter of 55 mm and capacity for 20 ml of target water a magnetic stirrer with a volume of 0 25 ml was added to the petri dish for continuous stirring throughout irradiation the sample surface was at 12 2 cm from the uv light source the irradiance was measured with a radiometer hd 2102 1 delta ohm that was equipped with a probe according to the specific emission wavelength delta ohm lp471 uva uvb or uvbc the measured irradiance at the sample surface was determined as 60 2 55 w m 2 uv a 1 36 0 07 w m 2 uv b and 0 39 0 04 w m 2 uv c with petri factors of 0 945 uv a 0 957 uv b and 0 995 uv c the uv dose of each uv led can be calculated as the product of exposure time and uv light intensity including several factors that affect it in the collimated beam bolton and linden 2003 thus the germicidal irradiance was obtained based on the reactor morphometry measured irradiance and water transmittance at the maximum wavelength emission of each uv led text s1 2 3 experimental approach experimentation was conducted in ground saltwater that was collected from the campus of puerto real of the university of cádiz spain ph 7 65 conductivity 48 9 ms cm 1 salinity 35 8 and toc 1 98 mg c l 1 the raw water was filtered through 0 45 µm and sterilized in an autoclave at 121 c in order to avoid particulate material as well as lowering the viral or bacterial load in the actual water different inactivation tests were performed with a similar experimental set up of those in previous studies moreno andrés et al 2016 briefly they were arranged with water inoculated with v alginolyticus to the collimated beam reactor the treatment was applied to samples in petri dishes with a continuous stirring throughout irradiation sampling was fixed at regular exposure times which implies different uv doses firstly single uv tests were performed by evaluating the disinfection efficacy of the three different uv leds wavelengths secondly photochemical tests were conducted by combining hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 ultrapure scharlau or peroxymonosulfate hso5 obtained from oxone sigma aldrich khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 with uv irradiation to address the effect of combined processes three experimental phases were defined i effect of h2o2 or hso5 in darkness based on previous optimization studies feng et al 2020 moreno andrés et al 2016 2019 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 10 mg of h2o2 l 1 0 29 mm and 2 5 10 mg of hso5 l 1 0 008 0 034 mm were selected as appropriate reagent concentrations for assessing photo disinfection processes ii simultaneous combination of uv h2o2 or uv hso5 the reagents were added in a single dosage and immediately exposed to uv radiation by fixing exposure times up to 60 min uv a or 5 min uv b and uv c which implies maximum uv doses of 16 32 j cm 2 uv a 33 60 mj cm 2 uv b and 8 40 mj cm 2 uv c iii in a third set of experiments the effect of combining oxidants with uv radiation was studied sequentially for this h2o2 or hso5 was added first and the mixture was kept in darkness under continuous agitation for 30 min in order to provide a sufficient amount of time for the reagent to penetrate the cell and initiate intracellular oxidation feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 after this time irradiation began and the sampling procedure was done in the same way as that in point ii in order to obtain a comprehensive scenario of the disinfection process the regrowth of bacteria was monitored for each disinfection method after the inactivation assays assuring a 3 log removal values water samples were stored in sterile flasks in darkness at an ambient temperature 20 2 c for 24 h in these experiments the residual oxidant was not neutralized to evaluate the possible effects after the treatment due to the scope of the present work photoreactivation experiences were not considered given the unlikelihood of the treated water being exposed to light after treatment especially in the ballast water situation the h2o2 concentration was measured with a colorimetric method with titanium iv oxysulfate tioso4 1 9 2 1 fluka at 410 nm din 38 409 h15 a similar colorimetric method with ki was attempted for the measurement of hso5 however it was not possible due to the low concentrations used which were very close to the detection limit 1 35 mg l 1 of this procedure wacławek et al 2015 in addition the molar absorption coefficient of each reagent was estimated by obtaining the uv vis spectra all of these procedures were measured with a jenway 7315 spectrophotometer 2 4 data treatment the response of the v alginolyticus to the different photo chemical processes was obtained by plotting the logarithmic reduction of the survival microorganisms log n n0 versus exposure time or uv dose the experimental points were fitted according to the well established mathematical model of pseudo first order eq 1 for which kobs is the kinetic rate constant of inactivation that was obtained by means of exposure time t s 1 or uv dose cm2 mj 1 1 n n 0 e kobs t or uv dose a ginafit tool was employed to fit the inactivation results on the kinetic model geeraerd et al 2005 accordingly the kinetic rate constant standard error was obtained additionally the different inactivation profiles were analyzed statistically to check for significant differences between the slopes of the inactivation profiles further anova for variables in the order fitted using statgraphics centurion xviii additionally in order to quantitatively assess the combination of the uv h2o2 or uv hso5 system the synergy of the combined processes s dimensionless was quantified according to eq 2 for which a positive value is representative of the synergistic effect dewil et al 2017 2 s k c o m b i n e d 1 n k i n d i v i d u a l k c o m b i n e d the percentage of regrowth was determined according to the eq 3 where n r is the viable bacteria concentration of reactivated samples after 24 h n is the viable bacteria concentration in samples measured immediately after the uv irradiation and n 0 is the initial bacterial concentration lindenauer and darby 1994 3 r e g r o w t h 100 n r n n 0 n finally the electrical energy per order ee o kwh m3 was obtained as the amount of electrical energy required per cubic meter to reduce the bacterial concentration by an order of magnitude ee o estimations have been successfully applied to assess the performance of different uv disinfection systems with either uv leds or low pressure mercury lamps as uv sources beck et al 2017 li et al 2019 the ee o values were calculated according to eq 4 sharpless and linden 2005 that is based on the experimental set up a irradiated surface area in cm2 v sample volume in liters and wf water factor bolton and linden 2003 the experimental results obtained kobs inactivation rate constant referred to the uv dose cm2 mj 1 and the wall plug efficiency c of each specific uv led provided by the manufacturer the factor 3 6 106 was used to convert between hours to seconds mw to kw and l to m3 4 e e o a 3 6 10 6 v k o b s c w f 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation by uv led in three emission range uv a uv b or uv c the first experiments were focused on the assessment of different uv leds for the inactivation of v alginolyticus time response curves were obtained and depicted in fig 1 where different inactivation profiles were defined according to the emission wavelength i e uv a uv b or uv c the inactivation profiles of v alginolyticus differ according to the uv emission range exposures for uv a radiation the inactivation is almost negligible fig 1 whereas the inactivation rates notably improve with uv b and uv c exposures inset fig 1 in order to quantify the inactivation rate according to the uv emission range a log linear decay was fitted to the experimental data and kinetic constants kobs were obtained table 1 indeed significant differences p value 0 01 between the slopes of the various inactivation profiles were determined for the distinct uv led exposures including uv b and uv c this indicates that the inactivation rate effectively increases according to the emission wavelength as uv a uv b uv c these results can be explained by the fact that the sensitivity to ultraviolet light is wavelength dependent pousty et al 2021 thus the results obtained with uv b exposures imply minor damage on v alginolyticus than with the uv c 42 less than the uv c according to the kobs s 1 although uv c causes direct damage to cellular dna absorption by genetic material also occurs within the uv b range whereas the genetic material slightly absorbs within the uv a range producing mainly physiological alterations in the bacterial cells giannakis et al 2022 song et al 2019 the main cell components affected by uv a are involved in the metabolic cycle such as lipids some proteins and especially reactive oxygen species ros scavengers such as catalases or superoxide dismutase feng et al 2020 giannakis et al 2022 however it has been demonstrated that these types of damage can effectively inactivate cells by triggering intracellular ros formation giannakis et al 2022 but at relatively higher uv a doses 50 100 j cm 2 that would require longer exposure times than those tested in this study giannakis et al 2022 song et al 2019 in order to properly compare the results with literature the inactivation rate constants in terms of the uv dose kobs cm2 mj 1 together with that estimated for reaching a specific log removal value lrv were also calculated table 1 in this regard the v alginolyticus seems to be more sensitive to uv radiation than other typical bacterial indicators such as e coli beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 song et al 2016 however for other opportunistic bacteria like legionella pneumophila pseudomonas aeruginosa or vibrio parahaemolyticus the kmax λ260 is approximately 1 cm2 mj 1 with uv doses of 1 3 3 0 mj cm 2 per lrv oguma et al 2019 which agrees with the results obtained in this study in the case of a uv b range λ300 similar kinetic rate constants were obtained when comparing with other types of bacteria oguma et al 2019 rattanakul and oguma 2018 finally with uv a exposure negligible inactivation effects were obtained the maximum uv a dose applied in the present study was 18 1 j cm 2 which resulted in a non observable effect for v alginolyticus inactivation it also agrees with previous studies for which negligible effects were achieved for vibrio species nakahashi et al 2014 but also for other microorganisms including bacteria or viruses guerra rodríguez et al 2022 umar et al 2019 it is important to consider that some discrepancies in time dose reciprocity might be obtained when scaling up the process in continuous reactors this is possibly related to different uv damage mechanisms at longer wavelengths in the specific case of v alginolyticus a time intensity reciprocity was observed for a uv dose range between 0 and 7 mj cm 2 within uv c λmax 275 nm romero martínez et al 2022 however further studies are recommended to effectively address the biological damage that might not only be related to the uv dose but also the exposure time wavelength and intensity pousty et al 2021 song et al 2016 3 2 combination of uv led with h2o2 or hso5 3 2 1 uv h2o2 and uv hso5 firstly the effect of different oxidants was tested in darkness a slight bacterial mortality was quantified as 0 52 0 41 lrv and 0 95 0 39 lrv after the addition of h2o2 or hso5 respectively during 60 min of contact time the specific results and discussion are detailed in the supplementary material text s2 figs s1 and s2 once the effect of single treatments i e uv radiation table 1 and reagent effect text s2 fig s1 were quantified the combination of uv radiation in different emission ranges together with h2o2 or hso5 were tested results in the form of inactivation profiles are depicted in fig 2 for each of the different cases under study it is observed that there is an improvement in the disinfection process when either h2o2 or hso5 are applied in combination with the uv the specific kinetic rate constants are summarized in fig 3 and they are also explicitly reported in table 1 for the three uv emission wavelengths the improvements are more noticeable with the use of hso5 than with the use of h2o2 figs 2 and 3 that is most perceptible in the uv a range followed by the uv b and then the uv c in fact significant differences comparing the slopes obtained in the inactivation curves were obtained when comparing the combined with the single irradiation process for uv a h2o2 or uv a hso5 uv b hso5 and uv c hso5 p value 0 01 however for uv b h2o2 p value 0 0583 and uv c h2o2 p value 0 3371 no significant differences were determined regarding the single irradiation process h2o2 consumption rate increased from uv c to uv a ranges with remaining h2o2 concentrations of 7 45 mg h2o2 l 1 uv a 8 83 mg h2o2 l 1 uv b and 9 03 mg h2o2 l 1 uv c the detailed h2o2 consumption profiles are shown in fig s2 related to the uv dose the results that were obtained suggest that it can be reduced down to 91 9 and 95 9 uv a 18 1 and 52 6 uv b or 20 7 and 33 9 uv c for h2o2 and hso5 respectively in addition there was clearly a synergistic effect in the uv a and uv b range fig s4 this confirms that the improvement on combined processes is clearly evidenced at longer wavelengths i e uv a uv b uv c the increase in the efficiency of the disinfection process can be related to the formation of reactive oxygen species ros in the extracellular environment the photocleavage of h2o2 or hso5 may depend on the wavelength applied thus the photolysis of h2o2 or hso5 will most likely occur when there is an overlap between the emission and absorbance spectra of the oxidizing agents fig 3d as can be seen in fig 3d the molar absorption coefficient of hso5 is higher than h2o2 in addition hso5 reaches the uv a emission spectra which is contrary to the h2o2 that clearly extends to the uv c and slightly reaches the uv b spectrum accordingly the generation of reactive species because of the photolysis of h2o2 is highly probable under the uv c radiation and to some extent under the uv b radiation meanwhile the high molar absorption coefficient of hso5 makes the photolysis of this compound possible under the uv a uv b and uv c radiation when there is no overlapping of the emission and absorption spectra the probable pathway of cell damage that is observed can be related to an intracellular effect section 3 1 irradiation can inflict damage on genetic material but also on key ros controlling enzymes depending on the emission wavelength giannakis et al 2016 pousty et al 2021 santos et al 2013 additionally the presence of h2o2 or hso5 in the extracellular environment can lead to an accumulation of it in the cell berruti et al 2021 feng et al 2020 as a result the combination of uv and h2o2 or hso5 can result in a series of intracellular processes such as fenton like reactions that would eventually inactivate the cells berruti et al 2021 feng et al 2020 giannakis et al 2016 according to the results intracellular processes might gain importance in the range of the uv a followed by the uv b and to a lesser extent with uv c radiation this is in agreement with the h2o2 consumption rates that were obtained fig s2 nonetheless it is important to note that the high uv sensitivity of v alginolyticus implies low uv exposure times with the subsequent low uv doses applied under the uv c or uv b exposures this makes it difficult to effectively quantify the disinfection enhancement produced from combined uv h2o2 or uv hso5 meanwhile the longer exposure times of uv a clearly permit the observation of disinfection enhancement from the photochemical processes 3 2 2 h2o2 uv and hso5 uv sequential approach at this point experimentation was carried out in order to address the effects of combined processes but following a different strategy the reagents were sequentially applied h2o2 or hso5 followed by uv for providing enough time for h2o2 or hso5 to penetrate the cell to initiate the intracellular oxidation thus the addition of the reagent can be considered as pretreatment with uv irradiation as the secondary disinfectant similar to that in the previous sections inactivation profiles were obtained and kinetic rate constants based on a linear inactivation model were determined thus kobs was represented in terms of uv dose cm2 mj 1 in fig 4 the specific inactivation profiles were represented in fig s5 inactivation during the 30 min of darkness was 0 48 0 17 lrv h2o2 and 0 52 0 22 lrv hso5 according to the values of inactivation rate constants slight differences can be observed according to the oxidizing agent h2o2 or hso5 and the irradiation wavelength in the case of h2o2 the inactivation constant between the simultaneous and sequential process i decreases in the uv a photo assisted process ii remains similar under the uv b irradiation and iii slightly increases under uv c light the consumption of h2o2 in the first 30 min of darkness was quantified as 26 7 fig s6 this may be due to the inherent compounds at the bulk but also to the bacterial activity that is able to consume h2o2 but only minimally effects the survival of the microorganisms because of the scavenging action of the cell s enzymes such as superoxide dismutase or catalases feng et al 2020 pedersen et al 2019 the subsequent irradiation does not produce any enhancement in the case of the uv a or uv b ranges thus indicating that the possible previous diffusion of h2o2 into the cell apparently did not produce extra damage however the slight enhancement in the uv c region increase of 4 9 the kobs can be ascertained from the severe damages that single uv c causes at low uv doses at the same time the photolysis of h2o2 can also be produced as previously discussed in section 3 2 1 in fact higher h2o2 consumption rates have been observed under uv c exposure fig s6 similar results were obtained using bacillus subtilis spores zhang et al 2014 on the other hand in the case of hso5 the inactivation constant that was obtained always decreased under sequential processes in comparison with the simultaneous strategy fig 4 these results can be related to the low concentrations of hso5 used in the present study and their unstable nature therefore a lower reagent amount will be available to interact with photons after 30 min consequently the oxidative damage caused by the hso5 itself does not result in a synergy if irradiation is applied after a certain amount of time another strategy that could enhance disinfection would be the sequential application of a uv oxidizing agent in this regard the damage caused by uv irradiation in any of its emission ranges would damage key cell components and subsequently facilitate the action of oxidizing agents to accelerate disinfection giannakis et al 2022 zhang et al 2014 some promising results were reported by sequentially combining single irradiation uv a uv c xiao et al 2018 or uv c h2o2 zhang et al 2014 thus future studies in this regard would be recommended to comprehensively assess this treatment strategy 3 3 regrowth after treatment due to the capacity of dark repair that some microorganisms have regrowth can occasionally result from either surviving bacteria after inactivation together with reactivation or repair processes thus the regrowth capability after treatment was evaluated for each photo chemical process of saving samples in the dark for 24 h the regrowth percentage is summarized in table 1 according to the results this occurs in each of the single irradiation tests uv alone although with lower regrowth percentages than uv alone certain regrowth is observed in hso5 based processes with either the uv a or uv b but is minor for uv c however in the process combined with h2o2 a negligible regrowth is obtained for all tests the single irradiation processes that were tested are based on the exposure of v alginolyticus at different uv wavelengths that vary in the bactericidal mode of action the cell damage obtained from the uv c region is mainly at the genome level while further cell components can be damaged as a result of uv b or uv a exposures at the same time the most germicidal wavelength is within the uv c range as confirmed by the inactivation profiles fig 2 table 1 thus the regrowth capability is directly related to the inactivation efficiency obtaining the lowest regrowth percentages in samples exposed to the uv c followed by those exposed to the uv b in the combined uv h2o2 process the regrowth capability is prevented in all cases which indicates that the level of cellular aggressions is apparently high in this combined treatment it can be a result of the severe damage produced in the cell due to hydroxyl radicals generated from the h2o2 photolysis in the uv c range but also other intracellular processes that might take importance in the uv a or uv b processes moreover the residual h2o2 fig s2 can increase the accumulation rate in the cell and cause a growth defect finally for the combined uv hso5 process regrowth is not avoided in 24 h in exposures to the uv a and uv b ranges it is negligible in the case of the uv c exposures it highlights that uv hso5 although sufficient to accelerate disinfection does not seem to be sufficient to prevent subsequent regrowth 3 4 electrical energy per order ee o values to obtain a final overview of the different processes tested in the present study the electrical energy per order values ee o kwh m 3 were estimated and represented in fig 5 following the same trends obtained in previous sections the ee o values decrease according to single uv processes uv h2o2 uv hso5 as they are directly related to the inactivation constant for single uv methods the obtained ee o values are 67 55 0 38 and 0 04 kwh m 3 for uv a uv b and uv c respectively the combination with h2o2 results in an ee o decrease of 96 80 uv a 18 00 uv b and 0 04 uv c whereas the application of hso5 implies an ee o reduction of 97 50 uv a 46 50 uv b and 0 17 uv c according to miklos et al 2018 those processes with ee o 1 kwh m 3 may represent a realistic range for full scale application in this scenario the uv b or uv c based processes present potential for their further study at larger scales the uv a process although showing promising results from the enhancement with a combination with h2o2 or hso5 still presents values above 1 kwh m 3 in any case the estimated ee o values presented in this study show promising potential for the application of uv leds even in the range with those obtained with low and medium pressure mercury lamps miklos et al 2018 nonetheless there is still a wide range for improvement primarily due to the still low wall plug efficiency of leds 4 conclusions in the present study the efficacy of the disinfection of the marine pathogen v alginolyticus is addressed by means of different uv led photochemical processes with the use of h2o2 or hso5 that are distinguished according to the emission wavelengths of uv a λmax 365 nm uv b λmax 300 nm or uv c λmax 275 nm thus the optimization of the uv dose and the wavelength effect for specific marine water disinfection is emphasized the disinfection efficacy based on the inactivation rate constants that were calculated is inversely proportional to the wavelength that is used so that higher disinfection efficiency is achieved with shorter wavelengths uv a uv b uv c v alginolyticus presents high sensitivity to the uv c and uv b radiation with obtained values of 1 60 mj cm 2 and 9 50 mj cm 2 per lrv respectively single uv a irradiation does not produce observable inactivation 0 39 lrv at 18 1 j cm 2 the three wavelengths tested exhibited a synergistic effect for both photochemical processes uv h2o2 and uv hso5 nonetheless the major inactivation rate constants were for uv hso5 in front of uv h2o2 process additionally disinfection enhancement was more evident at longer wavelengths uv a uv b uv c which suggests that intracellular processes might be important in the uv a range followed by uv b irradiation and to a lesser extent uv c radiation it is also important to note the higher uv sensitivity of v alginolyticus and thus the lower uv doses applied in the uv b and uv c regions on the other hand application in the sequential mode hso5 or h2o2 uv provided negligible results in the inactivation of v alginolyticus when compared with the simultaneous mode bacterial regrowth was only avoided after 24 h with the use of h2o2 thus although with slightly lower inactivation rates compared to uv hso5 the level of cellular aggression was apparently higher in the uv h2o2 process finally both photochemical systems present promising eeo values especially when applied with leds emitting in the uv b or uv c region for which eeo 1 kwh m 3 was obtained

15049,ultraviolet uv radiation is a well implemented process for water disinfection the development of emergent uv sources such as light emitting diodes leds has afforded new possibilities for advanced oxidation processes the emission wavelength is considered to be an important factor for photo chemical processes in terms of both biological damage and energetic efficiency as the inactivation mechanisms and mode of action may differ according to the wavelength that is applied in addition these processes merit exploration for inactivating emerging pathogens such as marine vibrios that are important bacteria to control in maritime activities the main goal of this study was to compare the disinfection efficacy of several uv led driven processes with different modes of action first the effect of uv leds was assessed at different uv ranges uv a uv b or uv c second the possible enhancement of a combination with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or peroxymonosulfate salt hso5 was investigated under two different application strategies i e simultaneous or sequential the results obtained indicate a high sensitivity of vibrio alginolyticus to uv radiation especially under uv b kobs 0 24 cm2 mj and uv c kobs 1 47 cm2 mj irradiation the highest inactivation rate constants were obtained for uv hso5 kobs cm2 mj 0 0007 uv a 0 39 uv b 1 79 uv c with respect to uv h2o2 kobs cm2 mj 0 0006 uv a 0 26 uv b and 1 54 uv c processes however regrowth was avoided only with uv h2o2 additionally the disinfection enhancement caused by a chemical addition was more evident in the order uv a uv b uv c by applying h2o2 10 mg l or hso5 2 5 mg l in a sequential mode before the uv negligible effects were obtained in comparison with the simultaneous application finally promising electrical energy per order eeo values were obtained as follows uv hso5 eeo kwh m3 1 68 uv a 0 20 uv b 0 04 uv c and uv h2o2 eeo kwh m3 2 15 uv a 0 32 uv b 0 04 uv c demonstrating the potential of uv leds for disinfection in particular activities such as the aquaculture industry or maritime transport graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultraviolet led marine bacteria aquaculture ballast water reactivation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ultraviolet disinfection is a conventional option for inactivating a variety of waterborne organisms bolton and cotton 2008 song et al 2016 its effectiveness for abating a wide variety of detrimental microorganisms has opened its field of application to other particular activities such as marine aquaculture summerfelt 2003 or ballast water treatment hess erga et al 2019 uv technology has traditionally been employed at a monochromatic λ 254 nm or polychromatic 200 400 nm emission with low or medium pressure mercury lamps nonetheless in the search for uv light sources that are more sustainable the light emitting diodes leds have demonstrated effectiveness as a promising alternative to mercury lamps chen et al 2017 umar et al 2019 additionally uv leds are a mercury free uv source that has gained significance according to the minamata convention on mercury unep 2019 the development of leds as a uv source has also afforded new possibilities for advanced water treatment processes in terms of photocatalytic or photochemical processes this is due to its ability to obtain a tailored emission spectrum along with the greater freedom for reactor design because of the distribution of multiple leds along the photo reactor jeon et al 2022 jo and tayade 2014 martín sómer et al 2018 romero martínez et al 2022 photocatalytic methods have shown promising results in disinfection levchuk et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2020b however their efficiency can be significantly affected by the relatively high salinity of the marine environment that lessens disinfection effectiveness levchuk et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2017 and thus raises concerns about the viability of this type of treatment in such a complex water matrix porcar santos et al 2020 on the other hand photochemical processes uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv o3 or uv chlorine have revealed promising results for water treatment over the last years miklos et al 2018 uv h2o2 processes have been widely studied in terms of disinfection specifically under uv c or solar irradiation feng et al 2020 giannakis et al 2016 moreno andrés et al 2016 the use of persulfate salts specifically peroxymonosulfate salt as hso5 has also shown encouraging results for bacteria inactivation as it is able to achieve inactivation levels similar to those of uv h2o2 berruti et al 2021 guerra rodríguez et al 2022 moreno andrés et al 2019 qi et al 2020 however although h2o2 or hso5 are favourable oxidizing chemicals in photo assisted processes their implementation still presents some concerns in terms of environmental sustainability being the electricity a relevant parameter pesqueira et al 2022 accordingly as uv leds are expected to increase in electrical efficiency they would be a promising technology for the water energy nexus jeon et al 2022 martín sómer et al 2023 the inactivation mechanisms and mode of action of uv h2o2 or uv hso5 may differ according to the wavelength that is applied in this regard intracellular mechanisms might prevail over extracellular mechanisms as the emission wavelength increases berruti et al 2022 feng et al 2020 giannakis et al 2022 accordingly the emission wavelength is considered to be an important factor for ensuring a proper evaluation of photo chemical processes in terms of both biological damage and energetic efficiency in parallel there is a lack of an integrative and comparative study of specific emission wavelengths in the three main uv ranges uv a 315 400 nm uv b 280 315 nm and uv c 200 280 nm the majority of the research in this area has been focused on an urban wastewater matrix and less attention has been paid to other relevant water matrices that requires disinfection such as seawater aguilar et al 2018 hess erga et al 2019 qi et al 2020 in addition the bacterial indicators selected to address the different inactivation processes are usually the typical indicators related to fecal pollution such as escherichia coli qi et al 2020 rubio et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 nonetheless the survival of e coli is negatively correlated with salinity giannakis et al 2014 as seawater ecosystems are a hostile environment for fecal bacteria belkin et al 2005 thus the regrowth of specific marine bacteria becomes relevant after disinfection processes hess erga et al 2010 moreno andrés et al 2018 wennberg et al 2013 however the inactivation of marine bacteria together with the underlying bacterial inactivation mechanisms and the influence of inorganic ions in seawater has not often been examined wang et al 2021 vibrio species family vibrionaceae are ubiquitously present in estuarine and marine environments baker austin et al 2017 reen et al 2006 in fact the genus vibrio is considered as a bacterial indicator in some international policies such as the regulation d 2 of the ballast water management convention imo 2004 although many species of the genus vibrio are not pathogenic there are four species of relevance that have emerged as opportunistic human pathogens and emergent pathogens of aquaculture species baker austin et al 2017 v cholerae v vulnificus v parahaemolyticus and v alginolyticus in this study v alginolyticus was selected as the target bacterium for inactivation experiments it is an overlooked bacterium that is recognized as an emerging human pathogen but also associated with disease in a wide variety of fish crustaceans or bivalves baker austin et al 2017 reen et al 2006 in addition their occurrence in ballast waters khandeparker et al 2020 where they might exhibit resistance to beta lactam antibiotics ng et al 2018 along with their relationship with harmful algal blooms bellés garulera et al 2016 make it an important bacterium to control due to the risk of pathogen emergence from environmental sources although a number previous studies have considered the uv mediated inactivation of the vibrio species table s1 the specific uv inactivation performance of v alginolyticus has been less studied in this regard photochemical processes used against the marine pathogen v alginolyticus are worth exploring to do so this study compared the disinfection efficacy of several uv led driven processes with different modes of action firstly the effect of uv leds in different uv ranges were assessed uv a λmax 365 nm uv b λmax 300 nm or uv c λmax 275 nm secondly the possible enhancement of a combination of these uv leds with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or peroxymonosulfate salt hso5 was investigated under two different strategies of application i e simultaneously or in a sequential mode finally in order to provide a wide ranging idea of the viability of these processes regrowth and considerations about the energy efficiency are also presented in this regard the wavelength effect as well as the optimization of uv dose for marine water disinfection are the main motivation of this study 2 material and methods 2 1 microbiological procedures the bacterium v alginolyticus cect 521t atcc 17749 was selected as the target microorganism for the different inactivation tests v alginolyticus typical in marine environments is considered as an emergent pathogen as previously indicated a pure strain isolated from spoiled trachurus trachurus causing food poisoning was acquired from the spanish type culture collection cect university of valencia the pure bacterial strain from a lyophilized culture was reactivated and preserved in water glycerol 50 50 at 35 c for each set of experiments the reactivation of each vial was performed from a frozen stock that was also used in previous studies moreno andrés et al 2020a briefly each vial was resuspended in marine broth panreac applichem and incubated aerobically at 30 c for 24 h after two cycles the subculture was considered metabolically active thus it was subjected to a centrifugation process at 3000 rpm for ten minutes which allowed the separation of the marine broth supernatant from the cells in the pellet form bacterial cells were then transferred to actual seawater thereby obtaining an inoculum ready for experimentation it was subsequently diluted to create a working solution for the experiments that ensured an initial concentration of approximately 106 cfu ml 1 bacterial survival after treatment was assessed with standard plate counts in triplicate with thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose tcbs agar vwr chemicals after the incubation period 30 c 24 h colonies were counted in order to ensure a measurable number of cfus 15 150 tenfold dilutions were plated the detection limit was 10 cfu ml 1 analyses were performed in triplicate using a variation coefficient of less than 30 as the acceptance criteria 2 2 uv led reactor a collimated beam reactor equipped with uv led technology photolab led275 0 01 300 0 03 365 1cb apria systems s l spain was used for the experimentation the photoreactor was equipped with three uv led devices emitting at three different wavelengths distinguished by uv a 1200 mw 365 370 nm λmax 365 nm uv b 32 mw 295 305 nm λmax 300 nm or uv c 10 5 mw 265 285 nm λmax 275 nm the photoreactor contains a collimator tube with a collimator lens with a diameter of 5 08 cm and focal length of 6 cm the treatment was applied to samples in petri dishes with a diameter of 55 mm and capacity for 20 ml of target water a magnetic stirrer with a volume of 0 25 ml was added to the petri dish for continuous stirring throughout irradiation the sample surface was at 12 2 cm from the uv light source the irradiance was measured with a radiometer hd 2102 1 delta ohm that was equipped with a probe according to the specific emission wavelength delta ohm lp471 uva uvb or uvbc the measured irradiance at the sample surface was determined as 60 2 55 w m 2 uv a 1 36 0 07 w m 2 uv b and 0 39 0 04 w m 2 uv c with petri factors of 0 945 uv a 0 957 uv b and 0 995 uv c the uv dose of each uv led can be calculated as the product of exposure time and uv light intensity including several factors that affect it in the collimated beam bolton and linden 2003 thus the germicidal irradiance was obtained based on the reactor morphometry measured irradiance and water transmittance at the maximum wavelength emission of each uv led text s1 2 3 experimental approach experimentation was conducted in ground saltwater that was collected from the campus of puerto real of the university of cádiz spain ph 7 65 conductivity 48 9 ms cm 1 salinity 35 8 and toc 1 98 mg c l 1 the raw water was filtered through 0 45 µm and sterilized in an autoclave at 121 c in order to avoid particulate material as well as lowering the viral or bacterial load in the actual water different inactivation tests were performed with a similar experimental set up of those in previous studies moreno andrés et al 2016 briefly they were arranged with water inoculated with v alginolyticus to the collimated beam reactor the treatment was applied to samples in petri dishes with a continuous stirring throughout irradiation sampling was fixed at regular exposure times which implies different uv doses firstly single uv tests were performed by evaluating the disinfection efficacy of the three different uv leds wavelengths secondly photochemical tests were conducted by combining hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 ultrapure scharlau or peroxymonosulfate hso5 obtained from oxone sigma aldrich khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 with uv irradiation to address the effect of combined processes three experimental phases were defined i effect of h2o2 or hso5 in darkness based on previous optimization studies feng et al 2020 moreno andrés et al 2016 2019 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 10 mg of h2o2 l 1 0 29 mm and 2 5 10 mg of hso5 l 1 0 008 0 034 mm were selected as appropriate reagent concentrations for assessing photo disinfection processes ii simultaneous combination of uv h2o2 or uv hso5 the reagents were added in a single dosage and immediately exposed to uv radiation by fixing exposure times up to 60 min uv a or 5 min uv b and uv c which implies maximum uv doses of 16 32 j cm 2 uv a 33 60 mj cm 2 uv b and 8 40 mj cm 2 uv c iii in a third set of experiments the effect of combining oxidants with uv radiation was studied sequentially for this h2o2 or hso5 was added first and the mixture was kept in darkness under continuous agitation for 30 min in order to provide a sufficient amount of time for the reagent to penetrate the cell and initiate intracellular oxidation feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 after this time irradiation began and the sampling procedure was done in the same way as that in point ii in order to obtain a comprehensive scenario of the disinfection process the regrowth of bacteria was monitored for each disinfection method after the inactivation assays assuring a 3 log removal values water samples were stored in sterile flasks in darkness at an ambient temperature 20 2 c for 24 h in these experiments the residual oxidant was not neutralized to evaluate the possible effects after the treatment due to the scope of the present work photoreactivation experiences were not considered given the unlikelihood of the treated water being exposed to light after treatment especially in the ballast water situation the h2o2 concentration was measured with a colorimetric method with titanium iv oxysulfate tioso4 1 9 2 1 fluka at 410 nm din 38 409 h15 a similar colorimetric method with ki was attempted for the measurement of hso5 however it was not possible due to the low concentrations used which were very close to the detection limit 1 35 mg l 1 of this procedure wacławek et al 2015 in addition the molar absorption coefficient of each reagent was estimated by obtaining the uv vis spectra all of these procedures were measured with a jenway 7315 spectrophotometer 2 4 data treatment the response of the v alginolyticus to the different photo chemical processes was obtained by plotting the logarithmic reduction of the survival microorganisms log n n0 versus exposure time or uv dose the experimental points were fitted according to the well established mathematical model of pseudo first order eq 1 for which kobs is the kinetic rate constant of inactivation that was obtained by means of exposure time t s 1 or uv dose cm2 mj 1 1 n n 0 e kobs t or uv dose a ginafit tool was employed to fit the inactivation results on the kinetic model geeraerd et al 2005 accordingly the kinetic rate constant standard error was obtained additionally the different inactivation profiles were analyzed statistically to check for significant differences between the slopes of the inactivation profiles further anova for variables in the order fitted using statgraphics centurion xviii additionally in order to quantitatively assess the combination of the uv h2o2 or uv hso5 system the synergy of the combined processes s dimensionless was quantified according to eq 2 for which a positive value is representative of the synergistic effect dewil et al 2017 2 s k c o m b i n e d 1 n k i n d i v i d u a l k c o m b i n e d the percentage of regrowth was determined according to the eq 3 where n r is the viable bacteria concentration of reactivated samples after 24 h n is the viable bacteria concentration in samples measured immediately after the uv irradiation and n 0 is the initial bacterial concentration lindenauer and darby 1994 3 r e g r o w t h 100 n r n n 0 n finally the electrical energy per order ee o kwh m3 was obtained as the amount of electrical energy required per cubic meter to reduce the bacterial concentration by an order of magnitude ee o estimations have been successfully applied to assess the performance of different uv disinfection systems with either uv leds or low pressure mercury lamps as uv sources beck et al 2017 li et al 2019 the ee o values were calculated according to eq 4 sharpless and linden 2005 that is based on the experimental set up a irradiated surface area in cm2 v sample volume in liters and wf water factor bolton and linden 2003 the experimental results obtained kobs inactivation rate constant referred to the uv dose cm2 mj 1 and the wall plug efficiency c of each specific uv led provided by the manufacturer the factor 3 6 106 was used to convert between hours to seconds mw to kw and l to m3 4 e e o a 3 6 10 6 v k o b s c w f 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation by uv led in three emission range uv a uv b or uv c the first experiments were focused on the assessment of different uv leds for the inactivation of v alginolyticus time response curves were obtained and depicted in fig 1 where different inactivation profiles were defined according to the emission wavelength i e uv a uv b or uv c the inactivation profiles of v alginolyticus differ according to the uv emission range exposures for uv a radiation the inactivation is almost negligible fig 1 whereas the inactivation rates notably improve with uv b and uv c exposures inset fig 1 in order to quantify the inactivation rate according to the uv emission range a log linear decay was fitted to the experimental data and kinetic constants kobs were obtained table 1 indeed significant differences p value 0 01 between the slopes of the various inactivation profiles were determined for the distinct uv led exposures including uv b and uv c this indicates that the inactivation rate effectively increases according to the emission wavelength as uv a uv b uv c these results can be explained by the fact that the sensitivity to ultraviolet light is wavelength dependent pousty et al 2021 thus the results obtained with uv b exposures imply minor damage on v alginolyticus than with the uv c 42 less than the uv c according to the kobs s 1 although uv c causes direct damage to cellular dna absorption by genetic material also occurs within the uv b range whereas the genetic material slightly absorbs within the uv a range producing mainly physiological alterations in the bacterial cells giannakis et al 2022 song et al 2019 the main cell components affected by uv a are involved in the metabolic cycle such as lipids some proteins and especially reactive oxygen species ros scavengers such as catalases or superoxide dismutase feng et al 2020 giannakis et al 2022 however it has been demonstrated that these types of damage can effectively inactivate cells by triggering intracellular ros formation giannakis et al 2022 but at relatively higher uv a doses 50 100 j cm 2 that would require longer exposure times than those tested in this study giannakis et al 2022 song et al 2019 in order to properly compare the results with literature the inactivation rate constants in terms of the uv dose kobs cm2 mj 1 together with that estimated for reaching a specific log removal value lrv were also calculated table 1 in this regard the v alginolyticus seems to be more sensitive to uv radiation than other typical bacterial indicators such as e coli beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 song et al 2016 however for other opportunistic bacteria like legionella pneumophila pseudomonas aeruginosa or vibrio parahaemolyticus the kmax λ260 is approximately 1 cm2 mj 1 with uv doses of 1 3 3 0 mj cm 2 per lrv oguma et al 2019 which agrees with the results obtained in this study in the case of a uv b range λ300 similar kinetic rate constants were obtained when comparing with other types of bacteria oguma et al 2019 rattanakul and oguma 2018 finally with uv a exposure negligible inactivation effects were obtained the maximum uv a dose applied in the present study was 18 1 j cm 2 which resulted in a non observable effect for v alginolyticus inactivation it also agrees with previous studies for which negligible effects were achieved for vibrio species nakahashi et al 2014 but also for other microorganisms including bacteria or viruses guerra rodríguez et al 2022 umar et al 2019 it is important to consider that some discrepancies in time dose reciprocity might be obtained when scaling up the process in continuous reactors this is possibly related to different uv damage mechanisms at longer wavelengths in the specific case of v alginolyticus a time intensity reciprocity was observed for a uv dose range between 0 and 7 mj cm 2 within uv c λmax 275 nm romero martínez et al 2022 however further studies are recommended to effectively address the biological damage that might not only be related to the uv dose but also the exposure time wavelength and intensity pousty et al 2021 song et al 2016 3 2 combination of uv led with h2o2 or hso5 3 2 1 uv h2o2 and uv hso5 firstly the effect of different oxidants was tested in darkness a slight bacterial mortality was quantified as 0 52 0 41 lrv and 0 95 0 39 lrv after the addition of h2o2 or hso5 respectively during 60 min of contact time the specific results and discussion are detailed in the supplementary material text s2 figs s1 and s2 once the effect of single treatments i e uv radiation table 1 and reagent effect text s2 fig s1 were quantified the combination of uv radiation in different emission ranges together with h2o2 or hso5 were tested results in the form of inactivation profiles are depicted in fig 2 for each of the different cases under study it is observed that there is an improvement in the disinfection process when either h2o2 or hso5 are applied in combination with the uv the specific kinetic rate constants are summarized in fig 3 and they are also explicitly reported in table 1 for the three uv emission wavelengths the improvements are more noticeable with the use of hso5 than with the use of h2o2 figs 2 and 3 that is most perceptible in the uv a range followed by the uv b and then the uv c in fact significant differences comparing the slopes obtained in the inactivation curves were obtained when comparing the combined with the single irradiation process for uv a h2o2 or uv a hso5 uv b hso5 and uv c hso5 p value 0 01 however for uv b h2o2 p value 0 0583 and uv c h2o2 p value 0 3371 no significant differences were determined regarding the single irradiation process h2o2 consumption rate increased from uv c to uv a ranges with remaining h2o2 concentrations of 7 45 mg h2o2 l 1 uv a 8 83 mg h2o2 l 1 uv b and 9 03 mg h2o2 l 1 uv c the detailed h2o2 consumption profiles are shown in fig s2 related to the uv dose the results that were obtained suggest that it can be reduced down to 91 9 and 95 9 uv a 18 1 and 52 6 uv b or 20 7 and 33 9 uv c for h2o2 and hso5 respectively in addition there was clearly a synergistic effect in the uv a and uv b range fig s4 this confirms that the improvement on combined processes is clearly evidenced at longer wavelengths i e uv a uv b uv c the increase in the efficiency of the disinfection process can be related to the formation of reactive oxygen species ros in the extracellular environment the photocleavage of h2o2 or hso5 may depend on the wavelength applied thus the photolysis of h2o2 or hso5 will most likely occur when there is an overlap between the emission and absorbance spectra of the oxidizing agents fig 3d as can be seen in fig 3d the molar absorption coefficient of hso5 is higher than h2o2 in addition hso5 reaches the uv a emission spectra which is contrary to the h2o2 that clearly extends to the uv c and slightly reaches the uv b spectrum accordingly the generation of reactive species because of the photolysis of h2o2 is highly probable under the uv c radiation and to some extent under the uv b radiation meanwhile the high molar absorption coefficient of hso5 makes the photolysis of this compound possible under the uv a uv b and uv c radiation when there is no overlapping of the emission and absorption spectra the probable pathway of cell damage that is observed can be related to an intracellular effect section 3 1 irradiation can inflict damage on genetic material but also on key ros controlling enzymes depending on the emission wavelength giannakis et al 2016 pousty et al 2021 santos et al 2013 additionally the presence of h2o2 or hso5 in the extracellular environment can lead to an accumulation of it in the cell berruti et al 2021 feng et al 2020 as a result the combination of uv and h2o2 or hso5 can result in a series of intracellular processes such as fenton like reactions that would eventually inactivate the cells berruti et al 2021 feng et al 2020 giannakis et al 2016 according to the results intracellular processes might gain importance in the range of the uv a followed by the uv b and to a lesser extent with uv c radiation this is in agreement with the h2o2 consumption rates that were obtained fig s2 nonetheless it is important to note that the high uv sensitivity of v alginolyticus implies low uv exposure times with the subsequent low uv doses applied under the uv c or uv b exposures this makes it difficult to effectively quantify the disinfection enhancement produced from combined uv h2o2 or uv hso5 meanwhile the longer exposure times of uv a clearly permit the observation of disinfection enhancement from the photochemical processes 3 2 2 h2o2 uv and hso5 uv sequential approach at this point experimentation was carried out in order to address the effects of combined processes but following a different strategy the reagents were sequentially applied h2o2 or hso5 followed by uv for providing enough time for h2o2 or hso5 to penetrate the cell to initiate the intracellular oxidation thus the addition of the reagent can be considered as pretreatment with uv irradiation as the secondary disinfectant similar to that in the previous sections inactivation profiles were obtained and kinetic rate constants based on a linear inactivation model were determined thus kobs was represented in terms of uv dose cm2 mj 1 in fig 4 the specific inactivation profiles were represented in fig s5 inactivation during the 30 min of darkness was 0 48 0 17 lrv h2o2 and 0 52 0 22 lrv hso5 according to the values of inactivation rate constants slight differences can be observed according to the oxidizing agent h2o2 or hso5 and the irradiation wavelength in the case of h2o2 the inactivation constant between the simultaneous and sequential process i decreases in the uv a photo assisted process ii remains similar under the uv b irradiation and iii slightly increases under uv c light the consumption of h2o2 in the first 30 min of darkness was quantified as 26 7 fig s6 this may be due to the inherent compounds at the bulk but also to the bacterial activity that is able to consume h2o2 but only minimally effects the survival of the microorganisms because of the scavenging action of the cell s enzymes such as superoxide dismutase or catalases feng et al 2020 pedersen et al 2019 the subsequent irradiation does not produce any enhancement in the case of the uv a or uv b ranges thus indicating that the possible previous diffusion of h2o2 into the cell apparently did not produce extra damage however the slight enhancement in the uv c region increase of 4 9 the kobs can be ascertained from the severe damages that single uv c causes at low uv doses at the same time the photolysis of h2o2 can also be produced as previously discussed in section 3 2 1 in fact higher h2o2 consumption rates have been observed under uv c exposure fig s6 similar results were obtained using bacillus subtilis spores zhang et al 2014 on the other hand in the case of hso5 the inactivation constant that was obtained always decreased under sequential processes in comparison with the simultaneous strategy fig 4 these results can be related to the low concentrations of hso5 used in the present study and their unstable nature therefore a lower reagent amount will be available to interact with photons after 30 min consequently the oxidative damage caused by the hso5 itself does not result in a synergy if irradiation is applied after a certain amount of time another strategy that could enhance disinfection would be the sequential application of a uv oxidizing agent in this regard the damage caused by uv irradiation in any of its emission ranges would damage key cell components and subsequently facilitate the action of oxidizing agents to accelerate disinfection giannakis et al 2022 zhang et al 2014 some promising results were reported by sequentially combining single irradiation uv a uv c xiao et al 2018 or uv c h2o2 zhang et al 2014 thus future studies in this regard would be recommended to comprehensively assess this treatment strategy 3 3 regrowth after treatment due to the capacity of dark repair that some microorganisms have regrowth can occasionally result from either surviving bacteria after inactivation together with reactivation or repair processes thus the regrowth capability after treatment was evaluated for each photo chemical process of saving samples in the dark for 24 h the regrowth percentage is summarized in table 1 according to the results this occurs in each of the single irradiation tests uv alone although with lower regrowth percentages than uv alone certain regrowth is observed in hso5 based processes with either the uv a or uv b but is minor for uv c however in the process combined with h2o2 a negligible regrowth is obtained for all tests the single irradiation processes that were tested are based on the exposure of v alginolyticus at different uv wavelengths that vary in the bactericidal mode of action the cell damage obtained from the uv c region is mainly at the genome level while further cell components can be damaged as a result of uv b or uv a exposures at the same time the most germicidal wavelength is within the uv c range as confirmed by the inactivation profiles fig 2 table 1 thus the regrowth capability is directly related to the inactivation efficiency obtaining the lowest regrowth percentages in samples exposed to the uv c followed by those exposed to the uv b in the combined uv h2o2 process the regrowth capability is prevented in all cases which indicates that the level of cellular aggressions is apparently high in this combined treatment it can be a result of the severe damage produced in the cell due to hydroxyl radicals generated from the h2o2 photolysis in the uv c range but also other intracellular processes that might take importance in the uv a or uv b processes moreover the residual h2o2 fig s2 can increase the accumulation rate in the cell and cause a growth defect finally for the combined uv hso5 process regrowth is not avoided in 24 h in exposures to the uv a and uv b ranges it is negligible in the case of the uv c exposures it highlights that uv hso5 although sufficient to accelerate disinfection does not seem to be sufficient to prevent subsequent regrowth 3 4 electrical energy per order ee o values to obtain a final overview of the different processes tested in the present study the electrical energy per order values ee o kwh m 3 were estimated and represented in fig 5 following the same trends obtained in previous sections the ee o values decrease according to single uv processes uv h2o2 uv hso5 as they are directly related to the inactivation constant for single uv methods the obtained ee o values are 67 55 0 38 and 0 04 kwh m 3 for uv a uv b and uv c respectively the combination with h2o2 results in an ee o decrease of 96 80 uv a 18 00 uv b and 0 04 uv c whereas the application of hso5 implies an ee o reduction of 97 50 uv a 46 50 uv b and 0 17 uv c according to miklos et al 2018 those processes with ee o 1 kwh m 3 may represent a realistic range for full scale application in this scenario the uv b or uv c based processes present potential for their further study at larger scales the uv a process although showing promising results from the enhancement with a combination with h2o2 or hso5 still presents values above 1 kwh m 3 in any case the estimated ee o values presented in this study show promising potential for the application of uv leds even in the range with those obtained with low and medium pressure mercury lamps miklos et al 2018 nonetheless there is still a wide range for improvement primarily due to the still low wall plug efficiency of leds 4 conclusions in the present study the efficacy of the disinfection of the marine pathogen v alginolyticus is addressed by means of different uv led photochemical processes with the use of h2o2 or hso5 that are distinguished according to the emission wavelengths of uv a λmax 365 nm uv b λmax 300 nm or uv c λmax 275 nm thus the optimization of the uv dose and the wavelength effect for specific marine water disinfection is emphasized the disinfection efficacy based on the inactivation rate constants that were calculated is inversely proportional to the wavelength that is used so that higher disinfection efficiency is achieved with shorter wavelengths uv a uv b uv c v alginolyticus presents high sensitivity to the uv c and uv b radiation with obtained values of 1 60 mj cm 2 and 9 50 mj cm 2 per lrv respectively single uv a irradiation does not produce observable inactivation 0 39 lrv at 18 1 j cm 2 the three wavelengths tested exhibited a synergistic effect for both photochemical processes uv h2o2 and uv hso5 nonetheless the major inactivation rate constants were for uv hso5 in front of uv h2o2 process additionally disinfection enhancement was more evident at longer wavelengths uv a uv b uv c which suggests that intracellular processes might be important in the uv a range followed by uv b irradiation and to a lesser extent uv c radiation it is also important to note the higher uv sensitivity of v alginolyticus and thus the lower uv doses applied in the uv b and uv c regions on the other hand application in the sequential mode hso5 or h2o2 uv provided negligible results in the inactivation of v alginolyticus when compared with the simultaneous mode bacterial regrowth was only avoided after 24 h with the use of h2o2 thus although with slightly lower inactivation rates compared to uv hso5 the level of cellular aggression was apparently higher in the uv h2o2 process finally both photochemical systems present promising eeo values especially when applied with leds emitting in the uv b or uv c region for which eeo 1 kwh m 3 was obtained
