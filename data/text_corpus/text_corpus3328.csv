16640,water quality events such as increases in stormwater or wastewater effluent in drinking water sources pose hazards to drinking water consumers stormwater and wastewater effluent enter lake mead an important drinking water source in the southwest usa via the las vegas wash previous studies have applied machine learning and online instruments to detect contamination in water distribution systems however alert systems at drinking water intakes would provide more time for corrective action an array of online instruments measuring ph conductivity redox potential turbidity temperature tryptophan like fluorescence uv absorbance uva254 toc and chlorophyll a was fed raw water directly from lake mead wastewater effluent dry weather las vegas wash and storm impacted las vegas wash samples were blended into the instrument inlets at known ratios to simulate three types of adverse water quality events data preprocessing was conducted to correct for diurnal patterns or instrument drift supervised machine learning was conducted using previously published models in r ninety nine models were screened on the raw data eight high performing models were evaluated in depth and optimized weighted k nearest neighbors single c5 0 ruleset mixture discriminant analysis and an ensemble of these three models had accuracy over 97 when assigning test set data among three classes normal event or maintenance the ensemble detected all event types at the earliest timepoint and had one false positive that was not a lag error i e consecutively following a true positive omitting maintenance the adaboost model had over 99 test set accuracy and zero false positives that were not lag errors data preprocessing was beneficial but the optimal methods were model specific all nine water quality variables were useful for most models but uva254 and turbidity were most important graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords principle component analysis support vector machine de facto reuse big data artificial intelligence fault diagnosis 1 introduction water quality events such as stormwater surges or fluctuations in de facto wastewater reuse dfr could cause hazards for water consumers for example stormwater surges caused turbidity to rise beyond the treatment capacity of a drinking water facility leading to a boil notice in laughlin nevada brean and taloma 2015 the percentage of dfr may change depending on flowrates in a river rice and westerhoff 2014 furthermore dfr at drinking water intakes in reservoirs can vary by greater than a factor of five depending on mixing conditions e g wind and thermal stratification pecson et al 2018 stormwater influx especially urban runoff may increase contaminants such as turbidity total organic carbon toc e coli metals disinfection byproduct precursors and aromatic hydrocarbons hill et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 whereas increased dfr may elevate contaminants including endocrine disrupting compounds and disinfection byproduct precursors snyder et al 1999 weisman et al 2019 the hazards from stormwater and dfr to drinking water consumers are expected to increase with time due to climate change for example the average percentage of dfr in the western usa is expected to increase over time as climate change related drought reduces stream flows in the region rice and westerhoff 2014 climate change is predicted to exacerbate weather extremes which could increase the severity or frequency of storm events that disrupt water treatment qiu et al 2019 events like stormwater or dfr fluctuations must be detected and acted upon rapidly such as by adjusting treatment or switching drinking water sources conducting grab samples and benchtop analyses with sufficient breadth and frequency for rapid 24 h detection of problematic water quality changes would require economically infeasible amounts of laboratory staff labor therefore online instruments are needed for rapid detection of hazardous changes in water quality numerous types of online instrumentation are now commercially available for the water industry optical sensors e g uv absorbance or fluorescence are especially promising due to their low cost low maintenance and high measurement frequency many studies have found correlations between specific fluorescence wavelength pairs and certain types of contamination for example the presence of wastewater effluent has been associated with tryptophan like fluorescence 280 nm excitation and 350 nm emission baker 2001 however methods are needed to process the data from these online instruments and generate alerts for utilities with minimal false positives supervised machine learning sml has been proposed for alerts in drinking water systems sml algorithms build a model using a labeled dataset i e a table of timeseries water quality data with a column stating normal or event and then use this model to make predictions about new data sml has many advantages relative to fixed thresholds firstly many sml models can categorize data into three or more categories rather than merely above or below the threshold this could allow sml to predict not only whether something unusual is occurring but also what type of event secondly sml models are multivariate and thus can distinguish whether the data as a whole is abnormal even if each water quality variable individually is within acceptable ranges furthermore machine learning can be adaptive i e continually updated with new training data such that its accuracy would improve over time finally sml can be nonlinear consider for example an alert system with two variables using fixed thresholds anything inside of a pre determined square on a coordinate plane would be considered normal and anything outside of that square would trigger an alert however using a sml model such as k nearest neighbors knn the region s enclosing the normal data could take on limitless possible shapes furthermore ensembles can take the consensus of multiple types of sml models sml has previously been applied for event detection in drinking water however most previous studies focused on treated water in distribution systems arad et al 2013 asheri arnon et al 2018 hou et al 2015 huang et al 2017 saetta et al 2021 a machine learning based alert system for online instruments in the drinking water intake could be more challenging 1 because there could be greater fouling or instrument drift on the sensors since the water would have more organic matter and 2 there could be wider baseline variability under normal conditions due to diurnal patterns sub hazardous precipitation etc however an alert system at the intake would provide greater safety because it would allow an opportunity for preventative action at the drinking water treatment plant dwtp before water reaches consumers furthermore nonhazardous water quality changes in the distribution system would likely be caused by operational changes e g pumps turning on which could be corrected by including operational data in the model in contrast nonhazardous water quality changes would more likely be due to natural cycles which would be uncontrolled but potentially modelable thus the most appropriate data preprocessing techniques and sml models may differ between raw and treated water contexts in this study multiple data preprocessing techniques and sml models were tested to generate alerts using data from a series of online instruments testing raw surface water from lake mead the surface water was actively pumped from the lake such that real seasonal or diurnal patterns or other variability would be reflected in the water quality data stormwater and wastewater effluent samples were injected at various blending ratios into the pipeline feeding the instruments nine water quality variables ph conductivity redox potential orp temperature turbidity tryptophan like fluorescence toc uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 and chlorophyll a were recorded at 15 min intervals over the course of 16 days the data was labelled into two three or five categories and split approximately 50 50 into train and test sets sml was conducted in r using the caret package kuhn 2008 ninety nine classification models i e models that predict in which categorical group a datapoint belongs and one ensemble were evaluated tuning parameters were adjusted and optimized within relatively accurate models models and the ensemble were compared based on accuracy sensitivity and specificity 2 methods 2 1 regional context the southern nevada water authority snwa is the drinking water wholesaler for the las vegas nevada metropolitan area with a population over 2 million people and average annual precipitation less than 11 cm las vegas is the most arid major city in the usa snwa gets approximately 10 of its water from groundwater and 90 from lake mead fig 1 lake mead is the largest reservoir in the united states with a maximum volume of 36 km3 holdren and turner 2010 it is the oldest reservoir in the colorado river system which provides drinking water to approximately 40 million people and supports approximately 16 million jobs and over one trillion usd year of economic activity milly and dunne 2020 unfortunately lake mead has not been near full capacity since 2000 and has since dropped by 40 m to 40 capacity usbor 2021 approximately 97 of the water in lake mead comes from the colorado river and this portion of the inflow is relatively pristine blunt et al 2018 however the colorado river s flow is historically overallocated and expected to decline over time due to climate change castle et al 2014 milly and dunne 2020 approximately 2 of the flow to lake mead comes from the las vegas wash lvw holdren and turner 2010 the lvw flow has more than doubled since the 1980 s due to the growing population of las vegas and it is around 85 wastewater effluent benotti et al 2010 holdren and turner 2010 the remainder is primarily resurfacing groundwater with naturally high levels of selenium ryan and zhou 2010 and dry weather urban runoff the lvw has poly and per flouroalkyl substance concentrations above the drinking water standards of multiple us states post 2020 quiñones and snyder 2009 the lvw is also a source of n nitrosodimethylamine precursors pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds to lake mead benotti et al 2010 woods and dickenson 2016 the wastewater effluent from the lvw was suspected to have contributed to a cryptosporidium outbreak in the 1990 s goldstein et al 1996 in response snwa installed an ozonation system to enhance cryptosporidium disinfection well beyond regulatory requirements urban stormwater from las vegas also enters lake mead via the lvw holdren and turner 2010 this urban stormwater is relatively contaminated i e high dissolved and suspended solids compared to other urban stormwater in the usa due to the high number of antecedent dry days between precipitation events zeng et al 2016 considering the inflows to lake mead are around 2 from the lvw and the lvw is approximately 85 wastewater effluent one might expect the dfr at snwa s drinking water intake would be 1 7 however based on a hydrodynamic model and the wastewater indicator sucralose the current average dfr is somewhat lower around 1 4 hannoun et al 2021 mawhinney et al 2011 this is because the lvw water is saltier but warmer than lake mead so it tends to pass through as a plume at a depth at which its density matches the density of the surrounding water labounty and horn 1997 this plume has higher concentrations of wastewater derived chemicals than the surrounding water snyder and benotti 2010 in 2015 snwa completed a new drinking water intake at a deeper elevation in lake mead for long term water supply resilience hannoun et al 2021 an additional benefit of this project was increasing the vertical distance between the intake and the typical depth of the plume by over 40 m nevertheless ongoing climate change drought and urbanization are expected to increase the probability and severity of events in which the effective blending ratio of lvw water could suddenly increase at the intake 2 2 online instruments a pvc pipe conveyed 1 l min of water from lake mead to three online instruments measuring nine water quality parameters turbidity conductivity ph orp temperature uva254 toc chlorophyll a and tryptophan like fluorescence the instruments were maintained weekly and calibrated monthly data was gathered for more than a year prior to the blending tests section 2 3 to establish baseline water quality and so the accuracy of the online instruments could be compared against benchtop data a bluei 702 turbiplus hydroguard monitored turbidity conductivity ph temperature and orp a realtech pl3500 monitored absorption over the wavelength range 200 to 800 nm at approximately 3 nm intervals using two lamps tungsten and deuterium it then output uva254 and site specific absorbance based estimates of toc and chlorophyll a chlorophyll a like absorbance is considered an algal indicator choo et al 2018 uva254 has many useful correlations in the drinking water field for example uva254 correlated with e coli in spring water after surface runoff events stadler et al 2008 the pl3500 and the hydroguard were both scada compatible and their water quality parameters were recorded at 15 min intervals an sts smf4 fluorimeter measured tryptophan like fluorescence around 280 nm excitation and 350 nm emission baker et al 2004 tryptophan like fluorescence has also been shown to be a quantitative fingerprint of dfr baker 2001 baker et al 2004 found a strong correlation between tryptophan like fluorescence as measured by a benchtop fluorometer and a portable smf2 an earlier model of the instrument used here this smf4 fluorimeter was primarily designed as a portable instrument for field sampling but was adapted for online monitoring using a quartz flowcell this instrument was not scada compatible so while it recorded data every 15 min these 15 min intervals did not necessarily align with the 15 min intervals of the other two instruments thus the tryptophan like fluorescence data was linearly interpolated onto the time vector of the other two instruments 2 3 blending events using a masterflex peristaltic pump relatively contaminated water was injected from a magnetically stirred 18 l carboy into the pvc pipe upstream of the instruments fig 2 the pump was calibrated prior to the first experiment and the injected flow was further verified by recording the change in volume in the carboy at 15 min intervals the flow in the pipe was measured with a 200 3000 ml min brooks instrument rotameter a koflo static inline mixer ensured the injected water was well mixed with the raw lake mead water prior to reaching the instruments blending events were conducted representing three lvw related scenarios lvw water during dry weather tertiary effluent from a large wastewater treatment plant wwtp that discharges into the lvw and lvw water approximately 12 h after a rain event samples were collected from the locations shown in fig 1 in 5 gallon 19 l plastic buckets stored at 4 c and used within 14 days the dry weather lvw scenario simulated elevated dfr due to changing mixing conditions increasing lvw water at the drinking water intake the wastewater effluent simulated a more general broadly applicable dfr scenario the stormwater impacted lvw simulated an urban runoff surge scenario this scenario would be relatively unlikely for snwa s current drinking water intake at the current lake mead water level but would be of interest to other utilities or the lake mead water level drops to a concerning level the dry weather lvw sample was compared against archived data in the lower colorado river water quality database for the same reach of the stream to confirm that the measured parameters were typical of this body of water i e within a 95 confidence interval of the historical mean the wwtp treats approximately 380 000 m3 day of municipal wastewater with a modified johannesburg process no mixed liquor return for biological phosphorus removal followed by alum coagulation and dual media filtration gerrity et al 2011 pruisner 2016 the waters used for blending were interrelated in that the dry weather lvw sample consisted of approximately 85 wastewater effluent from the same metro area as the wastewater effluent sample including around 40 from the exact same wwtp the stormwater impacted lvw sample consisted of approximately 50 urban runoff and 50 similar water as the dry weather lvw sample fig s1 each water type was injected into the pipe at three blending ratios for one hour each consecutively and in order from lowest to highest blending there was one exception to this protocol a 45 min gap between the middle and highest blending ratios for wastewater effluent there was at least one hour between the third highest blending ratio of the previous water type and the first lowest blending ratio of the subsequent water type this time between blending events of different water types was intended to allow contaminants to wash out of the system and for water quality to return to baseline the middle blending ratios were selected such that the expected water quality would be approximately two median absolute deviations mads above the median for at least one parameter tables s1 s3 this was calculated based on an analysis of the past year of online water quality data and benchtop measurements of the water samples conducted immediately prior to the first blending events the blending ratios were 2 5 and 10 for tertiary wastewater effluent 0 02 0 05 and 0 10 for stormwater impacted lvw and 0 5 2 5 and 5 for dry weather lvw one blending event with each water type was conducted during an 8 day period and the procedure was then replicated during the following eight days table s4 thus there were 12 true positives i e four 15 min samples over one hour for each blending ratio times three blending ratios for each of the three event types in each dataset the raw data from these blending events is publicly available for download via github https github com kathom198 star lab blob master phase1 data xlsx 2 4 benchtop analyses ph was measured with a fisher scientific accumet ap110 portable ph meter conductivity was measured with a hach sension378 turbidity was measured with a hach 2100an turbidimeter uva254 was measured with a hach dr 6000 contrary to conventional procedure samples were not filtered prior to uva254 analysis because this gave a better indication of the expected change on the real tech pl3500 which did not have a pre filter toc was measured with a shimadzu toc l toc analyzer 2 5 machine learning observations in the dataset were first labelled as one of three event types or classes normal maintenance or event maintenance refers to timepoints at which human operators conducted routine cleaning or preventative maintenance on the instruments and recorded these activities in a logbook event refers to times when any of the three blending ratios of any of the three water types were occurring sml was conducted with r version 3 4 3 in the rstudio interface version 1 0 136 using the caret package kuhn 2008 2020 the caret package contains a set of programming functions that streamline the process of generating predictive models it allows a library of over 200 types of sml models to be trained and tested using uniform syntax classification models i e those predicting whether an observation belongs within a limited set of numerical or qualitative values such as normal or event were applied rather than regression models i e those predicting non discrete quantitative outputs such as percentage dfr the dataset was split approximately 50 50 into train and test with one example of each type of blending event section 2 3 in the train and test sets the split was chronological not randomized to simulate real world model training and implementation and to enable time series based data preprocessing techniques section 2 6 classification models available within caret were first trained on the train set n 776 the trained model then generated predictions for the test set n 785 these predictions were then compared to the true labels ninety nine classification models designed for datasets with more than two classes were initially screened on raw data for all nine variables with their default tuning parameters i e hyperparameters in caret the computation time train set accuracy test set accuracy p value i e probability that the true accuracy is below the no information rate nir event sensitivity and number of false positives were recorded in appendix a nir is the accuracy when predicting that all datapoints belong to the most common class in the train set the nir was 94 1 for three classes or 95 4 omitting maintenance datapoints the p value that the test set accuracy was above the nir was calculated using the binomial confidence interval method kuhn 2008 clopper and pearson 1934 the train set accuracy was internally cross validated with 25 bootstraps i e 25 random samples with replacement of equal length as the train set were generated and split 75 25 into train and test sets the average accuracy on these random test sets selected from within the train set was considered the train set accuracy this bootstrapped train set accuracy was used for selecting tuning parameters false positives were defined as normal observations incorrectly identified as an event since maintenance related errors could be considered relatively unimportant computation times were for a desktop personal computer with intel core i7 7700t cpu 2 90 ghz up to 15 min per tuning parameter setting was considered acceptable the seed was set to 1 before each training to reset the random number generator and ensure reproducibility test set accuracy was used as the main performance metric in this study however it was hypothesized that models with relatively high train set accuracy but low test set accuracy i e relatively overfit might perform better after tuning parameter optimization also it was hypothesized that models with relatively high sensitivity but high false positive rate or vice versa might perform well by both metrics and thus also higher overall accuracy after data preprocessing thus models were selected for further evaluation if they were ranked first or second for any of the following criteria bootstrapped train set accuracy test set accuracy event sensitivity excluding models with less than 90 test set accuracy or fewest false positives excluding models with less than 90 test set accuracy or that predicted all observations to be normal these select models were then tested with various data preprocessing methods section 2 5 the preprocessing method that resulted in highest test set accuracy was selected next each model with its optimal preprocessing was evaluated with a range of tuning parameters they were also iteratively tested with the least important feature omitted to determine whether equal accuracy could be achieved with less computation time the least important feature was determined using the varimp function alongside the screened but not selected models the performance metrics of the versions of the selected models with sub optimal preprocessing feature selection or tuning can be found in appendix a three models were selected for inclusion in an ensemble based on having the highest test set accuracy the ensemble made the same prediction as the majority of its component models e g if two models predicted normal but the third model predicted event the ensemble predicted normal in the case of a three way split decision the ensemble selected the prediction of the model with highest test set accuracy describing the theory and methodologies of the 90 models screened but not selected for in depth evaluation would cause this article to exceed the length requirements of this journal however the r packages of all models tested are listed online by kuhn 2019 the documentation for these packages is available in the cran package repository r 2021 this documentation usually contains peer reviewed citations 2 6 data preprocessing data preprocessing techniques were applied to correct for diurnal patterns or instrument drift since the water was pumped from lake mead to the instruments in real time any natural cycles in the reservoir e g rising and falling temperatures during day and night would be reflected in the data such diurnal patterns would increase the variability of the data making small changes from other causes less likely to be detected for example an increase in temperature due to an increase in warmer wastewater effluent might be undetected if it occurred in the early morning when water is coolest furthermore online water quality sensors such as fluorimeters are known to drift i e have a gradual increase in bias or error in a particular direction over time between cleanings when placed in natural waters sorensen et al 2018 the first approach was to calculate the difference relative to the mean of the previous four datapoints i e previous hour these differences are herein referred to as deltas huang et al 2017 applied a similar approach for an event detection study with treated water another technique was to calculate the slope of the linear regression of the variable over time for the previous hour these coefficients are herein referred to as slopes the deltas and slopes were calculated for all variables deltas and slopes were provided as features i e independent variables to the models in addition to the raw data another technique was to model the diurnal pattern as a sine function with a period of 24 h fig s2 the models were fit to the train set data using the nls function in r which uses the gauss newton algorithm to determine non linear least squares estimates the gauss newton algorithm is a method for finding minima of sums of squared values such as sums of squared errors qin et al 2018 the predictions of the sine model were then calculated for both the train and test sets the residuals of these models are the difference between each measured datapoint and the expected value for that time of day this procedure could be considered a form of state estimation as discussed by mckenna et al 2007 and it was conducted on features with visibly apparent diurnal patterns in the train set the residuals of these sine models were used in lieu of the raw data for the corresponding features and are referred to herein as diurnally adjusted this procedure reduced the baseline variability of these features table s5 the amplitudes of the sine models were statistically significant p value 0 05 though less than 3 relative to the respective train set means fig s2 little diurnal variation would be expected in a hypolimnetic system at the current intake depth to the extent that the temperature variation observed may have originated in the pipeline rather than in lake mead nevertheless it was hypothesized that correcting for these small variations could increase the sensitivity of the sml models for atypical water quality events in sml additional features provide greater increases in accuracy when they are not correlated with the features already in the model irizarry 2019 thus another form of preprocessing employed was principle component analysis pca with normalization using the prcomp function in r pca transforms a set of observations of variables into a set of values of uncorrelated principle components pcs thus in theory each pc should provide new information to the sml algorithm the number of pcs is equal to the original number of features furthermore the pcs are ordered such that the first has the largest possible variance and the second accounts for as much as possible of the remaining variability and so on thus pca can be used for dimensionality reduction i e reducing the number of independent variables to accelerate subsequent calculations by omitting latter pcs the component scores of the testing set were calculated based on the variable loadings of the train set pcs replaced the raw data as features in the models 2 7 classification among other numbers of classes classification among three classes event normal maintenance was the focus of this manuscript however in practice utilities may choose to omit rather than label and predict observations during maintenance periods thus 43 classification models that can only predict two classes as well as the select models mentioned above were re screened as described above but with maintenance data omitted of these eight models were selected for evaluation with preprocessing feature omission and parameter tuning based on the same criteria as for models predicting three classes provided sufficient sample size it would be ideal if a machine learning based alert system could indicate not only whether an event is occurring but also what type of event is occurring for example increases in dfr or stormwater surges might merit different responses thus the eight models selected for in depth evaluation based on their performance with three classes were also trained and tested with five classes normal maintenance wastewater effluent dry weather las vegas wash and stormwater impacted las vegas wash 3 results 3 1 water quality data median water quality of the waters used in the blending experiments is shown in table 1 the data for the baseline raw surface water was typical of this drinking water intake in lake mead all three water types injected into the instruments had lower ph but higher conductivity turbidity tryptophan like fluorescence toc and uva254 compared to lake mead the stormwater impacted lvw sample had particularly elevated turbidity ph temperature conductivity and orp had visually apparent diurnal patterns and so were selected for diurnal adjustment preprocessing fig 3 during blending events water quality generally changed as expected based on the blending ratio and characteristics of the separate waters table 1 one exception was conductivity decline by 2 during the stormwater impacted lvw blending events because conductivity was on the downward slope of its diurnal pattern at the time tryptophan like fluorescence had upward drift between maintenance events due to fouling in the flowcell this drift was more pronounced during the test set fig 4 possibly due to lower flow during this period temperature increased during blending events because the lake mead water was around 16 c and the blended waters were approximately room temperature figs 3 and 4 it is realistic that temperature would increase during full scale events since the lvw is warmer than lake mead labounty and horn 1997 3 2 results with three classes ninety nine models listed in appendix a were screened for their ability to classify data into three classes normal event or maintenance using their default tuning parameters in the r caret package and raw data for nine water quality parameters ph conductivity orp temperature turbidity tryptophan like fluorescence uva254 toc and chlorophyll a models were selected for in depth evaluation based on ranking within the top two for any of the following four criteria train set accuracy test set accuracy event sensitivity or fewest false positives the in depth evaluation included testing preprocessing techniques section 2 6 optimizing tuning parameters and omitting least important features to potentially increase calculation time without reducing accuracy the conditions and accuracies of the optimized models are shown in table 2 weighted k nearest neighbors kknn was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the highest train set accuracy with raw data at 98 9 table s6 kknn assigns an observation to a class based on the plurality of k nearest observations in the train set schliep et al 2016 nearness is according to minkowski distance and neighbors can be weighted based on various methods kknn has three tuning parameters kmax is the maximum number of neighbors distance is the order of minkowski distance and kernel is the formula for weighting the neighbors diurnally adjustment only resulted in increased test set accuracy for temperature appendix a adding slope features resulted in a slightly greater improvement of test set accuracy than deltas the highest test accuracy after preprocessing was 97 1 with pca and the ninth pc omitted table 2 this test set accuracy was significantly above the nir of 94 1 over the range of kmax 2 to 9 distance 1 to 3 and the 11 available weighting kernels the highest train set accuracy was achieved with kmax of 2 distance of 2 and the rectangular kernel i e equal weights however the test set accuracy was 95 8 lower than with the default tuning parameters this result indicates that despite boostrap cross validation the model was overfit k nearest neighbor models with k less than 5 are generally considered at risk of overfitting irizarry 2019 localized linear discriminant analysis loclda was selected for in depth evaluation because it tied for second highest train set accuracy with raw data at 98 6 table s6 loclda generates linear discriminant analysis classification rules for each observation considering only the k nearest neighbors within the train set roever et al 2018 diurnal adjustment of both temperature and conductivity resulted in higher test set accuracy appendix a diurnally adjusted conductivity was identified as the least important feature but omitting it reduced test set accuracy using deltas slopes or pca decreased event sensitivity the optimal k was 170 approximately 20 of the train set the highest test set accuracy after optimizing the preprocessing methods and k was 96 2 table 2 among the optimized models loclda tied for highest event sensitivity and detected all three event types on the first time point table 3 shows the time until first detection for each of the selected models calculated as the number of consecutive false negatives at the start of the event multiplied by 15 min however loclda also had 15 false positives which could be considered unacceptable least squares support vector machine with radial basis function kernel lssvmradial was also selected for in depth evaluation because it tied for second highest train set accuracy with raw data at 98 6 table s6 least square support vector machines have been described by suykens and vandewalle 1999 sigma is the inverse kernel width and tau is the regularization parameter diurnal adjustments did not improve the accuracy of this model appendix a deltas slopes and pca all increased test set accuracy to approximately 96 omitting the chlorophyll a slope resulted in two fewer false positives omitting the conductivity slope resulted equal accuracy and slightly faster computation time reducing tau and sigma resulted in a higher train set accuracy but higher test set false positives indicating overfitting single c5 0 ruleset c5 0rules was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the highest test set accuracy using raw data at 97 3 table s6 c5 0 rules generates a single set of if then rules using the c5 0 system kuhn et al 2020 the final ruleset had just five if then rules using just four features uva254 turbidity tryptophan like fluorescence and chlorophyll a text s1 hence toc ph temperature orp and conductivity could be dropped without any loss of accuracy none of the preprocessing methods improved the accuracy of this model mixture discriminant analysis mda was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the second highest test set accuracy using raw data 97 2 table s6 mda modifies traditional linear discriminant analysis by assuming that each class consists of a mixture of unobserved subclasses hastie and tibshirani 1996 each subclass is considered to have a normal distribution for each feature such that non normal distributions of the actual classes can be approximated as super imposed sums of normal distributions none of the preprocessing methods improved the accuracy of this model appendix a tryptophan like fluorescence was identified as the least important feature but omitting it caused less test set accuracy increasing subclasses from 4 to 6 increased the train set accuracy from 98 5 to 98 8 but decreased the test set accuracy from 97 2 to 80 8 indicating overfitting support vector machine with linear kernel svmlinear was selected for in depth evaluation because on the raw data it had 100 event sensitivity however it had 55 false positives and a test set accuracy of 92 below the nir table s6 svmlinear constructs a linear hyperplane between observations of different classes with maximum margin between the boundary and the nearest training set points c is the cost of points within the margin of the boundary diurnally adjustment of ph temperature and conductivity and including slopes increased the test set accuracy of this model to 94 5 above the nir but not statistically significantly appendix a chlorophyll a slope was the least important feature but omitting it decreased the test set accuracy setting c above 1 decreased both train and test set accuracy neural networks with feature extraction pcannet was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the second highest event sensitivity at 97 2 among models with a test set accuracy over 90 using the raw data table s6 pcannet runs pca on a dataset for feature extraction then classifies using a neural network diurnally adjusting ph and temperature increased this model s test set accuracy from 94 9 to 95 5 and including deltas improved it further to 96 1 appendix a chlorophyll a delta was identified as the least important feature but omitting it reduced the test set accuracy over the ranges size 1 to 9 and decay 1 to 10 5 size of 8 and decay of 0 01 had higher train set accuracy than the size of 5 and decay of 0 1 but the test set accuracy was lower indicating overfitting support vector machines with radial basis function kernel svmradial was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the fewest false positives just one and a test set accuracy of 95 3 using the raw data table s6 svmradial simulates a k nearest neighbor algorithm by using a kernel function that assigns a high value to points near other points within the same class and decays exponential with greater distance the tuning parameter sigma is the exponential rate of decay and c is the cost of points within the margin diurnally adjusting ph and orp improved the test set accuracy to 95 7 while maintaining a single false positive appendix a however neither deltas slopes nor pca improved the test set accuracy tryptophan like fluorescence was identified as the least important feature but omitting it decreased test set accuracy lowering sigma from 0 36 to 0 1 or increasing c from 1 to 3 5 improved the train set accuracy but lowered the test set accuracy indicating overfitting random forest rule based model rfrules was selected for further evaluation because using the raw data it had the second fewest false positives two table s6 it also tied for third highest test set accuracy 96 8 rfrules is a type of random forest which generates an ensemble of hundreds of decision trees each using random subsets of features breiman 2001 however this model was not robust and the high test set accuracy was due in part to random chance different seeds provided to the random number generator resulted in different selections of features for rules so more or less useful features for prediction on the test set were selected by random chance setting the seed to 1 through 30 resulted in test set accuracies ranging from 87 0 to 97 6 with a median of 96 using the raw data while this median test set accuracy exceeded the nir it was concluded that this model was too computationally expensive to justify further evaluation with replicate seeds the mean computation time was 7 min per tune per seed this computation time was orders of magnitude greater than the other models in table s6 and would not allow for computation time in under 15 min with 3 or more tune settings or iterations with different seeds thus this model was concluded to be too instable and slow and was not further evaluated an ensemble of the three optimized models with highest test set accuracy c5 0rules mda and kknn had a test set accuracy of 97 7 higher than any of the models independently table s6 this ensemble could be considered to balance between the more conservative kknn and the more sensitive mda with c5 0rules serving as a mediator considering that each of these single models had computations times below 4 s this ensemble would not be computationally burdensome even with large datasets code for the ensemble model is provided in the si text s2 in summary multiple models had statistically significant test set accuracy c5 0rules was the most accurate single model and an ensemble of c5 0rules mda and kknn was even more accurate for most models tested preprocessing such as pca or diurnal adjustment improved accuracy but the most effective preprocessing was model specific often the default tuning parameter settings in the caret package were already optimal and testing a wider range of values did not improve accuracy 3 3 results with two classes adaboost classification trees adaboost had the highest test set accuracy 99 2 with two classes after preprocessing and tuning parameter optimization adaboost is a binary classification model and thus was not available for classification among three classes c5 0rules which had the highest test set accuracy with three classes had the second highest test set accuracy with two classes 98 6 for comparison binary classification was also conducted using a fixed threshold based approach in which the threshold was set to the maximum normal value of each feature within the train set the highest test set accuracy for this approach was achieved using turbidity but this test set accuracy was only 96 not significantly different from the nir details on the classification among two classes are in the si text s3 text s4 table s7 table s8 3 4 results with five classes classifying the same dataset into a greater number of classes will generally result in equal or less accuracy due to the additional possible types of error i e in this context correctly identifying that a water quality event is occurring but misidentifying the type of event kknn performed similarly with five classes as with three except for the addition of incorrect event type errors for example with pca preprocessing and the ninth pc omitted kknn had eight maintenance related errors six false positives and nine false negatives when classifying among three or five classes appendix a however the overall test accuracy was reduced from 97 1 to 96 8 due to two incorrect event type errors however among the three models tested on five classes kknn was the only one with a significant test set accuracy p value 0 001 with pca preprocessing and the ninth pc omitted with five classes instead of three c5 0rules had greater false positive rates and mda had numerous maintenance related errors regardless of the preprocessing applied appendix a considering train set sample size was only 12 within each blending event type perhaps greater sample size would have increased accuracy for five classes 4 discussion testing set accuracy was used as the main metric of success in this study but it has limitations for unbalanced data e g data with many more of one class than the other s such as used here models could achieve over 94 accuracy by always assuming datapoints were normal or over 88 accuracy by randomly guessing classes based solely on their proportion in the training set furthermore using only testing set accuracy the success of models cannot be directly compared across studies since the accuracy would depend in part on the proportion of classes in the respective datasets one alternative metric is balanced accuracy or what the accuracy would be if there were equal proportions of each class in the dataset balanced accuracy is more intercomparable across studies and cannot be increased by increasing the proportion of a specific class balanced accuracies for the optimized versions of the models selected for in depth evaluation are shown in table 2 loclda had the highest balanced accuracy 81 3 driven by its tied for highest event sensitivity of 97 2 and tied for highest maintenance sensitivity at 50 another alternative to accuracy is cohen s kappa cohen s kappa compares the agreement between the true classifications and the model classifications to the agreement that could occur due to random allocation cohen 1960 the formula for cohen s kappa with three or more classes is chicco et al 2021 1 k c s k k p k t k s 2 k k p k t k where c is the total number of observations correctly predicted s is the total number of observations pk is the number of times class k was predicted and tk is the number of times class k truly occurs the ensemble had the highest cohen s kappa at 0 783 and mda also had a cohen s kappa over 0 75 which would be considered substantial or excellent fleiss 1981 landis and koch 1977 a limitation for both balanced accuracy and cohen s kappa is that these metrics do not consider the relative importance of error types in this study s context maintenance related errors could be considered relatively unimportant for example an operator would be aware whether he or she was currently conducting maintenance and could discount or disarm an alert during that time if a maintenance event were incorrectly predicted as normal this too would be relatively inconsequential nevertheless the balanced accuracy and cohen s kappa of the models were limited since no model achieved maintenance sensitivity above 50 this limited sensitivity for maintenance could be explained by limited sample size for maintenance in the training set one instance totaling just nine datapoints further research and model training with greater maintenance sample size might improve maintenance accuracy and thus the balanced accuracy and cohen s kappa of these models omitting maintenance from the dataset mda svmradial and adaboost all had balanced accuracy of at least 97 table s8 adaboost would have a cohen s kappa of 0 915 which would be considered excellent or almost perfect fleiss 1981 landis and koch 1977 for events false positives could be considered more important than false negatives a false positive could lead to complacency or unnecessary emergency protocols in contrast the low stormwater and dfr blending ratios used in this study would not exceed the treatment capabilities of the utility at which this study was conducted it would be beneficial for a model to detect these low levels since they may portend more severe contamination nevertheless a utility may prefer a model with lower sensitivity but greater specificity i e fewer false positives assigning a weight of one to maintenance related errors two for false negatives and four for false positives the best single model for three classes would be c5 0rules and the three way ensemble would be better still appendix a this is the same recommendation that would be made based on the unweighted test set accuracy errors may also be unequally important in timeseries data depending on their location in time many of the false positives in the models tested were lag errors i e occurring immediately after a blending event or maintenance before instruments had fully returned to baseline in practice these errors would be unimportant since operators would already be responding to a correct alert during that time furthermore true positives that occur sooner would be beneficial since they would allow prompter investigation with three classes the ensemble detected all three water types on the first timepoint i e in 15 min and at the lowest blending ratio tested fig 4 of its six false positives five were lag errors occurring consecutively after maintenance or blending events thus in practice this ensemble would have had virtually perfect event sensitivity and just one false alert in a week this false alert corresponded to an increase in uva254 and turbidity that may have been caused by a brief flow interruption with two classes adaboost detected all three blending events on the first timepoint and all four false positives were lag errors fig s4 thus adaboost was virtually perfect on this dataset if binary classification is satisfactory for all models optimized for three classes uva254 and turbidity were the first and second most important features respectively table s9 toc was the third most important feature for all models except c5 0rules the high relative importance of both uva254 and toc is somewhat surprising considering these features are highly correlated r2 0 91 in train set with toc in fact calculated from uva254 as well as uv absorbance at 260 and 280 nm this indicates the value of monitoring multiple uv wavelengths for most models omitting even the least important feature reduced test set accuracy so all water quality parameters measured in the study could be considered useful nevertheless tryptophan like fluorescence had the worst mean rank importance overall this study served as a successful proof of concept that sml could be applied for alert systems in drinking water intakes despite the high variability in data from this context however further research with greater sample size would be required to confirm whether sml can not only detect but also distinguish among adverse water quality events furthermore much research remains to be done in terms of which instruments are most useful for detecting which water quality event types both individually and as components of multivariate algorithms regression modeling was beyond the scope of this manuscript however supervised machine learning can also be applied for regression and this would be a logical next step for further research sml classification could be applied to alert systems that would instigate investigation or corrective action by human operators sml regression could be applied to estimate the percentage of dfr as opposed to just presence or absence this could in turn be used to calculate pathogen concentrations or recommend changes in water treatment operation to counteract the expected increase in pathogens 5 conclusions multiple models kknn c5 0rules mda could predict whether test set observations were normal event or maintenance with over 97 accuracy p value 0 0001 relative to the nir the lowest blending ratios tested 2 tertiary wastewater effluent 0 5 dry weather lvw and 0 02 stormwater impacted lvw were all detectable by sml models an ensemble of the three most accurate models had a test set accuracy of 97 7 higher than any of the models independently it detected all event types in 15 min and had only one false positive that was not a lag error multiple models loclda c5 0rules adaboost and mda could predict whether test set observations were either normal or event with maintenance omitted with over 98 accuracy p value 0 0001 relative to the nir adaboost had the highest test set accuracy at 99 2 detected all blending events on the first timepoint and had zero false positives that were not lag errors preprocessing methods to correct for diurnal patterns or instrument drift generally could improve model accuracy but the optimal approach was model specific uva254 and turbidity were the most important water quality parameters for all models tested for most models tested omitting the least important feature reduced test set accuracy indicating that all the instruments and water quality parameters used in this study can be useful for stormwater or dfr detection some aspects of the results presented herein may be specific to the instrumentation water quality context and dataset studied e g the trained sml models would be specific to this set of instrumentation and lake mead s

16640,water quality events such as increases in stormwater or wastewater effluent in drinking water sources pose hazards to drinking water consumers stormwater and wastewater effluent enter lake mead an important drinking water source in the southwest usa via the las vegas wash previous studies have applied machine learning and online instruments to detect contamination in water distribution systems however alert systems at drinking water intakes would provide more time for corrective action an array of online instruments measuring ph conductivity redox potential turbidity temperature tryptophan like fluorescence uv absorbance uva254 toc and chlorophyll a was fed raw water directly from lake mead wastewater effluent dry weather las vegas wash and storm impacted las vegas wash samples were blended into the instrument inlets at known ratios to simulate three types of adverse water quality events data preprocessing was conducted to correct for diurnal patterns or instrument drift supervised machine learning was conducted using previously published models in r ninety nine models were screened on the raw data eight high performing models were evaluated in depth and optimized weighted k nearest neighbors single c5 0 ruleset mixture discriminant analysis and an ensemble of these three models had accuracy over 97 when assigning test set data among three classes normal event or maintenance the ensemble detected all event types at the earliest timepoint and had one false positive that was not a lag error i e consecutively following a true positive omitting maintenance the adaboost model had over 99 test set accuracy and zero false positives that were not lag errors data preprocessing was beneficial but the optimal methods were model specific all nine water quality variables were useful for most models but uva254 and turbidity were most important graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords principle component analysis support vector machine de facto reuse big data artificial intelligence fault diagnosis 1 introduction water quality events such as stormwater surges or fluctuations in de facto wastewater reuse dfr could cause hazards for water consumers for example stormwater surges caused turbidity to rise beyond the treatment capacity of a drinking water facility leading to a boil notice in laughlin nevada brean and taloma 2015 the percentage of dfr may change depending on flowrates in a river rice and westerhoff 2014 furthermore dfr at drinking water intakes in reservoirs can vary by greater than a factor of five depending on mixing conditions e g wind and thermal stratification pecson et al 2018 stormwater influx especially urban runoff may increase contaminants such as turbidity total organic carbon toc e coli metals disinfection byproduct precursors and aromatic hydrocarbons hill et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 whereas increased dfr may elevate contaminants including endocrine disrupting compounds and disinfection byproduct precursors snyder et al 1999 weisman et al 2019 the hazards from stormwater and dfr to drinking water consumers are expected to increase with time due to climate change for example the average percentage of dfr in the western usa is expected to increase over time as climate change related drought reduces stream flows in the region rice and westerhoff 2014 climate change is predicted to exacerbate weather extremes which could increase the severity or frequency of storm events that disrupt water treatment qiu et al 2019 events like stormwater or dfr fluctuations must be detected and acted upon rapidly such as by adjusting treatment or switching drinking water sources conducting grab samples and benchtop analyses with sufficient breadth and frequency for rapid 24 h detection of problematic water quality changes would require economically infeasible amounts of laboratory staff labor therefore online instruments are needed for rapid detection of hazardous changes in water quality numerous types of online instrumentation are now commercially available for the water industry optical sensors e g uv absorbance or fluorescence are especially promising due to their low cost low maintenance and high measurement frequency many studies have found correlations between specific fluorescence wavelength pairs and certain types of contamination for example the presence of wastewater effluent has been associated with tryptophan like fluorescence 280 nm excitation and 350 nm emission baker 2001 however methods are needed to process the data from these online instruments and generate alerts for utilities with minimal false positives supervised machine learning sml has been proposed for alerts in drinking water systems sml algorithms build a model using a labeled dataset i e a table of timeseries water quality data with a column stating normal or event and then use this model to make predictions about new data sml has many advantages relative to fixed thresholds firstly many sml models can categorize data into three or more categories rather than merely above or below the threshold this could allow sml to predict not only whether something unusual is occurring but also what type of event secondly sml models are multivariate and thus can distinguish whether the data as a whole is abnormal even if each water quality variable individually is within acceptable ranges furthermore machine learning can be adaptive i e continually updated with new training data such that its accuracy would improve over time finally sml can be nonlinear consider for example an alert system with two variables using fixed thresholds anything inside of a pre determined square on a coordinate plane would be considered normal and anything outside of that square would trigger an alert however using a sml model such as k nearest neighbors knn the region s enclosing the normal data could take on limitless possible shapes furthermore ensembles can take the consensus of multiple types of sml models sml has previously been applied for event detection in drinking water however most previous studies focused on treated water in distribution systems arad et al 2013 asheri arnon et al 2018 hou et al 2015 huang et al 2017 saetta et al 2021 a machine learning based alert system for online instruments in the drinking water intake could be more challenging 1 because there could be greater fouling or instrument drift on the sensors since the water would have more organic matter and 2 there could be wider baseline variability under normal conditions due to diurnal patterns sub hazardous precipitation etc however an alert system at the intake would provide greater safety because it would allow an opportunity for preventative action at the drinking water treatment plant dwtp before water reaches consumers furthermore nonhazardous water quality changes in the distribution system would likely be caused by operational changes e g pumps turning on which could be corrected by including operational data in the model in contrast nonhazardous water quality changes would more likely be due to natural cycles which would be uncontrolled but potentially modelable thus the most appropriate data preprocessing techniques and sml models may differ between raw and treated water contexts in this study multiple data preprocessing techniques and sml models were tested to generate alerts using data from a series of online instruments testing raw surface water from lake mead the surface water was actively pumped from the lake such that real seasonal or diurnal patterns or other variability would be reflected in the water quality data stormwater and wastewater effluent samples were injected at various blending ratios into the pipeline feeding the instruments nine water quality variables ph conductivity redox potential orp temperature turbidity tryptophan like fluorescence toc uv absorbance at 254 nm uva254 and chlorophyll a were recorded at 15 min intervals over the course of 16 days the data was labelled into two three or five categories and split approximately 50 50 into train and test sets sml was conducted in r using the caret package kuhn 2008 ninety nine classification models i e models that predict in which categorical group a datapoint belongs and one ensemble were evaluated tuning parameters were adjusted and optimized within relatively accurate models models and the ensemble were compared based on accuracy sensitivity and specificity 2 methods 2 1 regional context the southern nevada water authority snwa is the drinking water wholesaler for the las vegas nevada metropolitan area with a population over 2 million people and average annual precipitation less than 11 cm las vegas is the most arid major city in the usa snwa gets approximately 10 of its water from groundwater and 90 from lake mead fig 1 lake mead is the largest reservoir in the united states with a maximum volume of 36 km3 holdren and turner 2010 it is the oldest reservoir in the colorado river system which provides drinking water to approximately 40 million people and supports approximately 16 million jobs and over one trillion usd year of economic activity milly and dunne 2020 unfortunately lake mead has not been near full capacity since 2000 and has since dropped by 40 m to 40 capacity usbor 2021 approximately 97 of the water in lake mead comes from the colorado river and this portion of the inflow is relatively pristine blunt et al 2018 however the colorado river s flow is historically overallocated and expected to decline over time due to climate change castle et al 2014 milly and dunne 2020 approximately 2 of the flow to lake mead comes from the las vegas wash lvw holdren and turner 2010 the lvw flow has more than doubled since the 1980 s due to the growing population of las vegas and it is around 85 wastewater effluent benotti et al 2010 holdren and turner 2010 the remainder is primarily resurfacing groundwater with naturally high levels of selenium ryan and zhou 2010 and dry weather urban runoff the lvw has poly and per flouroalkyl substance concentrations above the drinking water standards of multiple us states post 2020 quiñones and snyder 2009 the lvw is also a source of n nitrosodimethylamine precursors pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds to lake mead benotti et al 2010 woods and dickenson 2016 the wastewater effluent from the lvw was suspected to have contributed to a cryptosporidium outbreak in the 1990 s goldstein et al 1996 in response snwa installed an ozonation system to enhance cryptosporidium disinfection well beyond regulatory requirements urban stormwater from las vegas also enters lake mead via the lvw holdren and turner 2010 this urban stormwater is relatively contaminated i e high dissolved and suspended solids compared to other urban stormwater in the usa due to the high number of antecedent dry days between precipitation events zeng et al 2016 considering the inflows to lake mead are around 2 from the lvw and the lvw is approximately 85 wastewater effluent one might expect the dfr at snwa s drinking water intake would be 1 7 however based on a hydrodynamic model and the wastewater indicator sucralose the current average dfr is somewhat lower around 1 4 hannoun et al 2021 mawhinney et al 2011 this is because the lvw water is saltier but warmer than lake mead so it tends to pass through as a plume at a depth at which its density matches the density of the surrounding water labounty and horn 1997 this plume has higher concentrations of wastewater derived chemicals than the surrounding water snyder and benotti 2010 in 2015 snwa completed a new drinking water intake at a deeper elevation in lake mead for long term water supply resilience hannoun et al 2021 an additional benefit of this project was increasing the vertical distance between the intake and the typical depth of the plume by over 40 m nevertheless ongoing climate change drought and urbanization are expected to increase the probability and severity of events in which the effective blending ratio of lvw water could suddenly increase at the intake 2 2 online instruments a pvc pipe conveyed 1 l min of water from lake mead to three online instruments measuring nine water quality parameters turbidity conductivity ph orp temperature uva254 toc chlorophyll a and tryptophan like fluorescence the instruments were maintained weekly and calibrated monthly data was gathered for more than a year prior to the blending tests section 2 3 to establish baseline water quality and so the accuracy of the online instruments could be compared against benchtop data a bluei 702 turbiplus hydroguard monitored turbidity conductivity ph temperature and orp a realtech pl3500 monitored absorption over the wavelength range 200 to 800 nm at approximately 3 nm intervals using two lamps tungsten and deuterium it then output uva254 and site specific absorbance based estimates of toc and chlorophyll a chlorophyll a like absorbance is considered an algal indicator choo et al 2018 uva254 has many useful correlations in the drinking water field for example uva254 correlated with e coli in spring water after surface runoff events stadler et al 2008 the pl3500 and the hydroguard were both scada compatible and their water quality parameters were recorded at 15 min intervals an sts smf4 fluorimeter measured tryptophan like fluorescence around 280 nm excitation and 350 nm emission baker et al 2004 tryptophan like fluorescence has also been shown to be a quantitative fingerprint of dfr baker 2001 baker et al 2004 found a strong correlation between tryptophan like fluorescence as measured by a benchtop fluorometer and a portable smf2 an earlier model of the instrument used here this smf4 fluorimeter was primarily designed as a portable instrument for field sampling but was adapted for online monitoring using a quartz flowcell this instrument was not scada compatible so while it recorded data every 15 min these 15 min intervals did not necessarily align with the 15 min intervals of the other two instruments thus the tryptophan like fluorescence data was linearly interpolated onto the time vector of the other two instruments 2 3 blending events using a masterflex peristaltic pump relatively contaminated water was injected from a magnetically stirred 18 l carboy into the pvc pipe upstream of the instruments fig 2 the pump was calibrated prior to the first experiment and the injected flow was further verified by recording the change in volume in the carboy at 15 min intervals the flow in the pipe was measured with a 200 3000 ml min brooks instrument rotameter a koflo static inline mixer ensured the injected water was well mixed with the raw lake mead water prior to reaching the instruments blending events were conducted representing three lvw related scenarios lvw water during dry weather tertiary effluent from a large wastewater treatment plant wwtp that discharges into the lvw and lvw water approximately 12 h after a rain event samples were collected from the locations shown in fig 1 in 5 gallon 19 l plastic buckets stored at 4 c and used within 14 days the dry weather lvw scenario simulated elevated dfr due to changing mixing conditions increasing lvw water at the drinking water intake the wastewater effluent simulated a more general broadly applicable dfr scenario the stormwater impacted lvw simulated an urban runoff surge scenario this scenario would be relatively unlikely for snwa s current drinking water intake at the current lake mead water level but would be of interest to other utilities or the lake mead water level drops to a concerning level the dry weather lvw sample was compared against archived data in the lower colorado river water quality database for the same reach of the stream to confirm that the measured parameters were typical of this body of water i e within a 95 confidence interval of the historical mean the wwtp treats approximately 380 000 m3 day of municipal wastewater with a modified johannesburg process no mixed liquor return for biological phosphorus removal followed by alum coagulation and dual media filtration gerrity et al 2011 pruisner 2016 the waters used for blending were interrelated in that the dry weather lvw sample consisted of approximately 85 wastewater effluent from the same metro area as the wastewater effluent sample including around 40 from the exact same wwtp the stormwater impacted lvw sample consisted of approximately 50 urban runoff and 50 similar water as the dry weather lvw sample fig s1 each water type was injected into the pipe at three blending ratios for one hour each consecutively and in order from lowest to highest blending there was one exception to this protocol a 45 min gap between the middle and highest blending ratios for wastewater effluent there was at least one hour between the third highest blending ratio of the previous water type and the first lowest blending ratio of the subsequent water type this time between blending events of different water types was intended to allow contaminants to wash out of the system and for water quality to return to baseline the middle blending ratios were selected such that the expected water quality would be approximately two median absolute deviations mads above the median for at least one parameter tables s1 s3 this was calculated based on an analysis of the past year of online water quality data and benchtop measurements of the water samples conducted immediately prior to the first blending events the blending ratios were 2 5 and 10 for tertiary wastewater effluent 0 02 0 05 and 0 10 for stormwater impacted lvw and 0 5 2 5 and 5 for dry weather lvw one blending event with each water type was conducted during an 8 day period and the procedure was then replicated during the following eight days table s4 thus there were 12 true positives i e four 15 min samples over one hour for each blending ratio times three blending ratios for each of the three event types in each dataset the raw data from these blending events is publicly available for download via github https github com kathom198 star lab blob master phase1 data xlsx 2 4 benchtop analyses ph was measured with a fisher scientific accumet ap110 portable ph meter conductivity was measured with a hach sension378 turbidity was measured with a hach 2100an turbidimeter uva254 was measured with a hach dr 6000 contrary to conventional procedure samples were not filtered prior to uva254 analysis because this gave a better indication of the expected change on the real tech pl3500 which did not have a pre filter toc was measured with a shimadzu toc l toc analyzer 2 5 machine learning observations in the dataset were first labelled as one of three event types or classes normal maintenance or event maintenance refers to timepoints at which human operators conducted routine cleaning or preventative maintenance on the instruments and recorded these activities in a logbook event refers to times when any of the three blending ratios of any of the three water types were occurring sml was conducted with r version 3 4 3 in the rstudio interface version 1 0 136 using the caret package kuhn 2008 2020 the caret package contains a set of programming functions that streamline the process of generating predictive models it allows a library of over 200 types of sml models to be trained and tested using uniform syntax classification models i e those predicting whether an observation belongs within a limited set of numerical or qualitative values such as normal or event were applied rather than regression models i e those predicting non discrete quantitative outputs such as percentage dfr the dataset was split approximately 50 50 into train and test with one example of each type of blending event section 2 3 in the train and test sets the split was chronological not randomized to simulate real world model training and implementation and to enable time series based data preprocessing techniques section 2 6 classification models available within caret were first trained on the train set n 776 the trained model then generated predictions for the test set n 785 these predictions were then compared to the true labels ninety nine classification models designed for datasets with more than two classes were initially screened on raw data for all nine variables with their default tuning parameters i e hyperparameters in caret the computation time train set accuracy test set accuracy p value i e probability that the true accuracy is below the no information rate nir event sensitivity and number of false positives were recorded in appendix a nir is the accuracy when predicting that all datapoints belong to the most common class in the train set the nir was 94 1 for three classes or 95 4 omitting maintenance datapoints the p value that the test set accuracy was above the nir was calculated using the binomial confidence interval method kuhn 2008 clopper and pearson 1934 the train set accuracy was internally cross validated with 25 bootstraps i e 25 random samples with replacement of equal length as the train set were generated and split 75 25 into train and test sets the average accuracy on these random test sets selected from within the train set was considered the train set accuracy this bootstrapped train set accuracy was used for selecting tuning parameters false positives were defined as normal observations incorrectly identified as an event since maintenance related errors could be considered relatively unimportant computation times were for a desktop personal computer with intel core i7 7700t cpu 2 90 ghz up to 15 min per tuning parameter setting was considered acceptable the seed was set to 1 before each training to reset the random number generator and ensure reproducibility test set accuracy was used as the main performance metric in this study however it was hypothesized that models with relatively high train set accuracy but low test set accuracy i e relatively overfit might perform better after tuning parameter optimization also it was hypothesized that models with relatively high sensitivity but high false positive rate or vice versa might perform well by both metrics and thus also higher overall accuracy after data preprocessing thus models were selected for further evaluation if they were ranked first or second for any of the following criteria bootstrapped train set accuracy test set accuracy event sensitivity excluding models with less than 90 test set accuracy or fewest false positives excluding models with less than 90 test set accuracy or that predicted all observations to be normal these select models were then tested with various data preprocessing methods section 2 5 the preprocessing method that resulted in highest test set accuracy was selected next each model with its optimal preprocessing was evaluated with a range of tuning parameters they were also iteratively tested with the least important feature omitted to determine whether equal accuracy could be achieved with less computation time the least important feature was determined using the varimp function alongside the screened but not selected models the performance metrics of the versions of the selected models with sub optimal preprocessing feature selection or tuning can be found in appendix a three models were selected for inclusion in an ensemble based on having the highest test set accuracy the ensemble made the same prediction as the majority of its component models e g if two models predicted normal but the third model predicted event the ensemble predicted normal in the case of a three way split decision the ensemble selected the prediction of the model with highest test set accuracy describing the theory and methodologies of the 90 models screened but not selected for in depth evaluation would cause this article to exceed the length requirements of this journal however the r packages of all models tested are listed online by kuhn 2019 the documentation for these packages is available in the cran package repository r 2021 this documentation usually contains peer reviewed citations 2 6 data preprocessing data preprocessing techniques were applied to correct for diurnal patterns or instrument drift since the water was pumped from lake mead to the instruments in real time any natural cycles in the reservoir e g rising and falling temperatures during day and night would be reflected in the data such diurnal patterns would increase the variability of the data making small changes from other causes less likely to be detected for example an increase in temperature due to an increase in warmer wastewater effluent might be undetected if it occurred in the early morning when water is coolest furthermore online water quality sensors such as fluorimeters are known to drift i e have a gradual increase in bias or error in a particular direction over time between cleanings when placed in natural waters sorensen et al 2018 the first approach was to calculate the difference relative to the mean of the previous four datapoints i e previous hour these differences are herein referred to as deltas huang et al 2017 applied a similar approach for an event detection study with treated water another technique was to calculate the slope of the linear regression of the variable over time for the previous hour these coefficients are herein referred to as slopes the deltas and slopes were calculated for all variables deltas and slopes were provided as features i e independent variables to the models in addition to the raw data another technique was to model the diurnal pattern as a sine function with a period of 24 h fig s2 the models were fit to the train set data using the nls function in r which uses the gauss newton algorithm to determine non linear least squares estimates the gauss newton algorithm is a method for finding minima of sums of squared values such as sums of squared errors qin et al 2018 the predictions of the sine model were then calculated for both the train and test sets the residuals of these models are the difference between each measured datapoint and the expected value for that time of day this procedure could be considered a form of state estimation as discussed by mckenna et al 2007 and it was conducted on features with visibly apparent diurnal patterns in the train set the residuals of these sine models were used in lieu of the raw data for the corresponding features and are referred to herein as diurnally adjusted this procedure reduced the baseline variability of these features table s5 the amplitudes of the sine models were statistically significant p value 0 05 though less than 3 relative to the respective train set means fig s2 little diurnal variation would be expected in a hypolimnetic system at the current intake depth to the extent that the temperature variation observed may have originated in the pipeline rather than in lake mead nevertheless it was hypothesized that correcting for these small variations could increase the sensitivity of the sml models for atypical water quality events in sml additional features provide greater increases in accuracy when they are not correlated with the features already in the model irizarry 2019 thus another form of preprocessing employed was principle component analysis pca with normalization using the prcomp function in r pca transforms a set of observations of variables into a set of values of uncorrelated principle components pcs thus in theory each pc should provide new information to the sml algorithm the number of pcs is equal to the original number of features furthermore the pcs are ordered such that the first has the largest possible variance and the second accounts for as much as possible of the remaining variability and so on thus pca can be used for dimensionality reduction i e reducing the number of independent variables to accelerate subsequent calculations by omitting latter pcs the component scores of the testing set were calculated based on the variable loadings of the train set pcs replaced the raw data as features in the models 2 7 classification among other numbers of classes classification among three classes event normal maintenance was the focus of this manuscript however in practice utilities may choose to omit rather than label and predict observations during maintenance periods thus 43 classification models that can only predict two classes as well as the select models mentioned above were re screened as described above but with maintenance data omitted of these eight models were selected for evaluation with preprocessing feature omission and parameter tuning based on the same criteria as for models predicting three classes provided sufficient sample size it would be ideal if a machine learning based alert system could indicate not only whether an event is occurring but also what type of event is occurring for example increases in dfr or stormwater surges might merit different responses thus the eight models selected for in depth evaluation based on their performance with three classes were also trained and tested with five classes normal maintenance wastewater effluent dry weather las vegas wash and stormwater impacted las vegas wash 3 results 3 1 water quality data median water quality of the waters used in the blending experiments is shown in table 1 the data for the baseline raw surface water was typical of this drinking water intake in lake mead all three water types injected into the instruments had lower ph but higher conductivity turbidity tryptophan like fluorescence toc and uva254 compared to lake mead the stormwater impacted lvw sample had particularly elevated turbidity ph temperature conductivity and orp had visually apparent diurnal patterns and so were selected for diurnal adjustment preprocessing fig 3 during blending events water quality generally changed as expected based on the blending ratio and characteristics of the separate waters table 1 one exception was conductivity decline by 2 during the stormwater impacted lvw blending events because conductivity was on the downward slope of its diurnal pattern at the time tryptophan like fluorescence had upward drift between maintenance events due to fouling in the flowcell this drift was more pronounced during the test set fig 4 possibly due to lower flow during this period temperature increased during blending events because the lake mead water was around 16 c and the blended waters were approximately room temperature figs 3 and 4 it is realistic that temperature would increase during full scale events since the lvw is warmer than lake mead labounty and horn 1997 3 2 results with three classes ninety nine models listed in appendix a were screened for their ability to classify data into three classes normal event or maintenance using their default tuning parameters in the r caret package and raw data for nine water quality parameters ph conductivity orp temperature turbidity tryptophan like fluorescence uva254 toc and chlorophyll a models were selected for in depth evaluation based on ranking within the top two for any of the following four criteria train set accuracy test set accuracy event sensitivity or fewest false positives the in depth evaluation included testing preprocessing techniques section 2 6 optimizing tuning parameters and omitting least important features to potentially increase calculation time without reducing accuracy the conditions and accuracies of the optimized models are shown in table 2 weighted k nearest neighbors kknn was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the highest train set accuracy with raw data at 98 9 table s6 kknn assigns an observation to a class based on the plurality of k nearest observations in the train set schliep et al 2016 nearness is according to minkowski distance and neighbors can be weighted based on various methods kknn has three tuning parameters kmax is the maximum number of neighbors distance is the order of minkowski distance and kernel is the formula for weighting the neighbors diurnally adjustment only resulted in increased test set accuracy for temperature appendix a adding slope features resulted in a slightly greater improvement of test set accuracy than deltas the highest test accuracy after preprocessing was 97 1 with pca and the ninth pc omitted table 2 this test set accuracy was significantly above the nir of 94 1 over the range of kmax 2 to 9 distance 1 to 3 and the 11 available weighting kernels the highest train set accuracy was achieved with kmax of 2 distance of 2 and the rectangular kernel i e equal weights however the test set accuracy was 95 8 lower than with the default tuning parameters this result indicates that despite boostrap cross validation the model was overfit k nearest neighbor models with k less than 5 are generally considered at risk of overfitting irizarry 2019 localized linear discriminant analysis loclda was selected for in depth evaluation because it tied for second highest train set accuracy with raw data at 98 6 table s6 loclda generates linear discriminant analysis classification rules for each observation considering only the k nearest neighbors within the train set roever et al 2018 diurnal adjustment of both temperature and conductivity resulted in higher test set accuracy appendix a diurnally adjusted conductivity was identified as the least important feature but omitting it reduced test set accuracy using deltas slopes or pca decreased event sensitivity the optimal k was 170 approximately 20 of the train set the highest test set accuracy after optimizing the preprocessing methods and k was 96 2 table 2 among the optimized models loclda tied for highest event sensitivity and detected all three event types on the first time point table 3 shows the time until first detection for each of the selected models calculated as the number of consecutive false negatives at the start of the event multiplied by 15 min however loclda also had 15 false positives which could be considered unacceptable least squares support vector machine with radial basis function kernel lssvmradial was also selected for in depth evaluation because it tied for second highest train set accuracy with raw data at 98 6 table s6 least square support vector machines have been described by suykens and vandewalle 1999 sigma is the inverse kernel width and tau is the regularization parameter diurnal adjustments did not improve the accuracy of this model appendix a deltas slopes and pca all increased test set accuracy to approximately 96 omitting the chlorophyll a slope resulted in two fewer false positives omitting the conductivity slope resulted equal accuracy and slightly faster computation time reducing tau and sigma resulted in a higher train set accuracy but higher test set false positives indicating overfitting single c5 0 ruleset c5 0rules was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the highest test set accuracy using raw data at 97 3 table s6 c5 0 rules generates a single set of if then rules using the c5 0 system kuhn et al 2020 the final ruleset had just five if then rules using just four features uva254 turbidity tryptophan like fluorescence and chlorophyll a text s1 hence toc ph temperature orp and conductivity could be dropped without any loss of accuracy none of the preprocessing methods improved the accuracy of this model mixture discriminant analysis mda was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the second highest test set accuracy using raw data 97 2 table s6 mda modifies traditional linear discriminant analysis by assuming that each class consists of a mixture of unobserved subclasses hastie and tibshirani 1996 each subclass is considered to have a normal distribution for each feature such that non normal distributions of the actual classes can be approximated as super imposed sums of normal distributions none of the preprocessing methods improved the accuracy of this model appendix a tryptophan like fluorescence was identified as the least important feature but omitting it caused less test set accuracy increasing subclasses from 4 to 6 increased the train set accuracy from 98 5 to 98 8 but decreased the test set accuracy from 97 2 to 80 8 indicating overfitting support vector machine with linear kernel svmlinear was selected for in depth evaluation because on the raw data it had 100 event sensitivity however it had 55 false positives and a test set accuracy of 92 below the nir table s6 svmlinear constructs a linear hyperplane between observations of different classes with maximum margin between the boundary and the nearest training set points c is the cost of points within the margin of the boundary diurnally adjustment of ph temperature and conductivity and including slopes increased the test set accuracy of this model to 94 5 above the nir but not statistically significantly appendix a chlorophyll a slope was the least important feature but omitting it decreased the test set accuracy setting c above 1 decreased both train and test set accuracy neural networks with feature extraction pcannet was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the second highest event sensitivity at 97 2 among models with a test set accuracy over 90 using the raw data table s6 pcannet runs pca on a dataset for feature extraction then classifies using a neural network diurnally adjusting ph and temperature increased this model s test set accuracy from 94 9 to 95 5 and including deltas improved it further to 96 1 appendix a chlorophyll a delta was identified as the least important feature but omitting it reduced the test set accuracy over the ranges size 1 to 9 and decay 1 to 10 5 size of 8 and decay of 0 01 had higher train set accuracy than the size of 5 and decay of 0 1 but the test set accuracy was lower indicating overfitting support vector machines with radial basis function kernel svmradial was selected for in depth evaluation because it had the fewest false positives just one and a test set accuracy of 95 3 using the raw data table s6 svmradial simulates a k nearest neighbor algorithm by using a kernel function that assigns a high value to points near other points within the same class and decays exponential with greater distance the tuning parameter sigma is the exponential rate of decay and c is the cost of points within the margin diurnally adjusting ph and orp improved the test set accuracy to 95 7 while maintaining a single false positive appendix a however neither deltas slopes nor pca improved the test set accuracy tryptophan like fluorescence was identified as the least important feature but omitting it decreased test set accuracy lowering sigma from 0 36 to 0 1 or increasing c from 1 to 3 5 improved the train set accuracy but lowered the test set accuracy indicating overfitting random forest rule based model rfrules was selected for further evaluation because using the raw data it had the second fewest false positives two table s6 it also tied for third highest test set accuracy 96 8 rfrules is a type of random forest which generates an ensemble of hundreds of decision trees each using random subsets of features breiman 2001 however this model was not robust and the high test set accuracy was due in part to random chance different seeds provided to the random number generator resulted in different selections of features for rules so more or less useful features for prediction on the test set were selected by random chance setting the seed to 1 through 30 resulted in test set accuracies ranging from 87 0 to 97 6 with a median of 96 using the raw data while this median test set accuracy exceeded the nir it was concluded that this model was too computationally expensive to justify further evaluation with replicate seeds the mean computation time was 7 min per tune per seed this computation time was orders of magnitude greater than the other models in table s6 and would not allow for computation time in under 15 min with 3 or more tune settings or iterations with different seeds thus this model was concluded to be too instable and slow and was not further evaluated an ensemble of the three optimized models with highest test set accuracy c5 0rules mda and kknn had a test set accuracy of 97 7 higher than any of the models independently table s6 this ensemble could be considered to balance between the more conservative kknn and the more sensitive mda with c5 0rules serving as a mediator considering that each of these single models had computations times below 4 s this ensemble would not be computationally burdensome even with large datasets code for the ensemble model is provided in the si text s2 in summary multiple models had statistically significant test set accuracy c5 0rules was the most accurate single model and an ensemble of c5 0rules mda and kknn was even more accurate for most models tested preprocessing such as pca or diurnal adjustment improved accuracy but the most effective preprocessing was model specific often the default tuning parameter settings in the caret package were already optimal and testing a wider range of values did not improve accuracy 3 3 results with two classes adaboost classification trees adaboost had the highest test set accuracy 99 2 with two classes after preprocessing and tuning parameter optimization adaboost is a binary classification model and thus was not available for classification among three classes c5 0rules which had the highest test set accuracy with three classes had the second highest test set accuracy with two classes 98 6 for comparison binary classification was also conducted using a fixed threshold based approach in which the threshold was set to the maximum normal value of each feature within the train set the highest test set accuracy for this approach was achieved using turbidity but this test set accuracy was only 96 not significantly different from the nir details on the classification among two classes are in the si text s3 text s4 table s7 table s8 3 4 results with five classes classifying the same dataset into a greater number of classes will generally result in equal or less accuracy due to the additional possible types of error i e in this context correctly identifying that a water quality event is occurring but misidentifying the type of event kknn performed similarly with five classes as with three except for the addition of incorrect event type errors for example with pca preprocessing and the ninth pc omitted kknn had eight maintenance related errors six false positives and nine false negatives when classifying among three or five classes appendix a however the overall test accuracy was reduced from 97 1 to 96 8 due to two incorrect event type errors however among the three models tested on five classes kknn was the only one with a significant test set accuracy p value 0 001 with pca preprocessing and the ninth pc omitted with five classes instead of three c5 0rules had greater false positive rates and mda had numerous maintenance related errors regardless of the preprocessing applied appendix a considering train set sample size was only 12 within each blending event type perhaps greater sample size would have increased accuracy for five classes 4 discussion testing set accuracy was used as the main metric of success in this study but it has limitations for unbalanced data e g data with many more of one class than the other s such as used here models could achieve over 94 accuracy by always assuming datapoints were normal or over 88 accuracy by randomly guessing classes based solely on their proportion in the training set furthermore using only testing set accuracy the success of models cannot be directly compared across studies since the accuracy would depend in part on the proportion of classes in the respective datasets one alternative metric is balanced accuracy or what the accuracy would be if there were equal proportions of each class in the dataset balanced accuracy is more intercomparable across studies and cannot be increased by increasing the proportion of a specific class balanced accuracies for the optimized versions of the models selected for in depth evaluation are shown in table 2 loclda had the highest balanced accuracy 81 3 driven by its tied for highest event sensitivity of 97 2 and tied for highest maintenance sensitivity at 50 another alternative to accuracy is cohen s kappa cohen s kappa compares the agreement between the true classifications and the model classifications to the agreement that could occur due to random allocation cohen 1960 the formula for cohen s kappa with three or more classes is chicco et al 2021 1 k c s k k p k t k s 2 k k p k t k where c is the total number of observations correctly predicted s is the total number of observations pk is the number of times class k was predicted and tk is the number of times class k truly occurs the ensemble had the highest cohen s kappa at 0 783 and mda also had a cohen s kappa over 0 75 which would be considered substantial or excellent fleiss 1981 landis and koch 1977 a limitation for both balanced accuracy and cohen s kappa is that these metrics do not consider the relative importance of error types in this study s context maintenance related errors could be considered relatively unimportant for example an operator would be aware whether he or she was currently conducting maintenance and could discount or disarm an alert during that time if a maintenance event were incorrectly predicted as normal this too would be relatively inconsequential nevertheless the balanced accuracy and cohen s kappa of the models were limited since no model achieved maintenance sensitivity above 50 this limited sensitivity for maintenance could be explained by limited sample size for maintenance in the training set one instance totaling just nine datapoints further research and model training with greater maintenance sample size might improve maintenance accuracy and thus the balanced accuracy and cohen s kappa of these models omitting maintenance from the dataset mda svmradial and adaboost all had balanced accuracy of at least 97 table s8 adaboost would have a cohen s kappa of 0 915 which would be considered excellent or almost perfect fleiss 1981 landis and koch 1977 for events false positives could be considered more important than false negatives a false positive could lead to complacency or unnecessary emergency protocols in contrast the low stormwater and dfr blending ratios used in this study would not exceed the treatment capabilities of the utility at which this study was conducted it would be beneficial for a model to detect these low levels since they may portend more severe contamination nevertheless a utility may prefer a model with lower sensitivity but greater specificity i e fewer false positives assigning a weight of one to maintenance related errors two for false negatives and four for false positives the best single model for three classes would be c5 0rules and the three way ensemble would be better still appendix a this is the same recommendation that would be made based on the unweighted test set accuracy errors may also be unequally important in timeseries data depending on their location in time many of the false positives in the models tested were lag errors i e occurring immediately after a blending event or maintenance before instruments had fully returned to baseline in practice these errors would be unimportant since operators would already be responding to a correct alert during that time furthermore true positives that occur sooner would be beneficial since they would allow prompter investigation with three classes the ensemble detected all three water types on the first timepoint i e in 15 min and at the lowest blending ratio tested fig 4 of its six false positives five were lag errors occurring consecutively after maintenance or blending events thus in practice this ensemble would have had virtually perfect event sensitivity and just one false alert in a week this false alert corresponded to an increase in uva254 and turbidity that may have been caused by a brief flow interruption with two classes adaboost detected all three blending events on the first timepoint and all four false positives were lag errors fig s4 thus adaboost was virtually perfect on this dataset if binary classification is satisfactory for all models optimized for three classes uva254 and turbidity were the first and second most important features respectively table s9 toc was the third most important feature for all models except c5 0rules the high relative importance of both uva254 and toc is somewhat surprising considering these features are highly correlated r2 0 91 in train set with toc in fact calculated from uva254 as well as uv absorbance at 260 and 280 nm this indicates the value of monitoring multiple uv wavelengths for most models omitting even the least important feature reduced test set accuracy so all water quality parameters measured in the study could be considered useful nevertheless tryptophan like fluorescence had the worst mean rank importance overall this study served as a successful proof of concept that sml could be applied for alert systems in drinking water intakes despite the high variability in data from this context however further research with greater sample size would be required to confirm whether sml can not only detect but also distinguish among adverse water quality events furthermore much research remains to be done in terms of which instruments are most useful for detecting which water quality event types both individually and as components of multivariate algorithms regression modeling was beyond the scope of this manuscript however supervised machine learning can also be applied for regression and this would be a logical next step for further research sml classification could be applied to alert systems that would instigate investigation or corrective action by human operators sml regression could be applied to estimate the percentage of dfr as opposed to just presence or absence this could in turn be used to calculate pathogen concentrations or recommend changes in water treatment operation to counteract the expected increase in pathogens 5 conclusions multiple models kknn c5 0rules mda could predict whether test set observations were normal event or maintenance with over 97 accuracy p value 0 0001 relative to the nir the lowest blending ratios tested 2 tertiary wastewater effluent 0 5 dry weather lvw and 0 02 stormwater impacted lvw were all detectable by sml models an ensemble of the three most accurate models had a test set accuracy of 97 7 higher than any of the models independently it detected all event types in 15 min and had only one false positive that was not a lag error multiple models loclda c5 0rules adaboost and mda could predict whether test set observations were either normal or event with maintenance omitted with over 98 accuracy p value 0 0001 relative to the nir adaboost had the highest test set accuracy at 99 2 detected all blending events on the first timepoint and had zero false positives that were not lag errors preprocessing methods to correct for diurnal patterns or instrument drift generally could improve model accuracy but the optimal approach was model specific uva254 and turbidity were the most important water quality parameters for all models tested for most models tested omitting the least important feature reduced test set accuracy indicating that all the instruments and water quality parameters used in this study can be useful for stormwater or dfr detection some aspects of the results presented herein may be specific to the instrumentation water quality context and dataset studied e g the trained sml models would be specific to this set of instrumentation and lake mead s

16641,disposal of reverse osmosis concentrate roc from advanced water purification facilities is a challenge associated with the implementation of reverse osmosis based treatment of municipal wastewater effluent for potable reuse in particular the dissolved organic matter dom present in roc diminishes the quality of the receiving water upon environmental disposal and affects the toxicity fate and transport of organic contaminants this study investigates uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops for treating dom in roc using a parallel factor analysis parafac approach dom composition and degradation were tested in uv only and three uv aops using hydrogen peroxide h2o2 free chlorine cl2 and persulfate s2o8 2 the four component parafac model consisted of two terrestrial humic like components cuvh and cvish a wastewater nutrient tracer component cnutr and a protein like tyrosine like component cprty based on the observed loss in the maximum fluorescence intensity of the components dom degradation was determined to be dependent on uv fluence oxidant dose and dilution factor of the roc i e bulk dom concentration cvish was most the photolabile component in the uv only system followed by cnutr cprty and cuvh respectively furthermore uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 displayed faster overall reaction kinetics compared to uv cl2 the degradation trends suggested that cnutr and cprty consisted of chemical moieties that were susceptible to reactive oxygen species ho but not reactive chlorine species whereas cvish was sensitive to all reactive species generated in the three uv aops compared to other components cprty was recalcitrant in all treatment scenarios tested calculations using chemical probe based analysis also confirmed these trends in the reactivity of dom components the outcomes of this study form a foundation for characterizing roc reactivity in uv aop treatment technologies to ultimately improve the sustainability of water reuse systems graphical

reuse of municipal wastewater effluent is being increasingly implemented worldwide to supplement dwindling supplies of fresh water and to produce reliably high quality drinking water at low cost tricas et al 2017 however wastewater effluent is contaminated with nutrients pathogens and inorganic and organic compounds not removed by conventional treatment plants creating the need for advanced treatment of the effluent to ensure safe potable water reuse nrc 2012 one of the most widely applied treatment trains for potable reuse employs membrane based processes typically consisting of microfiltration ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis ro followed by an oxidation based process marron et al 2019 this full advanced treatment fat train generates a waste stream containing molecules rejected by the ro membranes known as brine ro concentrate roc or retentate that is traditionally discharged into the ocean surface waters sewers or subsurface however roc contains elevated concentrations of salts metals dissolved organic matter dom and toxic organic pollutants benner et al 2008 cemre birben et al 2017 lee et al 2020 pérez gonzález et al 2012 weng et al 2018 yang et al

gonzález et al 2012 subramani and jacangelo 2014 xu et al 2013 among these advanced oxidation processes aops using ultraviolet uv light have gained attention for roc treatment in recent years umar et

et al 2019 sgroi et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 the elevated concentration of dom in roc 20 60 mg l 1 leads to the formation of large sludge volumes a reduction in water recovery efficiency an increase in

pradhan et al 2016 the shift in uv absorbance spectra as a result of ozonation indicated decomposition of the high molecular weight dom to lower molecular weight organics 1 kda having lower aromaticity ultimately reducing toxicity and increasing biodegradability by two to three fold weng et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 however unidimensional bulk parameters like doc dn cod uv absorbance do not fully capture the complex reactivity of dom in roc in this context three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to capture the reactivity of fluorescent dom which has been shown to be a good representation of the bulk dom mckay 2020 abdelmelek et al 2011 used peak picking to identify three features in the eem spectra eems of roc and showed that the fluorescence peaks corresponding to protein like dom degraded faster than humic like dom during uv h2o2 treatment more recently parallel factor parafac analysis has been applied to eems of dom from

2011 murphy et al 2013 shi et al 2020 yang et al 2015 because parafac deconvolutes eems into mathematically independent components parafac is preferred over peak picking and regional integration for the fluorescence analysis of complex dom matrices the fluorescence intensity at maximum wavelength fmax for each component generated from parafac modelling is analogous to the abundance of each component and reaction kinetics have been applied to individual component data to quantitatively assess dom transformation parafac analysis was used to establish the ph dependence of dom components from suwannee river natural organic matter in environmentally relevant solar irradiation timko et al 2015 recent studies used parafac to understand the role of humic acids in the fouling of membranes of annamox bioreactors zhu et al 2020 to examine the origins and reactivity of dom in agricultural wastewater mangalgiri et al 2017 to study interaction of metals and dom molecules huang et al 2018 and to quantify the adsorption kinetics of dom in landfill leachate by granular activated carbon lee and hur 2016 parafac has the unique advantage of capturing the complex chemical reactivity of dom in engineered systems allowing for the description and quantification of source and composition dependent dom reactivity despite the advantages parafac models have not yet been widely applied to characterize dom in roc from membrane based potable reuse systems in this study roc samples were collected from a municipal potable reuse facility in the southwestern u s over three years the overall objectives were to characterize the dom in roc generated during potable reuse treatment of reclaimed municipal wastewater to examine the degradation of dom in roc using parafac analysis in three uv aops using h2o2 cl2 and s2o8 2 as oxidants and to evaluate the mechanism of dom transformation during uv based treatment in addition a selective chemical probe based competition kinetics method was applied to report reactivities of the mathematically independent parafac components that inform on the chemical make up of dom in roc waste streams 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals materials all

pressure lamp λ 254 nm phillips tuv6t5 the effective uv flux or fluence rate was measured as 56 5 mj cm 2 min 1 using atrazine based actinometry and verified using ferrioxalate actinometry bolton and linden 2003 bolton et al 2011 canonica et al 2008 to start a uv experiment 8 ml aliquots of an experimental solution were placed in quartz tubes and capped to ensure minimal headspace all solutions were buffered using 10 mm phosphate ph 7 at targeted uv fluences samples were extracted from the uv reactor and quenched with thiosulfate prior to further analysis all experiments were performed in duplicate the degradation of dom in roc was quantified over a uv fluence of up to 3500 mj cm 2 three uv aop oxidants were tested h2o2 cl2 and s2o8 2 along with uv only no oxidant as control for each oxidant type three doses 75 150 and 300 µm were tested based on realistic concentrations of h2o2 used in water and wastewater treatment mangalgiri et al 2019 for each treatment condition three dilutions of roc were tested 2x 5x and 10x denoted as roc2x roc5x roc10x roc2x contained highest dom content 50 and roc10x had the least amount of dom 10 in addition control experiments using di water were conducted the dilution series was meant to simulate blending of roc with non saline streams prior to disposal in real systems the impact of light screening by bulk dom on the degradation kinetics

the peak picking method described by coble 2007 with high intensity fluorescence in region ii compared to others fig s1 chen et al 2003 a parafac model was built using eems from 795 samples obtained during uv and uv aop treatment of roc the parafac analysis was performed with matlab r2014a using the dreem toolbox v0 1 0 murphy et al 2013 in short preliminary models with 3 13 components were

and discussion 3 1 roc characterization the four components fig 1 in the parafac model were identified using the openfluor database table s2 cuvh ex em 344 445 nm and cvish ex em 250 450 nm most closely matched terrestrial humic like components ubiquitous to dom from wastewater effluents as well as surface waters murphy et al 2014 cnutr ex em 290 360 nm resembled spectral properties of wastewater nutrient tracer components rather than protein like components as previously identified for rocs using peak picking method abdelmelek et al 2011 the cprty ex em 285 330 nm component most closely matched protein like tyrosine like components which are largely detected in wastewater effluents the fluorescence descriptor labels used above are nominal and indicate potential sources of associated fluorophores and do not confirm chemical composition and dom sources rosario ortiz and korak 2017 in general the highest contribution towards total fluorescence intensity of roc samples was from cnutr 47 9 followed by cvish and cuvh 20 3 and 17 1 respectively and cprty 14 7 the higher fluorescence in the humic and fulvic region of the eems for roc reported in previous studies bagastyo et al 2011 are likely associated with improper or absent corrections for inner filter effects given the extent of treatment municipal wastewater undergoes prior to reaching the ro system in potable water reuse facilities roc characteristics are expected to be fairly consistent across samples as evidenced by the distribution of the components for samples collected over three years fig s1c this observation is consistent with wastewater treatment by microfiltration membranes which removes molecules 100 000 da that tend to fluoresce in the visible range nebbioso and piccolo 2013 from municipal wastewater effluents compared to smaller molecules that display fluorescence in uv range although the high value of fmax does not necessarily imply greater abundance of one component over another the low fluorescence intensity of cuvh and cvish in roc compared to cnutr distinguishes the roc composition from other wastewater dom samples such as wastewater influents effluents and wastewater impacted surface waters for which humic like and fulvic like components show in greater or equal intensity compared to protein like components ishii and boyer 2012 3 2 degradation of dom from roc by uv photolysis all four components followed pseudo first order degradation kinetics under direct uv photolysis fig s2 no increase in fmax value was observed for any parafac components in any scenario tested suggesting no new formation of fluorescent dom during uv based treatment the general trend for direct photolysis rates of parafac components was cvish cprty cnutr cuvh fig 2 the slower degradation of protein like component cprty in this study compared to visible humic like components cvish in this study has also been reported by others hur et al 2011 mangalgiri et al 2017 phong and hur 2015 for each dom component the degradation was fastest in the most dilute solution roc10x with kobs values decreasing in solutions containing more bulk dom i e roc5x and roc2x for example when the dom concentration increased from 4 95 to 24 75 mg c l 1 i e dilution factor decreased from 10x to 2x the kobs value for cvish decreased from 1 33 10 4 mj cm 2 to 0 46 10 4 mj cm 2 the decreasing photodegradation shows inhibitive effects of bulk dom partly associated with light screening the uv transmissivity at 254 nm uv t254 increased with dilution from roc2x roc5x and roc10x 26 9 59 1 and 76 9 respectively furthermore the estimated true rate constant of direct photolysis kd see text s2 for cuvh cnutr cvish and cprty were 0 63 10 4 1 06 10 4 1 52 10 4 and 0 91 10 4 cm2 mj 1 respectively these kd numbers also follow similar trends as seen for kobs with the highest rate constants for cvish followed cnutr and cprty with cuvh being the lowest in general in the presence of bulk dom the expected theoretical screening corrected observed rate constant was much greater than the observed rate constant i e kth kobs suggesting that mechanisms other than light screening contribute to the inhibition of photodegradation previous studies of uv systems have reported the formation of photolytically produced reactive intermediate species ppris including triplet state excited dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical ho mcneill and canonica 2016 o connor et al 2019 schmitt et al 2017 similar indirect photolysis photodegradation due to generation of reactive species due to irradiation of dom has been kinetically modelled for several organic contaminants of emerging concern in water boreen et al 2003 mangalgiri and blaney 2017 we posit that these ppris contributed to the degradation of molecules that constitute dom components and that the scavenging of these radicals by bulk dom resulted in the additional decrease in photodegradation efficiency with increase in roc content fig 2 mcneill and canonica 2016 murphy et al 2018 for cuvh cnutr and cvish the contribution of scavenging of reactive species to kobs values increased with the increase in dom concentration whereas for cprty such trend was not observed while the true molar absorption coefficients for the parafac components at 254 nm are not known the excitation loading spectrum of the components may be used as a proxy for the absorbance properties to estimate relative quantum yields for photolysis to make intra model component to component comparisons at 254 nm the excitation loading value on a common arbitrary scale for cvish 0 22 was approximately 31 70 and 42 greater than that of cuvh cnutr and cprty which had comparable loading values of 0 15 0 14 and 0 16 respectively the variation in photodegradation properties of cuvh cnutr and cprty are then associated with their quantum yields for photolysis using photodegradation data for roc5x cuvh and cprty were determined to have similar quantum yields for direct photolysis the relative quantum yields of cnutr and cvish were 1 77 and 1 52 times greater than that of cuvh see text s2 and figure s2 these varying quantum yields for photolysis at 254 nm and dissimilar radical scavenging properties of components confirm that the differences in photolytic degradation rates are associated with the chemical composition and reactivity in addition to the spectral properties of components these chemical signatures and reactivities of dom components are further explored through bench scale experiments studying degradation of roc dom in uv aop systems 3 3 transformation of dom from roc in uv aops pseudo first order degradation kinetics were observed for all dom components in the uv aops fig s3 s5 the lack of multiphasic trends over large fluences for roc treatment suggests that the composition of each component consisted of chemical moieties with similar reactivities this observation is in contrast with uv and uv aop treatment of surface water murphy et al 2018 and wastewater zhang et al 2019 that displayed distinct fast and slow degradation phases furthermore while other studies reported dom degradation in uv aops at high applied oxidant doses 5 mm yang et al 2019 we used realistic doses of oxidant to mimic operational conditions that resulted in no observable change in doc levels of roc indicating negligible mineralization with treatment additionally no trends were observed in bulk dom parameters e g uv absorbance at 254 nm toc for roc samples undergoing treatment likely due to the dominance of low aromaticity organic molecules with low molecular weights fig s6 text s6 impact of oxidant type overall the degradation of cvish visible humic like was faster than that of cnutr nutrient tracer and cprty protein like in all uv aops fig 3 this observation agrees with previous literature that report that tyrosine like dom molecules cprty in this study are more recalcitrant to degradation in uv aop systems compared to certain humic like substances abdelmelek et al 2011 hur et al 2011 reported that after an initial degradation of large molecules consisting of aromatic humic substance degradation of smaller protein like fluorescence in dom followed leaving recalcitrant humic molecules to accumulate hur et al 2011 this observation was also reported in our study where cuvh representing uv humic like component persisted throughout all uv and uv aop treatment in contrast to this study abdelmelek et al 2011 reported that the uv humic like peak corresponding to cuvh in this study and the visible humic like peak corresponding to cvish in this study showed similar degradation rates and that these rates were faster than the peak identified as protein like corresponding to the cnutr in this study however the previous study was based on a peak picking method which was unable to distinguish the significant spectral overlap of cuvh and cvish components these observations highlight the superiority of parafac based analysis over peak picking for kinetic analysis of dom degradation compared to direct photolysis the addition of 150 µm of oxidant increased the degradation rates of dom components due to formation of reactive species the exception was uv cl2 for cuvh cprty and cnutr which showed comparable degradation to uv only treatment furthermore some components were more sensitive to the oxidant type than others for example the observed degradation rate of cvish only increased by a factor of 0 2 when 150 µm of h2o2 was added to roc5x compared to a 1 25 and 0 68 factor increase observed with uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 at the same oxidant dose in roc5x in contrast upon addition of 150 µm of h2o2 the degradation rates of cnutr and cprty increased by a factor of 2 7 and 2 9 respectively compared to a lower factor of 2 and 1 87 upon addition of 150 µm of s2o8 2 furthermore the addition of 150 µm of cl2 increased the degradation rate of cnutr by only 15 and did not increase degradation of cprty these differences in reactivity are further explored below impact of oxidant dose and dilution factor of roc for a given dilution factor of roc the value of kobs for each component increased linearly with an increase in oxidant concentration fig 4 for instance for h2o2 75 µm in roc10x kobs value of cnutr was 1 93 10 4 cm2 mj 1 the kobs for cnutr increased to 3 23 10 4 cm2 mj 1 and 5 14 10 4 cm2 mj 1 when h2o2 dose increased to 150 µm and 300 µm similar trends were observed for other uv aops as well figs s7 and s8 similarly kobs for each component increased linearly as a function of dom level i e inversely with dilution factor of roc for a fixed oxidant dose the linear increase is associated with greater formation of reactive species with increased oxidant dose and proportional self scavenging of reactive species by oxidant simultaneously the exception to this linear trend of kobs in uv h2o2 was for cuvh and cvish in roc2x r2 0 90 that was attributed to the high contribution of direct photolysis for example direct photolysis contributed to 96 0 of cvish degradation for h2o2 75 µm compared to 83 2 and 60 1 for h2o2 150 µm and h2o2 300 µm these trends highlight the role of direct photolysis in dom degradation in uv aops at low oxidant concentrations despite low uv transmittance in roc matrices in addition the plateauing of kobs at the higher oxidant dose can also be associated with increased scavenging of reactive species by oxidants 3 4 mechanism of dom transformation reactive radicals are formed by the photolysis of oxidants table 1 ho from h2o2 reaction 1 ho and cl from hocl naocl reaction 2 and so4 the primary radical formed from s2o8 2 reaction 3a the so4 undergoes further reactions with h2o to generate ho reaction 3b in addition so4 can react with chloride to form cl reaction 3b in turn cl can also form ho through reaction with water and secondary chain reactions in presence of chloride reactions 4 6 mangalgiri et al 2019 a variety of secondary reactive chlorine species rcs reactive oxygen species ros and reactive sulfate species rss along with carbonate radical co3 can also be formed in rocs lee et al 2020 yang et al 2016 overall ho so4 and cl were the primary radical species generated additional discussion provided in text s3 and text s7 despite high levels carbonate reported in roc 10 11 to 10 8 m modeling indicated that the co3 ss in the uv aops of this study was not significant 10 11 m as the loss of the n n dma a probe for co3 and ho showed low degradation levels similarly insignificant loss of ffa beyond that expected from ho in the uv aops indicated low concentrations of 1o2 ss 10 16 m 1o2 is primarily formed in uv only systems by oxygen quenching of 3dom previous studies have indicated insignificant participation of 3dom and low formation 1o2 in uv aops even though these species may be important in uv only systems at low dom concentrations lester et al 2013 in the presence of 150 µm of oxidant in the three uv aops ho ss increased by approximately three orders of magnitude in the presence of roc compared to di samples fig 4 in the di matrix table 2 the highest ho ss was observed for uv s2o8 2 3 24 10 13 m closely followed by uv h2o2 3 04 10 13 m and uv cl2 2 88 10 13 m overall ho showed the highest concentrations in all systems compared to other species 2 42 32 4 10 14 m in presence of roc table 2 for uv h2o2 an increase in dom decreased the ho ss by 24 79 with greater decrease in ho ss observed for uv cl2 31 91 and uv s2o8 2 43 90 these differences were attributed to the complex mechanisms associated with secondary ho formation in uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 systems and the simultaneous scavenging of reactive species by bulk dom in roc note that the degradation of nitrobenzene selective probe for ho in the presence of dom from roc suggested formation of low but negligible concentrations of ho ss 10 16 m in uv only systems table 2 the cl ss was in the range of 6 9 13 3 10 14 m in uv cl2 and 1 3 5 75 10 14 m in uv s2o8 2 furthermore so4 formation was only significant 2 10 14 m in uv s2o8 2 in low roc matrices where the chloride concentration was low the so4 ss decreased by 41 88 in uv s2o8 2 with an increase in roc in contrast the value of cl ss in uv s2o8 2 increased from less than 0 5 10 14 m to 5 75 10 14 m in presence of roc10x furthermore the increase in roc decreased the values of cl ss to 4 56 10 14 m in roc5x and to 1 31 10 14 m in roc2x the cl ss in uv cl2 followed conventional trends 5 48 decrease with an increase in roc from di to roc10x 5x and 2x despite the formation of cl and so4 ho remained the dominant reactive species in all uv aops the branching ratio of ho i e the relative consumption of ho by a scavenging agent indicated that dom was the major sink for ho 88 90 with bicarbonate accounting for approximately 4 6 of ho scavenging text s7 fig s8 furthermore anions did not impact ho consumption as reported by others lee et al 2020 yang et al 2016 for cl and so4 chloride 97 99 and trace concentrations of bromide up to 1 5 were the major sinks in uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 the steady state concentrations of reactive species also inform on the reactivity and selectivity of the components the degradation trends for fmax value for cnutr and cprty in uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 compared to uv h2o2 suggested that these components are susceptible to attack by ho but not by other reactive species in contrast the elevated degradation of cvish component in roc 5x for uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 despite lower values of ho ss indicated that cvish consisted of compounds sensitive to cl and so4 and other reactive chlorine species while all the primary radical species have comparable oxidation potentials ho 1 9 2 7 v cl 2 6 v and so4 2 5 3 1 v li et al 2017 and may undergo addition electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction reactions the mechanisms for reactive chlorine species and reactive sulfate species render them more selective than ho towards molecules with electron donating groups and denser electron clouds li et al 2017 varanasi et al 2018 hence the composition of cvish appeared to be dominated by molecules containing unsaturated bonds aromatic components and olefins while cnutr and cprty consisted of chemical moieties aliphatic in nature compared to cnutr cvish and cprty the cuvh component remained relatively recalcitrant with low degradation rates by the uv aops we conclude that the cuvh component consisted of stable transformation products and chemicals moieties recalcitrant to ho attack including aldehydes and ketones xie et al 2015 these reactivity trends were further reflected in the values of the second order rate constants kr ci table 3 calculated for the reaction of components with ho cl and so4 the kr ci values were calculated using kobs values of components degradation in uv aops and the steady state concentrations determined from probe based analysis for roc5x 3 5 environmental applications the primary assumption of parafac analysis is that the total fluorescence of a sample is additive which has been shown to hold true for dom samples wünsch et al 2017 as no formation of new fluorescent dom was observed in this study the superposition model may also be extended to photoreactivity and degradation of parafac components in these uv aops just as reaction additivity has been applied to degradation kinetics of trace contaminants uv based systems schwarzenbach et al 2005 our kinetic analysis then lays the groundwork for designing treatment trains for rocs using dom fluorescence as a stand in for the load of organic matter by applying a probe based approach to determine the reactivity of parafac components undergoing degradation in unit processes in engineered systems this study identifies first and second order reaction rate constants for parafac components in three uv aop systems these unique chemical reactivity descriptors may then be used to further compare and contrast parafac components with similar spectral loadings in this way a novel standardized parafac component characterization method is established to identify components based on chemical reactivity the linear dependence of component degradation kinetics with oxidant dose and dom concentration i e dilution factor of roc allows for the application of a weighted arithmetic mean based overall second order pseudo rate constant kaop ci overall details in text s8 while not representing a true second order rate constant for reaction between components and oxidants this dom oxidant normalized prediction parameter the kaop ci overall having units of cm2 mj 1 moxidant 1 may be used in combination with the expected uv fluence and molar oxidant dose to determine the loss of fluorescence intensity of a parafac component thus the utility of the kaop ci overall value lies in real life application to determine the oxidant and uv fluence dose to achieve a set reduction in fluorescence of dom in any roc these estimations may be extended to roc from other sources having similar scavenging profile i e a similar distribution of dom bicarbonate chloride ratio as this study the kaop ci overall also indicates the most effective uv aop to degrade dom in roc the loss of fluorescence normalized by oxidant and fluence doses for cuvh 1 48 10 1 cm2 mj 1 oxidant 1 and cvish 6 55 10 1 cm2 mj 1 ms2o8 2 1 is highest for uv s2o8 2 where as uv h2o2 is the better uv aop for removal of cnutr 2 08 10 1 cm2 mj 1 mh2o2 1 and cprty 4 08 10 1 cm2 mj 1 mh2o2 1 of the three uv aops uv cl2 was the least effective at degrading fluorescent dom in most cases uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 had comparable performance with uv s2o8 2 slightly better than uv h2o2 4 conclusions this study characterized the composition and reactivity of fluorescent dom in roc from a municipal potable water reuse facility over a three year period parafac analysis was applied to deconvoluted eems into statistically independent fluorescent components from large datasets of dom from roc samples treated by uv and uv aop the parafac model developed consisted of four components the cnutr component wastewater nutrient tracer dominated the total fluorescence constituting of 47 9 of the roc fluorescence cvish visible humic like cuvh uv humic like and cprty tyrosine like contributed to 20 3 17 1 and 14 7 respectively this study demonstrated that the fluorescent dom composition of roc associated with fat of a secondary wastewater effluent by microfiltration and ro remained consistent over a three year period the degradation of dom from roc in uv and uv aops followed pseudo first order kinetics in addition we applied a probe based analysis to obtain the steady state concentration of primary radicals ho so4 and cl and predicted the mechanism of dom degradation in uv aops while previous studies for roc have used unidimensional bulk parameters such as doc cod and uv254 to describe dom degradation of reactive species findings from this study using parafac components provided a more fundamental understanding of the complex reactivity of dom in roc by studying degradation of roc at various dilutions we were able to demonstrate the applicability of these kinetic analyses to various roc disposal scenarios including blending with wastewater treatment plant effluent and application of uv aop as a pre treatment step in roc management furthermore the reactivity parameters determined in this study the dom oxidant normalized prediction parameter kaop ci overall and the second order rate constants for reaction of components with primary radicals kr ci are independent of oxidant dose and ro dilution and can be used to predict dom fate in engineered systems since the predictive parameters are related to the fundamental reactivity and chemical composition of dom molecules they may also serve as additional descriptors of parafac components and enable comparison of dom reactivity from other water

16641,disposal of reverse osmosis concentrate roc from advanced water purification facilities is a challenge associated with the implementation of reverse osmosis based treatment of municipal wastewater effluent for potable reuse in particular the dissolved organic matter dom present in roc diminishes the quality of the receiving water upon environmental disposal and affects the toxicity fate and transport of organic contaminants this study investigates uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops for treating dom in roc using a parallel factor analysis parafac approach dom composition and degradation were tested in uv only and three uv aops using hydrogen peroxide h2o2 free chlorine cl2 and persulfate s2o8 2 the four component parafac model consisted of two terrestrial humic like components cuvh and cvish a wastewater nutrient tracer component cnutr and a protein like tyrosine like component cprty based on the observed loss in the maximum fluorescence intensity of the components dom degradation was determined to be dependent on uv fluence oxidant dose and dilution factor of the roc i e bulk dom concentration cvish was most the photolabile component in the uv only system followed by cnutr cprty and cuvh respectively furthermore uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 displayed faster overall reaction kinetics compared to uv cl2 the degradation trends suggested that cnutr and cprty consisted of chemical moieties that were susceptible to reactive oxygen species ho but not reactive chlorine species whereas cvish was sensitive to all reactive species generated in the three uv aops compared to other components cprty was recalcitrant in all treatment scenarios tested calculations using chemical probe based analysis also confirmed these trends in the reactivity of dom components the outcomes of this study form a foundation for characterizing roc reactivity in uv aop treatment technologies to ultimately improve the sustainability of water reuse systems graphical

reuse of municipal wastewater effluent is being increasingly implemented worldwide to supplement dwindling supplies of fresh water and to produce reliably high quality drinking water at low cost tricas et al 2017 however wastewater effluent is contaminated with nutrients pathogens and inorganic and organic compounds not removed by conventional treatment plants creating the need for advanced treatment of the effluent to ensure safe potable water reuse nrc 2012 one of the most widely applied treatment trains for potable reuse employs membrane based processes typically consisting of microfiltration ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis ro followed by an oxidation based process marron et al 2019 this full advanced treatment fat train generates a waste stream containing molecules

pradhan et al 2016 the shift in uv absorbance spectra as a result of ozonation indicated decomposition of the high molecular weight dom to lower molecular weight organics 1 kda having lower aromaticity ultimately reducing toxicity and increasing biodegradability by two to three fold weng et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 however unidimensional bulk parameters like doc dn cod uv absorbance do not fully capture the complex reactivity of dom in roc in this context three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to capture the reactivity of fluorescent dom which has been shown to be a good representation of the bulk dom mckay 2020 abdelmelek et al 2011 used peak picking to identify three features in the eem spectra eems of roc and showed that the fluorescence peaks corresponding to protein like dom degraded faster than humic like dom during uv h2o2 treatment more recently parallel factor parafac analysis has been applied to eems of dom from

2011 murphy et al 2013 shi et al 2020 yang et al 2015 because parafac deconvolutes eems into mathematically independent components parafac is preferred over peak picking and regional integration for the fluorescence analysis of complex dom matrices the fluorescence intensity at maximum wavelength fmax for each component generated from parafac modelling is analogous to the abundance of each component and reaction kinetics have been applied to individual component data to quantitatively assess dom transformation parafac analysis was used to establish the ph dependence of dom components from suwannee river natural organic matter in environmentally relevant solar irradiation timko et al 2015 recent studies used parafac to understand the role of humic acids in the fouling of membranes of annamox bioreactors zhu et al 2020 to examine the origins and reactivity of dom in agricultural wastewater mangalgiri et al 2017 to study interaction of metals and dom molecules huang et al 2018 and to quantify the adsorption kinetics of dom in landfill leachate by granular activated carbon lee and hur 2016 parafac has the unique advantage of capturing the complex chemical reactivity of dom in engineered systems allowing for the description and quantification of source and composition dependent dom reactivity despite the advantages parafac models have not yet been widely applied to characterize dom in roc from membrane based potable reuse systems in this study roc samples were collected from a municipal potable reuse facility in the southwestern u s over three years the overall objectives were to characterize the dom in roc generated during potable reuse treatment of reclaimed municipal wastewater to examine the degradation of dom in roc using parafac analysis in three uv aops using h2o2 cl2 and s2o8 2 as oxidants and to evaluate the mechanism of dom transformation during uv based treatment in addition a selective chemical probe based competition kinetics method was applied to report reactivities of the mathematically independent parafac components that inform on the chemical make up of dom in roc waste streams 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemicals materials all

pressure lamp λ 254 nm phillips tuv6t5 the effective uv flux or fluence rate was measured as 56 5 mj cm 2 min 1 using atrazine based actinometry and verified using ferrioxalate actinometry bolton and linden 2003 bolton et al 2011 canonica et al 2008 to start a uv experiment 8 ml aliquots of an experimental solution were placed in quartz tubes and capped to ensure minimal headspace all solutions were buffered using 10 mm phosphate ph 7 at targeted uv fluences samples were extracted from the uv reactor and quenched with thiosulfate prior to further analysis all experiments were performed in duplicate the degradation of dom in roc was quantified over a uv fluence of up to 3500 mj cm 2 three uv aop oxidants were tested h2o2 cl2 and s2o8 2 along with uv only no oxidant as control for each oxidant type three doses 75 150 and 300 µm were tested based on realistic concentrations of h2o2 used in water and wastewater treatment mangalgiri et al 2019 for each treatment condition three dilutions of roc were tested 2x 5x and 10x denoted as roc2x roc5x roc10x roc2x contained highest dom content 50 and roc10x had the least amount of dom 10 in addition control experiments using di water were conducted the dilution series was meant to simulate blending of roc with non saline streams prior to disposal in real systems the impact of light screening by bulk dom on the degradation kinetics

and discussion 3 1 roc characterization the four components fig 1 in the parafac model were identified using the openfluor database table s2 cuvh ex em 344 445 nm and cvish ex em 250 450 nm most closely matched terrestrial humic like components ubiquitous to dom from wastewater effluents as well as surface waters murphy et al 2014 cnutr ex em 290 360 nm resembled spectral properties of wastewater nutrient tracer components rather than protein like components as previously identified for rocs using peak picking method abdelmelek et al 2011 the cprty ex em 285 330 nm component most closely matched protein like tyrosine like components which are largely detected in wastewater effluents the fluorescence descriptor labels used above are nominal and indicate potential sources of associated fluorophores and do not confirm chemical composition and dom sources rosario ortiz and korak 2017 in general the highest contribution towards total fluorescence intensity of roc samples was from cnutr 47 9 followed by cvish and cuvh 20 3 and 17 1 respectively and cprty 14 7 the higher fluorescence in the humic and fulvic region of the eems for roc reported in previous studies bagastyo et al 2011 are likely associated with improper or absent corrections for inner filter effects given the extent of treatment municipal wastewater undergoes prior to reaching the ro system in potable water reuse facilities roc characteristics are expected to be fairly consistent across samples as evidenced by the distribution of the components for samples collected over three years fig s1c this observation is consistent with wastewater treatment by microfiltration membranes which removes molecules 100 000 da that tend to fluoresce in the visible range nebbioso and piccolo 2013 from municipal wastewater effluents compared to smaller molecules that display fluorescence in uv range although the high value of fmax does not necessarily imply greater abundance of one component over another the low fluorescence intensity of cuvh and cvish in roc compared to cnutr distinguishes the roc composition from other wastewater dom samples such as wastewater influents effluents and wastewater impacted surface waters for which humic like and fulvic like components show in greater or equal intensity compared to protein like components ishii and boyer 2012 3 2 degradation of dom from roc by uv photolysis all four components followed pseudo first order degradation kinetics under direct uv photolysis fig s2 no increase in fmax value was observed for any parafac components in any scenario tested suggesting no new formation of fluorescent dom during uv based treatment the general trend for direct photolysis rates of parafac components was cvish cprty cnutr cuvh fig 2 the slower degradation of protein like component cprty in this study compared to visible humic like components cvish in this study has also been reported by others hur et al 2011 mangalgiri et al 2017 phong and hur 2015 for each dom component the degradation was fastest in the most dilute solution roc10x with kobs values decreasing in solutions containing more bulk dom i e roc5x and roc2x for example when the dom concentration increased from 4 95 to 24 75 mg c l 1 i e dilution factor decreased from 10x to 2x the kobs value for cvish decreased from 1 33 10 4 mj cm 2 to 0 46 10 4 mj cm 2 the decreasing photodegradation shows inhibitive effects of bulk dom partly associated with light screening the uv transmissivity at 254 nm uv t254 increased with dilution from roc2x roc5x and roc10x 26 9 59 1 and 76 9 respectively furthermore the estimated true rate constant of direct photolysis kd see text s2 for cuvh cnutr cvish and cprty were 0 63 10 4 1 06 10 4 1 52 10 4 and 0 91 10 4 cm2 mj 1 respectively these kd numbers also follow similar trends as seen for kobs with the highest rate constants for cvish followed cnutr and cprty with cuvh being the lowest in general in the presence of bulk dom the expected theoretical screening corrected observed rate constant was much greater than the observed rate constant i e kth kobs suggesting that mechanisms other than light screening contribute to the inhibition of photodegradation previous studies of uv systems have reported the formation of photolytically produced reactive intermediate species ppris including triplet state excited dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical ho mcneill and canonica 2016 o connor et al 2019 schmitt et al 2017 similar indirect photolysis photodegradation due to generation of reactive species due to irradiation of dom has been kinetically modelled for several organic contaminants of emerging concern in water boreen et al 2003 mangalgiri and blaney 2017 we posit that these ppris contributed to the degradation of molecules that constitute dom components and that the scavenging of these radicals by bulk dom resulted in the additional decrease in photodegradation efficiency with increase in roc content fig 2 mcneill and canonica 2016 murphy et al 2018 for cuvh cnutr and cvish the contribution of scavenging of reactive species to kobs values increased with the increase in dom concentration whereas for cprty such trend was not observed while the true molar absorption coefficients for the parafac components at 254 nm are not known the excitation loading spectrum of the components may be used as a proxy for the absorbance properties to estimate relative quantum yields for photolysis to make intra model component to component comparisons at 254 nm the excitation loading value on a common arbitrary scale for cvish 0 22 was approximately 31 70 and 42 greater than that of cuvh cnutr and cprty which had comparable loading values of 0 15 0 14 and 0 16 respectively the variation in photodegradation properties of cuvh cnutr and cprty are then associated with their quantum yields for photolysis using photodegradation data for roc5x cuvh and cprty were determined to have similar quantum yields for direct photolysis the relative quantum yields of cnutr and cvish were 1 77 and 1 52 times greater than that of cuvh see text s2 and figure s2 these varying quantum yields for photolysis at 254 nm and dissimilar radical scavenging properties of components confirm that the differences in photolytic degradation rates are associated with the chemical composition and reactivity in addition to the spectral properties of components these chemical signatures and reactivities of dom components are further explored through bench scale experiments studying degradation of roc dom in uv aop systems 3 3 transformation of dom from roc in uv aops pseudo first order degradation kinetics were observed for all dom components in the uv aops fig s3 s5 the lack of multiphasic trends over large fluences for roc treatment suggests that the composition of each component consisted of chemical moieties with similar reactivities this observation is in contrast with uv and uv aop treatment of surface water murphy et al 2018 and wastewater zhang et al 2019 that displayed distinct fast and slow degradation phases furthermore while other studies reported dom degradation in uv aops at high applied oxidant doses 5 mm yang et al 2019 we used realistic doses of oxidant to mimic operational conditions that resulted in no observable change in doc levels of roc indicating negligible mineralization with treatment additionally no trends were observed in bulk dom parameters e g uv absorbance at 254 nm toc for roc samples undergoing treatment likely due to the dominance of low aromaticity organic molecules with low molecular weights fig s6 text s6 impact of oxidant type overall the degradation of cvish visible humic like was faster than that of cnutr nutrient tracer and cprty protein like in all uv aops fig 3 this observation agrees with previous literature that report that tyrosine like dom molecules cprty in this study are more recalcitrant to degradation in uv aop systems compared to certain humic like substances abdelmelek et al 2011 hur et al 2011 reported that after an initial degradation of large molecules consisting of aromatic humic substance degradation of smaller protein like fluorescence in dom followed leaving recalcitrant humic molecules to accumulate hur et al 2011 this observation was also reported in our study where cuvh representing uv humic like component persisted throughout all uv and uv aop treatment in contrast to this study abdelmelek et al 2011 reported that the uv humic like peak corresponding to cuvh in this study and the visible humic like peak corresponding to cvish in this study showed similar degradation rates and that these rates were faster than the peak identified as protein like corresponding to the cnutr in this study however the previous study was based on a peak picking method which was unable to distinguish the significant spectral overlap of cuvh and cvish components these observations highlight the superiority of parafac based analysis over peak picking for kinetic analysis of dom degradation compared to direct photolysis the addition of 150 µm of oxidant increased the degradation rates of dom components due to formation of reactive species the exception was uv cl2 for cuvh cprty and cnutr which showed comparable degradation to uv only treatment furthermore some components were more sensitive to the oxidant type than others for example the observed degradation rate of cvish only increased by a factor of 0 2 when 150 µm of h2o2 was added to roc5x compared to a 1 25 and 0 68 factor increase observed with uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 at the same oxidant dose in roc5x in contrast upon addition of 150 µm of h2o2 the degradation rates of cnutr and cprty increased by a factor of 2 7 and 2 9 respectively compared to a lower factor of 2 and 1 87 upon addition of 150 µm of s2o8 2 furthermore the addition of 150 µm of cl2 increased the degradation rate of cnutr by only 15 and did not increase degradation of cprty these differences in reactivity are further explored below impact of oxidant dose and dilution factor of roc for a given dilution factor of roc the value of kobs for each component increased linearly with an increase in oxidant concentration fig 4 for instance for h2o2 75 µm in roc10x kobs value of cnutr was 1 93 10 4 cm2 mj 1 the kobs for cnutr increased to 3 23 10 4 cm2 mj 1 and 5 14 10 4 cm2 mj 1 when h2o2 dose increased to 150 µm and 300 µm similar trends were observed for other uv aops as well figs s7 and s8 similarly kobs for each component increased linearly as a function of dom level i e inversely with dilution factor of roc for a fixed oxidant dose the linear increase is associated with greater formation of reactive species with increased oxidant dose and proportional self scavenging of reactive species by oxidant simultaneously the exception to this linear trend of kobs in uv h2o2 was for cuvh and cvish in roc2x r2 0 90 that was attributed to the high contribution of direct photolysis for example direct photolysis contributed to 96 0 of cvish degradation for h2o2 75 µm compared to 83 2 and 60 1 for h2o2 150 µm and h2o2 300 µm these trends highlight the role of direct photolysis in dom degradation in uv aops at low oxidant concentrations despite low uv transmittance in roc matrices in addition the plateauing of kobs at the higher oxidant dose can also be associated with increased scavenging of reactive species by oxidants 3 4 mechanism of dom transformation reactive radicals are formed by the photolysis of oxidants table 1 ho from h2o2 reaction 1 ho and cl from hocl naocl reaction 2 and so4 the primary radical formed from s2o8 2 reaction 3a the so4 undergoes further reactions with h2o to generate ho reaction 3b in addition so4 can react with chloride to form cl reaction 3b in turn cl can also form ho through reaction with water and secondary chain reactions in presence of chloride reactions 4 6 mangalgiri et al 2019 a variety of secondary reactive chlorine species rcs reactive oxygen species ros and reactive sulfate species rss along with carbonate radical co3 can also be formed in rocs lee et al 2020 yang et al 2016 overall ho so4 and cl were the primary radical species generated additional discussion provided in text s3 and text s7 despite high levels carbonate reported in roc 10 11 to 10 8 m modeling indicated that the co3 ss in the uv aops of this study was not significant 10 11 m as the loss of the n n dma a probe for co3 and ho showed low degradation levels similarly insignificant loss of ffa beyond that expected from ho in the uv aops indicated low concentrations of 1o2 ss 10 16 m 1o2 is primarily formed in uv only systems by oxygen quenching of 3dom previous studies have indicated insignificant participation of 3dom and low formation 1o2 in uv aops even though these species may be important in uv only systems at low dom concentrations lester et al 2013 in the presence of 150 µm of oxidant in the three uv aops ho ss increased by approximately three orders of magnitude in the presence of roc compared to di samples fig 4 in the di matrix table 2 the highest ho ss was observed for uv s2o8 2 3 24 10 13 m closely followed by uv h2o2 3 04 10 13 m and uv cl2 2 88 10 13 m overall ho showed the highest concentrations in all systems compared to other species 2 42 32 4 10 14 m in presence of roc table 2 for uv h2o2 an increase in dom decreased the ho ss by 24 79 with greater decrease in ho ss observed for uv cl2 31 91 and uv s2o8 2 43 90 these differences were attributed to the complex mechanisms associated with secondary ho formation in uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 systems and the simultaneous scavenging of reactive species by bulk dom in roc note that the degradation of nitrobenzene selective probe for ho in the presence of dom from roc suggested formation of low but negligible concentrations of ho ss 10 16 m in uv only systems table 2 the cl ss was in the range of 6 9 13 3 10 14 m in uv cl2 and 1 3 5 75 10 14 m in uv s2o8 2 furthermore so4 formation was only significant 2 10 14 m in uv s2o8 2 in low roc matrices where the chloride concentration was low the so4 ss decreased by 41 88 in uv s2o8 2 with an increase in roc in contrast the value of cl ss in uv s2o8 2 increased from less than 0 5 10 14 m to 5 75 10 14 m in presence of roc10x furthermore the increase in roc decreased the values of cl ss to 4 56 10 14 m in roc5x and to 1 31 10 14 m in roc2x the cl ss in uv cl2 followed conventional trends 5 48 decrease with an increase in roc from di to roc10x 5x and 2x despite the formation of cl and so4 ho remained the dominant reactive species in all uv aops the branching ratio of ho i e the relative consumption of ho by a scavenging agent indicated that dom was the major sink for ho 88 90 with bicarbonate accounting for approximately 4 6 of ho scavenging text s7 fig s8 furthermore anions did not impact ho consumption as reported by others lee et al 2020 yang et al 2016 for cl and so4 chloride 97 99 and trace concentrations of bromide up to 1 5 were the major sinks in uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 the steady state concentrations of reactive species also inform on the reactivity and selectivity of the components the degradation trends for fmax value for cnutr and cprty in uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 compared to uv h2o2 suggested that these components are susceptible to attack by ho but not by other reactive species in contrast the elevated degradation of cvish component in roc 5x for uv cl2 and uv s2o8 2 despite lower values of ho ss indicated that cvish consisted of compounds sensitive to cl and so4 and other reactive chlorine species while all the primary radical species have comparable oxidation potentials ho 1 9 2 7 v cl 2 6 v and so4 2 5 3 1 v li et al 2017 and may undergo addition electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction reactions the mechanisms for reactive chlorine species and reactive sulfate species render them more selective than ho towards molecules with electron donating groups and denser electron clouds li et al 2017 varanasi et al 2018 hence the composition of cvish appeared to be dominated by molecules containing unsaturated bonds aromatic components and olefins while cnutr and cprty consisted of chemical moieties aliphatic in nature compared to cnutr cvish and cprty the cuvh component remained relatively recalcitrant with low degradation rates by the uv aops we conclude that the cuvh component consisted of stable transformation products and chemicals moieties recalcitrant to ho attack including aldehydes and ketones xie et al 2015 these reactivity trends were further reflected in the values of the second order rate constants kr ci table 3 calculated for the reaction of components with ho cl and so4 the kr ci values were calculated using kobs values of components degradation in uv aops and the steady state concentrations determined from probe based analysis for roc5x 3 5 environmental applications the primary assumption of parafac analysis is that the total fluorescence of a sample is additive which has been shown to hold true for dom samples wünsch et al 2017 as no formation of new fluorescent dom was observed in this study the superposition model may also be extended to photoreactivity and degradation of parafac components in these uv aops just as reaction additivity has been applied to degradation kinetics of trace contaminants uv based systems schwarzenbach et al 2005 our kinetic analysis then lays the groundwork for designing treatment trains for rocs using dom fluorescence as a stand in for the load of organic matter by applying a probe based approach to determine the reactivity of parafac components undergoing degradation in unit processes in engineered systems this study identifies first and second order reaction rate constants for parafac components in three uv aop systems these unique chemical reactivity descriptors may then be used to further compare and contrast parafac components with similar spectral loadings in this way a novel standardized parafac component characterization method is established to identify components based on chemical reactivity the linear dependence of component degradation kinetics with oxidant dose and dom concentration i e dilution factor of roc allows for the application of a weighted arithmetic mean based overall second order pseudo rate constant kaop ci overall details in text s8 while not representing a true second order rate constant for reaction between components and oxidants this dom oxidant normalized prediction parameter the kaop ci overall having units of cm2 mj 1 moxidant 1 may be used in combination with the expected uv fluence and molar oxidant dose to determine the loss of fluorescence intensity of a parafac component thus the utility of the kaop ci overall value lies in real life application to determine the oxidant and uv fluence dose to achieve a set reduction in fluorescence of dom in any roc these estimations may be extended to roc from other sources having similar scavenging profile i e a similar distribution of dom bicarbonate chloride ratio as this study the kaop ci overall also indicates the most effective uv aop to degrade dom in roc the loss of fluorescence normalized by oxidant and fluence doses for cuvh 1 48 10 1 cm2 mj 1 oxidant 1 and cvish 6 55 10 1 cm2 mj 1 ms2o8 2 1 is highest for uv s2o8 2 where as uv h2o2 is the better uv aop for removal of cnutr 2 08 10 1 cm2 mj 1 mh2o2 1 and cprty 4 08 10 1 cm2 mj 1 mh2o2 1 of the three uv aops uv cl2 was the least effective at degrading fluorescent dom in most cases uv h2o2 and uv s2o8 2 had comparable performance with uv s2o8 2 slightly better than uv h2o2 4 conclusions this study characterized the composition and reactivity of fluorescent dom in roc from a municipal potable water reuse facility over a three year period parafac analysis was applied to deconvoluted eems into statistically independent fluorescent components from large datasets of dom from roc samples treated by uv and uv aop the parafac model developed consisted of four components the cnutr component wastewater nutrient tracer dominated the total fluorescence constituting of 47 9 of the roc fluorescence cvish visible humic like cuvh uv humic like and cprty tyrosine like contributed to 20 3 17 1 and 14 7 respectively this study demonstrated that the fluorescent dom composition of roc associated with fat of a secondary wastewater effluent by microfiltration and ro remained consistent over a three year period the degradation of dom from roc in uv and uv aops followed pseudo first order kinetics in addition we applied a probe based analysis to obtain the steady state concentration of primary radicals ho so4 and cl and predicted the mechanism of dom degradation in uv aops while previous studies for roc have used unidimensional bulk parameters such as doc cod and uv254 to describe dom degradation of reactive species findings from this study using parafac components provided a more fundamental understanding of the complex reactivity of dom in roc by studying degradation of roc at various dilutions we were able to demonstrate the applicability of these kinetic analyses to various roc disposal scenarios including blending with wastewater treatment plant effluent and application of uv aop as a pre treatment step in roc management furthermore the reactivity parameters determined in this study the dom oxidant normalized prediction parameter kaop ci overall and the second order rate constants for reaction of components with primary radicals kr ci are independent of oxidant dose and ro dilution and can be used to predict dom fate in engineered systems since the predictive parameters are related to the fundamental reactivity and chemical composition of dom molecules they may also serve as additional descriptors of parafac components and enable comparison of dom reactivity from other water

16642,an innovative localized mixing concept was tested in an anaerobic plug flow reactor anpfr treating food waste fw mixed with municipal wastewater ww the proposed concept consists of placing propellers along the shaft of the anpfr at key points that represent the mid region of each of the anaerobic digestion stages hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis first the need for and efficiency of localized mixing the new concept suggested by the authors were investigated while the main benefit of localized mixing is the reduction of energy demand associated with conventional uniform mixing i e throughout the longitudinal axis the system can also benefit from synergetic reactions in non mixed zones in fact at a total solid ts content of 15 organic loading rate olr of 4 2 g

different ts content 10 15 20 and 22 5 corresponding to olrs of 2 8 4 2 6 3 and 7 9 g vs l 1 d 1 respectively while operating under the same hrt it was found that the system can adequately sustain a feed with a maximum ts of 20 while achieving removal rates up to 92 for solids and a ch4 yield of 613 ml g vsfed 1 the digester was simulated using computational fluid dynamics the outputs revealed 1 highest radial mixing at the center of the methanogenesis zone where the propeller is located and 2 low longitudinal mixing before and after the propeller of the methanogenesis stage implying the presence of sedimentation zones that was visually verified the former is assumed to favor better dispersion of inhibitors and improved stability while the latter is expected to provide stagnant areas

vavilin and angelidaki 2005 showed that high intensity mixing inhibits methanogenesis as well as hydrolysis acidogenesis moreover karim et al 2005a 2005b found that very rapid mixing disrupts the flocs structure in completely mixed reactors thereby disturbing the syntrophic relationships between microorganisms similarly stroot et al 2001 and lindmark et al 2014a suggested that vigorous continuous mixing degrades the performance of high solid anaerobic digesters and that minimal mixing was sufficient to distribute the feed adequately and allow syntrophic interactions on the other hand intermittent mixing might be an optimal solution for ideal ad performance since it can create initiation zones where methanogens can grow and thrive and hence resulting in seeding the rest of the reactor vavilin and angelidaki 2005 zhai et al 2018 kress et al 2018 kaparaju et al 2008 lindmark et al 2014a and kariyama et al 2018 showed that intermittent and minimal mixing strategies improve ch4 yield compared to continuous and rigorous mixing furthermore optimized intermittent mixing of ad processes has been reported to reduce the energy demand and maintenance cost compared to the continuous mixing mode lindmark et al 2014a 2014b wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 kariyama et al 2018 consequently intermittent mixing has been recommended in digesters treating organic waste under mesophilic temperature conditions kariyama et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 chang et al 2019 from a modeling perspective computational fluid dynamics cfd has emerged as a promising tool to study the fluid flow in bioenergy systems terashima et al 2009 wu 2010 2012 2013 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 rasouli et al 2018 mao et al 2019 tobo et al 2019 models and methods have been developed to determine optimum mixing patterns in real scale ancstrs specifically at different solid concentrations terashima et al 2009 wu 2012 cfd has been also used to simulate circular and egg shaped lab scale digesters and estimate velocity fields particle trajectories dead zones and turbulence impacts wu 2010 recently cfd has been used to assess mixing quality in full scale anaerobic digesters dapelo and bridgeman 2018 ghanimeh et al 2020 in comparison with the above this study attempts to reduce energy requirements through incomplete localized mixing reducing the mass of the waste to be mixed decreases the energy needed for mixing yet the challenge remains to prove the stability and treatment efficiency of the locally mixed reactor and define its loading capacity to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first work to test this concept in anpfr the experimental program has two parts 1 the locally mixed anpfr was tested for treatment of fw at ts 15 and its performance was compared to that of a stagnant with no mixing reactor and 2 the feeding rate was gradually increased with ts 10 to 22 5 until failure to determine maximum sustainable load system stability treatment efficiency and methane generation were monitored using key indicators finally the system was simulated using cfd for the purpose of quantifying and numerically validating the observed fluid behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a lab scale anpfr was constructed with a plexiglas cylinder of 40 cm length 8 cm inner diameter and 0 5 cm thickness fig 1 g the two liter anpfr has a working volume of 1 8 l and a biogas headspace of 0 2 l the digester was kept under mesophilic conditions 37 0 5 c in a 60 l plexiglass water bath with an automatic temperature controller a a direct current motor k was connected to the anpfr to rotate the longitudinal shaft and a valve e was placed at the opposite end to withdraw the digestate the system is fed through a valve c the biogas is collected from the top of the digester and sent to a wet tip gas meter f for volume measurement and collected in a 10 l tedlar bag d for daily analysis according to lindmark et al 2014b for a given hrt about 7 5 17 5 and 75 of the treatment time are required for hydrolysis acidogenisis and methanogenesis respectively assuming proportionality between process time and the length traveled by the waste in anpfr for a digester of 40 cm length the following zones were considered applicable 3 cm for hydrolysis 7 cm for acidogenisis and 30 cm for methanogenesis accordingly local mixing was achieved using three rectangular paddles 1 cm width 0 2 cm thickness and 7 5 cm height along the longitudinal axis placed at 1 5 cm 6 5 cm and 25 cm away from the feeding end those locations are assumed to coincide with the middle of each of the digestion stages the shaft was continuously rotated at 25 rpm lindmark et al 2014a 2 2 inoculation waste preparation and feeding during inoculation the digester was filled with anaerobic digestate extracted from a lab scale mesophilic ancstr fw was prepared based on the composition of typical lebanese waste with ts 23 4 and vs 17 8 ghanimeh et al 2018b the waste was shredded and mixed with wastewater ww collected from the on campus ww treatment plant using a homogenizer cole parmer labgen 850 homogenizer to achieve the required ts content table 1 four batches of feed were prepared during the experiment with ts varying between 10 and 22 5 and a fw to ww ratio ranging from 0 75 to 25 the samples were homogenized and stored in 500 ml plastic bottles at 20 c feeding occurred daily including weekends 2 3 experimental procedure the program consisted of two experiments experiment 1 assessing the proposed local mixing design and experiment 2 defining the loading capacity of the locally mixed digester experiment 1 was conducted at a feeding ts of 15 an organic loading rate olr of 4 2 g vs l 1 d 1 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 28 d the experiment was divided into four phases over a total running period of 30 weeks as follows phase 1 during which mixing occurred at 25 rpm phase 2 corresponding to a period of no mixing performance is compared to phase one to investigate the need for mixing phase 3 considered a recovery period during which mixing was resumed to restore adequate performance similar to that in phase 1 phase 4 is a steady state operation with mixing at 25 rpm the system is stabilized and prepared for the next experiment experiment 2 aims to define the loading capacity of the locally mixed anpfr by increasing the ts content of the feed until reaching failure conditions while operating under an hrt of 28 d the ts contents investigated in this study are 10 15 20 and 22 5 corresponding to olrs of 2 8 4 2 6 3 and 7 9 g vs l 1 d 1 respectively every ts level was maintained for at least 12 weeks 3 hrts except at ts 22 5 at which the system experienced instability after eight weeks of operation 2 4 analytical methods physical and chemical parameters were determined every monday including ts and vs using standard methods 2540b and 2540e procedures cod through spectrophotometry applying a modification of standard methods 5220d apha et al 2012 using hach medium range cod kits hach company loveland colorado total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration by spectrophotometry using hach high range ammonia kits hach company loveland colorado partial alkalinity pa total alkalinity ta and vfa by titration ripley et al 1986 removal rates of solids were determined as the difference between influent and effluent concentrations divided by influent concentration the ph was monitored three times a week using a ph probe hach 35641 51 the daily collected biogas was fed to a dual wavelength infrared cell with reference channels gem 5000 monitor keison products uk for analysis specific ch4 yield expressed as the volume of ch4 produced per gram vs fed to the digester was calculated weekly the dynamic viscosity of the fluid entering and leaving the system was measured using a viscometer cole parmer ndj5s rotary viscometer where deemed appropriate the analysis results are reported as average value standard deviation 2 5 cfd simulation a transient three dimensional cfd was performed to simulate the mixing of the anpfr using volume of fluid vof model guerrero et al 2017 with dispersed interface the vof model was combined with the reynolds stress transport model launder et al 1975 eraky et al 2018 to capture the underlying flow turbulence anisotropy of the mixing digestate the 3d geometry of the anpfr was split into two zones rotating zone enclosure that surrounds the propellers and shaft and stationary zone tank as shown in fig 2 the two zones were separated by an interface surface where the coupling between the stationary and rotating zones is solved using multiple reference frame model luo et al 1994 the anpfr geometry was meshed using unstructured tetrahedral mesh with non uniform element size of 1 2 4 mm and a total of 132 500 elements fig 3 the sections of the inlet tank wall and outlets digestate and biogas were modelled as stationary wall with no slip condition the system was modeled as homogeneous newtonian fluid yu et al 2011 rasouli et al 2018 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 considering that experimental viscosities of 0 175 and 0 00183 pa s 1 were observed for the flow entering and leaving the system respectively the bioreactor was modelled as a multiphase flow by dividing the system into four phases with linearly changing viscosities 1 hydrolysis 950 kg m 3 0 167 pa s 1 2 acidogenesis 950 kg m 3 0 143 pa s 1 3 methanogenesis 950 kg m 3 0 067 pa s 1 and 4 biogas headspace the transient simulation was performed using ansys fluent 18 1 commercial code where the pressure velocity coupling is solved using simple scheme and the momentum equation is spatially discretized using the second order upwind scheme different time steps were tested from 0 001 to 0 004 s where 0 004 s was the optimal time step for maintaining the solution convergence and computational cost the simulation was conducted for four complete propeller revolutions 9 6 s computational field variables such as reynolds number re flow field velocity and volume fraction were recorded during the simulation time and processed using cfd post 18 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment 1 assessing the local mixing design 3 1 1 visual observation and simulation output fig 4 a shows the three propellers at key points i mid hydrolysis ii mid acidogenesis and iii mid methanogenesis by visual inspection two deposition areas c were noticed where the suspended solids have settled at the bottom of the anpfr due to the low impact of nearby propellers this is an indicative sign of mixing occurring only at the proximity of the propellers this was further explained by the outcome of the cfd simulation in terms of longitudinal mixing the model output shows the changes in the volume fraction at each mixing location which occurred only at the propellers proximity fig 4 b the areas on both sides of propeller iii seem to be moving slowly without considerable mixing this is further demonstrated in fig 5 which shows the velocity along the mid section of the digester it is clearly seen that the velocity approaches zero before and after the third propeller fig 5 this justifies the sedimentation zones observed on both sides accordingly this study s modeling methodology may be used to modify the design components e g mixing intensity propellers locations and shapes dimensions of digester to increase or decrease the sedimented volume the latter can be correlated with the proportions of stagnant to mixed conditions where high biochemical synergy zones are alternated with low inhibitor concentration zones fig 6 display the re along the mid section of the digester where it is highest 1 57 around the third propeller this is expected since in this region the viscosity is relatively small and the velocity is high fig 5 the re approaches zero before and after the third propeller since the velocity is insignificant in these regions as to radial mixing it is better observed at the third propeller phase iii with an average velocity of 0 045 m s 1 which is larger than that of the first 0 015 m s 1 and second 0 018 m s 1 propellers due to the relatively much lower viscosity fig 7 generally this favors better distribution of substrate and homogenization of temperature and limits short circuiting of untreated waste ghanimeh et al 2013b most importantly radial mixing improves the dispersion of inhibitors and reduces localized high concentrations often considered a major concern in the methanogenic zone and a direct cause of failure ghanimeh et al 2013a 2013b 3 1 2 removal efficiency during phase 1 high removal efficiency was accomplished reaching 94 9 0 9 92 8 1 1 and 93 8 0 9 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 8 c these rates are significantly higher than the ones reported for conventional axially mixed anpfrs sharma et al 2000 investigated the digestion of kitchen waste using an inclined anpfr mixed using propellers continuously placed throughout the shaft and achieved only a removal of 71 and 78 for vs and cod respectively another study was conducted to analyze the performance of an anpfr axially mixed using an auger when feeding corn silage at different olrs veluchamy et al 2019 results showed that removal could reach 62 and 57 when feeding at an olr of 3 5 and 5 g vs l 1 d 1 respectively furthermore lastella et al 2002 performed an extensive study on anpfr mixed axially throughout the reactor while treating fw at a ts content of 10 and concluded a maximum vs and cod removal efficiency of 73 and 77 respectively this superior performance of the locally mixed design compared to that of a continuously mixed design i e propellers placed throughout the longitudinal axis can be attributed to the presence of syntrophic activity in areas of low to no mixing the presence of alternating areas of good and poor mixing next and away from propellers respectively are expected to boost the performance of the system as follows 1 in poor mixing stagnant areas far from propellers syntrophic microorganisms are not disturbed leading to improved interaction between hydrogenotrophs and hydrogen generating bacteria this suggestion is based on reported observations in the literature showing the occurrence of syntrophic biochemical mechanisms narihiro et al 2015 syntrophic pathways consist of sets of reactions whereby the waste of one species of microorganisms is used as substrate by another species in areas of limited or no mixing syntrophic microorganisms would grow naturally in close proximity as a result the transfer of by products including h2 considered a propionate inhibitor becomes easier and faster astals et al 2014 2 in well mixed areas in the proximity of the propellers the homogenous distribution of nutrients and heat coupled with the dilution of inhibitors creates stable conditions for adequate microbial growth ghanimeh et al 2013a lindmark et al 2014b jegede et al 2019 upon interruption of mixing in phase 2 the loss of operational stability was accompanied by a drop of system performance leading to decreased removal rates reaching 83 80 and 81 for vs ts and cod respectively when mixing was reinitiated phase 3 the removal rates increased again and were stabilized to rates close to pre shock conditions in phase 4 fig 8 c the observations further prove the need for and benefits of local mixing 3 1 3 biogas generation during phase 1 biogas yield was 1128 55 ml g vsfed 1 of which 57 5 corresponded to ch4 resulting in an average ch4 yield of 641 26 ml g vsfed 1 fig 8 b this is higher than the range of 250 550 ml g vsfed 1 reported in the literature for ad of fw cuetos et al 2008 wang and zhao 2009 nagao et al 2012 however it is similar to the ch4 yield obtained when co digesting ww and fw using a mesophilic ancstr abou khalil et al 2016a jabagi et al 2016 ghanimeh et al 2018a 2018b 2019 the high ch4 generation can be attributed to the continuous seeding achieved by the addition of raw ww to the feed ghanimeh et al 2018a 2018b 2019 similar findings were reported when adding sludge to fw resulting in higher ch4 generation liu et al 2016 kaur et al 2019 prabhu and mutnuri 2016 in addition the effectiveness of the adopted mixing strategy could also have contributed to the high biogas yield since this strategy allows for distribution of substrate near the propellers coupled with syntrophic microbial activities in the non mixed regions when mixing was stopped phase 2 the biogas yield dropped to 706 ml g vsfed 1 with only 29 ch4 leading to a decrease in average ch4 yield by 75 this further ascertains the inhibitory conditions in various locations presumably in areas of accumulation of substrate i e at the bottom of the digester where sedimentation occurs the high ch4 yield was restored upon re initiation of mixing phase 3 and stabilized at 649 37 ml g vsfed 1 during phase 4 fig 8 b 3 1 4 system stability the stability of the proposed locally mixed digester was assessed vis a vis ammonia inhibition tan and acidity levels ph and vfas as well as buffering capacity alkalinity during phase 1 continuous slow mixing the average vfa concentration was 1351 87 mg l 1 fig 8 a considered satisfactory for ad of fw 1000 to 2000 mg l jayalakshmi et al 2009 kassuwi et al 2012 li et al 2011 the digester s ph was 7 46 0 06 on average considered acceptable as well mao et al 2015 tan concentration was 1085 51 mg l 1 which is lower than reported ammonia inhibition thresholds of 1500 to 9000 mg l 1 el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 sheng et al 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 tan concentration remained under the inhibitory threshold during the entire experiments for all four phases indicating adequate feed composition feeding rate and operating temperature chen et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 during phase 2 no mixing vfa increased drastically reaching up to 17 000 mg l 1 fig 8 a which is considerably higher than the acceptable concentrations of vfa found in the literature chen et al 2008 jayalakshmi et al 2009 li et al 2011 kassuwi et al 2012 this substantial increase in vfa concentration can be attributed to the settlements of solids at the bottom of the digester resulting in high acidity niches and inhibiting the methanogenic activity karim et al 2005b kaparaju et al 2008 ghanimeh et al 2013a as a result the digester s acidity decreased drastically reaching a ph level of 6 5 which is less than the acceptable range reported in the literature 6 8 to 7 4 wang et al 2014 mao et al 2015 mixing was reinitiated in phase 3 to recover the system and prevent the souring of the digester the vfa and ph returned to their initial levels at week 18 end of phase 3 during phase 4 the digester stability was re established thus proving the importance and need for mixing in digesters relying on local mixing similar conclusions were reported for other digester designs including completely mixed reactors karim et al 2005a khalid et al 2011 and conventional pfr lastella et al 2002 veluchamy et al 2019 the buffering capacity of the system is often reported as alkalinity levels in this experiment ta was 4263 406 mg l 1 during phase 1 and increased up to 11 000 mg l 1 during phase 2 such a variation was attributed to an increased microbial generation of alkalinity components in response to the digester undesirable acidic conditions yu et al 2002 microorganisms belonging to the cloacimonetes and the bacteroidetes phyla were reported to be abundant in mesophilic anaerobic digesters when subject to high vfa concentrations chen et al 2021 they are known for their ability to oxidize vfas break down proteins to tan and increase ta chen et al 2021 after recovery phase 3 ta and pa returned to their initial levels and were stabilized during phase 4 also ia pa ratio of intermediate to partial alkalinity considered as a stability indicator had an average of 0 21 0 07 during all mixed phases 1 3 and 4 which is considered satisfactory 0 1 to 0 35 ferrer et al 2010 3 2 experiment 2 defining the loading capacity this experiment aims at determining the loading capacity of the proposed locally mixed digester therefore the loading rate was increased progressively by varying the ts content of the feed 10 15 20 and 22 5 corresponding to olr of 2 8 4 2 6 3 and 7 9 g vs l 1 d 1 respectively while maintaining a constant hrt 28 days the experiment was run for 60 weeks during which four feed mixtures at four fw to ww ratios were successively used table 1 at a ts content of 10 weeks 1 to 12 the system was stable with vfa and tan concentrations of 1110 43 mg l 1 and 766 14 mg l 1 fig 9 a respectively which are considered satisfactory jayalakshmi et al 2009 el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 also the ph remained at neutral levels 7 49 0 04 and ia pa was about 0 27 0 04 lower than the inhibitory range 0 35 ferrer et al 2010 biogas generation was 1085 19 ml g vsfed 1 of which 53 5 1 3 was ch4 fig 9 b in addition solid removal was significant reaching up to 94 1 90 1 and 92 1 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 9 c at week 13 feeding with a ts content of 15 was initiated where the concentrations of vfa and tan slightly increased but remained in the satisfactory range reaching 1230 46 mg l 1 and 1214 78 mg l 1 fig 9 a respectively likewise the ph and ia pa maintained an acceptable level 7 51 0 03 0 22 0 04 there was a slight increase in biogas and ch4 yield reaching a generation of 1163 95 ml g vsfed 1 and 643 38 ml g vsfed 1 respectively fig 9 b similarly solid removal remained significant 93 2 88 1 and 91 2 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 9 c likewise at a feed ts of 20 week 25 the system remained stable in terms of vfa concentration ph and ia pa at values of 1316 33 mg l 1 7 46 0 02 and 0 24 0 03 fig 9 a and 9 b respectively for a period of 3 hrts although the tan concentration reached 1604 60 mg l 1 which falls within the inhibitory range reported in the literature 1500 mg l 1 to 9000 mg l 1 el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 biogas generation was significant reaching about 1024 19 ml g vsfed 1 of which 59 8 1 1 was ch4 fig 9 b also treatment efficiency remained high reaching 92 2 87 1 and 90 2 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 9 c consequently the prevailing relatively high tan level seems to remain below the locally mixed digester s tolerance limit however upon initiating the feeding with a ts content of 22 5 week 38 the system performance started to degrade tan concentration increased gradually and noticeably fig 9 a and inhibitory conditions seemed to prevail as vfa concentration ph and ia pa reached unsatisfactory levels of 11 100 100 mg l 1 6 37 0 21 and 0 84 0 07 respectively fig 9 a and 9 b when tan reached about 2440 36 mg l 1 an abrupt increase in vfa was observed which implies that the deterioration of the microbial balance indicated by vfa accumulation occurs gradually with the increase in tan concentration until reaching a tipping point beyond which an acute loss of stability is observed el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 ghanimeh et al 2018a the tipping point observed in this study was 2440 mg l 1 tan inhibition can be attributed to various factors such as type of feed reactor design feeding rate operating temperature and ph inside the digester el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 in this study tan increased mainly due to the relatively high olr and high ts which exceeded the maximum allowable loading for the studied design leading to tan accumulation in the system and resulting in a low biogas generation rate 883 11 ml g vsfed 1 of which only 28 5 12 2 was ch4 fig 9 b expectedly solid removal also deteriorated reaching 79 6 74 6 and 77 7 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 9 c as a result the feed ts was decreased after 8 weeks of feeding at a ts of 22 5 back to 20 which lead to the recovery of the system 4 conclusions a mesophilic anpfr was designed to provide localized mixing at key locations and was fed with a mixture of fw and ww at an olr of 4 2 g vs l 1 d 1 ts 15 and a hrt of 28 d the locally mixed digester showed stable performance and high efficiency yielding a biogas generation of 1128 55 ml g vsfed 1 of which 68 9 1 3 consists of ch4 however when mixing was halted the digester s performance deteriorated proving the need for mixing the maximum feed ts that maintains an adequate performance of the locally mixed digester was 20 removal rates 92 0 0 5 87 1 0 5 and 90 1 0 5 for vs ts and cod respectively with a ch4 yield of 613 5 ml g vsfed 1 at a ts content of 22 5 ofwsm to ww ratio of 25 the system failed and vfa concentration reached a level as high as 11 000 mg l 1 cfd simulation was used to assess the sedimentation zones before and after methanogenesis radial mixing was the highest in the methanogenesis zone thus favoring the dispersion of inhibitors and enhancing system stability recommendations for future work include simulation of discrete solids sedimentation optimization of the biological system

16642,an innovative localized mixing concept was tested in an anaerobic plug flow reactor anpfr treating food waste fw mixed with municipal wastewater ww the proposed concept consists of placing propellers along the shaft of the anpfr at key points that represent the mid region of each of the anaerobic digestion stages hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis first the need for and efficiency of localized mixing the new concept suggested by the authors were investigated while the main benefit of localized mixing is the reduction of energy demand associated with conventional uniform mixing i e throughout the longitudinal axis the system can also benefit from synergetic reactions in non mixed zones in fact at a total solid ts content of 15 organic loading rate olr of 4 2 g vs l 1 d 1 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 28 days the mixing pattern was sufficient to maintain stable operation with high removal rates up to 96 of solids and high biogas generation 1128 55 ml g vsfed 1 of which 68 9 consisted of ch4 but when mixing was halted the system s performance deteriorated second the loading capacity of the locally mixed anpfr was investigated by subjecting it to different ts content 10 15 20 and 22 5 corresponding to olrs of 2 8 4 2 6 3 and 7 9 g vs l 1 d 1 respectively while operating under the same hrt it was found that the system can adequately sustain a feed with a maximum ts of 20 while achieving removal rates up to 92 for solids and a ch4 yield of 613 ml g vsfed 1 the digester was simulated using computational fluid dynamics the outputs revealed 1 highest radial mixing at the center of the methanogenesis zone where the propeller is located and 2 low longitudinal mixing before and after the propeller of the methanogenesis stage implying the presence of sedimentation zones that was visually verified the former is assumed to favor better dispersion of inhibitors and improved stability while the latter is expected to provide stagnant areas

substantially adopted in developed countries vasco correa et al 2018 can be equally attractive in developing countries where fw commonly constitutes 40 to 60 of municipal solid waste thi et al 2015 ikhlayel 2018 anaerobic plug flow reactors anpfr are known for their added benefits compared to anaerobic completely stirred tank reactors ancstr including 1 lower capital cost 2 lower volatile fatty acids vfa in the effluent 3 more stable performance and 4 higher removal rates sharma et al 2000 lansing et al 2008 mao et al 2015 specifically anpfr can sustain a feed with a higher total solid ts content compared to ancstr leading to loading rates reaching up to 8 5 g vs l 1 d 1 lansing et al 2010 massé et al 2013 mao et al 2015 commonly commercial anpfrs are designed as either continuously mixed throughout the longitudinal direction martin 2005 dvorak 2012 or not mixed at all de laclos et al 1997 jagadish et al 1998 mixing is commonly achieved by internal propellers installed through the longitudinal shaft rasouli et al 2018 generally a significant amount of energy is required to mix the digesters content which is often the highest operational cost component kariyama et al 2018 yet mixing is known to deliver numerous advantages including 1 reduced dead zones 2 dilution of inhibiting by products 3 uniform temperature and 4 distribution of nutrients ghanimeh et al 2013b lindmark et al 2014a 2014b jegede et al 2019 in comparison stagnant conditions allow the development of syntrophic microorganisms with complementary metabolic mechanisms where the waste of one species is used as a substrate by another narihiro et al 2015 paritosh et al 2020 for instance hydrogen h2 known to inhibit propionate degradation at concentrations above 50 mm can be reduced by syntrophic pathways mccarty and smith 1986 at close microbial proximity i e at a distance 10 μm h2 may be transferred from producer to consumer species batstone et al 2004 mixing may interrupt this transfer process by increasing the distance between syntrophic species stroot et al 2001 mcmahon et al 2001 kim et al 2002 leading to vfa namely propionate accumulation suwannoppadol et al 2011 given the importance of the mixing factor it has been addressed from various angles on the one hand high intensity and vigorous continuous mixing have shown negative impacts on microbiological activities vavilin and angelidaki 2005 showed that high intensity mixing inhibits methanogenesis as well as hydrolysis acidogenesis moreover karim et al 2005a 2005b found that very rapid mixing disrupts the flocs structure in completely mixed reactors thereby disturbing the syntrophic relationships between microorganisms similarly stroot et al 2001 and lindmark et al 2014a suggested that vigorous continuous mixing degrades the performance of high solid anaerobic digesters and that minimal mixing was sufficient to distribute the feed adequately and allow syntrophic interactions on the other hand intermittent mixing might be an optimal solution for ideal ad performance since it can create initiation zones where methanogens can grow and thrive and hence resulting in seeding the rest of the reactor vavilin and angelidaki 2005 zhai et al 2018 kress et al 2018 kaparaju et al 2008 lindmark et al 2014a and kariyama et al 2018 showed that intermittent and minimal mixing strategies improve ch4 yield compared to continuous and rigorous mixing furthermore optimized intermittent mixing of ad processes has been reported to reduce the energy demand and maintenance cost compared to the continuous mixing mode lindmark et al 2014a 2014b wiedemann et al 2017 kress et al 2018 kariyama et al 2018 consequently intermittent mixing has been recommended in digesters treating organic waste under mesophilic temperature conditions kariyama et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 chang et al 2019 from a modeling perspective computational fluid dynamics cfd has emerged as a promising tool to study the fluid flow in bioenergy systems terashima et al 2009 wu 2010 2012 2013 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 rasouli et al 2018 mao et al 2019 tobo et al 2019 models and methods have been developed to determine optimum mixing patterns in real scale ancstrs specifically at different solid concentrations terashima et al 2009 wu 2012 cfd has been also used to simulate circular and egg shaped lab scale digesters and estimate velocity fields particle trajectories dead zones and turbulence impacts wu 2010 recently cfd has been used to assess mixing quality in full scale anaerobic digesters dapelo and bridgeman 2018 ghanimeh et al 2020 in comparison with the above this study attempts to reduce energy requirements through incomplete localized mixing reducing the mass of the waste to be mixed decreases the energy needed for mixing yet the challenge remains to prove the stability and treatment efficiency of the locally mixed reactor and define its loading capacity to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first work to test this concept in anpfr the experimental program has two parts 1 the locally mixed anpfr was tested for treatment of fw at ts 15 and its performance was compared to that of a stagnant with no mixing reactor and 2 the feeding rate was gradually increased with ts 10 to 22 5 until failure to determine maximum sustainable load system stability treatment efficiency and methane generation were monitored using key indicators finally the system was simulated using cfd for the purpose of quantifying and numerically validating the observed fluid behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a lab scale anpfr was constructed with a plexiglas cylinder of 40 cm length 8 cm inner diameter and 0 5 cm thickness fig 1 g the two liter anpfr has a working volume of 1 8 l and a biogas headspace of 0 2 l the digester was kept under mesophilic conditions 37 0 5 c in a 60 l plexiglass water bath with an automatic temperature controller a a direct current motor k was connected to the anpfr to rotate the longitudinal shaft and a valve e was placed at the opposite end to withdraw the digestate the system is fed through a valve c the biogas is collected from the top of the digester and sent to a wet tip gas meter f for volume measurement and collected in a 10 l tedlar bag d for daily analysis according to lindmark et al 2014b for a given hrt about 7 5 17 5 and 75 of the treatment time are required for hydrolysis acidogenisis and methanogenesis respectively assuming proportionality between process time and the length traveled by the waste in anpfr for a digester of 40 cm length the following zones were considered applicable 3 cm for hydrolysis 7 cm for acidogenisis and 30 cm for methanogenesis accordingly local mixing was achieved using three rectangular paddles 1 cm width 0 2 cm thickness and 7 5 cm height along the longitudinal axis placed at 1 5 cm 6 5 cm and 25 cm away from the feeding end those locations are assumed to coincide with the middle of each of the digestion stages the shaft was continuously rotated at 25 rpm lindmark et al 2014a 2 2 inoculation waste preparation and feeding during inoculation the digester was filled with anaerobic digestate extracted from a lab scale mesophilic ancstr fw was prepared based on the composition of typical lebanese waste with ts 23 4 and vs 17 8 ghanimeh et al 2018b the waste was shredded and mixed with wastewater ww collected from the on campus ww treatment plant using a homogenizer cole parmer labgen 850 homogenizer to achieve the required ts content table 1 four batches of feed were prepared during the experiment with ts varying between 10 and 22 5 and a fw to ww ratio ranging from 0 75 to 25 the samples were homogenized and stored in 500 ml plastic bottles at 20 c feeding occurred daily including weekends 2 3 experimental procedure the program consisted of two experiments experiment 1 assessing the proposed local mixing design and experiment 2 defining the loading capacity of the locally mixed digester experiment 1 was conducted at a feeding ts of 15 an organic loading rate olr of 4 2 g vs l 1 d 1 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 28 d the experiment was divided into four phases over a total running period of 30 weeks as follows phase 1 during which mixing occurred at 25 rpm phase 2 corresponding to a period of no mixing performance is compared to phase one to investigate the need for mixing phase 3 considered a recovery period during which mixing was resumed to restore adequate performance similar to that in phase 1 phase 4 is a steady state operation with mixing at 25 rpm the system is stabilized and prepared for the next experiment experiment 2 aims to define the loading capacity of the locally mixed anpfr by increasing the ts content of the feed until reaching failure conditions while operating under an hrt of 28 d the ts contents investigated in this study are 10 15 20 and 22 5 corresponding to olrs of 2 8 4 2 6 3 and 7 9 g vs l 1 d 1 respectively every ts level was maintained for at least 12 weeks 3 hrts except at ts 22 5 at which the system experienced instability after eight weeks of operation 2 4 analytical methods physical and chemical parameters were determined every monday including ts and vs using standard methods 2540b and 2540e procedures cod through spectrophotometry applying a modification of standard methods 5220d apha et al 2012 using hach medium range cod kits hach company loveland colorado total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration by spectrophotometry using hach high range ammonia kits hach company loveland colorado partial alkalinity pa total alkalinity ta and vfa by titration ripley et al 1986 removal rates of solids were determined as the difference between influent and effluent concentrations divided by influent concentration the ph was monitored three times a week using a ph probe hach 35641 51 the daily collected biogas was fed to a dual wavelength infrared cell with reference channels gem 5000 monitor keison products uk for analysis specific ch4 yield expressed as the volume of ch4 produced per gram vs fed to the digester was calculated weekly the dynamic viscosity of the fluid entering and leaving the system was measured using a viscometer cole parmer ndj5s rotary viscometer where deemed appropriate the analysis results are reported as average value standard deviation 2 5 cfd simulation a transient three dimensional cfd was performed to simulate the mixing of the anpfr using volume of fluid vof model guerrero et al 2017 with dispersed interface the vof model was combined with the reynolds stress transport model launder et al 1975 eraky et al 2018 to capture the underlying flow turbulence anisotropy of the mixing digestate the 3d geometry of the anpfr was split into two zones rotating zone enclosure that surrounds the propellers and shaft and stationary zone tank as shown in fig 2 the two zones were separated by an interface surface where the coupling between the stationary and rotating zones is solved using multiple reference frame model luo et al 1994 the anpfr geometry was meshed using unstructured tetrahedral mesh with non uniform element size of 1 2 4 mm and a total of 132 500 elements fig 3 the sections of the inlet tank wall and outlets digestate and biogas were modelled as stationary wall with no slip condition the system was modeled as homogeneous newtonian fluid yu et al 2011 rasouli et al 2018 dapelo and bridgeman 2018 considering that experimental viscosities of 0 175 and 0 00183 pa s 1 were observed for the flow entering and leaving the system respectively the bioreactor was modelled as a multiphase flow by dividing the system into four phases with linearly changing viscosities 1 hydrolysis 950 kg m 3 0 167 pa s 1 2 acidogenesis 950 kg m 3 0 143 pa s 1 3 methanogenesis 950 kg m 3 0 067 pa s 1 and 4 biogas headspace the transient simulation was performed using ansys fluent 18 1 commercial code where the pressure velocity coupling is solved using simple scheme and the momentum equation is spatially discretized using the second order upwind scheme different time steps were tested from 0 001 to 0 004 s where 0 004 s was the optimal time step for maintaining the solution convergence and computational cost the simulation was conducted for four complete propeller revolutions 9 6 s computational field variables such as reynolds number re flow field velocity and volume fraction were recorded during the simulation time and processed using cfd post 18 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment 1 assessing the local mixing design 3 1 1 visual observation and simulation output fig 4 a shows the three propellers at key points i mid hydrolysis ii mid acidogenesis and iii mid methanogenesis by visual inspection two deposition areas c were noticed where the suspended solids have settled at the bottom of the anpfr due to the low impact of nearby propellers this is an indicative sign of mixing occurring only at the proximity of the propellers this was further explained by the outcome of the cfd simulation in terms of longitudinal mixing the model output shows the changes in the volume fraction at each mixing location which occurred only at the propellers proximity fig 4 b the areas on both sides of propeller iii seem to be moving slowly without considerable mixing this is further demonstrated in fig 5 which shows the velocity along the mid section of the digester it is clearly seen that the velocity approaches zero before and after the third propeller fig 5 this justifies the sedimentation zones observed on both sides accordingly this study s modeling methodology may be used to modify the design components e g mixing intensity propellers locations and shapes dimensions of digester to increase or decrease the sedimented volume the latter can be correlated with the proportions of stagnant to mixed conditions where high biochemical synergy zones are alternated with low inhibitor concentration zones fig 6 display the re along the mid section of the digester where it is highest 1 57 around the third propeller this is expected since in this region the viscosity is relatively small and the velocity is high fig 5 the re approaches zero before and after the third propeller since the velocity is insignificant in these regions as to radial mixing it is better observed at the third propeller phase iii with an average velocity of 0 045 m s 1 which is larger than that of the first 0 015 m s 1 and second 0 018 m s 1 propellers due to the relatively much lower viscosity fig 7 generally this favors better distribution of substrate and homogenization of temperature and limits short circuiting of untreated waste ghanimeh et al 2013b most importantly radial mixing improves the dispersion of inhibitors and reduces localized high concentrations often considered a major concern in the methanogenic zone and a direct cause of failure ghanimeh et al 2013a 2013b 3 1 2 removal efficiency during phase 1 high removal efficiency was accomplished reaching 94 9 0 9 92 8 1 1 and 93 8 0 9 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 8 c these rates are significantly higher than the ones reported for conventional axially mixed anpfrs sharma et al 2000 investigated the digestion of kitchen waste using an inclined anpfr mixed using propellers continuously placed throughout the shaft and achieved only a removal of 71 and 78 for vs and cod respectively another study was conducted to analyze the performance of an anpfr axially mixed using an auger when feeding corn silage at different olrs veluchamy et al 2019 results showed that removal could reach 62 and 57 when feeding at an olr of 3 5 and 5 g vs l 1 d 1 respectively furthermore lastella et al 2002 performed an extensive study on anpfr mixed axially throughout the reactor while treating fw at a ts content of 10 and concluded a maximum vs and cod removal efficiency of 73 and 77 respectively this superior performance of the locally mixed design compared to that of a continuously mixed design i e propellers placed throughout the longitudinal axis can be attributed to the presence of syntrophic activity in areas of low to no mixing the presence of alternating areas of good and poor mixing next and away from propellers respectively are expected to boost the performance of the system as follows 1 in poor mixing stagnant areas far from propellers syntrophic microorganisms are not disturbed leading to improved interaction between hydrogenotrophs and hydrogen generating bacteria this suggestion is based on reported observations in the literature showing the occurrence of syntrophic biochemical mechanisms narihiro et al 2015 syntrophic pathways consist of sets of reactions whereby the waste of one species of microorganisms is used as substrate by another species in areas of limited or no mixing syntrophic microorganisms would grow naturally in close proximity as a result the transfer of by products including h2 considered a propionate inhibitor becomes easier and faster astals et al 2014 2 in well mixed areas in the proximity of the propellers the homogenous distribution of nutrients and heat coupled with the dilution of inhibitors creates stable conditions for adequate microbial growth ghanimeh et al 2013a lindmark et al 2014b jegede et al 2019 upon interruption of mixing in phase 2 the loss of operational stability was accompanied by a drop of system performance leading to decreased removal rates reaching 83 80 and 81 for vs ts and cod respectively when mixing was reinitiated phase 3 the removal rates increased again and were stabilized to rates close to pre shock conditions in phase 4 fig 8 c the observations further prove the need for and benefits of local mixing 3 1 3 biogas generation during phase 1 biogas yield was 1128 55 ml g vsfed 1 of which 57 5 corresponded to ch4 resulting in an average ch4 yield of 641 26 ml g vsfed 1 fig 8 b this is higher than the range of 250 550 ml g vsfed 1 reported in the literature for ad of fw cuetos et al 2008 wang and zhao 2009 nagao et al 2012 however it is similar to the ch4 yield obtained when co digesting ww and fw using a mesophilic ancstr abou khalil et al 2016a jabagi et al 2016 ghanimeh et al 2018a 2018b 2019 the high ch4 generation can be attributed to the continuous seeding achieved by the addition of raw ww to the feed ghanimeh et al 2018a 2018b 2019 similar findings were reported when adding sludge to fw resulting in higher ch4 generation liu et al 2016 kaur et al 2019 prabhu and mutnuri 2016 in addition the effectiveness of the adopted mixing strategy could also have contributed to the high biogas yield since this strategy allows for distribution of substrate near the propellers coupled with syntrophic microbial activities in the non mixed regions when mixing was stopped phase 2 the biogas yield dropped to 706 ml g vsfed 1 with only 29 ch4 leading to a decrease in average ch4 yield by 75 this further ascertains the inhibitory conditions in various locations presumably in areas of accumulation of substrate i e at the bottom of the digester where sedimentation occurs the high ch4 yield was restored upon re initiation of mixing phase 3 and stabilized at 649 37 ml g vsfed 1 during phase 4 fig 8 b 3 1 4 system stability the stability of the proposed locally mixed digester was assessed vis a vis ammonia inhibition tan and acidity levels ph and vfas as well as buffering capacity alkalinity during phase 1 continuous slow mixing the average vfa concentration was 1351 87 mg l 1 fig 8 a considered satisfactory for ad of fw 1000 to 2000 mg l jayalakshmi et al 2009 kassuwi et al 2012 li et al 2011 the digester s ph was 7 46 0 06 on average considered acceptable as well mao et al 2015 tan concentration was 1085 51 mg l 1 which is lower than reported ammonia inhibition thresholds of 1500 to 9000 mg l 1 el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 sheng et al 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 tan concentration remained under the inhibitory threshold during the entire experiments for all four phases indicating adequate feed composition feeding rate and operating temperature chen et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 during phase 2 no mixing vfa increased drastically reaching up to 17 000 mg l 1 fig 8 a which is considerably higher than the acceptable concentrations of vfa found in the literature chen et al 2008 jayalakshmi et al 2009 li et al 2011 kassuwi et al 2012 this substantial increase in vfa concentration can be attributed to the settlements of solids at the bottom of the digester resulting in high acidity niches and inhibiting the methanogenic activity karim et al 2005b kaparaju et al 2008 ghanimeh et al 2013a as a result the digester s acidity decreased drastically reaching a ph level of 6 5 which is less than the acceptable range reported in the literature 6 8 to 7 4 wang et al 2014 mao et al 2015 mixing was reinitiated in phase 3 to recover the system and prevent the souring of the digester the vfa and ph returned to their initial levels at week 18 end of phase 3 during phase 4 the digester stability was re established thus proving the importance and need for mixing in digesters relying on local mixing similar conclusions were reported for other digester designs including completely mixed reactors karim et al 2005a khalid et al 2011 and conventional pfr lastella et al 2002 veluchamy et al 2019 the buffering capacity of the system is often reported as alkalinity levels in this experiment ta was 4263 406 mg l 1 during phase 1 and increased up to 11 000 mg l 1 during phase 2 such a variation was attributed to an increased microbial generation of alkalinity components in response to the digester undesirable acidic conditions yu et al 2002 microorganisms belonging to the cloacimonetes and the bacteroidetes phyla were reported to be abundant in mesophilic anaerobic digesters when subject to high vfa concentrations chen et al 2021 they are known for their ability to oxidize vfas break down proteins to tan and increase ta chen et al 2021 after recovery phase 3 ta and pa returned to their initial levels and were stabilized during phase 4 also ia pa ratio of intermediate to partial alkalinity considered as a stability indicator had an average of 0 21 0 07 during all mixed phases 1 3 and 4 which is considered satisfactory 0 1 to 0 35 ferrer et al 2010 3 2 experiment 2 defining the loading capacity this experiment aims at determining the loading capacity of the proposed locally mixed digester therefore the loading rate was increased progressively by varying the ts content of the feed 10 15 20 and 22 5 corresponding to olr of 2 8 4 2 6 3 and 7 9 g vs l 1 d 1 respectively while maintaining a constant hrt 28 days the experiment was run for 60 weeks during which four feed mixtures at four fw to ww ratios were successively used table 1 at a ts content of 10 weeks 1 to 12 the system was stable with vfa and tan concentrations of 1110 43 mg l 1 and 766 14 mg l 1 fig 9 a respectively which are considered satisfactory jayalakshmi et al 2009 el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 also the ph remained at neutral levels 7 49 0 04 and ia pa was about 0 27 0 04 lower than the inhibitory range 0 35 ferrer et al 2010 biogas generation was 1085 19 ml g vsfed 1 of which 53 5 1 3 was ch4 fig 9 b in addition solid removal was significant reaching up to 94 1 90 1 and 92 1 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 9 c at week 13 feeding with a ts content of 15 was initiated where the concentrations of vfa and tan slightly increased but remained in the satisfactory range reaching 1230 46 mg l 1 and 1214 78 mg l 1 fig 9 a respectively likewise the ph and ia pa maintained an acceptable level 7 51 0 03 0 22 0 04 there was a slight increase in biogas and ch4 yield reaching a generation of 1163 95 ml g vsfed 1 and 643 38 ml g vsfed 1 respectively fig 9 b similarly solid removal remained significant 93 2 88 1 and 91 2 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 9 c likewise at a feed ts of 20 week 25 the system remained stable in terms of vfa concentration ph and ia pa at values of 1316 33 mg l 1 7 46 0 02 and 0 24 0 03 fig 9 a and 9 b respectively for a period of 3 hrts although the tan concentration reached 1604 60 mg l 1 which falls within the inhibitory range reported in the literature 1500 mg l 1 to 9000 mg l 1 el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 biogas generation was significant reaching about 1024 19 ml g vsfed 1 of which 59 8 1 1 was ch4 fig 9 b also treatment efficiency remained high reaching 92 2 87 1 and 90 2 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 9 c consequently the prevailing relatively high tan level seems to remain below the locally mixed digester s tolerance limit however upon initiating the feeding with a ts content of 22 5 week 38 the system performance started to degrade tan concentration increased gradually and noticeably fig 9 a and inhibitory conditions seemed to prevail as vfa concentration ph and ia pa reached unsatisfactory levels of 11 100 100 mg l 1 6 37 0 21 and 0 84 0 07 respectively fig 9 a and 9 b when tan reached about 2440 36 mg l 1 an abrupt increase in vfa was observed which implies that the deterioration of the microbial balance indicated by vfa accumulation occurs gradually with the increase in tan concentration until reaching a tipping point beyond which an acute loss of stability is observed el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 ghanimeh et al 2018a the tipping point observed in this study was 2440 mg l 1 tan inhibition can be attributed to various factors such as type of feed reactor design feeding rate operating temperature and ph inside the digester el hadj et al 2009 yenigün and demirel 2013 rajagopal et al 2013 in this study tan increased mainly due to the relatively high olr and high ts which exceeded the maximum allowable loading for the studied design leading to tan accumulation in the system and resulting in a low biogas generation rate 883 11 ml g vsfed 1 of which only 28 5 12 2 was ch4 fig 9 b expectedly solid removal also deteriorated reaching 79 6 74 6 and 77 7 for vs ts and cod respectively fig 9 c as a result the feed ts was decreased after 8 weeks of feeding at a ts of 22 5 back to 20 which lead to the recovery of the system 4 conclusions a mesophilic anpfr was designed to provide localized mixing at key locations and was fed with a mixture of fw and ww at an olr of 4 2 g vs l 1 d 1 ts 15 and a hrt of 28 d the locally mixed digester showed stable performance and high efficiency yielding a biogas generation of 1128 55 ml g vsfed 1 of which 68 9 1 3 consists of ch4 however when mixing was halted the digester s performance deteriorated proving the need for mixing the maximum feed ts that maintains an adequate performance of the locally mixed digester was 20 removal rates 92 0 0 5 87 1 0 5 and 90 1 0 5 for vs ts and cod respectively with a ch4 yield of 613 5 ml g vsfed 1 at a ts content of 22 5 ofwsm to ww ratio of 25 the system failed and vfa concentration reached a level as high as 11 000 mg l 1 cfd simulation was used to assess the sedimentation zones before and after methanogenesis radial mixing was the highest in the methanogenesis zone thus favoring the dispersion of inhibitors and enhancing system stability recommendations for future work include simulation of discrete solids sedimentation optimization of the biological system through a more accurate representation of the ad phases along the length of the digester through a genomic analysis of the digester content and cost to benefit analysis including energy saving of the

16643,small low income and rural communities across the united states are disproportionately exposed to arsenic contaminated drinking water because existing treatment solutions are too expensive and difficult to operate this paper describes efforts to overcome some barriers and limitations of conventional iron electrocoagulation fe ec to enable its use in the rural californian u s context barriers and limitations of fe ec s application in rural california considered in this work include 1 frequent labor intensive electrode cleaning is required to overcome rust accumulation 2 electrolysis durations are long reducing throughput for a given system size and 3 waste needs compliance with california standards we report results from an investigation for overcoming these limitations via a field trial on a farm in allensworth a small low income rural community in california our strategies to overcome each of the above barriers and limitations are respectively 1 operating the fe ec reactor at high current density to result in sustained fe production 2 operating at high charge dosage rate with external h2o2 and 3 characterization of the arsenic laden waste and are discussed further in the paper main findings are 1 fe ec removed arsenic consistently below the federal and state standard of 10 µg l 2 high current density failed to sustain fe production whereas low current density did not 3 electrolysis time decreased from 1 hour to 2 min with h2o2 dosing of 5 mg l at higher charge dosage rates 4 dilution of as sludge is required to comply with state s non hazardous waste status and 5 discrepancies were observed between lab and field results in using current density to overcome labor intensive electrode cleanings finally implications of overcoming limitations to scale up of fe ec in relevant california communities are discussed keywords drinking water treatment low income communities iron electrocoagulation arsenic california 1 introduction and background arsenic occurs naturally in groundwaters around the world including in many rural small and low income community water systems in the united states welch et al 2000 state water resources control board 2015 the environmental protection agency epa maximum contaminant limit mcl for arsenic in drinking water is set at 10 µg l united states environmental protection agency 2021 chronic consumption of drinking water exceeding this mcl can lead to adverse health effects including internal cancers skin lesions neuropathy and developmental impacts world health organization 2017 effective solutions on the market for treating arsenic contaminated water for potable use include coagulation filtration adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis and iron removal i e oxidation filtration wang et al 2011 however most technologies are considered beyond the technical managerial financial capacity of small rural california communities facing arsenic contaminated drinking water state water resources control board 2015 as a result socioeconomically disadvantaged and minoritized populations in california are disproportionately exposed to arsenic contaminated drinking water balazs et al 2012 iron electrocoagulation fe ec is a promising arsenic removal technology and has been investigated widely both in laboratory and field settings to effectively remove arsenic to less than the epa mcl of 10 µg l consistently fe ec removes arsenic by capturing it on insoluble fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitates produced in the water through the electrically driven dissolution of iron electrodes ratna kumar et al 2004 lakshmanan et al 2010 wan et al 2011 amrose et al 2013 van genuchten et al 2014b delaire et al 2017 amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 bandaru et al 2020a specifically fe ii ions migrate from the anode into bulk and undergo further oxidation by dissolved oxygen to form fe iii oxyhydr oxide lakshmanan et al 2010 reactive fenton type intermediates possibly fe iv species are produced during the oxidation of fe ii by dissolved oxygen at circum netural ph hug and leupin 2003 these reactive intermediates selectively oxidize as iii to as v which adsorbs rapidly onto fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitates li et al 2012 delaire et al 2017 the dissolution of iron electrodes in water is called for brevity iron dosing amrose et al 2014 after iron dosing and adsorption of arsenic on the resulting fe iii oxyhydr oxides the arsenic bearing sludge mostly comprising fe iii precipitates is separated from the water and arsenic safe water is produced amrose et al 2014 fe ec s modular design minimal supply chain i e fe plates and alum requiring low skilled operators e g high school degree or less has enabled it to be an effective technology to address arsenic contaminated drinking water in resource poor decentralized communities globally recently hernandez et al 2019 reported successful demonstration of a pilot scale fe ec plant 10 000 l day capacity at a resource poor decentralized rural community near kolkata india this plant has been delivering arsenic safe water to the community at a locally affordable price of less than 1 u s cent per liter hernandez et al 2019 while fe ec has been demonstrated successfully in india the implementation of fe ec in the united states is poorly understood we conducted this study as a hypothesis generating not as a hypothesis testing effort although it occasionally has some aspects of the latter we explored and report here limitations to be overcome for implementing fe ec as a scalable affordable and distributed solution in resource constrained regions in rural u s communities 2 approach in this study we hypothesized three major barriers and limitations of fe ec as implemented in india these need addressing before fe ec can be translated into a locally affordable community scale treatment technology for low income regions in the united states we describe below the approaches taken to overcome these three barriers and limitations herein barriers and limitations are referred to as limitations 2 1 frequent electrode cleaning is required the steady accumulation of layers of rust on the iron electrodes leads to the steady deterioration of the faradaic efficiency ratio between iron measured in the bulk after electrolysis and iron expected theoretically in fe ec systems amrose et al 2014 van genuchten et al 2016 müller et al 2019 this decline in faradaic efficiency is problematic because if iron is not released in sufficient amounts in the bulk water arsenic might not be removed from the water to below its regulated limit 10 µg l as intended in previous work this issue was resolved by having operators lightly brush the electrode surfaces daily to abrasively remove the top layer of deposited iron rust amrose et al 2014 however this approach is infeasible for the u s context because of the much higher labor rates for operators 15 85 hr in the united states colby et al 2010 vs 1 hr at the fe ec plant in india gadgil 2018 we investigated automated systems for brushing electrode plates for u s applications however our multiple attempts at such design led to unattractively large increases in capital costs by more than 50 in continuation of our efforts to overcome this problem we studied varying an operating parameter current density current per unit submerged electrode area ma cm2 over an extended period at 100 liter l scale operated as a batch process in the field charge dosage rate c l min is also a relevant variable when considering the operation of fe ec systems amrose et al 2013 charge dosage rate can be correlated to current density by changing the current and keeping the electrode surface area the same charge dosage rate can be uncorrelated with current density by keeping the current the same while changing the electrode surface area recent observations by müller et al 2019 suggested that experimenting with a high charge dosage rate and resultingly high current density had the potential to address the decline in faradaic efficiency and growth of surface layer formation müller et al 2019 using synthetic bangladesh groundwater sbgw defined in the manuscript and soft groundwater sbgw electrolyte without ca and mg müller et al 2019 observed that low charge dosage rate and therefore low current density 1 ma cm2 resulted in a steadily decreasing faradaic efficiency of total iron over time 60 after 2 months whereas higher charge dosage rate and therefore high current density 1 ma cm2 resulted in relative high faradaic efficiency 85 over 2 months of operation müller et al 2019 speculated that at high current densities high positive charge of the anode and large flux of positively charged fe2 ions at the anode electrolyte interface facilitated rapid migration and diffusion of fe2 ions into the bulk solution instead of accumulating at the anode surface the soft sbgw electrolyte used in müller et al 2019 is very similar to typical groundwater composition found in california central valley e g low ca and mg concentrations barazesh et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that operating fe ec at high current density 1 ma cm2 and low charge dosage rate 5 c l min would achieve high faradaic efficiency of total iron in the bulk solution and hence consistent arsenic removal over extended periods of operation additionally we conducted several short term experiments in the lab at beaker scale that suggested support for this hypothesis before we conducted the longer term experiments with 100 l reactors in the field in this study we investigated if high current density could offer protection against the decline in faradaic efficiency on a larger scale fe ec system 100 l reactor treating real arsenic contaminated groundwater in the field conditions we operated two reactors in the field one at high current density and one at low current density as control at similar operating conditions to those reported in müller et al 2019 2 2 electrolysis times are long in conventional fe ec in contrast to india where the scale of the fe ec technology was designed to deliver arsenic safe water to meet only the drinking water needs united states regulations require that all the water delivered to the household by public water systems must be of adequate quality for human consumption regardless of its end use united states congress 2019 this requirement increases the volume of water that must be treated and delivered per person per day from about 2 gallons approximately 7 6 liters in the indian context to about 100 gallons approximately 378 5 liters in the united states context however fe ec treatment cannot be sped up by simply rapidly releasing a larger amount of iron in the water previous work has demonstrated that increasing the rate of iron released in the water by increasing the charge dosage rate cdr c l min decreased the efficiency of arsenic removal because of the competition between fe ii and as iii for the reactive intermediates amrose et al 2013 li et al 2012 delaire et al 2017 thus for a given iron dose low cdrs and therefore long electrolysis times were found important to achieve complete oxidation of fe ii and high efficiency of arsenic removal dubrawski et al 2015 bandaru et al 2020b however the long electrolysis times on the order of hours increases the operating costs and the physical footprint of the fe ec system when delivering increased volumes of water making the fe ec system unattractive and unaffordable for rural communities in california operating fe ec at high cdrs 10 c l min decreases the electrolysis times to the order of minutes and can achieve the high flow rates desired for the u s context at low operating costs however the slow kinetics of oxygen dissolution in water requires fe ec to operate at low cdrs to achieve complete fe ii oxidation and hence efficient arsenic removal for a given charge dose c l bandaru et al 2020b to overcome this limitation we studied use of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as an external oxidant to the fe ec system in the field the literature has documented the use of h2o2 as an external oxidant at beaker scale using fe salts hug and leupin 2003 use of h2o2 as an external oxidant can enhance the kinetics of fe ii oxidation 10 000 times compared to kinetics of oxidation with dissolved oxygen thus facilitating efficient arsenic removal at a high charge dosage rate hug and leupin 2003 king and farlow 2000 rapid kinetics between h2o2 and fe ii to achieve efficient arsenic removal at very high charge dosage rates 1200 c l min or short electrolysis times seconds has been reported recently with in situ h2o2 generation by an air diffusion cathode bandaru et al 2020b the air cathode assisted fe ec is a promising alternative to traditional fe ec systems to deliver high flow rates at low operating costs however the long term performance of the air cathode in the air cathode assisted fe ec needs further evaluation and could increase the operating costs e g if the cathode fouled irreversibly to our knowledge the use of h2o2 as an external oxidant in the fe ec system for arsenic removal remains unexplored in the literature and the field demonstration of this approach is missing altogether in this space we explored the efficacy of fe ec with externally added h2o2 as an affordable solution to address arsenic contamination in rural regions in the united states specifically experiments under laboratory conditions necessarily rely on synthetic groundwater matrices only field conditions require the technology to have full exposure to exactly all constituents of the groundwater even those which we might not have thought relevant for the laboratory synthetic groundwater matrix these might include specific kinds of natural organic matter conditions of do complexation of the contaminant with suspended clay particles other organic and biological contaminants bacteria and algae that might have been missed in the lab 2 3 waste needs characterization as per california state standards in the context of this work we defined waste characterization as one of the necessary pieces of knowledge needed for ensuring ability to use the fe ec system this characterization will determine if the arsenic laden waste generated from the fe ec system can pass the two specific tests defined in section to receive regulatory approval for practical implementation of the technology lack of knowledge about the sludge is a barrier to use of the technology it is not a limitation of the technology fe ec produces an arsenic laden iron sludge as a waste by product that must be managed appropriately amrose et al 2014 two measurements total threshold limit concentration ttlc and soluble threshold limit concentration stlc are required per californian regulations to determine the nature of the waste e g hazardous non hazardous and resulting waste management practices needed for scale up e g landfill disposal california code of regulations 2021 ttlc measures the solubilized extractable and non extractable concentrations i e total arsenic and stlc measures the solubilized and extractable concentrations the ttlc standard for arsenic is 500 mg kg and the stlc standard for arsenic is 5 mg l california code of regulations 2021 until now fe ec sludge produced from arsenic removal process had not been characterized per either standard to overcome this knowledge gap ttlc and stlc values of sludge generated in the field were measured in a third party california water boards certified lab enthalpy analytical at berkeley california 3 materials and methods we conducted month long field testing of a 100 l fe ec system in batch mode on a private farm impacted by arsenic contaminated groundwater in allensworth california allensworth is a small low income rural community in california with a history of struggling with arsenic contaminated drinking water state water resources control board 2013 the groundwater at the farm had 153 29 1 μg l of arsenic nearly 15 times the epa maximum contaminant level of 10 μg l for arsenic in the drinking water most california wells with arsenic contamination have concentrations that are much lower 90 µg l state water resources control board 2021 the groundwater is pumped directly into the reactors without any pretreatment to understand fe ec performance at removing arsenic under realistic operating conditions we operated two fe ec reactors 100 l in the field in batch mode one at high current density and one at low current density as control at similar operating conditions to those reported in müller et al 2019 the location thus allowed testing fe ec s performance in a groundwater condition in the context of rural california 3 1 chemical analysis and other measurements potassium and sodium concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms epa method 6020 total iron silica phosphorus magnesium and calcium were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes total arsenic was measured using either icp ms or icp oes depending on availability of the instruments to the researchers icp ms icp oes and ion chromatography samples were acidified prior to measurement by adding 1 ml of 1 1 m hcl to a 5 ml sample arsenic samples were filtered with a 0 45 µm filter prior to acidification chloride sulfate and nitrate were measured by ion chromatography epa method 300 0 alkalinity was

precision 1687b 1688b 9115 were used to supply desired current for electrolysis power supplies were operated in constant current mode at the desired current and the resulting voltage was recorded in the field near the start and end of electrolysis interface potentials near the reactor electrodes were measured in the field using an ag agcl 3m nacl reference electrode basi by placing it very close 0 2 cm to 0 5 cm to the iron electrodes the potential difference between the reference electrodes and the iron electrode was measured with a multimeter fluke 87v and this value was reported as an

experiments beaker scale electrolyte volume 0 2 l fe ec experiments were conducted in the lab at low 0 5 ma cm2 and high current density 10 ma cm2 using the groundwater collected from the field site the main objective of these short term experiments 16 batches was to investigate the hypothesis that high faradaic efficiency 85 of total iron can be achieved when fe ec operated at high current density 1 ma cm2 and low charge dosage rate 5 c l min over long periods of operation the charge dosage rate was kept constant at 3 1 c l min at both current densities and the electrolyte was stirred continuously using a magnetic stir bar after delivering the desired dose of 200 300 c l samples for total iron were collected and acidified immediately with 1 1 m hcl for icp oes analysis electrodes were pulled out of the reactor gently and iron dosed groundwater was replaced with new groundwater in the beaker every day up to three experiments were performed at each current density and a total of 16 experiments were completed in 2 weeks at these operating conditions the electrodes were left to dry overnight and were not cleaned in between the experiments electrodes were not cleaned between batches batches 1 6 were conducted at approximately 196 c l and batches 7 16 were conducted at approximately 300 c l the operating parameters of these experiments were summarized in si table s1 3 3 reactors and processes pilot scale experiments were conducted to understand the performance of fe ec at treating arsenic contaminated groundwater over a long period of time month the objective of these experiments was similar to the batch experiments described in section 3 2 specifically the purpose was to understand if high faradaic efficiency of total iron can be achieved in a scaled up fe ec system 100 l reactor volume operating at high current density 10 ma cm2 and low charge dosage rate 3 5 c l min over long term operation in the field these experiments were expected to address the frequent electrode cleaning limitation described in section 2 1 two fe ec reactors electrolyte volume 100 l were constructed at the university of california berkeley and transported to the field site in allensworth ca these reactors were designed to operate at low current density and high current density by changing the electrode surface area and therefore number of electrodes while keeping the reactor volume and charge dosage rate the same herein we refer to these reactors as low and high current density reactors the change in shape of the fe ec reactors rectangular for low current density reactor and circular for high current density reactor do not influence the mixing conditions or the arsenic removal chemistry because electrolyte mixing is achieved by continuously recirculating the electrolyte using a submersible pump during the electrolysis similar mixing configuration has been implemented in the published work on fe ec systems in the field amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 the reactors had different number of plates 12 vs 2 to accommodate the low and high current densities while supplying the same current to each of the two reactors thus two designs accommodated the difference in electrode surface areas as shown in fig 1 note that since both designs held the same water volume and deployed the same current they both delivered identical charge dosage rate but with different current densities on their electrode surfaces on the low current density reactor each of the electrode plates was labeled 1 through 12 and the face of each plate was labeled either f for front or b for back the inter electrode distance was 2 cm during electrolysis water was aerated using a pipe with holes to jet the water downward through the air water was recirculated using a submersible pump 124 watts through the reactor to replenish dissolved oxygen and ensure mixing when used h2o2 was added to the solution right above the submersible pump in the reactors fig 1a submersible pump to ensure uniform distribution of h2o2 throughout the reactor by recirculation after electrolysis water with iron oxide particles was fed to a settling tank settling process will be described later industrial grade non ferric alum al2 so4 3 18 h2o was added to aid in the settling process alum stock solution was made to the concentration of 5000 mg l as al an alum dose of 2 5 to 7 5 mg l as al was investigated based on the published literature during the initial testing data not shown for brevity we found that the alum dose of 7 5 mg l as al resulted in lowest turbidity after 1 minute rapid mixing 600 800 rpm 20 minute slow mixing 20 40 rpm and 2 hours of settling the alum dose and parameters for rapid and slow mixing were selected based on the published literature amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 3 4 field operation the reactors were each operated typically one to two times per day for five days per week for four weeks in june 2019 table 1 presents the operating conditions for this part of the field trial the dose and charge dosage rate were target values the current was measured the current density was calculated batches 1 2 were test runs used to ensure the basic system components e g pumps power supplies were operating as designed batches 3 5 were designed to determine the minimum dose of iron required to remove arsenic to less than 10 µg l this was achieved by measuring arsenic removal in the field over a wide range of doses 0 400 c l 0 c l referring to raw water without treatment or particle separation data at 0 50 100 c l were duplicate measurements and everything else was triplicated batches 6 37 were operated at the above determined minimum dose to examine the long term performance of the fe ec system with respect to arsenic removal faradaic efficiency of total iron and energy consumption h2o2 experiments were conducted using the field trial setup and low current density reactor in july 2019 and explored the influence of h2o2 concentration and charge dosage rate on arsenic removal performance new electrode plates were used in the low current density reactor for h2o2 experiments table 2 presents the operating conditions for this part of the field trial the dosage rate in the july field experiments was selected to be nearly an order of magnitude higher than the dosage rate in the june field experiments to investigate arsenic removal with a shorter electrolysis time raw water samples were collected once per day from the groundwater source water pumped from wells entered a tank where it was pumped out into a hose that entered either reactor before conducting experiments each day we let the water leaving the tank flush for 5 minutes pre and post electrolysis samples were collected from the electrolysis tanks at the end of each experiment samples were collected while the recirculation pump was running to prevent any settling of the suspension leading to non uniform concentrations of total iron in the solution the solution ph do and conductivity were measured in one set of samples right after the collection samples for total concentrations of the solution species were acidified immediately with 1 1 m hcl samples for dissolved concentrations of the species were filtered using 0 45 µm nylon syringe filters and the filtrate was acidified immediately with 1 1 m hcl we filtered the samples to understand the degree of arsenic removal possible if the particle separation was fully effective it was important to separate the arsenic removal results from those of the particle separation approaches tested similarly post settling samples and post filtration samples for the total concentrations of solution species and dissolved concentrations of the solution species were collected from the settling tank and at the outlet hose when half the settling tank was drained particle separation approaches investigated in this study are presented in the supporting information section s2 we did not explore particle separation exhaustively to include this section in the main manuscript hence these findings are presented in si so that other researchers may find them useful in their future work 3 5 characterizing sludge wet sludge collected from the field was dried in a lab oven at approximately 75 c until water evaporated after the field trial was complete the drying time was not accurately recorded but it was around a few 3 4 days stlc and ttlc measurements of the dried sludge were conducted by a third party california water boards certified lab enthalpy analytical at berkeley california ttlc was done using the method epa 6020 icp ms stlc was done using wet epa 6010b 4 results and discussion 4 1 raw water composition and determining minimum dose 4 1 1 raw water composition conductivity varied greatly over the duration of the field trial as shown in si figure s1 and indicated by the large standard deviation in table 3 broadly the water conductivity was high 4585 µs cm 790 µs cm in the first quarter and last quarter portions of the field trial batches 1 9 and 27 37 and lower 441 9 µs cm 209 9 µs cm in batches 10 26 as a result in several figures we have demarcated these distinct conductivity regimes with vertical lines table 3 presents the raw water composition separated into low and high conductivity periods table s2 presents the average and standard deviation of the raw water composition throughout the duration of the field trial we do not know the cause of the conductivity changes however we suspect that the variability of pumping on the farm might be a factor the upper limit allowed in california for chloride and sulfate is 500 mg l state water resources control board 2018 on average the chloride and sulfate concentration in the raw water is much higher and thus would need to be removed in addition to arsenic to provide this water for drinking purposes toc was not detected in any sample measured 4 1 2 experiments to determine minimum dose fig 2 presents the average arsenic concentration after electrolysis during batches 3 5 at low current density and high current density operation dissolved arsenic in the filtered samples decreased from an initial concentration of 185 µg l to a concentration of 0 2 µg l as charge dosage increased from 0 to 400 c l dissolved arsenic in the filtered samples decreased to below 10 µg l at charge dose of 100 c l or greater the arsenic removal was similar across the low and high current density reactors which were supplied with the same current 5 8 a had the same volume 100l and therefore the same dosage rates this is consistent with the earlier reported finding that arsenic removal is more strongly influenced by charge dosage rate than the current density e g amrose et al 2013 based on these findings a charge dose of 150 c l was selected for the long term performance experiments as a moderately conservative dose to consistently yield concentrations below 10 µg l 4 2 addressing limitation 1 frequent electrode cleaning is required 4 2 1 long term arsenic removal fig 3 shows the arsenic concentration in the filtered sample all samples shown were collected after receiving a dose of 150 c l and are from batches 3 37 excluding 11 13 all sample measurements demonstrate that fe ec consistently removed arsenic to below 10 µg l from the average initial concentration of 153 29 1 µg l the average arsenic levels in the samples from the low and high current density reactors were similar at 1 9 2 1 µg l and 1 9 2 0 µg l respectively changes in conductivity of raw water the electrolyte had no notable impact on arsenic removal the electrolyte composition can influence the size and structure of the particles formed in fe ec van genuchten et al 2014a for example divalent cations ca2 and mg2 aid in the aggregation of fe iii oxyhyr oxides increase the sites available for attachment of as v to the precipitates and increase the size of the particles generated during electrolysis the average concentrations of ca and mg in the groundwater decreased from 26 9 4 8 mg l and 24 2 4 6 mg l respectively during the high conductivity period to 2 7 1 6 mg l and 1 5 1 6 mg l respectively in the low conductivity period as a result when groundwater conductivity was 1000 µs cm or low ionic strength the 0 45 µm filter failed to remove all of the fe iii oxyhydr oxide particles which resulted in high arsenic concentrations in the post electrolysis filtered and acid digested samples thus arsenic results do not include samples for batches 11 13 after batch 13 when this was realized instead of collecting the sample after electrolysis we collected samples after the particle separation step in which alum was added alum increased the particle size and allowed for adequate removal of solids by filtration using the 0 45 µm filter we thereafter obtained correct measurements of the arsenic remaining in solution in the treated water samples we still do not fully understand the large variance in the measured arsenic values in post treatment water all below 10 µg l but with a large scatter possibly this has to do with the particle separation which could impact the amount of iron oxides and arsenic going through the 0 45 micron filter into the samples measured for arsenic this aspect deserves future exploration 4 2 2 faradaic efficiency of total iron fig 4 a presents the faradaic efficiency of total iron in the beaker scale experiments see müller et al 2019 for faradaic efficiency calculations in the low current density reactor the faradaic efficiency decreased from about 0 8 to about 0 6 during 16 batch experiments whereas in the high current density reactor the faradaic efficiency remained high 85 over 16 batch experiments the results were consistent with prior reported findings in previous field work the faradaic efficiency steadily declined over time in low current density operation amrose et al 2014 in previous lab work the faradaic efficiency steadily declined over time in low current density operation and remained relatively high and constant over time in high current density operation müller et al 2019 however for experiments conducted in the field using 100 l reactors unexpected results for faradaic efficiency were observed fig 4b presents the faradaic efficiency for the low and high current density reactors for the field trial duration batches 3 37 in the field results from the 100 l low current density reactor the faradaic efficiency remained steady at an average value of 86 3 8 over 37 batch experiments however in the high current density reactor the faradaic efficiency steadily decreased from 109 in b6 to 50 in b37 greater than 100 efficiency could be attributed to nonuniform mixing post electrolysis the color of the solution in the high current density reactor steadily became a lighter orange color as the field trial progressed from b6 to b37 consistent with the progressively lower fe concentrations analytically measured in the solution as the trial progressed si figure s2 this finding is in contrast with previously published fe ec literature amrose et al 2014 müller et al 2019 despite having similar operating variables see table 1 these results demonstrate that operating fe ec at high current density and low charge dosage rate was not beneficial to achieve sustained high faradaic efficiency over long periods of operation in the following paragraphs we discuss various hypotheses and mechanisms to elucidate our findings to help understand the sustained faradaic efficiency in the low current density reactor we presented indirect measurements such as interface potentials difference in the weight of the electrodes and digital images of the electrodes the interface potential measurements remained constant for a given conductivity period over the duration of the field trial si figure s3 which suggest minimal surface layer resistive growth on the electrodes this hypothesis is further supported by the difference between initial and final weights of the anode plates 1 1 g plate or 0 17 of plate weight see si table s3 which presents the change in mass of the electrodes before and after the field trial in the low current density reactor one possible hypothesis is that the low concentrations of strongly adsorbing phosphate ions in the groundwater throughout the field trial non detect 0 1 mg l could have prevented the growth of surface layers on the electrodes in low current density reactor van genuchten et al 2014a another hypothesis is the presence of high levels of dissolved oxygen post electrolysis 7 4 0 3 mg l which could have prevented the formation of a magnetite surface layer as seen in other fe ec systems huang and zhang 2005 van genuchten et al 2016 the interface potential measurements could not be taken in the high current density reactor due to the reactor design which had a pipe and side supports see items 2 and 3 in si figure 11 that prohibited putting anything between the iron plates the decrease in faradaic efficiency in the high current density reactor could be due to the non uniform dissolution of the fe anode see fig 5 resulting in localized high current density regions to favor other oxidation reactions one possible mechanism could be due to excessive chloride concentration in the groundwater at our field location the chloride concentration ranged from 184 mg l 5 mm as cl to 1222 mg l 34 mm as cl therefore at increasing high current densities with time the oxidation of cl to cl2 could be predominant anodic reaction over fe 0 to fe2 oxidation wei et al 2012 brillas and martínez huitle 2015 qian et al 2019 however more work is needed to fully elucidate the mechanism and explore the relationship between surface layer formation water composition and operating parameters to further provide evidence related to the structural integrity and surface layer formation in both high and low current density systems we provide photographs of electrodes in fig 5 for the low current density system there were 6 cathodes and 6 anodes and we selected one representative image from each for the table there are textural differences between the anodes in the high and low current density systems in the high current density system the anode has a nonuniform texture which could be due to nonuniform anodic dissolution of the iron electrode whereas in the low current density system the anode has a more uniform texture it is also clear that on both cathodes there is significant light yellow white surface layer likely due to calcite precipitation favored by the higher ph at the cathode it is important to note on the high current density anode there is a portion on the bottom that is fully consumed by electrolysis this was expected as anodes in the system are consumables and the high current density system had higher cumulative coulombs consumed per electrode surface area we present faradaic efficiency versus cumulative coulombs over electrode surface area in si figures s4 and s5 to illustrate the difference in coulombs consumed per electrode surface area in each system these figures demonstrate the faradaic efficiency as the electrode becomes increasingly consumed in short term beaker scale experiments si figure s4 the faradaic efficiency of total iron decreased with cumulative coulombs per surface area which suggests the surface layer growth on the anode surface at low current density in contrast the faradaic efficiency of total iron remained constant with cumulative coulombs per surface area likely due to less accumulation of surface layers on the anode surface however contrasting results are observed in the field scale fe ec system at low and high current densities over long term operation figure s5 in this section we briefly discussed the possible causes for this contrasting behavior of the fe ec system in the field 4 2 3 energy intensity and coulombic efficiency of arsenic removal energy intensity of arsenic removal defined as mwh l µg arsenic removed l for the high and low current density reactors was calculated to understand the energetic requirements per unit of arsenic removed si figure s6 the energy intensity ranged from 1 5 to 13 6 mwh l µg arsenic removed l in high current density reactor which was an order of magnitude higher than the low current density reactor which ranged from 0 2 to 1 2 mwh l µg arsenic removed l the order of magnitude increase in energy intensity relative to low current density reactor can be attributed to high operating voltages greater than 30 v in the high current density reactor current was held constant and arsenic removal remained stable whereas voltage changed throughout the trial the estimated coulombic efficiency of arsenic removal coulombs of charge dosed μg as removed was similar and consistent across both reactors which suggests that current density did not influence the arsenic removal in fe ec si figure s7 this is consistent with the reported findings that the charge dosage rate strongly influences the arsenic removal in the fe ec system amrose et al 2013 4 3 addressing limitation 2 electrolysis times are long in conventional fe ec fig 6 presents the arsenic concentration after electrolysis for varying h2o2 concentrations 0 5 and 26 mg l h2o2 and charge doses 50 100 and 150 c l at a high dosage rate of 30 c l min at 0 mg l h2o2 where dissolved oxygen is the primary oxidant a charge dose of 150 c l was needed to remove arsenic to below the epa mcl the arsenic removal at 150 c l at high cdr is comparable to the low cdr experiments at low and high current density see fig 3 at 5 mg l h2o2 and 26 mg l h2o2 a charge dose of only 50 c l was needed to remove arsenic to below the epa mcl the time saved in electrolysis when operating at a higher dosage rate an operating mode enabled by h2o2 use was on the order of hours under typical operation of fe ec that requires a low dosage rate amrose et al 2013 electrolysis took place over hours whereas here substantially shorter electrolysis times 1 7 mins were sufficient to remove arsenic to levels below the mcl our results suggest that h2o2 combined with a high charge dosage rate rendered fe ec a high throughput system while maintaining excellent arsenic removal performance iron concentration faradaic efficiency and raw water composition of these experiments are provided in si figure s8 si figure s9 and si table s4 respectively faradaic efficiency for these experiments was between 78 92 water quality varied throughout the experiment the conductivity on average was 4630 µs cm with a standard deviation of 2460 µs cm the energy intensity of arsenic removal defined earlier was calculated for a traditional fe ec operation at low charge dosage rates si figure s6 and b novel fe ec operation with h2o2 injection at high charge dosage rates si figure s10 fe ec operation for removing arsenic with h2o2 injection and high charge dosage rates was about as energy intensive as the traditional operation of fe ec at low current density 0 2 mwh l µg arsenic removed l for both however the h2o2 addition allowed much shorter more than 40x shorter electrolysis duration than with traditional fe ec this translates to high throughput of 3600 lph when h2o2 injection was deployed in contrast to 84 lph with traditional fe ec low current density reactor 4 4 overcoming limitation 3 waste needs characterization as per california standards solid waste disposal in california requires the waste to pass two different tests ttlc and stlc these tests were conducted on dried sludge at a third party commercial laboratory three samples of dried sludge were analyzed the average results for arsenic were as follows for ttlc 897 mg arsenic kg solid waste and for stlc 3 6 mg arsenic liter the stlc result met the standard for arsenic allowable maximum is 5 mg l the ttlc result was above the standard allowable maximum is 500 mg kg which indicates that the resulting dry sludge contained higher than allowable concentration of arsenic immobilizing the solid waste e g by mixing with cement that later hardens into concrete would be an option to lower the ttlc result to below maximum allowable limit and certify the final product as non hazardous waste roy et al 2019 an alternative solution would be to increase the iron dose decreasing the mass of arsenic per mass of waste 4 5 implications of limitations explored for scale up of fe ec in california finally it is relevant to discuss our results in the context of a future scaled up fe ec systems implemented for arsenic removal in california first while low current density operated under low charge dosage rates was shown to be the best option to maintain faradaic efficiency under the field conditions it is not an ideal approach given its required long duration for electrolysis instead using high dosage rates along with the addition of h2o2 would enable short electrolysis times and hence high throughput can be achieved further the use of h2o2 might reduce the buildup surface layers and the need for electrode cleaning however future research needs to investigate this hypothesis over longer time periods in the field hydrogen peroxide is widely available over the counter in the local grocery stores and hardware stores as a household chemical in the united states it is also widely available for a commercial scale use at 3 concentration without requiring hazardous material handling larger quantities at higher concentration are also easily available e g 10 or 15 one liter of over the counter h2o2 3 is sufficient to treat nearly 6000 l of arsenic contaminated water at 5 mg l of h2o2 dose in the fe ec reactor automated dosing pumps can be implemented for in situ addition of h2o2 while filling the reactor tanks before fe ec electrolysis the h2o2 supply chain is a minor issue in the united states because commercial delivery services e g fedex ups transport household chemicals like dilute h2o2 on a regular basis to the local stores the cost of h2o2 use is expected to be small and might result in net cost savings at a concentration tested in the field trial 5 mg h2o2 l water the added cost of h2o2 is only 0 004 per l water treated use of h2o2 would decrease the size of the electrolysis reactor which would correspondingly decrease fabrication costs and plant footprint a granular activated carbon filter can be used as a polishing step to remove any residual h2o2 before distribution to the community 5 conclusions in this paper we identified three limitations and strategies to overcome these limitations to develop fe ec as a technology appropriate for scaling up in the context of arsenic removal for rural california drinking water we successfully demonstrated substantially shorter electrolysis time using externally added h2o2 we have identified methods by which the waste can be managed in a way which renders it non hazardous as per california state standards finally we presented the implications of limitations to scale up of fe ec in the californian context to help provide safe drinking water for all the use of current density to prevent surface layer formation resulted in differing outcomes in the lab and the field but without undercutting the main

16643,small low income and rural communities across the united states are disproportionately exposed to arsenic contaminated drinking water because existing treatment solutions are too expensive and difficult to operate this paper describes efforts to overcome some barriers and limitations of conventional iron electrocoagulation fe ec to enable its use in the rural californian u s context barriers and limitations of fe ec s application in rural california considered in this work include 1 frequent labor intensive electrode cleaning is required to overcome rust accumulation 2 electrolysis durations are long reducing throughput for a given system size and 3 waste needs compliance with california standards we report results from an investigation for overcoming these limitations via a field trial on a farm in allensworth a small low income rural community in california our strategies to overcome each of the above barriers and limitations are respectively 1 operating the fe ec reactor at high current density to result in sustained fe production 2 operating at high charge dosage rate with external h2o2 and 3 characterization of the arsenic laden waste and are discussed further in the paper main findings are 1 fe ec removed arsenic consistently below the federal and state standard of 10 µg l 2 high current density failed to sustain fe production whereas low current density did not 3 electrolysis time decreased from 1 hour to 2 min with h2o2 dosing of 5 mg l at higher charge dosage rates 4 dilution of as sludge is required to comply with state s non hazardous waste status and 5 discrepancies were observed between lab and field results in using current density to overcome labor intensive electrode cleanings finally implications of overcoming limitations to scale up of fe ec in relevant california communities are discussed keywords drinking water treatment low income communities iron electrocoagulation arsenic california 1 introduction and background arsenic occurs naturally in groundwaters around the world including in many rural small and low income community water systems in the united states welch et al 2000 state water resources control board 2015 the environmental protection agency epa maximum contaminant limit mcl for arsenic in drinking water is set at 10 µg l united states environmental protection agency 2021 chronic consumption of drinking water exceeding this mcl can lead to adverse health effects including internal cancers skin lesions neuropathy and developmental impacts world health organization 2017 effective solutions on the market for treating arsenic contaminated water for potable use include coagulation filtration adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis and iron removal i e oxidation filtration wang et al 2011 however most technologies are considered beyond the technical managerial financial capacity of small rural california communities facing arsenic contaminated drinking water state water resources control board 2015 as a result socioeconomically disadvantaged and minoritized populations in california are disproportionately exposed to arsenic contaminated drinking water balazs et al 2012 iron electrocoagulation fe ec is a promising arsenic removal technology and has been investigated widely both in laboratory and field settings to effectively remove arsenic to less than the epa mcl of 10 µg l consistently fe ec removes arsenic by capturing it on insoluble fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitates produced in the water through the electrically driven dissolution of iron electrodes ratna kumar et al 2004 lakshmanan et al 2010 wan et al 2011 amrose et al 2013 van genuchten et al 2014b delaire et al 2017 amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 bandaru et al 2020a specifically fe ii ions migrate from the anode into bulk and undergo further oxidation by dissolved oxygen to form fe iii oxyhydr oxide lakshmanan et al 2010 reactive fenton type intermediates possibly fe iv species are produced during the oxidation of fe ii by dissolved oxygen at circum netural ph hug and leupin 2003 these reactive intermediates selectively oxidize as iii to as v which adsorbs rapidly onto fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitates li et al 2012 delaire et al 2017 the dissolution of iron electrodes in water is called for brevity iron dosing amrose et al 2014 after iron dosing and adsorption of arsenic on the resulting fe iii oxyhydr oxides the arsenic bearing sludge mostly comprising fe iii precipitates is separated from the water and arsenic safe water is produced amrose et al 2014 fe ec s modular design minimal supply chain i e fe plates and alum requiring low skilled operators e g high school degree or less has enabled it to be an effective technology to address arsenic contaminated drinking water in resource poor decentralized communities globally recently hernandez et al 2019 reported successful demonstration of a pilot scale fe ec plant 10 000 l day capacity at a resource poor decentralized rural community near kolkata india this plant has been delivering arsenic safe water to the community at a locally affordable price of less than 1 u s cent per liter hernandez et al 2019 while fe ec has been demonstrated successfully in india the implementation of fe ec in the united states is poorly understood we conducted this study as a hypothesis generating not as a hypothesis testing effort although it occasionally has some aspects of the latter we explored and report here limitations to be overcome for implementing fe ec as a scalable affordable and distributed solution in resource constrained regions in rural u s communities 2 approach in this study we hypothesized three major barriers and limitations of fe ec as implemented in india these need addressing before fe ec can be translated into a locally affordable community scale treatment technology for low income regions in the united states we describe below the approaches taken to overcome these three barriers and limitations herein barriers and limitations are referred to as limitations 2 1 frequent electrode cleaning is required the steady accumulation of layers of rust on the iron electrodes leads to the steady deterioration of the faradaic efficiency ratio between iron measured in the bulk after electrolysis and iron expected theoretically in fe ec systems amrose et al 2014 van genuchten et al 2016 müller et al 2019 this decline in faradaic efficiency is problematic because if iron is not released in sufficient amounts in the bulk water arsenic might not be removed from the water to below its regulated limit 10 µg l as intended in previous work this issue was resolved by having operators lightly brush the electrode surfaces daily to abrasively remove the top layer of deposited iron rust amrose et al 2014 however this approach is infeasible for the u s context because of the much higher labor rates for operators 15 85 hr in the united states colby et al 2010 vs 1 hr at the fe ec plant in india gadgil 2018 we investigated automated systems for brushing electrode plates for u s applications however our multiple attempts at such design led to unattractively large increases in capital costs by more than 50 in continuation of our efforts to overcome this problem we studied varying an operating parameter current density current per unit submerged electrode area ma cm2 over an extended period at 100 liter l scale operated as a batch process in the field charge dosage rate c l min is also a relevant variable when considering the operation of fe ec systems amrose et al 2013 charge dosage rate can be correlated to current density by changing the current and keeping the electrode surface area the same charge dosage rate can be uncorrelated with current density by keeping the current the same while changing the electrode surface area recent observations by müller et al 2019 suggested that experimenting with a high charge dosage rate and resultingly high current density had the potential to address the decline in faradaic efficiency and growth of surface layer formation müller et al 2019 using synthetic bangladesh groundwater sbgw defined in the manuscript and soft groundwater sbgw electrolyte without ca and mg müller et al 2019 observed that low charge dosage rate and therefore low current density 1 ma cm2 resulted in a steadily decreasing faradaic efficiency of total iron over time 60 after 2 months whereas higher charge dosage rate and therefore high current density 1 ma cm2 resulted in relative high faradaic efficiency 85 over 2 months of operation müller et al 2019 speculated that at high current densities high positive charge of the anode and large flux of positively charged fe2 ions at the anode electrolyte interface facilitated rapid migration and diffusion of fe2 ions into the bulk solution instead of accumulating at the anode surface the soft sbgw electrolyte used in müller et al 2019 is very similar to typical groundwater composition found in california central valley e g low ca and mg concentrations barazesh et al 2018 therefore we hypothesized that operating fe ec at high current density 1 ma cm2 and low charge dosage rate 5 c l min would achieve high faradaic efficiency of total iron in the bulk solution and hence consistent arsenic removal over extended periods of operation additionally we conducted several short term experiments in the lab at beaker scale that suggested support for this hypothesis before we conducted the longer term experiments with 100 l reactors in the field in this study we investigated if high current density could offer protection against the decline in faradaic efficiency on a larger scale fe ec system 100 l reactor treating real arsenic contaminated groundwater in the field conditions we operated two reactors in the field one at high current density and one at low current density as control at similar operating conditions to those reported in müller et al 2019 2 2 electrolysis times are long in conventional fe ec in contrast to india where the scale of the fe ec technology was designed to deliver arsenic safe water to meet only the drinking water needs united states regulations require that all the water delivered to the household by public water systems must be of adequate quality for human consumption regardless of its end use united states congress 2019 this requirement increases the volume of water that must be treated and delivered per person per day from about 2 gallons approximately 7 6 liters in the indian context to about 100 gallons approximately 378 5 liters in the united states context however fe ec treatment cannot be sped up by simply rapidly releasing a larger amount of iron in the water previous work has demonstrated that increasing the rate of iron released in the water by increasing the charge dosage rate cdr c l min decreased the efficiency of arsenic removal because of the competition between fe ii and as iii for the reactive intermediates amrose et al 2013 li et al 2012 delaire et al 2017 thus for a given iron dose low cdrs and therefore long electrolysis times were found important to achieve complete oxidation of fe ii and high efficiency of arsenic removal dubrawski et al 2015 bandaru et al 2020b however the long electrolysis times on the order of hours increases the operating costs and the physical footprint of the fe ec system when delivering increased volumes of water making the fe ec system unattractive and unaffordable for rural communities in california operating fe ec at high cdrs 10 c l min decreases the electrolysis times to the order of minutes and can achieve the high flow rates desired for the u s context at low operating costs however the slow kinetics of oxygen dissolution in water requires fe ec to operate at low cdrs to achieve complete fe ii oxidation and hence efficient arsenic removal for a given charge dose c l bandaru et al 2020b to overcome this limitation we studied use of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as an external oxidant to the fe ec system in the field the literature has documented the use of h2o2 as an external oxidant at beaker scale using fe salts hug and leupin 2003 use of h2o2 as an external oxidant can enhance the kinetics of fe ii oxidation 10 000 times compared to kinetics of oxidation with dissolved oxygen thus facilitating efficient arsenic removal at a high charge dosage rate hug and leupin 2003 king and farlow 2000 rapid kinetics between h2o2 and fe ii to achieve efficient arsenic removal at very high charge dosage rates 1200 c l min or short electrolysis times seconds has been reported recently with in situ h2o2 generation by an air diffusion cathode bandaru et al 2020b the air cathode assisted fe ec is a promising alternative to traditional fe ec systems to deliver high flow rates at low operating costs however the long term performance of the air cathode in the air cathode assisted fe ec needs further evaluation and could increase the operating costs e g if the cathode fouled irreversibly to our knowledge the use of h2o2 as an external oxidant in the fe ec system for arsenic removal remains unexplored in the literature and the field demonstration of this approach is missing altogether in this space we explored the efficacy of fe ec with externally added h2o2 as an affordable solution to address arsenic contamination in rural regions in the united states specifically experiments under laboratory conditions necessarily rely on synthetic groundwater matrices only field conditions require the technology to have full exposure to exactly all constituents of the groundwater even those which we might not have thought relevant for the laboratory synthetic groundwater matrix these might include specific kinds of natural organic matter conditions of do complexation of the contaminant with suspended clay particles other organic and biological contaminants bacteria and algae that might have been missed in the lab 2 3 waste needs characterization as per california state standards in the context of this work we defined waste characterization as one of the necessary pieces of knowledge needed for ensuring ability to use the fe ec system this characterization will determine if the arsenic laden waste generated from the fe ec system can pass the two specific tests defined in section to receive regulatory approval for practical implementation of the technology lack of knowledge about the sludge is a barrier to use of the technology it is not a limitation of the technology fe ec produces an arsenic laden iron sludge as a waste by product that must be managed appropriately amrose et al 2014 two measurements total threshold limit concentration ttlc and soluble threshold limit concentration stlc are required per californian regulations to determine the nature of the waste e g hazardous non hazardous and resulting waste management practices needed for scale up e g landfill disposal california code of regulations 2021 ttlc measures the solubilized extractable and non extractable concentrations i e total arsenic and stlc measures the solubilized and extractable concentrations the ttlc standard for arsenic is 500 mg kg and the stlc standard for arsenic is 5 mg l california code of regulations 2021 until now fe ec sludge produced from arsenic removal process had not been characterized per either standard to overcome this knowledge gap ttlc and stlc values of sludge generated in the field were measured in a third party california water boards certified lab enthalpy analytical at berkeley california 3 materials and methods we conducted month long field testing of a 100 l fe ec system in batch mode on a private farm impacted by arsenic contaminated groundwater in allensworth california allensworth is a small low income rural community in california with a history of struggling with arsenic contaminated drinking water state water resources control board 2013 the groundwater at the farm had 153 29 1 μg l of arsenic nearly 15 times the epa maximum contaminant level of 10 μg l for arsenic in the drinking water most california wells with arsenic contamination have concentrations that are much lower 90 µg l state water resources control board 2021 the groundwater is pumped directly into the reactors without any pretreatment to understand fe ec performance at removing arsenic under realistic operating conditions we operated two fe ec reactors 100 l in the field in batch mode one at high current density and one at low current density as control at similar operating conditions to those reported in müller et al 2019 the location thus allowed testing fe ec s performance in a groundwater condition in the context of rural california 3 1 chemical analysis and other measurements potassium and sodium concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms epa method 6020 total iron silica phosphorus magnesium and calcium were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes total arsenic was measured using either icp ms or icp oes depending on availability of the instruments to the researchers icp ms icp oes and ion chromatography samples were acidified prior to measurement by adding 1 ml of 1 1 m hcl to a 5 ml sample arsenic samples were filtered with a 0 45 µm filter prior to acidification chloride sulfate and nitrate were measured by ion chromatography epa method 300 0 alkalinity was measured by titration sm2320b natural organic matter nom was measured through total organic carbon toc using method sm310c ph do and conductivity were measured in the field using electrode probes orion 5 star thermo scientific turbidity was measured in the field using a portable turbidity meter orion aq4500 turbidimeter the concentration of h2o2 was measured in the field using a portable spectrophotometer hach dr 2400 h with titanium iv oxysulfate solution sigma aldrich at wavelength 405 nm the mass of the iron electrodes before and after the field trial was measured using an electronic scale air temperature was recorded in the field using a thermometer and water temperature using a multiparameter portable meter orion 5 star thermo scientific dc power supplies b k precision 1687b 1688b 9115 were used to supply desired current for electrolysis power supplies were operated in constant current mode at the desired current and the resulting voltage was recorded in the field near the start and end of electrolysis interface potentials near the reactor electrodes were measured in the field using an ag agcl 3m nacl reference electrode basi by placing it very close 0 2 cm to 0 5 cm to the iron electrodes the potential difference between the reference electrodes and the iron electrode was measured with a multimeter fluke 87v and this value was reported as an interface potential of the electrodes we assumed a negligible ohmic voltage drop between the reference electrode and iron electrode the uncertainty of all measurements reported in this work are shown

experiments beaker scale electrolyte volume 0 2 l fe ec experiments were conducted in the lab at low 0 5 ma cm2 and high current density 10 ma cm2 using the groundwater collected from the field site the main objective of these short term experiments 16 batches was to investigate the hypothesis that high faradaic efficiency 85 of total iron can be achieved when fe ec operated at high current density 1 ma cm2 and low charge dosage rate 5 c l min over long periods of operation the charge dosage rate was kept constant at 3 1 c l min at both current densities and the electrolyte was stirred continuously using a magnetic stir bar after delivering the desired dose of 200 300 c l samples for total iron were collected and acidified immediately with 1 1 m hcl for icp oes analysis electrodes were pulled out of the reactor gently and iron dosed groundwater was replaced with new groundwater in the beaker every day up to three experiments were performed at each current density and a total of 16 experiments were completed in 2 weeks at these operating conditions the electrodes were left to dry overnight and were not cleaned in between the experiments electrodes were not cleaned between batches batches 1 6 were conducted at approximately 196 c l and batches 7 16 were conducted at approximately 300 c l the operating parameters of these experiments were summarized in si table s1 3 3 reactors and processes pilot scale experiments were conducted to understand the performance of fe ec at treating arsenic contaminated groundwater over a long period of time month the objective of these experiments was similar to the batch experiments described in section 3 2 specifically the purpose was to understand if high faradaic efficiency of total iron can be achieved in a scaled up fe ec system 100 l reactor volume operating at high current density 10 ma cm2 and low charge dosage rate 3 5 c l min over long term operation in the field these experiments were expected to address the frequent electrode cleaning limitation described in section 2 1 two fe ec reactors electrolyte volume 100 l were constructed at the university of california berkeley and transported to the field site in allensworth ca these reactors were designed to operate at low current density and high current density by changing the electrode surface area and therefore number of electrodes while keeping the reactor volume and charge dosage rate the same herein we refer to these reactors as low and high current density reactors the change in shape of the fe ec reactors rectangular for low current density reactor and circular for high current density reactor do not influence the mixing conditions or the arsenic removal chemistry because electrolyte mixing is achieved by continuously recirculating the electrolyte using a submersible pump during the electrolysis similar mixing configuration has been implemented in the published work on fe ec systems in the field amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 the reactors had different number of plates 12 vs 2 to accommodate the low and high current densities while supplying the same current to each of the two reactors thus two designs accommodated the difference in electrode surface areas as shown in fig 1 note that since both designs held the same water volume and deployed the same current they both delivered identical charge dosage rate but with different current densities on their electrode surfaces on the low current density reactor each of the electrode plates was labeled 1 through 12 and the face of each plate was labeled either f for front or b for back the inter electrode distance was 2 cm during electrolysis water was aerated using a pipe with holes to jet the water downward through the air water was recirculated using a submersible pump 124 watts through the reactor to replenish dissolved oxygen and ensure mixing when used h2o2 was added to the solution right above the submersible pump in the reactors fig 1a submersible pump to ensure uniform distribution of h2o2 throughout the reactor by recirculation after electrolysis water with iron oxide particles was fed to a settling tank settling process will be described later industrial grade non ferric alum al2 so4 3 18 h2o was added to aid in the settling process alum stock solution was made to the concentration of 5000 mg l as al an alum dose of 2 5 to 7 5 mg l as al was investigated based on the published literature during the initial testing data not shown for brevity we found that the alum dose of 7 5 mg l as al resulted in lowest turbidity after 1 minute rapid mixing 600 800 rpm 20 minute slow mixing 20 40 rpm and 2 hours of settling the alum dose and parameters for rapid and slow mixing were selected based on the published literature amrose et al 2014 hernandez et al 2019 3 4 field operation the reactors were each operated typically one to two times per day for five days per week for four weeks in june 2019 table 1 presents the operating conditions for this part of the field trial the dose and charge dosage rate were target values the current was measured the current density was calculated batches 1 2 were test runs used to ensure the basic system components e g pumps power supplies were operating as designed batches 3 5 were designed to determine the minimum dose of iron required to remove arsenic to less than 10 µg l this was achieved by measuring arsenic removal in the field over a wide range of doses 0 400 c l 0 c l referring to raw water without treatment or particle separation data at 0 50 100 c l were duplicate measurements and everything else was triplicated batches 6 37 were operated at the above determined minimum dose to examine the long term performance of the fe ec system with respect to arsenic removal faradaic efficiency of total iron and energy consumption h2o2 experiments were conducted using the field trial setup and low current density reactor in july 2019 and explored the influence of h2o2 concentration and charge dosage rate on arsenic removal performance new electrode plates were used in the low current density reactor for h2o2 experiments table 2 presents the operating conditions for this part of the field trial the dosage rate in the july field experiments was selected to be nearly an order of magnitude higher than the dosage rate in the june field experiments to investigate arsenic removal with a shorter electrolysis time raw water samples were collected once per day from the groundwater source water pumped from wells entered a tank where it was pumped out into a hose that entered either reactor before conducting experiments each day we let the water leaving the tank flush for 5 minutes pre and post electrolysis samples were collected from the electrolysis tanks at the end of each experiment samples were collected while the recirculation pump was running to prevent any settling of the suspension leading to non uniform concentrations of total iron in the solution the solution ph do and conductivity were measured in one set of samples right after the collection samples for total concentrations of the solution species were acidified immediately with 1 1 m hcl samples for dissolved concentrations of the species were filtered using 0 45 µm nylon syringe filters and the filtrate was acidified immediately with 1 1 m hcl we filtered the samples to understand the degree of arsenic removal possible if the particle separation was fully effective it was important to separate the arsenic removal results from those of the particle separation approaches tested similarly post settling samples and post filtration samples for the total concentrations of solution species and dissolved concentrations of the solution species were collected from the settling tank and at the outlet hose when half the settling tank was drained particle separation approaches investigated in this study are presented in the supporting information section s2 we did not explore particle separation exhaustively to include this section in the main manuscript hence these findings are presented in si so that other researchers may find them useful in their future work 3 5 characterizing sludge wet sludge collected from the field was dried in a lab oven at approximately 75 c until water evaporated after the field trial was complete the drying time was not accurately recorded but it was around a few 3 4 days stlc and ttlc measurements of the dried sludge were conducted by a third party california water boards certified lab enthalpy analytical at berkeley california ttlc was done using the method epa 6020 icp ms stlc was done using wet epa 6010b 4 results and discussion 4 1 raw water composition and determining minimum dose 4 1 1 raw water composition conductivity varied greatly over the duration of the field trial as shown in si figure s1 and indicated by the large standard deviation in table 3 broadly the water conductivity was high 4585 µs cm 790 µs cm in the first quarter and last quarter portions of the field trial batches 1 9 and 27 37 and lower 441 9 µs cm 209 9 µs cm in batches 10 26 as a result in several figures we have demarcated these distinct conductivity regimes with vertical lines table 3 presents the raw water composition separated into low and high conductivity periods table s2 presents the average and standard deviation of the raw water composition throughout the duration of the field trial we do not know the cause of the conductivity changes however we suspect that the variability of pumping on the farm might be a factor the upper limit allowed in california for chloride and sulfate is 500 mg l state water resources control board 2018 on average the chloride and sulfate concentration in the raw water is much higher and thus would need to be removed in addition to arsenic to provide this water for drinking purposes toc was not detected in any sample measured 4 1 2 experiments to determine minimum dose fig 2 presents the average arsenic concentration after electrolysis during batches 3 5 at low current density and high current density operation dissolved arsenic in the filtered samples decreased from an initial concentration of 185 µg l to a concentration of 0 2 µg l as charge dosage increased from 0 to 400 c l dissolved arsenic in the filtered samples decreased to below 10 µg l at charge dose of 100 c l or greater the arsenic removal was similar across the low and high current density reactors which were supplied with the same current 5 8 a had the same volume 100l and therefore the same dosage rates this is consistent with the earlier reported finding that arsenic removal is more strongly influenced by charge dosage rate than the current density e g amrose et al 2013 based on these findings a charge dose of 150 c l was selected for the long term performance experiments as a moderately conservative dose to consistently yield concentrations below 10 µg l 4 2 addressing limitation 1 frequent electrode cleaning is required 4 2 1 long term arsenic removal fig 3 shows the arsenic concentration in the filtered sample all samples shown were collected after receiving a dose of 150 c l and are from batches 3 37 excluding 11 13 all sample measurements demonstrate that fe ec consistently removed arsenic to below 10 µg l from the average initial concentration of 153 29 1 µg l the average arsenic levels in the samples from the low and high current density reactors were similar at 1 9 2 1 µg l and 1 9 2 0 µg l respectively changes in conductivity of raw water the electrolyte had no notable impact on arsenic removal the electrolyte composition can influence the size and structure of the particles formed in fe ec van genuchten et al 2014a for example divalent cations ca2 and mg2 aid in the aggregation of fe iii oxyhyr oxides increase the sites available for attachment of as v to the precipitates and increase the size of the particles generated during electrolysis the average concentrations of ca and mg in the groundwater decreased from 26 9 4 8 mg l and 24 2 4 6 mg l respectively during the high conductivity period to 2 7 1 6 mg l and 1 5 1 6 mg l respectively in the low conductivity period as a result when groundwater conductivity was 1000 µs cm or low ionic strength the 0 45 µm filter failed to remove all of the fe iii oxyhydr oxide particles which resulted in high arsenic concentrations in the post electrolysis filtered and acid digested samples thus arsenic results do not include samples for batches 11 13 after batch 13 when this was realized instead of collecting the sample after electrolysis we collected samples after the particle separation step in which alum was added alum increased the particle size and allowed for adequate removal of solids by filtration using the 0 45 µm filter we thereafter obtained correct measurements of the arsenic remaining in solution in the treated water samples we still do not fully understand the large variance in the measured arsenic values in post treatment water all below 10 µg l but with a large scatter possibly this has to do with the particle separation which could impact the amount of iron oxides and arsenic going through the 0 45 micron filter into the samples measured for arsenic this aspect deserves future exploration 4 2 2 faradaic efficiency of total iron fig 4 a presents the faradaic efficiency of total iron in the beaker scale experiments see müller et al 2019 for faradaic efficiency calculations in the low current density reactor the faradaic efficiency decreased from about 0 8 to about 0 6 during 16 batch experiments whereas in the high current density reactor the faradaic efficiency remained high 85 over 16 batch experiments the results were consistent with prior reported findings in previous field work the faradaic efficiency steadily declined over time in low current density operation amrose et al 2014 in previous lab work the faradaic efficiency steadily declined over time in low current density operation and remained relatively high and constant over time in high current density operation müller et al 2019 however for experiments conducted in the field using 100 l reactors unexpected results for faradaic efficiency were observed fig 4b presents the faradaic efficiency for the low and high current density reactors for the field trial duration batches 3 37 in the field results from the 100 l low current density reactor the faradaic efficiency remained steady at an average value of 86 3 8 over 37 batch experiments however in the high current density reactor the faradaic efficiency steadily decreased from 109 in b6 to 50 in b37 greater than 100 efficiency could be attributed to nonuniform mixing post electrolysis the color of the solution in the high current density reactor steadily became a lighter orange color as the field trial progressed from b6 to b37 consistent with the progressively lower fe concentrations analytically measured in the solution as the trial progressed si figure s2 this finding is in contrast with previously published fe ec literature amrose et al 2014 müller et al 2019 despite having similar operating variables see table 1 these results demonstrate that operating fe ec at high current density and low charge dosage rate was not beneficial to achieve sustained high faradaic efficiency over long periods of operation in the following paragraphs we discuss various hypotheses and mechanisms to elucidate our findings to help understand the sustained faradaic efficiency in the low current density reactor we presented indirect measurements such as interface potentials difference in the weight of the electrodes and digital images of the electrodes the interface potential measurements remained constant for a given conductivity period over the duration of the field trial si figure s3 which suggest minimal surface layer resistive growth on the electrodes this hypothesis is further supported by the difference between initial and final weights of the anode plates 1 1 g plate or 0 17 of plate weight see si table s3 which presents the change in mass of the electrodes before and after the field trial in the low current density reactor one possible hypothesis is that the low concentrations of strongly adsorbing phosphate ions in the groundwater throughout the field trial non detect 0 1 mg l could have prevented the growth of surface layers on the electrodes in low current density reactor van genuchten et al 2014a another hypothesis is the presence of high levels of dissolved oxygen post electrolysis 7 4 0 3 mg l which could have prevented the formation of a magnetite surface layer as seen in other fe ec systems huang and zhang 2005 van genuchten et al 2016 the interface potential measurements could not be taken in the high current density reactor due to the reactor design which had a pipe and side supports see items 2 and 3 in si figure 11 that prohibited putting anything between the iron plates the decrease in faradaic efficiency in the high current density reactor could be due to the non uniform dissolution of the fe anode see fig 5 resulting in localized high current density regions to favor other oxidation reactions one possible mechanism could be due to excessive chloride concentration in the groundwater at our field location the chloride concentration ranged from 184 mg l 5 mm as cl to 1222 mg l 34 mm as cl therefore at increasing high current densities with time the oxidation of cl to cl2 could be predominant anodic reaction over fe 0 to fe2 oxidation wei et al 2012 brillas and martínez huitle 2015 qian et al 2019 however more work is needed to fully elucidate the mechanism and explore the relationship between surface layer formation water composition and operating parameters to further provide evidence related to the structural integrity and surface layer formation in both high and low current density systems we provide photographs of electrodes in fig 5 for the low current density system there were 6 cathodes and 6 anodes and we selected one representative image from each for the table there are textural differences between the anodes in the high and low current density systems in the high current density system the anode has a nonuniform texture which could be due to nonuniform anodic dissolution of the iron electrode whereas in the low current density system the anode has a more uniform texture it is also clear that on both cathodes there is significant light yellow white surface layer likely due to calcite precipitation favored by the higher ph at the cathode it is important to note on the high current density anode there is a portion on the bottom that is fully consumed by electrolysis this was expected as anodes in the system are consumables and the high current density system had higher cumulative coulombs consumed per electrode surface area we present faradaic efficiency versus cumulative coulombs over electrode surface area in si figures s4 and s5 to illustrate the difference in coulombs consumed per electrode surface area in each system these figures demonstrate the faradaic efficiency as the electrode becomes increasingly consumed in short term beaker scale experiments si figure s4 the faradaic efficiency of total iron decreased with cumulative coulombs per surface area which suggests the surface layer growth on the anode surface at low current density in contrast the faradaic efficiency of total iron remained constant with cumulative coulombs per surface area likely due to less accumulation of surface layers on the anode surface however contrasting results are observed in the field scale fe ec system at low and high current densities over long term operation figure s5 in this section we briefly discussed the possible causes for this contrasting behavior of the fe ec system in the field 4 2 3 energy intensity and coulombic efficiency of arsenic removal energy intensity of arsenic removal defined as mwh l µg arsenic removed l for the high and low current density reactors was calculated to understand the energetic requirements per unit of arsenic removed si figure s6 the energy intensity ranged from 1 5 to 13 6 mwh l µg arsenic removed l in high current density reactor which was an order of magnitude higher than the low current density reactor which ranged from 0 2 to 1 2 mwh l µg arsenic removed l the order of magnitude increase in energy intensity relative to low current density reactor can be attributed to high operating voltages greater than 30 v in the high current density reactor current was held constant and arsenic removal remained stable whereas voltage changed throughout the trial the estimated coulombic efficiency of arsenic removal coulombs of charge dosed μg as removed was similar and consistent across both reactors which suggests that current density did not influence the arsenic removal in fe ec si figure s7 this is consistent with the reported findings that the charge dosage rate strongly influences the arsenic removal in the fe ec system amrose et al 2013 4 3 addressing limitation 2 electrolysis times are long in conventional fe ec fig 6 presents the arsenic concentration after electrolysis for varying h2o2 concentrations 0 5 and 26 mg l h2o2 and charge doses 50 100 and 150 c l at a high dosage rate of 30 c l min at 0 mg l h2o2 where dissolved oxygen is the primary oxidant a charge dose of 150 c l was needed to remove arsenic to below the epa mcl the arsenic removal at 150 c l at high cdr is comparable to the low cdr experiments at low and high current density see fig 3 at 5 mg l h2o2 and 26 mg l h2o2 a charge dose of only 50 c l was needed to remove arsenic to below the epa mcl the time saved in electrolysis when operating at a higher dosage rate an operating mode enabled by h2o2 use was on the order of hours under typical operation of fe ec that requires a low dosage rate amrose et al 2013 electrolysis took place over hours whereas here substantially shorter electrolysis times 1 7 mins were sufficient to remove arsenic to levels below the mcl our results suggest that h2o2 combined with a high charge dosage rate rendered fe ec a high throughput system while maintaining excellent arsenic removal performance iron concentration faradaic efficiency and raw water composition of these experiments are provided in si figure s8 si figure s9 and si table s4 respectively faradaic efficiency for these experiments was between 78 92 water quality varied throughout the experiment the conductivity on average was 4630 µs cm with a standard deviation of 2460 µs cm the energy intensity of arsenic removal defined earlier was calculated for a traditional fe ec operation at low charge dosage rates si figure s6 and b novel fe ec operation with h2o2 injection at high charge dosage rates si figure s10 fe ec operation for removing arsenic with h2o2 injection and high charge dosage rates was about as energy intensive as the traditional operation of fe ec at low current density 0 2 mwh l µg arsenic removed l for both however the h2o2 addition allowed much shorter more than 40x shorter electrolysis duration than with traditional fe ec this translates to high throughput of 3600 lph when h2o2 injection was deployed in contrast to 84 lph with traditional fe ec low current density reactor 4 4 overcoming limitation 3 waste needs characterization as per california standards solid waste disposal in california requires the waste to pass two different tests ttlc and stlc these tests were conducted on dried sludge at a third party commercial laboratory three samples of dried sludge were analyzed the average results for arsenic were as follows for ttlc 897 mg arsenic kg solid waste and for stlc 3 6 mg arsenic liter the stlc result met the standard for arsenic allowable maximum is 5 mg l the ttlc result was above the standard allowable maximum is 500 mg kg which indicates that the resulting dry sludge contained higher than allowable concentration of arsenic immobilizing the solid waste e g by mixing with cement that later hardens into concrete would be an option to lower the ttlc result to below maximum allowable limit and certify the final product as non hazardous waste roy et al 2019 an alternative solution would be to increase the iron dose decreasing the mass of arsenic per mass of waste 4 5 implications of limitations explored for scale up of fe ec in california finally it is relevant to discuss our results in the context of a future scaled up fe ec systems implemented for arsenic removal in california first while low current density operated under low charge dosage rates was shown to be the best option to maintain faradaic efficiency under the field conditions it is not an ideal approach given its required long duration for electrolysis instead using high dosage rates along with the addition of h2o2 would enable short electrolysis times and hence high throughput can be achieved further the use of h2o2 might reduce the buildup surface layers and the need for electrode cleaning however future research needs to investigate this hypothesis over longer time periods in the field hydrogen peroxide is widely available over the counter in the local grocery stores and hardware stores as a household chemical in the united states it is also widely available for a commercial scale use at 3 concentration without requiring hazardous material handling larger quantities at higher concentration are also easily available e g 10 or 15 one liter of over the counter h2o2 3 is sufficient to treat nearly 6000 l of arsenic contaminated water at 5 mg l of h2o2 dose in the fe ec reactor automated dosing pumps can be implemented for in situ addition of h2o2 while filling the reactor tanks before fe ec electrolysis the h2o2 supply chain is a minor issue in the united states because commercial delivery services e g fedex ups transport household chemicals like dilute h2o2 on a regular basis to the local stores the cost of h2o2 use is expected to be small and might result in net cost savings at a concentration tested in the field trial 5 mg h2o2 l water the added cost of h2o2 is only 0 004 per l water treated use of h2o2 would decrease the size of the electrolysis reactor which would correspondingly decrease fabrication costs and plant footprint a granular activated carbon filter can be used as a polishing step to remove any residual h2o2 before distribution to the community 5 conclusions in this paper we identified three limitations and strategies to overcome these limitations to develop fe ec as a technology appropriate for scaling up in the context of arsenic removal for rural california drinking water we successfully demonstrated substantially shorter electrolysis time using externally added h2o2 we have identified methods by which the waste can be managed in a way which renders it non hazardous as per california state standards finally we presented the implications of limitations to scale up of fe ec in the californian context to help provide safe drinking water for all the use of current density to prevent surface layer formation resulted in differing outcomes in the lab and the field but without undercutting the main

16644,extensive use of organoarsenic feed additives such as roxarsone has caused organoarsenicals to occur in livestock wastewater and further within anaerobic wastewater treatment systems currently information on the long term impacts of roxarsone on anaerobic granular sludge ags activity and the underlying mechanisms is very limited in this study the response of ags to long term loading of roxarsone was investigated using a laboratory up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor spiked with 5 0 mg l 1 of roxarsone under the effect of roxarsone methane production decreased by 40 due to the complete inhibition on acetoclastic methanogenic activity on day 260 before being restored eventually over 30 of the influent arsenic was accumulated in the ags and the capability of ags to prevent intracellular as iii accumulation increased with time the ags size was reduced by 30 to 1 20 1 26 mm based on morphology and confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis roxarsone exposure stimulated the excretion of extracellular polymeric substances and the surface spalling of ags high throughput sequencing analysis further indicated roxarsone initially altered the acidogenic pathway and severely inhibited the acetoclastic methanogen methanothrix acetogenic bacteria and methanothrix were finally enriched and became the main contributor for a full restoration of the initial methane production these findings provide a deeper understanding on the effect of organoarsenicals on ags which is highly beneficial for the effective anaerobic treatment of organoarsenic bearing wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords roxarsone methanogenic activity anaerobic granular sludge extracellular polymeric substance microbial community 1 introduction roxarsone 4 hydroxy 3 nitro phenylarsonic acid has globally been used for decades as an organoarsenic feed additive to control coccidiosis infection and improve pigmentation and growth hu et al 2019 mangalgiri et al 2015 the allowable limit of roxarsone dosage is 50 mg kg 1 for poultry feed and 100 mg kg 1 for pig feed respectively mangalgiri et al 2015 due to the concern on arsenic residue in animal products and the associated human health risk the use of organoarsenic feed additives including roxarsone has been successively banned in europe since 1999 the usa since 2013 china since 2019 etc hu et al 2019 however their use in animal feeding operations is still approved in many developing countries such as argentina brazil india and vietnam as summarized in our previous study tang et al 2021a as roxarsone is poorly metabolized by animals 90 of dietary roxarsone is excreted without any chemical transformation fei et al 2018 thereby causing livestock waste or and wastewater to be contaminated by arsenic zhai et al 2017 previous studies have indicated that arsenic concentrations can reach levels of up to 119 mg kg 1 in manure li and chen 2005 and up to 0 44 mg l 1 in swine wastewater makris et al 2008 zhai et al 2017 once released to the natural environment either via discharge of wastewater or through land application the organoarsenicals such as roxarsone tend to be converted to more toxic inorganic forms that jeopardize water and soil security fei et al 2018 makris et al 2008 swine wastewater typically has a high biological oxygen demand bod that ranges from 2000 to 30 000 mg l 1 nagarajan et al 2019 anaerobic digestion is a widely used technique for a rigorous treatment of these wastewaters because of the option for biogas recovery and due to the low operational cost lourinho et al 2020 the core of anaerobic digesters consists of anaerobic sludge which prevails as floc or in granular form compared to floc sludge anaerobic granular sludge ags consists of denser aggregates with a multilayered architecture he et al 2019 from the outer toward the inner layer ags contains a distinct sequence of dominant microorganisms including acidogens hydrogenogens syntrophic microorganisms and methanogens satoh et al 2007 in addition to the microorganisms microbially excreted extracellular polymeric substances eps are another important component of ags protecting microbes against external adverse conditions such as toxic chemicals sheng et al 2010 roxarsone has been previously demonstrated to exert a negative impact on the activity of various microbes including that of methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2010 tang et al 2021b for example sierra alvarez et al 2004 found that under methanogenic conditions the 50 inhibition concentration ic50 of roxarsone on acetoclastic methanogenic activity of floc sludge was 112 mg l 1 while less susceptible than acetoclastic methanogenic activity hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity was still inhibited by 60 in the presence of 263 mg l 1 roxarsone sierra alvarez et al 2010 this inhibition is thought to be caused not only by roxarsone itself but also by its anaerobic degradation products i e 4 hydroxy 3 amino phenylarsonic acid hapa methylated arsenic arsenate as v and arsenite as iii cortinas et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 these arsenical transformation products appear to have a higher toxicity towards methanogens than roxarsone itself sierra alvarez et al 2010 2004 especially noteworthy is the toxicity of as iii towards methanogens which is 100 times higher than that of roxarsone based on their ic50 on methanogenic activity sierra alvarez et al 2004 our previous investigations that used ags as inoculums indicated that methane production was completely suppressed by roxarsone at levels of 60 120 mg l 1 in batch experiments tang et al 2019 and at even lower levels of 25 mg l 1 in a continuous up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor shui et al 2016 importantly the observed inhibition appeared to be irreversible and the toxicity of arsenic to be closely concentration dependent sierra alvarez et al 2004 the roxarsone concentrations reported to critically impact anaerobic digestion ranged between 20 and 350 mg l 1 shui et al 2016 sierra alvarez et al 2010 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 i e at least one order of magnitude higher than concentrations in typical swine wastewaters makris et al 2008 zhai et al 2017 clearly for an efficient wastewater treatment a more robust understanding of the response of the ags to the long term loading of low concentrations of roxarsone is of great significance in this new experimental study we operated a laboratory scale uasb reactor setup for 420 days and now analyze the collected data to generate a deeper and more process based understanding of the response of ags to roxarsone starting from a macro scale perspective and moving towards the micro scale we exploit various experimental techniques and approaches our main objectives were to a evaluate the long term impact of roxarsone on methanogenic activity b analyze and understand the biotransformation reactions affecting roxarsone fate within the reactor c elucidate the changes in structure and eps of the ags using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm d and investigate the shifts in microbial community structure using high throughput sequencing technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic granular sludge the ags used in this study was taken from an anaerobic reactor treating citric acid wastewater in bengbu china the particle diameter total solid ts content volatile solid vs content and the specific methanogenic activity sma of the ags were 1 5 2 0 mm 14 0 0 7 10 8 0 5 and 138 12 ml ch4 g vs d 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design the experimental investigation was carried out in two identical 3 l uasb reactors with a diameter of 100 mm one of the two reactors r0 was operated as control and not fed with roxarsone while r1 was fed with roxarsone to ensure the analytical precision of our analysis the initial roxarsone concentration was set at 5 0 mg l 1 which corresponds to 1 43 mg l 1 arsenic the employed concentration was therefore while at a similar level somewhat higher by 1 mg l 1 than typical arsenic concentration in real swine wastewater e g concentrations of 0 21 0 44 mg l 1 as reported by zhai et al 2017 and 0 004 0 53 mg l 1 as reported by jin and chang 2011 both reactors were inoculated with 25 g ts l 1 ags and operated at 35 2 c with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 0 5 day and a sludge retention time of 63 days the synthetic wastewater was amended with roxarsone and sucrose table 1 as well as other necessary mineral elements as described in our previous study tang et al 2020 both reactors were operated in two distinct stages table 1 during stage i days 0 24 both reactors were started up and acclimatized while inflow sucrose concentrations where successively increased from 1 0 to 3 0 g l 1 equivalent to biodegradable chemical oxygen demand cod increase from 1 1 to 3 4 g l 1 as a result the volumetric organic loading rates and sludge organic loading rates of both reactors increased from 2 2 to 6 8 kg cod m 3 d 1 and from 0 11 to 0 34 kg cod kg 3 vs d 1 respectively no roxarsone was amended during stage i during stage ii days 25 420 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone was amended to the inflow solution in r1 the volumetric and sludge organic loading rates of both reactors remained at 6 8 kg cod m 3 d 1 and 0 34 kg cod kg 3 vs d 1 respectively biogas production was monitored regularly in both reactors and roxarsone biotransformations in r1 were measured to investigate the influence of roxarsone on methanogenic activity ags samples were withdrawn at the intervals ranging between 20 and 65 days from both reactors to determine the acetoclastic sma i e one of the most important indicators for the evaluation on methanogenic activity of the ags particle size eps and arsenic concentrations the ags samples collected on day 20 start up phase day 270 methanogenesis inhibition phase and day 420 methanogenesis restoration phase were used to analyze the changes in ags morphology eps distribution and microbial community 2 3 chemical analysis the volume and composition of biogas were measured using a custom made electronic counter and a gas chromatograph model sp 6890 lu nan respectively shui et al 2016 the average particle diameters and the morphology of the ags were evaluated using a microscope cx41 olympus equipped with a digital camera dschx1 sony di and torregrossa 2013 eps of the ags was extracted using the cation exchange resin method frølund et al 1996 the protein and carbohydrate concentrations were determined using a modified lorry method komsa penkova et al 1996 and the phenol sulfuric acid method masuko et al 2005 respectively the acetoclastic sma of the ags was estimated using a modified batch experiment based on the method reported by astals et al 2015 in brief 2 g cod l 1 of acetate 2 g vs l 1 of the ags and essential trace elements were added in a serum bottle with the working volume of 50 ml under anaerobic conditions the methane production was monitored every two hours the methane production rate was defined as the slope of a linear regression fitting of the cumulative methane production y axis and time x axis based on the data collected from the stable methanogenesis stage the acetoclastic sma in ml ch4 g vs d 1 was calculated by dividing the methane production rate by the amount of the ags added organoarsenicals including roxarsone and hapa were determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity agilent technologies and inorganic arsenic was determined using hplc hydrogen generation atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs8220 titan as previously tested and reported by tang et al 2020 the ags withdrawn from r1 was extracted three times using a mixed reagent of 20 g l 1 k2hpo4 and h3po4 mix ratio 200 3 v v at 40 c to obtain extracellular exchangeable arsenic before being disrupted with an ultrasonic cell disruptor vcx150 sonics and further extracted three times using the same reagent mentioned above to gain intracellular exchangeable arsenic tang et al 2017 after the extraction the ags residue was used for the determination of precipitated arsenic 2 4 visual observation of eps distribution in the ags the spatial distribution of polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids in the ags was visualized using a technique that combines fluorescence labeling with clsm lsm 710 zeiss zhang et al 2020 the ags was successively stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma lectins concanavalin a con a thermo fisher scientific calcofluor white sigma and syto 63 sigma to trace the proteins α β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and nucleic acid respectively table s1 after each staining the ags was washed using 1 pbs buffer to eliminate the residual stains the stained granules were embedded with an o c t compound sakura finetek frozen at 20 c and sectioned into 60 μm slices for the clsm observation 2 5 high throughput sequencing a high throughput sequencing technique was used to analyze the microbial community structure within the ags the dna in the ags samples was extracted using an e z n a mag bind soil dna kit closely following the manufacturer s instructions to amplify the bacterial dna in v3 v4 regions two rounds of polymerase chain reaction pcr were performed using 341f 805r primer pairs and illumina bridge type pcr compatible primers respectively hugerth et al 2014 for amplifying archaeal dna in v3 v4 regions three rounds of pcr were conducted using m 340f gu1st 1000r 349f 806r and illumina bridge type pcr compatible primer pairs respectively pausan et al 2019 the pcr products were purified and recovered for high throughput sequencing 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of roxarsone on methanogenic activity methane production is a key indicator of the performance of anaerobic bioreactors in this study the evolution of biogas including methane and hydrogen was monitored in both reactors fig 1 a during stage i the observed methane production increased from 2 0 to 6 9 l d 1 in r0 and from 1 9 to 6 7 l d 1 in r1 while the hydrogen production remained at a low but stable level of 0 1 l d 1 in both reactors this indicates that both anaerobic reactors were successfully started up and operated similarly with the start of stage ii days 25 420 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone was fed into r1 over time methane production in r1 decreased gradually reaching a minimum of 3 8 l d 1 on day 260 corresponding to 61 7 of the production in the control column r0 on day 260 6 1 l d 1 while a previous report indicated that the 20 inhibition concentration ic20 of roxarsone on acetoclastic methanogenic activity was 66 0 mg l 1 sierra alvarez et al 2004 and the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity was less susceptible to roxarsone sierra alvarez et al 2010 in this study the selected concentration of roxarsone 5 0 mg l 1 which was 10 times lower than the ic20 induced a 40 reduction on the overall methane production the observed reduction in the methane production can be attributed to the synergetic inhibition of roxarsone and its arsenical metabolites during anaerobic digestion methane is predominantly produced via two pathways i e either i an acetoclastic or ii a hydrogenotrophic pathway abbasi et al 2012 in our study the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas fig s1 and hydrogen fig 1a occurred during days 65 131 and days 135 316 respectively indicating the successive inhibition on the activity of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens due to the exposure to roxarsone and its metabolites furthermore the difference in methane production between both reactors ranged from 0 3 to 2 3 l d 1 during days 64 364 suggesting that 148 1104 mg l 1 acetate equivalent vfas should accumulate in r1 based on a previously reported anaerobic digestion model blumensaat and keller 2005 the so calculated vfa concentrations were 1 15 times larger than the observed vfa concentrations in r1 fig s1 therefore implying that the metabolic pathways of sucrose might have been changed or that the hydrolysis and acidification might have been inhibited after day 280 the methane production in r1 progressively increased before plateauing at a stable level of 5 7 0 1 l d 1 during days 364 420 accounting for 91 4 of that in r0 this reflects an almost complete restoration of the expected methane production in r1 the accumulation of vfas and hydrogen started to decline after day 260 and day 322 respectively figs 1a and s1b suggesting the recovery of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity and explaining the observed restoration of the original methane production to further elucidate the processes controlling the long term impacts of roxarsone on methanogenesis the acetoclastic sma was determined bi monthly fig 1b during stage i the acetoclastic sma in both reactor was similar reaching 230 ml ch4 g vs d 1 at the end on day 24 after the start of stage ii upon amending 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone to the inflow solution the acetoclastic sma in r1 decreased from 234 ml ch4 g vs d 1 on day 48 to an undetectable level on days 205 270 before eventually recovering to 210 ml ch4 g vs d 1 in contrast in r0 the acetoclastic sma remained at a stable level of 240 ml ch4 g vs d 1 over the entire stage ii these results confirmed i that the acetoclastic sma was seriously suppressed and ii that this suppression was restorable although in r1 the acetoclastic sma was completely inhibited during days 205 270 the methane production remained in the range between 3 8 and 5 2 l d 1 this indicates that the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were not completely inhibited and were indeed the primary contributor of the methane production during this period this is in good agreement with previous studies that suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogens have a higher tolerance towards roxarsone than acetoclastic methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2010 in contrast the observed capacity to restore the methanogenic activity was somewhat more contradictory to previous studies shui et al 2016 sierra alvarez et al 2010 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 where 20 350 mg l 1 roxarsone showed to exert an exhaustive and irreversible inhibition on the methanogenic activity the observed lower level of inhibition probably originated from the lower roxarsone concentrations that was employed in our study given that the toxicity of roxarsone and of its metabolites has previously shown to be concentration dependent sierra alvarez et al 2004 while feeding these lower concentrations of roxarsone on the short term induced an inhibition of the methanogenic activity the activity was eventually restored after an acclimatization phase note that arsenic concentrations in typical swine manure wastewater are in the same range or somewhat lower than the concentration selected in this study makris et al 2008 zhai et al 2017 accordingly in many cases the impact of organoarsenicals on methanogenic performance might only be temporal and negligible for long term operations of full scale anaerobic reactors that treat swine manure wastewater 3 2 roxarsone biotransformation roxarsone can be microbially converted into various arsenic species with each species having a different level of toxicity to microorganisms including methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2004 tang et al 2020 in this study the roxarsone biotransformation reactions were investigated to better understand the fluctuations in the microbial activity that occurred in column r1 roxarsone was only detected in the first week after roxarsone amendment was started fig 2 a hapa concentration increased dramatically and reached 0 63 1 01 mg as l 1 accounting for 68 3 90 8 of the total arsenic inorganic arsenic concentrations remained at 0 01 0 10 mg l 1 whereby as iii was dominant this result was consistent with previous investigations shui et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 that showed that roxarsone was easily transformed to hapa through reducing the nitro to an amino group while hapa remained resistant to the cleavage of the c as bond in addition several unknown organic arsenic species were observed their concentrations increased slowly from 0 004 to 0 24 mg as l 1 based on our previous study tang et al 2020 these organic arsenic species might be the intermediates of hapa degradation such as trivalent hapa 4 hydroxy 3 amino phenylarsenite and phenylarsenite due to the instability of these trivalent organic arsenic species it is difficult to quantify them individually apart from arsenic discharge with the effluent arsenic accumulation in the sludge is another important factor affecting arsenic fate tang et al 2017 2021a based on a mass balance for arsenic in r1 31 2 38 0 of the amended arsenic mass remained accumulated in the reactor with arsenic concentrations in the ags increasing from 5 to 1274 mg kg 1 ts fig 2b after the 420 day long operation of r1 precipitated arsenic was the dominant arsenic species in the ags followed by extracellular arsenic and intracellular arsenic the extracellular and intracellular arsenic were exchangeable and therefore had a higher bioaccessibility and biotoxicity whereby the exchangeable as iii was the most toxic to methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2004 the intracellular arsenic accumulation rate decreased gradually fig 2b and the intracellular as iii percentage in the ags declined from 40 8 on day 270 to 25 8 on day 420 fig s3 this reflects an increasing arsenic resistance of ags and enhanced ability to protect arsenic from piercing into cells possibly related to the restoration of the methanogenic activity that we observed to occur simultaneously fig 1 3 3 response of ags to roxarsone loading 3 3 1 changes in granular size ags has been extensively applied in anaerobic reactors due to its superior settling performance and its high efficiency mu et al 2012 granular size has shown to be a crucial physical parameter that impacts the performance of anaerobic reactors wu et al 2016 fig 3 illustrates the observed size changes in both reactors during stage i ags remained at a stable diameter of 1 7 mm in both reactors reflecting that both reactors were started up analogously however during stage ii with roxarsone addition only occurring in r1 the granular size in both reactors increased in parallel to 1 8 mm during days 25 48 afterwards the granular size began to decrease slowly reaching 1 26 mm in r1 on day 352 equivalent to 64 0 of the size found in r0 at the corresponding time we hypothesize this effect to be related to the change in arsenic speciation that occurred in r1 during days 25 48 organoarsenicals e g roxarsone and hapa dominated in r1 fig 2a subsequently however inorganic arsenic species that have a higher toxicity were released thereby posing an adverse impact on the ags after day 352 the granular size in r0 and r1 became once more stable and remained at a size of 2 0 and 1 2 mm respectively the 34 1 reduction in granular size within r1 that occurred over the duration of the roxarsone amendment is very likely connected with the production of roxarsone metabolites interestingly the on going reduction in granular size from day 270 to day 352 was accompanied by the full restoration of methanogenic activity rather than its further inhibition fig 1 therefore we speculate that the reduction in granular size might have been a self adaption process under the prevailing roxarsone loaded conditions this would be consistent with previous reports wu et al 2016 that small particle sizes enable the ags to reduce the mass transfer efficiency thereby reducing the toxic loading imposed by roxarsone and its metabolites on the ags also sierra alvarez et al 2004 reported that fine anaerobic sludge exhibited a higher capability to sequestrate as iii due to a higher surface area compared to larger sized ags similarly smaller sized ags possessing a higher surface area would be expected to provide more binding sites that can sequester the newly produced arsenic species in this study this hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the restoration of the original methane production capacity despite the decreasing granular size that was observed in r1 3 3 2 changes in ags morphology given that the minimum methane production in r1 fig 1 and a rapidly increasing difference in granular size between r0 and r1 fig 3 occurred on day 270 the morphology of the ags samples that were collected on day 270 from the two reactors was more closely inspected and compared this showed that the ags in r0 was regularly sphere or oval and had a black and smooth surface fig 4 a whereas the ags in r1 was coated with a gray and rough eps layer fig 4c this indicates that the long term exposure to roxarsone greatly altered the ags morphology the coating of eps might be a self protection mechanism of the ags against toxic arsenic compounds fang et al 2002 sheng et al 2005 shui et al 2016 reported a similar result i e that the presence of 13 2 25 0 mg l 1 roxarsone endowed the ags with a yellow green eps layer to further uncover the morphology of the ags beneath the eps layer the two ags samples were soaked in a phosphate buffer and treated with ultrasound to remove the external eps layer while the treated ags in r0 exhibited a black and shiny surface fig 4b the treated ags collected from r1 showed a black surface with obviously tarnished aeras and many fractures on its edges fig 4d this indicates that the outer microorganisms of the ags in r1 were falling off therefore at least partially explaining the reduction in ags size fig 3 3 3 3 changes in eps secretion and distribution eps is commonly observed in ags the existence of multiple functional groups in eps e g sh cooh and oh can protect microbes within the ags from adverse influences that may be caused by many toxic substances such as aromatics and metal loid s sheng et al 2010 therefore clarifying the changes in eps secretion over the course of the experiment may allow to better understand how the methanogenic activity of the ags was restored under the stress of roxarsone during stage i without roxarsone amendment an analogous increase in eps excretions was observed in both r0 and r1 with protein and carbohydrate concentrations increasing from 133 5 to 190 mg g 1 ts and from 91 4 to 120 mg g 1 ts respectively fig 5 during stage ii the total concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates ranged from 248 7 to 339 1 mg g 1 ts in r1 and were therefore significantly higher than those observed in r0 136 0 273 2 mg g 1 ts p 0 01 this difference is most likely associated with the imposed roxarsone exposure since this triggered that more eps especially proteins were secreted to protect the microorganisms under the prevailing toxin stress sheng et al 2010 the higher ratio of protein to carbohydrate in r1 1 58 1 60 compared to r0 1 13 1 38 that occurred in the period between day 100 and day 270 further underpins this hypothesis furthermore given that as iii might be sequestered by sh associated with proteins gadd 2019 an increased protein excretion in r1 might have assisted the microbes to be detoxified of as iii the results indicate that the increasing excretion of eps especially proteins might be a self protection mechanism of the ags as it was exposed to roxarsone to further investigate the eps distribution within the ags under roxarsone amended conditions the ags samples collected on day 20 start up stage day 270 inhibition phase and day 420 restoration phase were analyzed using fluorescence labeling and clsm techniques at the end of the start up stage the image of the ags in r1 20 ags1 was identical to that in r0 20 ags0 fig 6 both ags samples contained abundant polysaccharides and were coated with a polysaccharide protein layer the interior of the ags showed a large number of distributed cavities which might have provided pathways for an effective mass transfer li et al 2010 and biogas emission jiang et al 2016 on day 270 i e after a 250 day long exposure to roxarsone the proteins and polysaccharides of the ags 270 ags1 were more densely distributed in r1 compared to r0 and the cavities prevailing in the interior of the ags were enlarged given that the multi layered structure of ags implied that methanogens primarily inhabited the interior of the ags liu et al 2002 we speculate that the methanogenic activity was inhibited by roxarsone and its metabolites therefore explaining the decline in methane production during this period fig 1 zhang et al 2014 also reported that in their study cleavages in the ags were caused by the inhibition of 350 mg l 1 roxarsone on methanogens with the continuous feeding of roxarsone in r1 the cavities were further enlarged and the ags surface 420 ags1 was fractured and ready for spalling consistent with the ags morphology results fig 4 considering the observed restoration of the methanogenic activity during stage ii fig 1 we speculate that the surface spalling of the ags was the primary process underpinning the adaptation to the roxarsone amended conditions rather than a performance deterioration to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms a live dead staining procedure for the ags collected in r1 on days 20 270 and 420 was performed fig s4 it showed that on day 270 the interior and parts of the external surface of ags contained a large number of dead microorganisms and that the decay of external microorganisms was further exacerbated on day 420 this indicates that the outer microbes of the ags died due to the long term exposure to roxarsone which then caused the detachment from the ags 3 3 4 microbial community evolution microbes are the core of ags and the microbial community structure is the controlling factor for bioreactor performance the tolerance to roxarsone and its metabolites differs between various microbes within anaerobic sludge sierra alvarez et al 2004 therefore this 420 day exposure to roxarsone amended conditions might have reshaped the microbial community structure addressing this issue ags samples were collected from both reactors on day 0 raw ags day 270 inhibition phase and day 420 restoration phase to document and analyze microbial community evolution the results showed that some modest changes in the bacterial operational taxonomic units otus occurred during the 420 day operation the archaeal otus decreased from 1260 to 906 in r1 while remaining at a stable level of 1200 in r0 table s2 this indicates a lowered tolerance of archaea to roxarsone and its metabolites compared to bacteria the observed decrease in the shannon index and the increase in the simpson index for archaea in r1 table s2 suggest a reduction in archaea diversity further confirming the susceptibility of archaea to arsenical compounds levilinea 21 7 and sulfurovum 21 5 both typical acetogenic bacteria amin et al 2021 were found to be the dominant bacteria in the raw ags fig 7 a however after 270 days of reactor operation the bacterial community composition was greatly altered in both reactors in r0 megasphaera 3 4 12 7 clostridium sensu stricto 1 6 12 0 olsenella 3 3 6 1 treponema 4 3 5 5 and desulfovibrio 4 9 8 8 became the dominating fermentative acidogenic bacteria on day 270 and remained similar in the samples collected on day 420 in the ags collected from r1 olsenella 11 0 megasphaera 8 0 clostridium sensu stricto 8 0 brooklawnia 6 0 and alloprevotella 5 6 were dominant on day 270 among the identified bacteria olsenella and alloprevotella were responsible for glycolysis with lactate and succinate being the main transformation products respectively downes et al 2013 lambrecht et al 2019 this indicates that the change of sucrose metabolic pathways might have been the main reason for the low level of vfas while methanogenesis was inhibited fig 1 on day 420 the bacterial composition in r1 was comparable to that in r0 except for the significantly higher abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 9 6 and salinispira 4 4 salinispira is a fermentative bacterium that exclusively metabolizes glucose ben hania et al 2015 clostridium species were previously demonstrated to be the main contributors for degrading roxarsone stolz et al 2007 and active in vfa fermentation jiang et al 2011 accordingly the increasing relative abundance of clostridium sensu stricto and salinispira in r1 might reflect the increase in roxarsone degrading activity which was consistent with the performance recovery observed in r1 methanogens as archaea are the most important microbes for anaerobic digestion therefore archaeal composition analysis is beneficial for understanding the inhibition of methanogenesis and similarly its restoration in r1 methanothrix was found to be the primary methanogen in the raw ags fig 7b i e a typical acetoclastic methanogen zhao et al 2020 after the 270 day operation methanothrix abundance decreased from 80 3 to 16 9 in r1 much lower than that 27 9 in r0 acetoclastic methanogens have previously been demonstrated to be more susceptible to roxarsone and its metabolites than hydrogenotrophic methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2010 therefore this provides a plausible explanation for the restricted growth of methanothrix hydrogenotrophic methanogens i e methanobacterium 37 5 methanolinea 37 8 methanomassiliicoccus 4 0 and methanoregula 2 0 dominated in r1 fig 7b with a total relative abundance of 80 however a decrease of the hydrogen utilization rate and hydrogen accumulation was observed in r1 during days 135 316 fig 1 this indicates that the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens also suffered somewhat from inhibition or even experienced lethal damage due to the amendment of roxarsone the cell viability that was tested through the live dead staining confirmed that there were many inactivated microbes distributed across the interior of the ags collected on day 270 from r1 fig s4 which was mainly colonized by methanogens liu et al 2002 after the 420 day operation the relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogens methanothrix had ultimately increased to 70 0 in r1 whereas hydrogenotrophic methanogen abundance decreased to 28 6 this indicates that the inhibition of roxarsone and its metabolites on methanothrix was restorable even under roxarsone loaded conditions furthermore the hydrogenotrophic methanogens despite their decreased relative abundance were capable of decreasing hydrogen accumulation in r1 thus indicating the restoration of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity accordingly the recovery of the methane production in r1 can be mainly attributed to the enrichment of acetoclastic methanogen methanothrix and the recovery of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity 3 4 implications this study demonstrated that roxarsone exposure caused a temporary inhibition in the ags methanogenic activity followed by a complete recovery back to pre exposure activity levels this behavior contrasts with the results from previous studies shui et al 2016 sierra alvarez et al 2010 where roxarsone exposure was found to induce an irreversible inhibition of methanogenesis however it should be noted that the roxarsone concentrations that were employed in our study which correspond well to arsenic levels in typical swine wastewater jin and chang 2011 zhai et al 2017 were 4 70 times lower than the previously tested concentrations shui et al 2016 sierra alvarez et al 2010 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 therefore our study is likely to provide a more realistic foundation for determining the efficiency and stability of anaerobic digestion systems that are used for the treatment of organoarsenic contaminated livestock wastewaters our results indicate that from a long term perspective anaerobic digestion of livestock wastewater can proceed efficiently reliably and mostly unaffected by endogenous organoarsenicals however it is important to be mindful that in this process anaerobic sludge becomes an important sink of arsenic due to its successive accumulation during the treatment of the organoarsenic contaminated wastewater given that nearly 50 of the accumulated arsenic within anaerobic sludge is exchangeable ji et al 2017 tang et al 2017 and therefore easily mobilized this can impose a serious environmental threat once the waste sludge is discharged and disposed of future studies need to evaluate the risk of arsenic leaching from the anaerobic sludge and develop efficient strategies for effectively securing that arsenic remains immobilized 4 conclusions in this study the response of ags to the loading of 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone in a uasb reactor was comprehensively investigated over a period of 420 days the results clearly demonstrate that 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone exerted a temporal inhibition of up to 40 on the methanogenic activity and that the inhibition was eventually fully reversed roxarsone fate in the reactor indicated an increasing capability of the ags to prevent arsenic from piercing into cells the reduction in granular size and the analysis of the ags morphology and clsm images demonstrated that roxarsone exposure stimulated the excretion of eps and the surface spalling of ags high throughput sequencing analysis further indicated that lactate producing olsenella became the dominant fermentative bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens methanothrix was severely inhibited when methane production was inhibited by roxarsone vfas producing bacteria and methanothrix were enriched again towards the end of the experimental period overall the findings of this study will improve the understanding of the effect of organoarsenicals on ags efficiency and provide highly beneficial information for the design of anaerobic treatment processes

16644,extensive use of organoarsenic feed additives such as roxarsone has caused organoarsenicals to occur in livestock wastewater and further within anaerobic wastewater treatment systems currently information on the long term impacts of roxarsone on anaerobic granular sludge ags activity and the underlying mechanisms is very limited in this study the response of ags to long term loading of roxarsone was investigated using a laboratory up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor spiked with 5 0 mg l 1 of roxarsone under the effect of roxarsone methane production decreased by 40 due to the complete inhibition on acetoclastic methanogenic activity on day 260 before being restored eventually over 30 of the influent arsenic was accumulated in the ags and the capability of ags to prevent intracellular as iii accumulation increased with time the ags size was reduced by 30 to 1 20 1 26 mm based on morphology and confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis roxarsone exposure stimulated the excretion of extracellular polymeric substances and the surface spalling of ags high throughput sequencing analysis further indicated roxarsone initially altered the acidogenic pathway and severely inhibited the acetoclastic methanogen methanothrix acetogenic bacteria and methanothrix were finally enriched and became the main contributor for a full restoration of the initial methane production these findings provide a deeper understanding on the effect of organoarsenicals on ags which is highly beneficial for the effective anaerobic treatment of organoarsenic bearing wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords roxarsone methanogenic activity anaerobic granular sludge extracellular polymeric substance microbial community 1 introduction roxarsone 4 hydroxy 3 nitro phenylarsonic acid has globally been used for decades as an organoarsenic feed additive to control coccidiosis infection and improve pigmentation and growth hu et al 2019 mangalgiri et al 2015 the allowable limit of roxarsone dosage is 50 mg kg 1 for poultry feed and 100 mg kg 1 for pig feed respectively mangalgiri et al 2015 due to the concern on arsenic residue in animal products and the associated human health risk the use of organoarsenic feed additives including roxarsone has been successively banned in europe since 1999 the usa since 2013 china since 2019 etc hu et al 2019 however their use in animal feeding operations is still approved in many developing countries such as argentina brazil india and vietnam as summarized in our previous study tang et al 2021a as roxarsone is poorly metabolized by animals 90 of dietary roxarsone is excreted without any chemical transformation fei et al 2018 thereby causing livestock waste or and wastewater to be contaminated by arsenic zhai et al 2017 previous studies have indicated that arsenic concentrations can reach levels of up to 119 mg kg 1 in manure li and chen 2005 and up to 0 44 mg l 1 in swine wastewater makris et al 2008 zhai et al 2017 once released to the natural environment either via discharge of wastewater or through land application the organoarsenicals such as roxarsone tend to be converted to more toxic inorganic forms that jeopardize water and soil security fei et al 2018 makris et al 2008 swine wastewater typically has a high biological oxygen demand bod that ranges from 2000 to 30 000 mg l 1 nagarajan et al 2019 anaerobic digestion is a widely used technique for a rigorous treatment of these wastewaters because of the option for biogas recovery and due to the low operational cost lourinho et al 2020 the core of anaerobic digesters consists of anaerobic sludge which prevails as floc or in granular form compared to floc sludge anaerobic granular sludge ags consists of denser aggregates with a multilayered architecture he et al 2019 from the outer toward the inner layer ags contains a distinct sequence of dominant microorganisms including acidogens hydrogenogens syntrophic microorganisms and methanogens satoh et al 2007 in addition to the microorganisms microbially excreted extracellular polymeric substances eps are another important component of ags protecting microbes against external adverse conditions such as toxic chemicals sheng et al 2010 roxarsone has been previously demonstrated to exert a negative impact on the activity of various microbes including that of methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2010 tang et al 2021b for example sierra alvarez et al 2004 found that under methanogenic conditions the 50 inhibition concentration ic50 of roxarsone on acetoclastic methanogenic activity of floc sludge was 112 mg l 1 while less susceptible than acetoclastic methanogenic activity hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity was still inhibited by 60 in the presence of 263 mg l 1 roxarsone sierra alvarez et al 2010 this inhibition is thought to be caused not only by roxarsone itself but also by its anaerobic degradation products i e 4 hydroxy 3 amino phenylarsonic acid hapa methylated arsenic arsenate as v and arsenite as iii cortinas et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 these arsenical transformation products appear to have a higher toxicity towards methanogens than roxarsone itself sierra alvarez et al 2010 2004 especially noteworthy is the toxicity of as iii towards methanogens which is 100 times higher than that of roxarsone based on their ic50 on methanogenic activity sierra alvarez et al 2004 our previous investigations that used ags as inoculums indicated that methane production was completely suppressed by roxarsone at levels of 60 120 mg l 1 in batch experiments tang et al 2019 and at even lower levels of 25 mg l 1 in a continuous up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor shui et al 2016 importantly the observed inhibition appeared to be irreversible and the toxicity of arsenic to be closely concentration dependent sierra alvarez et al 2004 the roxarsone concentrations reported to critically impact anaerobic digestion ranged between 20 and 350 mg l 1 shui et al 2016 sierra alvarez et al 2010 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 i e at least one order of magnitude higher than concentrations in typical swine wastewaters makris et al 2008 zhai et al 2017 clearly for an efficient wastewater treatment a more robust understanding of the response of the ags to the long term loading of low concentrations of roxarsone is of great significance in this new experimental study we operated a laboratory scale uasb reactor setup for 420 days and now analyze the collected data to generate a deeper and more process based understanding of the response of ags to roxarsone starting from a macro scale perspective and moving towards the micro scale we exploit various experimental techniques and approaches our main objectives were to a evaluate the long term impact of roxarsone on methanogenic activity b analyze and understand the biotransformation reactions affecting roxarsone fate within the reactor c elucidate the changes in structure and eps of the ags using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm d and investigate the shifts in microbial community structure using high throughput sequencing technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic granular sludge the ags used in this study was taken from an anaerobic reactor treating citric acid wastewater in bengbu china the particle diameter total solid ts content volatile solid vs content and the specific methanogenic activity sma of the ags were 1 5 2 0 mm 14 0 0 7 10 8 0 5 and 138 12 ml ch4 g vs d 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design the experimental investigation was carried out in two identical 3 l uasb reactors with a diameter of 100 mm one of the two reactors r0 was operated as control and not fed with roxarsone while r1 was fed with roxarsone to ensure the analytical precision of our analysis the initial roxarsone concentration was set at 5 0 mg l 1 which corresponds to 1 43 mg l 1 arsenic the employed concentration was therefore while at a similar level somewhat higher by 1 mg l 1 than typical arsenic concentration in real swine wastewater e g concentrations of 0 21 0 44 mg l 1 as reported by zhai et al 2017 and 0 004 0 53 mg l 1 as reported by jin and chang 2011 both reactors were inoculated with 25 g ts l 1 ags and operated at 35 2 c with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 0 5 day and a sludge retention time of 63 days the synthetic wastewater was amended with roxarsone and sucrose table 1 as well as other necessary mineral elements as described in our previous study tang et al 2020 both reactors were operated in two distinct stages table 1 during stage i days 0 24 both reactors were started up and acclimatized while inflow sucrose concentrations where successively increased from 1 0 to 3 0 g l 1 equivalent to biodegradable chemical oxygen demand cod increase from 1 1 to 3 4 g l 1 as a result the volumetric organic loading rates and sludge organic loading rates of both reactors increased from 2 2 to 6 8 kg cod m 3 d 1 and from 0 11 to 0 34 kg cod kg 3 vs d 1 respectively no roxarsone was amended during stage i during stage ii days 25 420 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone was amended to the inflow solution in r1 the volumetric and sludge organic loading rates of both reactors remained at 6 8 kg cod m 3 d 1 and 0 34 kg cod kg 3 vs d 1 respectively biogas production was monitored regularly in both reactors and roxarsone biotransformations in r1 were measured to investigate the influence of roxarsone on methanogenic activity ags samples were withdrawn at the intervals ranging between 20 and 65 days from both reactors to determine the acetoclastic sma i e one of the most important indicators for the evaluation on methanogenic activity of the ags particle size eps and arsenic concentrations the ags samples collected on day 20 start up phase day 270 methanogenesis inhibition phase and day 420 methanogenesis restoration phase were used to analyze the changes in ags morphology eps distribution and microbial community 2 3 chemical analysis the volume and composition of biogas were measured using a custom made electronic counter and a gas chromatograph model sp 6890 lu nan respectively shui et al 2016 the average particle diameters and the morphology of the ags were evaluated using a microscope cx41 olympus equipped with a digital camera dschx1 sony di and torregrossa 2013 eps of the ags was extracted using the cation exchange resin method frølund et al 1996 the protein and carbohydrate concentrations were determined using a modified lorry method komsa penkova et al 1996 and the phenol sulfuric acid method masuko et al 2005 respectively the acetoclastic sma of the ags was estimated using a modified batch experiment based on the method reported by astals et al 2015 in brief 2 g cod l 1 of acetate 2 g vs l 1 of the ags and essential trace elements were added in a serum bottle with the working volume of 50 ml under anaerobic conditions the methane production was monitored every two hours the methane production rate was defined as the slope of a linear regression fitting of the cumulative methane production y axis and time x axis based on the data collected from the stable methanogenesis stage the acetoclastic sma in ml ch4 g vs d 1 was calculated by dividing the methane production rate by the amount of the ags added organoarsenicals including roxarsone and hapa were determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity agilent technologies and inorganic arsenic was determined using hplc hydrogen generation atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs8220 titan as previously tested and reported by tang et al 2020 the ags withdrawn from r1 was extracted three times using a mixed reagent of 20 g l 1 k2hpo4 and h3po4 mix ratio 200 3 v v at 40 c to obtain extracellular exchangeable arsenic before being disrupted with an ultrasonic cell disruptor vcx150 sonics and further extracted three times using the same reagent mentioned above to gain intracellular exchangeable arsenic tang et al 2017 after the extraction the ags residue was used for the determination of precipitated arsenic 2 4 visual observation of eps distribution in the ags the spatial distribution of polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids in the ags was visualized using a technique that combines fluorescence labeling with clsm lsm 710 zeiss zhang et al 2020 the ags was successively stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma lectins concanavalin a con a thermo fisher scientific calcofluor white sigma and syto 63 sigma to trace the proteins α β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and nucleic acid respectively table s1 after each staining the ags was washed using 1 pbs buffer to eliminate the residual stains the stained granules were embedded with an o c t compound sakura finetek frozen at 20 c and sectioned into 60 μm slices for the clsm observation 2 5 high throughput sequencing a high throughput sequencing technique was used to analyze the microbial community structure within the ags the dna in the ags samples was extracted using an e z n a mag bind soil dna kit closely following the manufacturer s instructions to amplify the bacterial dna in v3 v4 regions two rounds of polymerase chain reaction pcr were performed using 341f 805r primer pairs and illumina bridge type pcr compatible primers respectively hugerth et al 2014 for amplifying archaeal dna in v3 v4 regions three rounds of pcr were conducted using m 340f gu1st 1000r 349f 806r and illumina bridge type pcr compatible primer pairs respectively pausan et al 2019 the pcr products were purified and recovered for high throughput sequencing 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of roxarsone on methanogenic activity methane production is a key indicator of the performance of anaerobic bioreactors in this study the evolution of biogas including methane and hydrogen was monitored in both reactors fig 1 a during stage i the observed methane production increased from 2 0 to 6 9 l d 1 in r0 and from 1 9 to 6 7 l d 1 in r1 while the hydrogen production remained at a low but stable level of 0 1 l d 1 in both reactors this indicates that both anaerobic reactors were successfully started up and operated similarly with the start of stage ii days 25 420 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone was fed into r1 over time methane production in r1 decreased gradually reaching a minimum of 3 8 l d 1 on day 260 corresponding to 61 7 of the production in the control column r0 on day 260 6 1 l d 1 while a previous report indicated that the 20 inhibition concentration ic20 of roxarsone on acetoclastic methanogenic activity was 66 0 mg l 1 sierra alvarez et al 2004 and the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity was less susceptible to roxarsone sierra alvarez et al 2010 in this study the selected concentration of roxarsone 5 0 mg l 1 which was 10 times lower than the ic20 induced a 40 reduction on the overall methane production the observed reduction in the methane production can be attributed to the synergetic inhibition of roxarsone and its arsenical metabolites during anaerobic digestion methane is predominantly produced via two pathways i e either i an acetoclastic or ii a hydrogenotrophic pathway abbasi et al 2012 in our study the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfas fig s1 and hydrogen fig 1a occurred during days 65 131 and days 135 316 respectively indicating the successive inhibition on the activity of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens due to the exposure to roxarsone and its metabolites furthermore the difference in methane production between both reactors ranged from 0 3 to 2 3 l d 1 during days 64 364 suggesting that 148 1104 mg l 1 acetate equivalent vfas should accumulate in r1 based on a previously reported anaerobic digestion model blumensaat and keller 2005 the so calculated vfa concentrations were 1 15 times larger than the observed vfa concentrations in r1 fig s1 therefore implying that the metabolic pathways of sucrose might have been changed or that the hydrolysis and acidification might have been inhibited after day 280 the methane production in r1 progressively increased before plateauing at a stable level of 5 7 0 1 l d 1 during days 364 420 accounting for 91 4 of that in r0 this reflects an almost complete restoration of the expected methane production in r1 the accumulation of vfas and hydrogen started to decline after day 260 and day 322 respectively figs 1a and s1b suggesting the recovery of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity and explaining the observed restoration of the original methane production to further elucidate the processes controlling the long term impacts of roxarsone on methanogenesis the acetoclastic sma was determined bi monthly fig 1b during stage i the acetoclastic sma in both reactor was similar reaching 230 ml ch4 g vs d 1 at the end on day 24 after the start of stage ii upon amending 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone to the inflow solution the acetoclastic sma in r1 decreased from 234 ml ch4 g vs d 1 on day 48 to an undetectable level on days 205 270 before eventually recovering to 210 ml ch4 g vs d 1 in contrast in r0 the acetoclastic sma remained at a stable level of 240 ml ch4 g vs d 1 over the entire stage ii these results confirmed i that the acetoclastic sma was seriously suppressed and ii that this suppression was restorable although in r1 the acetoclastic sma was completely inhibited during days 205 270 the methane production remained in the range between 3 8 and 5 2 l d 1 this indicates that the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were not completely inhibited and were indeed the primary contributor of the methane production during this period this is in good agreement with previous studies that suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogens have a higher tolerance towards roxarsone than acetoclastic methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2010 in contrast the observed capacity to restore the methanogenic activity was somewhat more contradictory to previous studies shui et al 2016 sierra alvarez et al 2010 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 where 20 350 mg l 1 roxarsone showed to exert an exhaustive and irreversible inhibition on the methanogenic activity the observed lower level of inhibition probably originated from the lower roxarsone concentrations that was employed in our study given that the toxicity of roxarsone and of its metabolites has previously shown to be concentration dependent sierra alvarez et al 2004 while feeding these lower concentrations of roxarsone on the short term induced an inhibition of the methanogenic activity the activity was eventually restored after an acclimatization phase note that arsenic concentrations in typical swine manure wastewater are in the same range or somewhat lower than the concentration selected in this study makris et al 2008 zhai et al 2017 accordingly in many cases the impact of organoarsenicals on methanogenic performance might only be temporal and negligible for long term operations of full scale anaerobic reactors that treat swine manure wastewater 3 2 roxarsone biotransformation roxarsone can be microbially converted into various arsenic species with each species having a different level of toxicity to microorganisms including methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2004 tang et al 2020 in this study the roxarsone biotransformation reactions were investigated to better understand the fluctuations in the microbial activity that occurred in column r1 roxarsone was only detected in the first week after roxarsone amendment was started fig 2 a hapa concentration increased dramatically and reached 0 63 1 01 mg as l 1 accounting for 68 3 90 8 of the total arsenic inorganic arsenic concentrations remained at 0 01 0 10 mg l 1 whereby as iii was dominant this result was consistent with previous investigations shui et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 that showed that roxarsone was easily transformed to hapa through reducing the nitro to an amino group while hapa remained resistant to the cleavage of the c as bond in addition several unknown organic arsenic species were observed their concentrations increased slowly from 0 004 to 0 24 mg as l 1 based on our previous study tang et al 2020 these organic arsenic species might be the intermediates of hapa degradation such as trivalent hapa 4 hydroxy 3 amino phenylarsenite and phenylarsenite due to the instability of these trivalent organic arsenic species it is difficult to quantify them individually apart from arsenic discharge with the effluent arsenic accumulation in the sludge is another important factor affecting arsenic fate tang et al 2017 2021a based on a mass balance for arsenic in r1 31 2 38 0 of the amended arsenic mass remained accumulated in the reactor with arsenic concentrations in the ags increasing from 5 to 1274 mg kg 1 ts fig 2b after the 420 day long operation of r1 precipitated arsenic was the dominant arsenic species in the ags followed by extracellular arsenic and intracellular arsenic the extracellular and intracellular arsenic were exchangeable and therefore had a higher bioaccessibility and biotoxicity whereby the exchangeable as iii was the most toxic to methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2004 the intracellular arsenic accumulation rate decreased gradually fig 2b and the intracellular as iii percentage in the ags declined from 40 8 on day 270 to 25 8 on day 420 fig s3 this reflects an increasing arsenic resistance of ags and enhanced ability to protect arsenic from piercing into cells possibly related to the restoration of the methanogenic activity that we observed to occur simultaneously fig 1 3 3 response of ags to roxarsone loading 3 3 1 changes in granular size ags has been extensively applied in anaerobic reactors due to its superior settling performance and its high efficiency mu et al 2012 granular size has shown to be a crucial physical parameter that impacts the performance of anaerobic reactors wu et al 2016 fig 3 illustrates the observed size changes in both reactors during stage i ags remained at a stable diameter of 1 7 mm in both reactors reflecting that both reactors were started up analogously however during stage ii with roxarsone addition only occurring in r1 the granular size in both reactors increased in parallel to 1 8 mm during days 25 48 afterwards the granular size began to decrease slowly reaching 1 26 mm in r1 on day 352 equivalent to 64 0 of the size found in r0 at the corresponding time we hypothesize this effect to be related to the change in arsenic speciation that occurred in r1 during days 25 48 organoarsenicals e g roxarsone and hapa dominated in r1 fig 2a subsequently however inorganic arsenic species that have a higher toxicity were released thereby posing an adverse impact on the ags after day 352 the granular size in r0 and r1 became once more stable and remained at a size of 2 0 and 1 2 mm respectively the 34 1 reduction in granular size within r1 that occurred over the duration of the roxarsone amendment is very likely connected with the production of roxarsone metabolites interestingly the on going reduction in granular size from day 270 to day 352 was accompanied by the full restoration of methanogenic activity rather than its further inhibition fig 1 therefore we speculate that the reduction in granular size might have been a self adaption process under the prevailing roxarsone loaded conditions this would be consistent with previous reports wu et al 2016 that small particle sizes enable the ags to reduce the mass transfer efficiency thereby reducing the toxic loading imposed by roxarsone and its metabolites on the ags also sierra alvarez et al 2004 reported that fine anaerobic sludge exhibited a higher capability to sequestrate as iii due to a higher surface area compared to larger sized ags similarly smaller sized ags possessing a higher surface area would be expected to provide more binding sites that can sequester the newly produced arsenic species in this study this hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the restoration of the original methane production capacity despite the decreasing granular size that was observed in r1 3 3 2 changes in ags morphology given that the minimum methane production in r1 fig 1 and a rapidly increasing difference in granular size between r0 and r1 fig 3 occurred on day 270 the morphology of the ags samples that were collected on day 270 from the two reactors was more closely inspected and compared this showed that the ags in r0 was regularly sphere or oval and had a black and smooth surface fig 4 a whereas the ags in r1 was coated with a gray and rough eps layer fig 4c this indicates that the long term exposure to roxarsone greatly altered the ags morphology the coating of eps might be a self protection mechanism of the ags against toxic arsenic compounds fang et al 2002 sheng et al 2005 shui et al 2016 reported a similar result i e that the presence of 13 2 25 0 mg l 1 roxarsone endowed the ags with a yellow green eps layer to further uncover the morphology of the ags beneath the eps layer the two ags samples were soaked in a phosphate buffer and treated with ultrasound to remove the external eps layer while the treated ags in r0 exhibited a black and shiny surface fig 4b the treated ags collected from r1 showed a black surface with obviously tarnished aeras and many fractures on its edges fig 4d this indicates that the outer microorganisms of the ags in r1 were falling off therefore at least partially explaining the reduction in ags size fig 3 3 3 3 changes in eps secretion and distribution eps is commonly observed in ags the existence of multiple functional groups in eps e g sh cooh and oh can protect microbes within the ags from adverse influences that may be caused by many toxic substances such as aromatics and metal loid s sheng et al 2010 therefore clarifying the changes in eps secretion over the course of the experiment may allow to better understand how the methanogenic activity of the ags was restored under the stress of roxarsone during stage i without roxarsone amendment an analogous increase in eps excretions was observed in both r0 and r1 with protein and carbohydrate concentrations increasing from 133 5 to 190 mg g 1 ts and from 91 4 to 120 mg g 1 ts respectively fig 5 during stage ii the total concentrations of proteins and carbohydrates ranged from 248 7 to 339 1 mg g 1 ts in r1 and were therefore significantly higher than those observed in r0 136 0 273 2 mg g 1 ts p 0 01 this difference is most likely associated with the imposed roxarsone exposure since this triggered that more eps especially proteins were secreted to protect the microorganisms under the prevailing toxin stress sheng et al 2010 the higher ratio of protein to carbohydrate in r1 1 58 1 60 compared to r0 1 13 1 38 that occurred in the period between day 100 and day 270 further underpins this hypothesis furthermore given that as iii might be sequestered by sh associated with proteins gadd 2019 an increased protein excretion in r1 might have assisted the microbes to be detoxified of as iii the results indicate that the increasing excretion of eps especially proteins might be a self protection mechanism of the ags as it was exposed to roxarsone to further investigate the eps distribution within the ags under roxarsone amended conditions the ags samples collected on day 20 start up stage day 270 inhibition phase and day 420 restoration phase were analyzed using fluorescence labeling and clsm techniques at the end of the start up stage the image of the ags in r1 20 ags1 was identical to that in r0 20 ags0 fig 6 both ags samples contained abundant polysaccharides and were coated with a polysaccharide protein layer the interior of the ags showed a large number of distributed cavities which might have provided pathways for an effective mass transfer li et al 2010 and biogas emission jiang et al 2016 on day 270 i e after a 250 day long exposure to roxarsone the proteins and polysaccharides of the ags 270 ags1 were more densely distributed in r1 compared to r0 and the cavities prevailing in the interior of the ags were enlarged given that the multi layered structure of ags implied that methanogens primarily inhabited the interior of the ags liu et al 2002 we speculate that the methanogenic activity was inhibited by roxarsone and its metabolites therefore explaining the decline in methane production during this period fig 1 zhang et al 2014 also reported that in their study cleavages in the ags were caused by the inhibition of 350 mg l 1 roxarsone on methanogens with the continuous feeding of roxarsone in r1 the cavities were further enlarged and the ags surface 420 ags1 was fractured and ready for spalling consistent with the ags morphology results fig 4 considering the observed restoration of the methanogenic activity during stage ii fig 1 we speculate that the surface spalling of the ags was the primary process underpinning the adaptation to the roxarsone amended conditions rather than a performance deterioration to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms a live dead staining procedure for the ags collected in r1 on days 20 270 and 420 was performed fig s4 it showed that on day 270 the interior and parts of the external surface of ags contained a large number of dead microorganisms and that the decay of external microorganisms was further exacerbated on day 420 this indicates that the outer microbes of the ags died due to the long term exposure to roxarsone which then caused the detachment from the ags 3 3 4 microbial community evolution microbes are the core of ags and the microbial community structure is the controlling factor for bioreactor performance the tolerance to roxarsone and its metabolites differs between various microbes within anaerobic sludge sierra alvarez et al 2004 therefore this 420 day exposure to roxarsone amended conditions might have reshaped the microbial community structure addressing this issue ags samples were collected from both reactors on day 0 raw ags day 270 inhibition phase and day 420 restoration phase to document and analyze microbial community evolution the results showed that some modest changes in the bacterial operational taxonomic units otus occurred during the 420 day operation the archaeal otus decreased from 1260 to 906 in r1 while remaining at a stable level of 1200 in r0 table s2 this indicates a lowered tolerance of archaea to roxarsone and its metabolites compared to bacteria the observed decrease in the shannon index and the increase in the simpson index for archaea in r1 table s2 suggest a reduction in archaea diversity further confirming the susceptibility of archaea to arsenical compounds levilinea 21 7 and sulfurovum 21 5 both typical acetogenic bacteria amin et al 2021 were found to be the dominant bacteria in the raw ags fig 7 a however after 270 days of reactor operation the bacterial community composition was greatly altered in both reactors in r0 megasphaera 3 4 12 7 clostridium sensu stricto 1 6 12 0 olsenella 3 3 6 1 treponema 4 3 5 5 and desulfovibrio 4 9 8 8 became the dominating fermentative acidogenic bacteria on day 270 and remained similar in the samples collected on day 420 in the ags collected from r1 olsenella 11 0 megasphaera 8 0 clostridium sensu stricto 8 0 brooklawnia 6 0 and alloprevotella 5 6 were dominant on day 270 among the identified bacteria olsenella and alloprevotella were responsible for glycolysis with lactate and succinate being the main transformation products respectively downes et al 2013 lambrecht et al 2019 this indicates that the change of sucrose metabolic pathways might have been the main reason for the low level of vfas while methanogenesis was inhibited fig 1 on day 420 the bacterial composition in r1 was comparable to that in r0 except for the significantly higher abundance of clostridium sensu stricto 9 6 and salinispira 4 4 salinispira is a fermentative bacterium that exclusively metabolizes glucose ben hania et al 2015 clostridium species were previously demonstrated to be the main contributors for degrading roxarsone stolz et al 2007 and active in vfa fermentation jiang et al 2011 accordingly the increasing relative abundance of clostridium sensu stricto and salinispira in r1 might reflect the increase in roxarsone degrading activity which was consistent with the performance recovery observed in r1 methanogens as archaea are the most important microbes for anaerobic digestion therefore archaeal composition analysis is beneficial for understanding the inhibition of methanogenesis and similarly its restoration in r1 methanothrix was found to be the primary methanogen in the raw ags fig 7b i e a typical acetoclastic methanogen zhao et al 2020 after the 270 day operation methanothrix abundance decreased from 80 3 to 16 9 in r1 much lower than that 27 9 in r0 acetoclastic methanogens have previously been demonstrated to be more susceptible to roxarsone and its metabolites than hydrogenotrophic methanogens sierra alvarez et al 2010 therefore this provides a plausible explanation for the restricted growth of methanothrix hydrogenotrophic methanogens i e methanobacterium 37 5 methanolinea 37 8 methanomassiliicoccus 4 0 and methanoregula 2 0 dominated in r1 fig 7b with a total relative abundance of 80 however a decrease of the hydrogen utilization rate and hydrogen accumulation was observed in r1 during days 135 316 fig 1 this indicates that the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens also suffered somewhat from inhibition or even experienced lethal damage due to the amendment of roxarsone the cell viability that was tested through the live dead staining confirmed that there were many inactivated microbes distributed across the interior of the ags collected on day 270 from r1 fig s4 which was mainly colonized by methanogens liu et al 2002 after the 420 day operation the relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogens methanothrix had ultimately increased to 70 0 in r1 whereas hydrogenotrophic methanogen abundance decreased to 28 6 this indicates that the inhibition of roxarsone and its metabolites on methanothrix was restorable even under roxarsone loaded conditions furthermore the hydrogenotrophic methanogens despite their decreased relative abundance were capable of decreasing hydrogen accumulation in r1 thus indicating the restoration of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity accordingly the recovery of the methane production in r1 can be mainly attributed to the enrichment of acetoclastic methanogen methanothrix and the recovery of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity 3 4 implications this study demonstrated that roxarsone exposure caused a temporary inhibition in the ags methanogenic activity followed by a complete recovery back to pre exposure activity levels this behavior contrasts with the results from previous studies shui et al 2016 sierra alvarez et al 2010 where roxarsone exposure was found to induce an irreversible inhibition of methanogenesis however it should be noted that the roxarsone concentrations that were employed in our study which correspond well to arsenic levels in typical swine wastewater jin and chang 2011 zhai et al 2017 were 4 70 times lower than the previously tested concentrations shui et al 2016 sierra alvarez et al 2010 tang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 therefore our study is likely to provide a more realistic foundation for determining the efficiency and stability of anaerobic digestion systems that are used for the treatment of organoarsenic contaminated livestock wastewaters our results indicate that from a long term perspective anaerobic digestion of livestock wastewater can proceed efficiently reliably and mostly unaffected by endogenous organoarsenicals however it is important to be mindful that in this process anaerobic sludge becomes an important sink of arsenic due to its successive accumulation during the treatment of the organoarsenic contaminated wastewater given that nearly 50 of the accumulated arsenic within anaerobic sludge is exchangeable ji et al 2017 tang et al 2017 and therefore easily mobilized this can impose a serious environmental threat once the waste sludge is discharged and disposed of future studies need to evaluate the risk of arsenic leaching from the anaerobic sludge and develop efficient strategies for effectively securing that arsenic remains immobilized 4 conclusions in this study the response of ags to the loading of 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone in a uasb reactor was comprehensively investigated over a period of 420 days the results clearly demonstrate that 5 0 mg l 1 roxarsone exerted a temporal inhibition of up to 40 on the methanogenic activity and that the inhibition was eventually fully reversed roxarsone fate in the reactor indicated an increasing capability of the ags to prevent arsenic from piercing into cells the reduction in granular size and the analysis of the ags morphology and clsm images demonstrated that roxarsone exposure stimulated the excretion of eps and the surface spalling of ags high throughput sequencing analysis further indicated that lactate producing olsenella became the dominant fermentative bacteria and acetoclastic methanogens methanothrix was severely inhibited when methane production was inhibited by roxarsone vfas producing bacteria and methanothrix were enriched again towards the end of the experimental period overall the findings of this study will improve the understanding of the effect of organoarsenicals on ags efficiency and provide highly beneficial information for the design of anaerobic treatment processes
