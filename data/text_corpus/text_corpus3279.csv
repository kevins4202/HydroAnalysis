16395,in recent years the ecological risks of plastics to marine environments and organisms have attracted increasing attention especially the leachates from plastics however a comprehensive knowledge about the leaching characteristics and subsequent toxicological effects of leachates is still sparse in this study 15 different plastic products were immersed in simulated seawater and fish digest for 16 h the leachates were analyzed through non target and target analyses and their toxicological signatures were assessed by bioassays in total 240 additives were identified from the plastic leachates among which plasticizers represented the most 16 7 followed by antioxidants 8 7 and flame retardants 7 1 approximately 40 of plastic leachates exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the bioluminescence using a recombinant luminescent assay in addition both the hyperactive and hypoactive behaviors were displayed in the larvae of marine medaka oryzias melastigma exposed to some plastic leachates in general the number and amount of identified compounds under simulated fish digest were less than those under simulated seawater however the simulated fish digest leachates triggered higher toxicity redundancy analysis demonstrated that identified additives did not adequately explain the toxicological effects future research should focus on the identification of more additives in the plastic leachates and their potential ecological risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords leachates plastic additives non target and target analyses bioassays toxicity 1 introduction marine plastic pollution has become a global issue and has attracted increasing worldwide attention alabi et al 2019 the amount of plastics in the oceans is estimated to be around 75 199 million tons accounting for 85 of the total marine litter and forming a huge plastisphere unep 2021 meanwhile 23 37 million tons of plastic waste will be released into the aquatic systems annually due to the absence of vigorous regulation unep 2021 marine plastics could cause great harms to marine organisms one of which is ingestion by marine organisms puskic et al 2020 markic et al 2020 it is shown that plastics accounted for 98 7 of ingested marine debris in sperm whale physeter microcephalus among which plastic bags represent 48 7 alexiadou et al 2019 many additives such as plasticizers flame retardants stabilizers and colorants have been applied in plastic products for a variety of purposes wiesinger et al 2021 the type and content of additives vary dependent on usages and production process gunaalan et al 2020 in general plasticizers represent 10 to 70 flame retardants from 10 to 20 and thermal stabilizers up to 8 by weight of the plastics andrady and rajapakse 2016 these additives could be leached out in a variety of media including seawater freshwater digest and stomach oil bridson et al 2021 coffin et al 2019a tanaka et al 2015 in seawater polyethylene bags can release 83 4 ng g di isobutyl phthalate dibp and 120 1 ng g di n butyl phthalate paluselli et al 2018 in deionized water plastic express package bags can release up to 309 μg g of total phthalates xu et al 2020 diverse additives could be leached out from different plastics under sophisticated environmental conditions coffin et al 2019a lithner et al 2012 however current knowledge about plastic leachates is very limited it is well known that some plastic additives such as phthalate acidic esters paes and organic phosphate esters opes may exert many toxicities including developmental toxicity endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity in aquatic animals chen et al 2021 van der veen and de boer 2012 zhang et al 2021 moreover some studies have revealed that leachates as a whole may inhibit bioluminescence lead to oxidative stress and result in cytotoxicity towards marine organisms gunaalan et al 2020 zimmermann et al 2019 our previous study reveals that shopping bags show a strong estrogenic effect among various plastic items coffin et al 2019a obviously the toxicity caused by leachates could be diverse as plastic leachates may contain various additives which have different mode of actions hahladakis et al 2018 gunaalan et al 2020 however research on the toxicity of leachates in organisms is largely unknown the aim of this study was to explore the chemical characteristics of leachates from plastics under simulated seawater and fish digest by using non target and target analyses with ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms and to evaluate the potential toxicity of leachates with a recombinant luminescent bacterium escherichia coli hb101 pucd607 and marine medaka larvae oryzias melastigma the

plastic products were cut into fragments with stainless scissors at 5 cm length and 1 cm width fragments were immersed into the freshly prepared sw and fd and shaken at 100 rpm at 24 c in the dark for 16 h this incubation duration was based on the retention time of food in the fish gastrointestinal tract coffin et al 2019a the simulated solutions without plastics were used as controls four replicates were made for each plastic product and each control 2 4 solid phase extraction after 16 h of incubation each solution was filtered through glass fiber filters whatman gf f 0 7 μm the ph of

the self constructed library a six point calibration ranging from 10 ng g to 1000 ng g for all target chemicals was used for linearity and quantitative evaluation the correlation coefficient of each target compound was 0 9 the concentration of additives leaching out of the plastics was expressed as ng g in addition a semi quantitative method was also used by peak area normalization for all the identified compounds feng et al 2016 all data obtained from the chemical analyses complied with strict quality assurance quality control qa qc regime 2 6 in vitro bioassay using recombinant luminescent bacterium the recombinant luminescent e coli was inserted with a lux gene and had been applied to measure the toxicity of plastic leachates according to previous studies fang et al 2012a

controls and samples respectively treatments and controls comprised of 4 replicates 4 technical repetitions for each replicate 2 7 in vivo bioassay using marine medaka larvae oryzias melastigma 2 7 1 fish culture adult marine medaka were cultured in glass tanks with 30 salinity of artificial seawater sea salt instant ocean usa water filtered and aerated tap water at 27 1 c with a light dark cycle of 14 h 10 h they were fed live brine shrimp artemia nauplii twice daily the embryos were collected from the adults every day and were placed in the incubator under the same temperature and a light dark cycle regime as the adults during the cultivation period the seawater was renewed daily and the dead embryos were removed as soon as they were observed 2 7 2 exposure design the methanol resuspended plastic leachates were diluted in seawater 0 1 v v a solvent control with the same volume of methanol was included five larvae 12 24 h after hatching were exposed to the leachates or

dark period with sound each period with10 min the motion trajectory was recorded every 60 s four fish from each replicate a total of 16 fish for each treatment were tested for the behavioral assay leuthold et al 2018 2 7 4 real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr total rna extraction and cdna synthesis were carried out according to our previous method huang et al 2016 briefly trizol reagent invitrogen was used to isolate rna from a pool of 5 larvae the concentration and quality of total rna were assessed on a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop onec thermo fisher scientific usa instructed by the manufacturer 1 μg rna was reverse transcribed into cdna in a total volume of 50 μl using the revertra ace qpcr rt master mix with gdna remover toyobo japan the transcriptional level of 7 genes associated to neurotoxicity gfap pcdh18b shha mbp α1 tubulin syn2a and manf and 4 genes related to developmental toxicity omtert p53 tnf α and cyp26b1 was quantified using the thunderbird sybr qpcr mix toyobo japan on applied biosystems quantstudio 7 flex abi usa the information of primers was shown in table s2 the qpcr amplification was firstly denatured at 95 c for 30 s following 40 cycles at 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 34 s fang et al 2012b the relative transcriptional abundance of target genes was evaluated by 2 δδct method using beta actin and ribosomal protein l7 as housekeeping genes 2 8 statistical analyses data related to toxicological effects of leachates were tested for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test and homogeneity of variance using levene s test when the parametric assumptions were met one way anova was carried out followed by the dunnett s test in comparison with the plastic free control otherwise a nonparametric kruskal wallis test was used followed by a dunn s post hoc test coffin et al 2018 in addition the differences between the sw and fd was compared if the d value of relevant samples was normal paired sample t test was carried out if not wilcoxon signed rank test was used statistical analyses were analyzed on ibm spss statistics version 26 and statistically significant difference was considered at p 0 05 the principle component analysis pca and redundancy analysis rda were conducted by canoco 5 firstly a compound detected in more than 20 of the samples was selected then the semi quantitative concentration of each compound belonging to the same categorical additives was added together and the final value of each type of additive was used as an environmental factor for pca and rda finally 14 environmental factors were selected to conduct pca as for rda the first 5 environmental factors inflation factor 10 were chosen as explanatory variables from all environmental factors by the forward selection method additionally the inhibitory rate of recombinant luminescent bacterium the total distances of larvae in the 4 periods the transcriptional expression of 11 target genes were used as response variables both environmental factors and response variables were log10 x 1 transformed and response variables were standardized and centered monte carlo permutation was performed to determine the significance of additives in explaining the variance of the toxicological effects 3 results 3 1 characteristics of leaching additives based on the self constructed and three reference libraries a total of 240 compounds were identified which were classified into 20 categories of additives according to their functionalities and properties including plasticizers antioxidants flame retardants and unclassified additives fig 1 table s3 and text s1 regardless of the unassigned additives the predominant additives were plasticizers antioxidants and flame retardants accounting for 16 7 8 7 and 7 1 respectively fig 1 and table s3 in general the number and amount of identified compounds were higher in the leachates by the sw than by the fd figs 2 and s3 however the number of unknown components detected in negative mode was higher in the leachates by the fd than by the sw table s4 furthermore 39 target compounds were quantified fig 3 and table s5 among them bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp dibp and tris 1 chloro 2 propanyl phosphate tcipp were detected in almost all plastic leachates with an averaged concentration of 8 22 115 59 and 25 73 ng g in the sw leachates and 1 62 46 15 and 1 15 ng g in the fd leachates respectively in addition triethyl phosphate tep was mainly detected in the sw leachates with concentrations ranging from 106 to 266 ng g and triisobutyl phosphate was mostly found in the fd leachates with a maximum concentration reaching 0 07 ng g a total of 12 quantitative compounds with more than 20 detection frequency in all samples were screened out and their concentrations varied from 10 2 to 102 ng g fig s4 for a better presentation of the data of these 12 compounds their concentrations were graded into 3 levels diethyl phthalate dibp tep and tcipp were at level 1 among which the concentration of tep was relatively high with an average concentration of 160 ng g fig s4a dehp dimethyl phthalate dmp triphenyl phosphine oxide tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate and benzophenone 3 were at level 2 and the average concentration of dehp epa priority controlled substance was 3 ng g fig s4b dibutyl phthalate dbp triphenyl phosphate and triisobutyl phosphate were at level 3 with relatively low concentration fig s4c 3 2 toxicity of plastic leachates on the luminescence of recombinant e coli as revealed in fig 4 the bioluminescence was significantly inhibited in swp3 p 0 04 swp4 p 0 001 swp6 p 0 013 swp8 p 0 012 and swp14 p 0 001 and the inhibitory rate was more than doubled in fdp8 fdp12 compared with their respective plastic free controls in addition the inhibition was higher for plastic leachates from the fd than that from the sw except p3 and p14 the integral toxicity of p9 p10 p11 and p12 was significantly enhanced under the fd being 3 9 2 5 52 8 and 4 9 fold compared to that under the sw 3 3 effects of plastic leachates on swimming behavior of larvae as shown in fig 5 a under the light period the swimming distances were markedly decreased in larvae exposed to swp5 swp8 fdp5 fdp6 and fdp13 by a minimum of 33 during the dark treatment with swp8 and fdp5 caused a significant reduction of swimming distance whereas treatment with swp2 swp3 swp15 fdp3 fdp4 and fdp14 resulted in a 65 61 58 57 56 and 72 increase in swimming distance respectively relative to the controls fig 5b furthermore the swimming distance of larvae exposed to p8 and p14 in the fd was greater than that of their counterparts in the sw fig 5b when sound was added in the light period a significant decrease was observed in fdp13 fig 5c exposed to dark with sound the swimming activity of larvae was greatly impaired being 58 and 51 lower for swp8 and swp9 60 and 44 lower for fdp5 and fdp13 than their respective controls fig 5d in addition the swimming distance of larvae appeared significantly different for p5 p13 and p14 between the sw and fd fig 5d 3 4 transcriptional levels of target genes in larvae the transcriptional levels of genes related to the development of the central nervous system were significantly changed under exposure to some plastic leachates figs 6 and s5 for example relative to the controls the transcripts of gfap and pcdh18b were respectively significantly up regulated by 1 41 1 81 fold and 1 30 2 02 fold while those of shha mbp and α1 tubulin were respectively significantly down regulated by 0 75 0 78 fold 0 53 0 86 fold and 0 64 0 74 fold under both the sw and fd the leachates of p1 p3 p8 and p10 could significantly down regulate mbp mrna levels in comparison with the controls meanwhile exposure to swp6 and fdp12 caused 1 32 and 0 71 fold changes in the mrna levels of syn2a compared with their respective controls there were significant differences between the sw and fd in the transcripts of pcdh18b and manf under p12 leachates pcdh18b and α1 tubulin under p13 leachates and mbp and syn2a under p14 leachates the transcripts of omtert in swp1 swp15 fdp2 and fdp8 increased significantly while that of p53 in swp13 fdp1 fdp4 fdp5 fdp6 fdp14 and fdp15 decreased significantly compared to their respective plastic free controls the mrna level of omtert responded to swp9 and swp11 was lower than that to fdp9 and fdp11 down regulation of the immune related gene tnf α transcripts was observed in response to p1 p7 p13 and p15 in the sw compared to their counterparts in the fd bone development related gene cyp26b1 mrna levels were significantly induced in swp2 swp8 and swp15 and inhibited in fdp12 compared with their respective controls furthermore exposure to p13 and p14 in the fd significantly up regulated cyp26b1 transcripts as compared with that in the sw 3 5 pca and rda pca analysis showed that the accumulative variance contribution of the first two principle components was 79 31 fig 7 a meanwhile the contribution of the unclassified additives plasticizers and flame retardants to the first principle component was relatively high the pca ordination showed an apparent boundary between the sw leachates and fd leachates rda analysis showed that the cumulative explained variation of axis1 and axis2 was 22 64 and the explanatory variable effects based on axis1 p 0 002 and all axes p 0 002 were highly significant fig 7b moreover the explanatory variables dyes p 0 026 antioxidants p 0 044 and flame retardants p 0 044 significantly impacted the response variables which accounted for 7 4 6 9 and 6 5 of the variance respectively rda showed a positive correlation of the total swimming distance the transcripts of gfap pcdh18b omtert and cyp26b1 with the concentrations of antioxidants fatty acids and by products as well as a positive correlation of the transcripts of p53 with the levels of flame retardants and dyes 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of plastic leachates in this study a total of 240 compounds has been identified in plastic leachates but many chemicals remain to be unidentified similarly in previous studies chen et al 2021 zimmermann et al 2019 1411 or 808 entities have been detected in plastic leachates but only a handful of compounds are identified because of the lack of availability of relative chemical data it has been estimated that more than 10 000 substances are used in plastics wiesinger et al 2021 apparently more comprehensive chemical databases are urgently needed for the identification of additives leached out from the plastics in addition this work along with other studies has revealed that the predominant additives such as plasticizers antioxidants and flame retardants are readily leached out from the plastics chen et al 2021 coffin et al 2018 furthermore though tep and dibp are the two most leachable compounds their concentrations in the leachates are not exceeding the specific migration limits of food contact products i e 60 mg kg 0 5 mg kg respectively chen et al 2022 gärtner et al 2009 however the leaching experiment lasted only16 h the concentrations of the additives leached out from the plastics could be higher should the duration of the experiment be longer nonetheless future research should focus on the leaching dynamics of the additives in plastics this study has demonstrated that the number and concentrations of confirmed leachates from the fd are less than those from the sw which is consistent with a previous study coffin et al 2019b at one hand the property of the plastics is crucial the polymers used to manufacture the plastics and additives may vary the type and strength of additives polymer binding the internal pore size of the polymer and the weight and hydrophobicity of additives might determine the leachability of the additives gunaalan et al 2020 teuten et al 2009 for example the concentrations of pae substances in this study are lower than those quantified in an early study with similar experimental design coffin et al 2019a implying that the plastic products with different production processes and different additives could account for the differences this could also be validated by the fact that the leaching features of diverse plastic products in the same simulated medium i e seawater and fish digest varied in this study on the other hand other factors like salinity suhrhoff and scholz bottcher 2015 ph luo et al 2019 and biotic processes are responsible for the leachability of additives gunaalan et al 2020 for example the concentration of benzothiazole and n cyclohexylformamide in car tire rubber are respectively 2313 and 1460 μg l in the marine plastic leachates and 1059 and 788 μg l in the freshwater plastic leachates capolupo et al 2020 in addition the discrepancy of leachates might be ascribed to the properties of the additives and the gradients of ph hartmann et al 2017 for instances the concentration of bpa and 3 3 diaminobenzidine like substances a class of fluorescent additives in the leaching medium increased with increased ph luo et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in contrast the concentrations of bpa dehp and benzyl butyl phthalate are significantly enhanced by 204 175 and 132 in the gut digest ph 2 in comparison with the sw coffin et al 2019a moreover pepsin may also be a critical factor under low ph due to its role as an appropriate surfactant in fish gastrointestinal tract bergmann et al 2015 which provides binding sites for phthalates dmp dbp dinoctyl phthalate diisonnonyl phthalate dicyclohexyl phthalate and dehp wang and zhang 2013 it is therefore likely that the binding between additives and pepsin may decrease their concentrations in leachates meanwhile pepsin may also play a role in hydrolysis or metabolism of certain additives which has been validated by the fact that some paes can be metabolized in stomach of rats rowland et al 1977 zeng et al 2013 4 2 toxicological effects of plastic leachates it has been known that plastic leachates are toxic to organisms resulting in cytotoxicity neurotoxicity developmental and reproductive toxicity gunaalan et al 2020 rendell bhatti et al 2021 walpitagama et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2019 in the present study some plastic leachates inhibit the bioluminescence of e coli cause the alterations in transcriptional levels of target genes and induce abnormal swimming behaviors in the o melastigma larvae this study has showed that the plastic items made from pe and pp seem to trigger higher toxicity than p1 nylon pe and 40 of all plastic leachates inhibit bioluminescence in compliance with this study the toxicity of different plastic consumer products varies and 62 of the whole plastic extracts by methanol inhibits the bioluminescence of aliivibrio fischeri zimmermann et al 2019 these results imply that the extract solvent ph and immersion duration might be critical for the leaching of the additives from the plastics in addition this study has shown that the inhibitory effects are significantly more potent for p9 p12 under the fd than those under the sw the exact reasons for the observed difference in the inhibitory effects of p9 p12 under two media remain to be elucidated surprisingly the levels and amount of identified compounds in p9 p12 in the fd were less than those in the sw however the number of unidentified compounds detected in the p9 p12 using the negative mode of qtof were more in the fd than in the sw further study is needed to identify those compounds and their potential effects on organisms behavior assay has gained increasing attention in ecotoxicology and behavioral endpoints have been suggested to be incorporated into the risk assessment of chemical pollution ford et al 2021 li et al 2021 in the present study swimming capacity was affected by some plastic leachates and the fish larvae were either hyperactive or hypoactive the effects of the leachates from plastics have yet to be determined however many studies focusing on the effects of certain single plastic additive show that additives in plastics can influence fish behavior for example exposure to triphenyl phosphate or organophosphate flame retardants respectively lead to hypoactivity in zebrafish or japanese medaka larvae shi et al 2018 sun et al 2016 whereas dehp increases maximum velocity and absolute turn angle of japanese medaka larvae yang et al 2018 in this study rda analysis showed that the antioxidants fatty acids and by products had a positive relation to swimming activity of larvae while flame retardants and dyes negatively associated with the movement this could partially account for the observed hyperactivity or hypoactivity in the o melastigma larvae exposed to the extracted leachates in addition in this study sound was added as an extra stimulus but the swimming capacity of the larvae still conformed to the rule that the swimming activity was significantly enhanced from light to dark transition and reduced during reverse transition liu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 furthermore in this study p1 leachates containing a relatively high number of identified and unidentified compounds however the p1 leachates did not elicit altered swimming capacity which is in consistence with the results showing that pp leachates containing the largest number of compounds do not affect the motility of mussel larvae capolupo et al 2020 in addition the genes associated with the nervous system were investigated in an effort to provide mechanistic explanation of the observed altered swimming behavior in this study the gfap and mbp mrna levels were altered by the additives in p8 in the sw the altered levels of these two genes might lead to myelination deficiency chen et al 2012 nielsen and jørgensen 2003 sun et al 2016 and subsequently affect the swimming capacity as evidenced by the hypoactivity in the medaka larvae exposed to p8 in the sw however the larvae exposed to p5 in the fd shared the same trend in swimming activity but not in gene expression as those exposed to p8 in the sw this might be due to that leachates derived from different plastics have different toxicity on the medaka larvae apart from neurotoxicity plastic leachates might affect the early development of o melastigma for instance it shows that leachates from plastic bags significantly impaired the embryonic development of japanese medaka oryzias latipes and yellow clam meretrix meretrix chen et al 2021 ke et al 2019 unfortunately in this study we did not analyze the embryonic development of larvae exposed to plastic leachates however the transcriptional levels of target genes related to stress response immune response and bone development to determine the toxicity of leachates on the early stages of o melastigma were examined in this study the overall trends of omtert tnf α and cyp26b1 mrna levels were enhanced similarly to those observed in embryos of o melastigma exposed to ciguatoxin yan et al 2017 the up regulation of these genes might result in promotion of cell proliferation immune dysfunction and stimulation of ros production as well as bone formation along with the loss of normal myotomes respectively mariappan et al 2007 yan et al 2017 on the other hand in this study the mrna expression of p53 was significantly inhibited p53 is very crucial for the protection of cells via initiating the dna repair system in normal cells and inducing cell apoptosis in abnormal cells fischer 2017 mankidy et al 2013 yang et al 2018 the lower p53 transcripts in o melastigma exposed to leachates implied that these larvae might be severely affected in the light of chemical analyses and toxicological effects the toxicity of the leachates in the fd was higher than that in the sw however the confirmed additives and their concentrations of the leachates in the fd were not more or higher than those in the sw on the one hand the difference might be due to the synergistic and antagonistic effects of the combined additives for example the joint estrogenic effects induced by bpa nonyl phenol and 4 tert octyl phenol have been elucidated in rat pituitary cells while the mixed paes exerted no cumulative toxicity to aquatic animals compared to individual pae zhang et al 2021 on the other hand the toxicity exerted by unidentified additives in the leachates is not clear but cannot be simply ignored which might explain the discrepancy in the toxicity of the leachates between the sw and fd 5 conclusion this study offers direct information about leaching additives and the toxicological effects of the leachates by two different media although we have an overview toward leaching chemicals the majority of additives still remain unidentified future efforts are needed to identify more plastic additives by establishing larger chemical library furthermore the toxicity of leachates elicited by the fd were generally higher than that by the sw the present study also reveals that the pe and pp plastics exert higher toxicity than the mixture of nylon and pe however the identified additives in the leachates could not account for the observed toxic effects it is worth noting that over 200 additives were identified in the leachates from plastic products since plastic products are often disposable after single use high demands on the market and low demands on stability the additives from plastic products and their ecological risks merit more attention this study has provided insights into the leachability of additives in

16395,in recent years the ecological risks of plastics to marine environments and organisms have attracted increasing attention especially the leachates from plastics however a comprehensive knowledge about the leaching characteristics and subsequent toxicological effects of leachates is still sparse in this study 15 different plastic products were immersed in simulated seawater and fish digest for 16 h the leachates were analyzed through non target and target analyses and their toxicological signatures were assessed by bioassays in total 240 additives were identified from the plastic leachates among which plasticizers represented the most 16 7 followed by antioxidants 8 7 and flame retardants 7 1 approximately 40 of plastic leachates exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the bioluminescence using a recombinant luminescent assay in addition both the hyperactive and hypoactive behaviors were displayed in the larvae of marine medaka oryzias melastigma exposed to some plastic leachates in general the number and amount of identified compounds under simulated fish digest were less than those under simulated seawater however the simulated fish digest leachates triggered higher toxicity redundancy analysis demonstrated that identified additives did not adequately explain the toxicological effects future research should focus on the identification of more additives in the plastic leachates and their potential ecological risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords leachates plastic additives non target and target analyses bioassays toxicity 1 introduction marine plastic pollution has become a global issue and has attracted increasing worldwide attention alabi et al 2019 the amount of plastics in the oceans is estimated to be around 75 199 million tons accounting for 85 of the total marine litter and forming a huge plastisphere unep 2021 meanwhile 23 37 million tons of plastic waste will be released into the aquatic systems annually due to the absence of vigorous regulation unep 2021 marine plastics could cause great harms to marine organisms one of which is ingestion by marine organisms puskic et al 2020 markic et al 2020 it is shown that plastics accounted for 98 7 of ingested marine debris in sperm whale physeter microcephalus among which plastic bags represent 48 7 alexiadou et al 2019 many additives such as plasticizers flame retardants stabilizers and colorants have been applied in plastic products for a variety of purposes wiesinger et al 2021 the type and content of additives vary dependent on usages and production process gunaalan et al 2020 in general plasticizers represent 10 to 70 flame retardants from 10 to 20 and thermal stabilizers up to 8 by weight of the plastics andrady and rajapakse 2016 these additives could be leached out in a variety of media including seawater freshwater digest and stomach oil bridson et al 2021 coffin et al 2019a tanaka et al 2015 in seawater polyethylene bags can release 83 4 ng g di isobutyl phthalate dibp and 120 1 ng g di n butyl phthalate paluselli et al 2018 in deionized water plastic express package bags can release up to 309 μg g of total phthalates xu et al 2020 diverse additives could be leached out from different plastics under sophisticated environmental conditions coffin et al 2019a lithner et al 2012 however current knowledge about plastic leachates is very limited it is well known that some plastic additives such as phthalate acidic esters paes and organic phosphate esters opes may exert many toxicities including developmental toxicity endocrine disruption and neurotoxicity in aquatic animals chen et al 2021 van der veen and de boer 2012 zhang et al 2021 moreover some studies have revealed that leachates as a whole may inhibit bioluminescence lead to oxidative stress and result in cytotoxicity towards marine organisms gunaalan et al 2020 zimmermann et al 2019 our previous study reveals that shopping bags show a strong estrogenic effect among various plastic items coffin et al 2019a obviously the toxicity caused by leachates could be diverse as plastic leachates may contain various additives which have different mode of actions hahladakis et al 2018 gunaalan et al 2020 however research on the toxicity of leachates in organisms is largely unknown the aim of this study was to explore the chemical characteristics of leachates from plastics under simulated seawater and fish digest by using non target and target analyses with ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms and to evaluate the potential toxicity of leachates with a recombinant luminescent bacterium escherichia coli hb101 pucd607 and marine medaka larvae oryzias melastigma the

instructed by the manufacturer 1 μg rna was reverse transcribed into cdna in a total volume of 50 μl using the revertra ace qpcr rt master mix with gdna remover toyobo japan the transcriptional level of 7 genes associated to neurotoxicity gfap pcdh18b shha mbp α1 tubulin syn2a and manf and 4 genes related to developmental toxicity omtert p53 tnf α and cyp26b1 was quantified using the thunderbird sybr qpcr mix toyobo japan on applied biosystems quantstudio 7 flex abi usa the information of primers was shown in table s2 the qpcr amplification was firstly denatured at 95 c for 30 s following 40 cycles at 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 34 s fang et al 2012b the relative transcriptional abundance of target genes was evaluated by 2 δδct method using beta actin and ribosomal protein l7 as housekeeping genes 2 8 statistical analyses data related to toxicological effects of leachates were tested for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test and homogeneity of variance using levene s test when the parametric assumptions were met one way anova was carried out followed by the dunnett s test in comparison with the plastic free control otherwise a nonparametric kruskal wallis test was used followed by a dunn s post hoc test coffin et al 2018 in addition the differences between the sw and fd was compared if the d value of relevant samples was normal paired sample t test was carried out if not wilcoxon signed rank test was used statistical analyses were analyzed on ibm spss statistics version 26 and statistically significant difference was considered at p 0 05 the principle component analysis pca and redundancy analysis rda were conducted by canoco 5 firstly a compound detected in more than 20 of the samples was selected then the semi quantitative concentration of each compound belonging to the same categorical additives was added together and the final value of each type of additive was used as an environmental factor for pca and rda finally 14 environmental factors were selected to conduct pca as for rda the first 5 environmental factors inflation factor 10 were chosen as explanatory variables from all environmental factors by the forward selection method additionally the inhibitory rate of recombinant luminescent bacterium the total distances of larvae in the 4 periods the transcriptional expression of 11 target genes were used as response variables both environmental factors and response variables were log10 x 1 transformed and response variables were standardized and centered monte carlo permutation was performed to determine the significance of additives in explaining the variance of the toxicological effects 3 results 3 1 characteristics of leaching additives based on the self constructed and three reference libraries a total of 240 compounds were identified which were classified into 20 categories of additives according to their functionalities and properties including plasticizers antioxidants flame retardants and unclassified additives fig 1 table s3 and text s1 regardless of the unassigned additives the predominant additives were plasticizers antioxidants and flame retardants accounting for 16 7 8 7 and 7 1 respectively fig 1 and table s3 in general the number and amount of identified compounds were higher in the leachates by the sw than by the fd figs 2 and s3 however the number of unknown components detected in negative mode was higher in the leachates by the fd than by the sw table s4 furthermore 39 target compounds were quantified fig 3 and table s5 among them bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp dibp and tris 1 chloro 2 propanyl phosphate tcipp were detected in almost all plastic leachates with an averaged concentration of 8 22 115 59 and 25 73 ng g in the sw leachates and 1 62 46 15 and 1 15 ng g in the fd leachates respectively in addition triethyl phosphate tep was mainly detected in the sw leachates with concentrations ranging from 106 to 266 ng g and triisobutyl phosphate was mostly found in the fd leachates with a maximum concentration reaching 0 07 ng g a total of 12 quantitative compounds with more than 20 detection frequency in all samples were screened out and their concentrations varied from 10 2 to 102 ng g fig s4 for a better presentation of the data of these 12 compounds their concentrations were graded into 3 levels diethyl phthalate dibp tep and tcipp were at level 1 among which the concentration of tep was relatively high with an average concentration of 160 ng g fig s4a dehp dimethyl phthalate dmp triphenyl phosphine oxide tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate and benzophenone 3 were at level 2 and the average concentration of dehp epa priority controlled substance was 3 ng g fig s4b dibutyl phthalate dbp triphenyl phosphate and triisobutyl phosphate were at level 3 with relatively low concentration fig s4c 3 2 toxicity of plastic leachates on the luminescence of recombinant e coli as revealed in fig 4 the bioluminescence was significantly inhibited in swp3 p 0 04 swp4 p 0 001 swp6 p 0 013 swp8 p 0 012 and swp14 p 0 001 and the inhibitory rate was more than doubled in fdp8 fdp12 compared with their respective plastic free controls in addition the inhibition was higher for plastic leachates from the fd than that from the sw except p3 and p14 the integral toxicity of p9 p10 p11 and p12 was significantly enhanced under the fd being 3 9 2 5 52 8 and 4 9 fold compared to that under the sw 3 3 effects of plastic leachates on swimming behavior of larvae as shown in fig 5 a under the light period the swimming distances were markedly decreased in larvae exposed to swp5 swp8 fdp5 fdp6 and fdp13 by a minimum of 33 during the dark treatment with swp8 and fdp5 caused a significant reduction of swimming distance whereas treatment with swp2 swp3 swp15 fdp3 fdp4 and fdp14 resulted in a 65 61 58 57 56 and 72 increase in swimming distance respectively relative to the controls fig 5b furthermore the swimming distance of larvae exposed to p8 and p14 in the fd was greater than that of their counterparts in the sw fig 5b when sound was added in the light period a significant decrease was observed in fdp13 fig 5c exposed to dark with sound the swimming activity of larvae was greatly impaired being 58 and 51 lower for swp8 and swp9 60 and 44 lower for fdp5 and fdp13 than their respective controls fig 5d in addition the swimming distance of larvae appeared significantly different for p5 p13 and p14 between the sw and fd fig 5d 3 4 transcriptional levels of target genes in larvae the transcriptional levels of genes related to the development of the central nervous system were significantly changed under exposure to some plastic leachates figs 6 and s5 for example relative to the controls the transcripts of gfap and pcdh18b were respectively significantly up regulated by 1 41 1 81 fold and 1 30 2 02 fold while those of shha mbp and α1 tubulin were respectively significantly down regulated by 0 75 0 78 fold 0 53 0 86 fold and 0 64 0 74 fold under both the sw and fd the leachates of p1 p3 p8 and p10 could significantly down regulate mbp mrna levels in comparison with the controls meanwhile exposure to swp6 and fdp12 caused 1 32 and 0 71 fold changes in the mrna levels of syn2a compared with their respective controls there were significant differences between the sw and fd in the transcripts of pcdh18b and manf under p12 leachates pcdh18b and α1 tubulin under p13 leachates and mbp and syn2a under p14 leachates the transcripts of omtert in swp1 swp15 fdp2 and fdp8 increased significantly while that of p53 in swp13 fdp1 fdp4 fdp5 fdp6 fdp14 and fdp15 decreased significantly compared to their respective plastic free controls the mrna level of omtert responded to swp9 and swp11 was lower than that to fdp9 and fdp11 down regulation of the immune related gene tnf α transcripts was observed in response to p1 p7 p13 and p15 in the sw compared to their counterparts in the fd bone development related gene cyp26b1 mrna levels were significantly induced in swp2 swp8 and swp15 and inhibited in fdp12 compared with their respective controls furthermore exposure to p13 and p14 in the fd significantly up regulated cyp26b1 transcripts as compared with that in the sw 3 5 pca and rda pca analysis showed that the accumulative variance contribution of the first two principle components was 79 31 fig 7 a meanwhile the contribution of the unclassified additives plasticizers and flame retardants to the first principle component was relatively high the pca ordination showed an apparent boundary between the sw leachates and fd leachates rda analysis showed that the cumulative explained variation of axis1 and axis2 was 22 64 and the explanatory variable effects based on axis1 p 0 002 and all axes p 0 002 were highly significant fig 7b moreover the explanatory variables dyes p 0 026 antioxidants p 0 044 and flame retardants p 0 044 significantly impacted the response variables which accounted for 7 4 6 9 and 6 5 of the variance respectively rda showed a positive correlation of the total swimming distance the transcripts of gfap pcdh18b omtert and cyp26b1 with the concentrations of antioxidants fatty acids and by products as well as a positive correlation of the transcripts of p53 with the levels of flame retardants and dyes 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of plastic leachates in this study a total of 240 compounds has been identified in plastic leachates but many chemicals remain to be unidentified similarly in previous studies chen et al 2021 zimmermann et al 2019 1411 or 808 entities have been detected in plastic leachates but only a handful of compounds are identified because of the lack of availability of relative chemical data it has been estimated that more than 10 000 substances are used in plastics wiesinger et al 2021 apparently more comprehensive chemical databases are urgently needed for the identification of additives leached out from the plastics in addition this work along with other studies has revealed that the predominant additives such as plasticizers antioxidants and flame retardants are readily leached out from the plastics chen et al 2021 coffin et al 2018 furthermore though tep and dibp are the two most leachable compounds their concentrations in the leachates are not exceeding the specific migration limits of food contact products i e 60 mg kg 0 5 mg kg respectively chen et al 2022 gärtner et al 2009 however the leaching experiment lasted only16 h the concentrations of the additives leached out from the plastics could be higher should the duration of the experiment be longer nonetheless future research should focus on the leaching dynamics of the additives in plastics this study has demonstrated that the number and concentrations of confirmed leachates from the fd are less than those from the sw which is consistent with a previous study coffin et al 2019b at one hand the property of the plastics is crucial the polymers used to manufacture the plastics and additives may vary the type and strength of additives polymer binding the internal pore size of the polymer and the weight and hydrophobicity of additives might determine the leachability of the additives gunaalan et al 2020 teuten et al 2009 for example the concentrations of pae substances in this study are lower than those quantified in an early study with similar experimental design coffin et al 2019a implying that the plastic products with different production processes and different additives could account for the differences this could also be validated by the fact that the leaching features of diverse plastic products in the same simulated medium i e seawater and fish digest varied in this study on the other hand other factors like salinity suhrhoff and scholz bottcher 2015 ph luo et al 2019 and biotic processes are responsible for the leachability of additives gunaalan et al 2020 for example the concentration of benzothiazole and n cyclohexylformamide in car tire rubber are respectively 2313 and 1460 μg l in the marine plastic leachates and 1059 and 788 μg l in the freshwater plastic leachates capolupo et al 2020 in addition the discrepancy of leachates might be ascribed to the properties of the additives and the gradients of ph hartmann et al 2017 for instances the concentration of bpa and 3 3 diaminobenzidine like substances a class of fluorescent additives in the leaching medium increased with increased ph luo et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in contrast the concentrations of bpa dehp and benzyl butyl phthalate are significantly enhanced by 204 175 and 132 in the gut digest ph 2 in comparison with the sw coffin et al 2019a moreover pepsin may also be a critical factor under low ph due to its role as an appropriate surfactant in fish gastrointestinal tract bergmann et al 2015 which provides binding sites for phthalates dmp dbp dinoctyl phthalate diisonnonyl phthalate dicyclohexyl phthalate and dehp wang and zhang 2013 it is therefore likely that the binding between additives and pepsin may decrease their concentrations in leachates meanwhile pepsin may also play a role in hydrolysis or metabolism of certain additives which has been validated by the fact that some paes can be metabolized in stomach of rats rowland et al 1977 zeng et al 2013 4 2 toxicological effects of plastic leachates it has been known that plastic leachates are toxic to organisms resulting in cytotoxicity neurotoxicity developmental and reproductive toxicity gunaalan et al 2020 rendell bhatti et al 2021 walpitagama et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2019 in the present study some plastic leachates inhibit the bioluminescence of e coli cause the alterations in transcriptional levels of target genes and induce abnormal swimming behaviors in the o melastigma larvae this study has showed that the plastic items made from pe and pp seem to trigger higher toxicity than p1 nylon pe and 40 of all plastic leachates inhibit bioluminescence in compliance with this study the toxicity of different plastic consumer products varies and 62 of the whole plastic extracts by methanol inhibits the bioluminescence of aliivibrio fischeri zimmermann et al 2019 these results imply that the extract solvent ph and immersion duration might be critical for the leaching of the additives from the plastics in addition this study has shown that the inhibitory effects are significantly more potent for p9 p12 under the fd than those under the sw the exact reasons for the observed difference in the inhibitory effects of p9 p12 under two media remain to be elucidated surprisingly the levels and amount of identified compounds in p9 p12 in the fd were less than those in the sw however the number of unidentified compounds detected in the p9 p12 using the negative mode of qtof were more in the fd than in the sw further study is needed to identify those compounds and their potential effects on organisms behavior assay has gained increasing attention in ecotoxicology and behavioral endpoints have been suggested to be incorporated into the risk assessment of chemical pollution ford et al 2021 li et al 2021 in the present study swimming capacity was affected by some plastic leachates and the fish larvae were either hyperactive or hypoactive the effects of the leachates from plastics have yet to be determined however many studies focusing on the effects of certain single plastic additive show that additives in plastics can influence fish behavior for example exposure to triphenyl phosphate or organophosphate flame retardants respectively lead to hypoactivity in zebrafish or japanese medaka larvae shi et al 2018 sun et al 2016 whereas dehp increases maximum velocity and absolute turn angle of japanese medaka larvae yang et al 2018 in this study rda analysis showed that the antioxidants fatty acids and by products had a positive relation to swimming activity of larvae while flame retardants and dyes negatively associated with the movement this could partially account for the observed hyperactivity or hypoactivity in the o melastigma larvae exposed to the extracted leachates in addition in this study sound was added as an extra stimulus but the swimming capacity of the larvae still conformed to the rule that the swimming activity was significantly enhanced from light to dark transition and reduced during reverse transition liu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 furthermore in this study p1 leachates containing a relatively high number of identified and unidentified compounds however the p1 leachates did not elicit altered swimming capacity which is in consistence with the results showing that pp leachates containing the largest number of compounds do not affect the motility of mussel larvae capolupo et al 2020 in addition the genes associated with the nervous system were investigated in an effort to provide mechanistic explanation of the observed altered swimming behavior in this study the gfap and mbp mrna levels were altered by the additives in p8 in the sw the altered levels of these two genes might lead to myelination deficiency chen et al 2012 nielsen and jørgensen 2003 sun et al 2016 and subsequently affect the swimming capacity as evidenced by the hypoactivity in the medaka larvae exposed to p8 in the sw however the larvae exposed to p5 in the fd shared the same trend in swimming activity but not in gene expression as those exposed to p8 in the sw this might be due to that leachates derived from different plastics have different toxicity on the medaka larvae apart from neurotoxicity plastic leachates might affect the early development of o melastigma for instance it shows that leachates from plastic bags significantly impaired the embryonic development of japanese medaka oryzias latipes and yellow clam meretrix meretrix chen et al 2021 ke et al 2019 unfortunately in this study we did not analyze the embryonic development of larvae exposed to plastic leachates however the transcriptional levels of target genes related to stress response immune response and bone development to determine the toxicity of leachates on the early stages of o melastigma were examined in this study the overall trends of omtert tnf α and cyp26b1 mrna levels were enhanced similarly to those observed in embryos of o melastigma exposed to ciguatoxin yan et al 2017 the up regulation of these genes might result in promotion of cell proliferation immune dysfunction and stimulation of ros production as well as bone formation along with the loss of normal myotomes respectively mariappan et al 2007 yan et al 2017 on the other hand in this study the mrna expression of p53 was significantly inhibited p53 is very crucial for the protection of cells via initiating the dna repair system in normal cells and inducing cell apoptosis in abnormal cells fischer 2017 mankidy et al 2013 yang et al 2018 the lower p53 transcripts in o melastigma exposed to leachates implied that these larvae might be severely affected in the light of chemical analyses and toxicological effects the toxicity of the leachates in the fd was higher than that in the sw however the confirmed additives and their concentrations of the leachates in the fd were not more or higher than those in the sw on the one hand the difference might be due to the synergistic and antagonistic effects of the combined additives for example the joint estrogenic effects induced by bpa nonyl phenol and 4 tert octyl phenol have been elucidated in rat pituitary cells while the mixed paes exerted no cumulative toxicity to aquatic animals compared to individual pae zhang et al 2021 on the other hand the toxicity exerted by unidentified additives in the leachates is not clear but cannot be simply ignored which might explain the discrepancy in the toxicity of the leachates between the sw and fd 5 conclusion this study offers direct information about leaching additives and the toxicological effects of the leachates by two different media although we have an overview toward leaching chemicals the majority of additives still remain unidentified future efforts are needed to identify more plastic additives by establishing larger chemical library furthermore the toxicity of leachates elicited by the fd were generally higher than that by the sw the present study also reveals that the pe and pp plastics exert higher toxicity than the mixture of nylon and pe however the identified additives in the leachates could not account for the observed toxic effects it is worth noting that over 200 additives were identified in the leachates from plastic products since plastic products are often disposable after single use high demands on the market and low demands on stability the additives from plastic products and their ecological risks merit more attention this study has provided insights into the leachability of additives in

16396,this study would investigate the effect of nano fe3o4 particles on the performance of membrane bioreactor mbr including membrane fouling membrane rejection and microbial community it can effectively alleviate membrane fouling and improve the effluent quality in mbr by bio effect rather than nanoparticle adsorption the lowest membrane fouling resistance was achieved at r4 mbr sludge and membrane surface with nano fe3o4 which decreased by 46 08 meanwhile r3 mbr sludge with nano fe3o4 had the lowest concentration of cod in effluent which was below 20 mg l in the stable phase of mbr operation after applying nano fe3o4 the content of extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp were both reduced with a lower molecular weight from the microbial community analysis the abundance of proteobacteria increased from 25 06 to 45 11 at the phylum level in r3 mbr it contributed to removing organic substances in mbrs moreover the nano fe3o4 restricted bacteroidetes growth especially in r4 mbr leading to a more excellent performance of membrane flux besides the applied nano fe3o4 promoted the abundance of quorum quenching qq microorganism and declined the percentage of quorum sensing qs bacteria then a lower content of n acyl l homoserine lactones ahls in containing nano fe3o4 sludge that was also prone to control membrane fouling overall this study indicates the nano fe3o4 particle is appropriate for elevating mbr performance such as membrane fouling and effluent quality by bio effect graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nano fe3o4 particle membrane fouling microbial community n acyl l homoserine lactones 1 introduction the membrane bioreactor mbr process combines the conventional activated sludge treatment with membrane separation chen et al 2015 dong et al 2018 it has been widely applied in the wastewater treatment process because of its positive profits of efficient solid liquid separation performance decreasing floor space of treatment process reducing excess sludge production and long solids retention time srt judd 2016 liu et al 2018 luo et al 2018 neoh et al 2016 however membrane fouling including microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf is still a key obstacle to the mbr process for more comprehensive development deng et al 2016 le clech et al 2006 membrane fouling in mbr was mainly caused by the dispreferred deposition of inorganic suspended particles from mixed liquor suspended solids mlss organic fouling substances from the influent and biofouling drews 2010 malaeb et al 2013 wang et al 2014 meanwhile the microorganism absorbing and growing on the membrane surface plays a key role in biofouling it generates smp and eps leading to membrane pore blocking and forming cake layer guo et al 2012 meng et al 2009 ninomiya et al 2020 based on such background many methods are used to control membrane fouling in the mbr process including membrane modification technology aslam et al 2017 gas cleaning such as air in aerobic mbr and biogas in anaerobic mbr verrecht et al 2010 wibisono et al 2014 and changing sludge mixture performance jamal khan et al 2012 kurita et al 2015 but bring about apparent drawbacks the membrane modification technology increases operating costs chen et al 2017 miao et al 2017 while the gas cleaning requires high energy consumption verrecht et al 2010 previous research found that adding granular materials for improving sludge mixture performance is beneficial for controlling membrane fouling in mbrs xiang et al 2010 yuniarto et al 2013 zhou et al 2007 zhu et al 2012 for example powdered activated carbon could absorb organic substances especially smp in sludge mixture and reduce membrane fouling resistance in mbr torretta et al 2013 xiang et al 2010 besides powdered activated carbon could also be utilized by microorganisms as the carbon source ng et al 2013 however the applied adsorbents may elevate residual sludge volume with more dosage to maintain an excellent performance alvarino et al 2017 in addition magnetic activated sludge technology can control membrane fouling in mbr because it is separable by a magnetic field and biocompatible without deteriorating microbial activity liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 the magnetic fe3o4 particles were capable of changing microbial community structure and composition and improving the water quality of effluent liu et al 2018 without complex chemical waste sludge generation zhou et al 2015 in mbr the concentration of nh4 n in effluent decreased by 29 86 after applying the magnetic fe3o4 particles in the active sludge liu et al 2018 when the membrane surface was coated by fe3o4 particles its initial flux might decline due to the reduced membrane size however a smaller membrane size was a benefit for improving membrane rejection performance for instance the nanofiltration membrane coated with fe3o4 particles would elevate about 20 rejection ratio of salt bagheripour et al 2019 furthermore fe3o4 particles could also alleviate the membrane fouling by the formed rougher surface after a more prolonged operation besides the fexoy would change the hydrophilia and charge properties of the membrane surface to improve the membrane rejection and anti fouling ability zhao et al 2018 although the magnetic activated sludge has many advantages in improving sludge mixture performance its characteristics in controlling membrane fouling and mechanism in mbrs are limited liu et al 2018 ma et al 2017 meanwhile previously reported studies merely focused on the performance of magnetic activated sludge but overlooked the variation of bioeffect in mbrs by magnetic substance thus the nano fe3o4 particle formed by precipitation oxidization preparation was used to alleviate membrane fouling and improve effluent quality in mbr the collected nano fe3o4 particle was added into the sludge mixture or coated on the surface of membrane and then demonstrated their performance in mbr the following objectives would be achieved through this study 1 analyzing the effect of the nano fe3o4 particle on membrane flux membrane fouling resistance and membrane rejection performance 2 assessing the variation of microbial community and composition 3 analyzing the variation of qs and detecting the content of ahls 4 discussing the mechanism of the nano fe3o4 particle on improving mbr property 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr characteristic and operating condition four lab scale mbrs were set up which was r1 mbr sludge without nano fe3o4 and membrane surface without nano fe3o4 r2 mbr sludge without nano fe3o4 and membrane surface with nano fe3o4 r3 mbr sludge with nano fe3o4 and membrane surface without nano fe3o4 and r4 mbr sludge with nano fe3o4 and membrane surface with nano fe3o4 respectively the lab scale mbr was with a working volume of 6 l including anoxic tank 3 l and aerobic tank 3 l and the schematic description of mbr was shown in fig s1 meanwhile the 0 8 g l nano fe3o4 particles were added into activated sludge of r3 mbr and r4 mbr liu et al 2018 moreover the membrane module of r2 mbr and r4 mbr was immersed to 500 ml milli q with 0 6 g nano fe3o4 particle and stirred by magnetic stirrers then it was circulating pumped by a peristaltic pump at the flow rate of 0 1 m3 h for 48 h to ensure the particle was fully coated on the membrane surface the membrane module was made up by polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf flat membrane risingsun membrane technology co ltd beijing china with a nominal membrane pore size of 0 1 μm and its effective surface area was 0 0072 m2 all mbrs had the same hydraulic retention time of 10 h and the sludge retention time of 40 days activated sludge was collected from the sludge export of aao process in wenchang sewage treatment plant harbin china four mbrs were fed with the prepared synthetic wastewater by sodium acetate its parameters were shown in table s1 an air pump was used to supply air at the flow rate of about 0 1 m3 h for 40 days the peristaltic pump was carried out to extract filtrate from the membrane module at a constant permeate flux of 2 315 10 6 m s trans membrane pressure tmp was measured by a vacuum manometer 0 1 mpa capacity and manually recorded every 24 h the nano fe3o4 particle was prepared by the method of precipitation oxidization qiu et al 2018 a 40 ml 0 125 m ferric chloride solution was added into a three necked flask stirring at 600 rpm for 30 min and then 3 mmol fecl2 4h2o was doped into the flask with the n2 protection the reactor was heated at 80 c for 15 min in a water bath and adjusted ph to 11 by the 0 1 m naoh stirring at 600 rpm for 60 min after that the nano fe3o4 particle was separated by applying magnetic field and freeze dried by a freezer dryer besides the relevant characteristic of prepared nano fe3o4 was shown in fig s2 2 2 analysis method 2 2 1 smp and eps extraction smp and eps were extracted by the thermal and centrifugation method banti et al 2018 hwang et al 2010 the detailed description was shown in text s1 2 2 2 membrane fouling analysis the compressibility of the cake layer and membrane fouling resistance was used to analyze the effect of nano fe3o4 particles on controlling membrane fouling in mbr zheng et al 2018 the detailed process was presented in text s2 meanwhile the membrane fouling resistance including the total resistance rt the membrane resistance rm the cake layer resistance rc and the pore blocking resistance rp was analyzed by darcy s equation which was elaborated in text s3 2 2 3 microbial diversity analysis to analyze the change of microbial communities the biomass samples were collected on the 30th day because all reactors reached stability the collected sludge contained activated sludge and biofilm chen et al 2015 and the specific analysis method was shown in text s4 2 2 4 other analysis methods the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn were analyzed by the apha method miner 2006 toc of smp and eps was quantified by a toc analyzer toc vws shimadzu japan thermogravimetry measured the suspended solids ss of sludge mixed liquor at 103 105 c he et al 2018 protein pn and polysaccharide ps were measured by the coomassie brilliant blue g250 method with bovine serum albumin as the standard and anthrone method with glucose as the standard respectively li et al 2018 the ph was analyzed by a ph meter leici shanghai china the adenosine triphosphate atp analysis was measured by a bioluminescence detector spectramax m5 molecular devices san jose usa using fluorescein purchased from shanghai life ilab bio technology co ltd yang et al 2018 the measure of ahls was detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters usa coupling with a time of flight mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization esi waters usa yu et al 2016 the detailed description of the measure of ahls was profiled in text s5 a particle size analyzer malvern 2000 uk was used to detect the particle size distribution the scanning electron microscope hitachi su8000 japan was carried out to observe the membrane fouling and sludge floc morphology meanwhile the fluorescence microscope sunny xy rfl china was also used to analyze the morphology of sludge floc a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 japan was carried out to measure the fluorescence spectra a high performance size exclusion chromatography detected the molecular weight distribution of smp and eps with a uv detector at 254 nm shimadzu japan the concentration of fe in the effluent was analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer agilent 5110 icp oes usa the content of nano fe3o4 particles on the membrane surface was measured by gravimetric method after the whole operation and the detailed expression was profiled in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of nano fe3o4 on membrane fouling 3 1 1 variations of membrane flux fig 1 a presented the variation of tmp for different mbrs during 40 days of operation for the control group r1 mbr the tmp slightly increased to 22 9 kpa and then rushed to 62 7 kpa on the 40th day but the tmp only increased to 41 9 kpa on the 40th day in r3 mbr the organic substance of influent such as tn and cod and the microbial metabolites of the formed biofilm including smp and eps were connected with the membrane fouling in mbr liu et al 2018 however the applied nano fe3o4 particle was invalid for absorbing tn and cod text s7 zhou et al 2014 then the concentration of smp and eps by biological metabolism might play a key role in r3 mbr ma et al 2017 therefore a higher membrane flux in r3 mbr might be ascribed to other reasons rather than the absorption of nano fe3o4 which would be discussed below liu et al 2018 for r2 mbr and r4 mbr it was only 35 3 and 30 8 kpa on the 40th day respectively during the operation of mbr the membrane surface would form biofilm the microbial community of biofilm could produce smp and eps that adhered on the membrane and deteriorated membrane flux xia et al 2010 heterogeneity of biofilm might produce a greater membrane flux in r2 mbr and r4 mbr zhou et al 2014 interestingly r4 mbr had a higher tmp at the initial stage compared with r2 mbr furthermore the tmp of r3 mbr was higher than that in r1 mbr 29 days when the nano fe3o4 particle was added into the sludge mixture i e r3 mbr and r4 mbr the membrane flux would be slightly lower than in r1 mbr in the initial operating period of mbr but r3 mbr achieved a better membrane flux at the end of a whole operation the similar phenomenon was also discovered by the previous study the coated nano fe3o4 particles could slightly reduce the membrane size and deteriorate membrane flux nevertheless the coated nanoparticles increase the roughness of membrane surface which was in favor of reducing membrane fouling by long term operation bagheripour et al 2019 in fig 1b the total membrane fouling resistance was 27 58 1012 m 1 in r1 mbr but it decreased to 20 23 1012 m 1 in r3 mbr nano fe3o4 particle could not absorb the organics of influent smp and eps text s7 so the nano fe3o4 particles in the sludge mixture might affect the microbial metabolism and change the concentration of smp and eps by non adsorption effect liu et al 2018 for r2 mbr and r4 mbr the total membrane fouling resistance decreased to 17 04 1012 and 14 87 1012 m 1 respectively besides pore blocking resistance was even reduced by 52 66 and 67 63 it might be ascribed to the effect of nano fe3o4 on the biofilm of membrane surface the nano fe3o4 particle was prone to alleviate membrane fouling whatever it was added into sludge or coated on the surface of membrane the n value of raw sludge was 2 30 but it declined to 1 42 in containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge from the analysis of cake layer compressibility fig s3 and table s3 so the containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge would induce a lower cake layer fouling accorded with fig 1b 3 1 2 sem analysis sem images were carried to analyze the morphology of membrane foulants the membrane surface of r1 mbr was covered with many sludge flocs which were nubby and tight fig 2 a the morphology of membrane fouling became granular and incompact in r3 mbr and some nano fe3o4 particle was observed in the cake layer fig 2c the nano fe3o4 particle improved the compressibility of the cake layer fig s3 nano fe3o4 particles of the sludge mixture in r3 mbr could be rejected on the membrane surface from text s6 then the nanoparticle might produce the higher compressibility of the cake layer according to the previous study there was a porous and loosened cake layer on the coated fe3o4 nanofiltration membrane after filtrating samples bagheripour et al 2019 zinadini et al 2014 for the r2 mbr its morphology was similar to r1 mbr fig 2b however the coated nano fe3o4 particle membrane had a lower tmp on the 40th day fig 1a it might be ascribed to the effect of nano fe3o4 particles on biofilm composition liu et al 2018 meanwhile there was more nano fe3o4 particle in the surface of contaminative membrane of r4 mbr compared with that in r2 mbr it might be ascribed to the adhesion of nano fe3o4 particle from sludge mixture by the sucking force of peristaltic pump fig 2d and text s6 then the cake layer was looser and presented some fine pore in r4 mbr therefore the applied nano fe3o4 particle effectively changed the membrane filtering performance in r2 r4 mbr the recovery capability of membrane flux was crucial for mbr so the backwashed membrane was observed by sem on the apparent the membrane of four mbrs were semblable after backwash but it presented distinct discrepancy in sem images figs s4 and 2 for the r1 mbr many foulants existed on the surface of membrane after washed which might be the smp and eps of sludge hazrati et al 2018 however only some microbial cell debris and nano fe3o4 particle emerged on the membrane surface in r2 mbr fig 2b besides fewer foulants were remained on the membrane surface of r3 mbr fig 2c the sludge or membrane surface with nano fe3o4 particles might produce less emplastic substance depositing on the membrane surface such as smp and eps iorhemen et al 2017 in fig 2d more nano fe3o4 particles were on the membrane surface after backwash compared with that in r2 mbr the nano fe3o4 particle in activated sludge might be rejected by membrane leading to more residual as discussed in text s6 the nano fe3o4 particle applied in the sludge not only improved membrane flux but was also contributed to membrane cleaning 3 2 characteristics of effluent fig 3 presented the variations of cod tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and org n in the effluent for the cod removal r3 mbr achieved a peak cod removal efficiency fig 3a so the applied nano fe3o4 particle could not deteriorate the effluent quality supported by the previous study liu et al 2018 besides the nano fe3o4 particle also improved the removal efficiency of tn nh4 n no3 n and no2 n however the effluent quality was deteriorated in r4 mbr as compared with that in r2 mbr and r3 mbr the sludge floc could settle on the membrane surface by suction force and electrostatic force forming biological film ivanovic and leiknes 2011 sun et al 2015 then some nano fe3o4 particles were transferred on the membrane surface from activated sludge text s6 the superfluous nano fe3o4 particle was toxic for microorganisms so the removal performance of organics in r4 mbr was lower than that in r2 mbr ma et al 2017 the concentration of atp for formed biofilm in r2 mbr and r4 mbr was also lower than others fig s5 a low concentration of atp with a high removal ratio of organics in r2 mbr might be ascribed to microbial community changes in biofilm by nano fe3o4 zheng et al 2018 additionally the nano fe3o4 particle was added in mbrs except r1 mbr so the concentration of fe in the effluent was detected its concentration of added nano fe3o4 particle group was slightly higher than that in r1 mbr fig 3f however all samples were lower than 0 3 mg l which was the limited value of chinese standard value gb3838 2002 zhou et al 2020 therefore the nano fe3o4 particle was fitting for improving effluent quality and alleviating membrane fouling in mbr 3 3 characteristics of containing nano fe3o4 sludge 3 3 1 morphology analysis of sludge nano fe3o4 particle improved the performance of mbr on organics removal fig 3 so the characteristic of containing nano fe3o4 sludge was investigated the raw sludge contained many fine particles surrounded by smp and eps translucence substance in the microscopic image fig 4 a meanwhile it was composed of a lot of particles forming the nubbly floc from sem image however the translucence substance contained some tiny granules in containing nano fe3o4 sludge it indicated the applied nano fe3o4 particle was embedded into the smp and eps fig 4b therefore the nano fe3o4 particle was integrated with the sludge floc the applied dosage of nano fe3o4 particle also affected the microbial activity ma et al 2017 however the concentration of dna was 65 6 μg l and 71 8 μg l in raw sludge and containing nano fe3o4 sludge respectively fig 4c a fraction of colony might produce maladjustment leading to the inactivation in containing nano fe3o4 sludge then some dna was released into supernate ning et al 2015 but the implanted nano fe3o4 particle in smp and eps of sludge could not excessively destroy the microbial cell the particle size distribution in the range of 0 150 μm increased and the range of 150 800 μm slightly decreased in containing nano fe3o4 sludge fig 4d meanwhile d90 of containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge declined from 292 17 to 266 74 μm fig 4e the agglomeration of microorganisms was connected by smp and eps of sludge forming sludge floc zhen et al 2018 after applying nano fe3o4 particles it acted on smp and eps which restricted the aggregation of sludge floc but microbial activity was impervious liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 3 3 2 smp and eps the concentration of toc for smp and eps in containing nano fe3o4 sludge was lower than that in raw sludge fig 5 a it decreased by 27 07 30 74 and 21 00 in smp lb eps and tb eps after 40 days respectively the smp and eps were the main membrane foulants in mbr so a low concentration of smp and eps could alleviate the membrane resistance in r3 mbr fig 1 the content of pn and ps in smp and lb eps presented similar variations although the pn content of tb eps increased in containing nano fe3o4 sludge it was weakly connected with the bio membrane fouling meng et al 2017 the variation of smp and eps content was simply caused by the change of microbial community liu et al 2018 on the other hand the applied nano fe3o4 particle decreased the average molecular weight of smp from 7339 to 5370 da but it played a small role on eps fig s6a the macromolecule organic matters including pn and ps were biodegraded to the micromolecule substance during the mbr operation the applied nano fe3o4 particle would enhance the biodegradation for organic matter so the r3 mbr had the best effluent quality fig 3 besides the building blocks substance also reduced in containing nano fe3o4 sludge fig s6b c that was prone to form membrane fouling so r3 mbr and r4 mbr achieved a lower membrane fouling resistance than the control group from fig 1b he et al 2021 liu et al 2018 the fluorescence spectra were carried out to analyze the variation of fluorescent material in smp and eps in fig 5b d three peaks were detected which was aromatic protein substance at ex em 225 235 330 350 peak a tryptophan protein like substance at ex em 280 285 330 340 peak b and a humic like substance at ex em 340 350 420 430 peak c liu et al 2016 zhen et al 2012b the intensity of three peaks for smp and eps all reduced in containing nano fe3o4 sludge especially the intensity of peak a for tb eps increased from 3180 to 3301 table s4 that might induce the increase of pn content for tb eps in containing nano particle sludge fig 5a moreover the intensity of peak a decreased by 33 84 and 47 53 and peak b decreased by 29 98 and 33 48 for smp and lb eps respectively it indicated that the nano particle principally influenced the synthesis of aromatic protein substances in smp and eps the membrane fouling included protein like and humic like substances in mbr hazrati et al 2018 then low content of aromatic protein would contribute to an excellent membrane flux fig 1 3 4 microbial activity and community analysis 3 4 1 microbial activity the eps was the microbial metabolites connected with microbial community composition and microbial activity and the concentration of atp could reflect the microbial activity of sludge mixture so it was detected fig 6 a xia et al 2010 zhen et al 2012a the concentration of atp in raw sludge was higher than that in containing nano fe3o4 sludge before the 10th day atp was formed by the breathing of live cells and then it can be set as a parameter for expressing the activation of microorganisms archibald et al 2001 yang et al 2018 the applied nano fe3o4 particle caused maladjustment for the certain microbial population because it changed the primary condition of microorganism growth ma et al 2017 in fig 3 the concentration of cod in the effluent of r3 mbr was also higher than r1 mbr before 10 days the concentration of atp persistently increased in containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge 35 days and was even better than that in raw sludge a previous study found the magnetic power could produce magnetic bio effect forming a high biological activity in mbr liu et al 2018 then the content of atp might persistently increase after microbial fully adapting to the new environment i e nano fe3o4 particle besides the high biological activity in containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge was a reason for a better removal ratio of organic substance in r3 mbr and r4 mbr fig 3 fig 6b showed the increment of suspended solid during the mbr operation in containing nano fe3o4 sludge the average increment of suspended solid was 0 19 g g cod however it reached 0 24 g g cod in raw sludge the r3 mbr had a better effluent quality fig 3 but it had a lower increment of suspended solid fig 6b as usually the great removal ratio of cod was relative to a high increment of suspended solids it might be caused by two main reasons which was the added nano particle coated on the surface of membrane during the filtration process leading to the enhancement of membrane rejection he et al 2014 the other was that the nano fe3o4 particle might change the microorganism species or microbial richness such as increasing certain microflora for organic substance removal liu et al 2018 3 4 2 microbial community and composition the high throughput sequencing measured the microbial community collected from the sludge and biofilm of different mbrs the diversity estimators including chao 1 ace shannon simpson and coverage were shown in table s5 the coverage of all samples exceeded 0 99 which suggested the actual microbial community of different mbrs could be fully expressed by sequencing depth chao 1 and ace expressed the microbial richness and shannon and simpson indicated the microbial diversity ding et al 2015 the raw sludge was different from the other sample by pcoa analysis fig s7 furthermore the major microbial community in r1 mbr and r2 mbr was similar the r3 mbr and r4 mbr were as a group but there was still otherness among different mbrs it suggested the applied nano fe3o4 particle could change microbial community when it was added into the sludge or coated on the membrane surface taxonomic classification of the microbial community at phylum level was shown in fig 7 a the nitrospirae and proteobacteria were dominant phyla in raw sludge after a whole operation period the bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria became dominant phyla in four mbrs meanwhile all samples detected acidobacteria chlamydiate chlorobi firmicutes and planctomycetes which is the common phyla in the lab scale and pilot scale mbr fykse et al 2016 liu et al 2018 the proteobacteria was relevant with the contaminant removal because it included various functional bacteria to remove organic substances qi et al 2016 its percentage was 25 06 33 07 45 11 and 37 22 in r1 mbr r2 mbr r3 mbr and r4 mbr respectively the peak value of organics removal achieved in r3 mbr might be ascribed to a higher abundance of proteobacteria fig 3 meanwhile the proteobacteria also transformed smp from high to small molecules accorded with fig s6 and then alleviated membrane fouling fig 1 ding et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the chloroflexi is cultivated in the anaerobic condition so that it might reproduce at the anaerobic phase of mbr chen et al 2019 meanwhile the nano fe3o4 particle was no apparent influence on it besides bacteroidetes is considered as causing membrane fouling bacteroidetes can secrete many membrane foulants such as proteinaceous eps and attach to the applied particle by its fimbriae guo et al 2015 jo et al 2016 its abundance was 15 21 10 01 4 76 and 3 33 in four mbrs respectively the nano fe3o4 restricted its reproduction in sludge and biofilm and then achieved an outstanding performance on alleviating membrane fouling fig 1 the abundance of nitrospirae also increased in r2 r4 mbr compared with r1 mbr that was a benefit for the removal of nitrogenous substances accorded with fig 3b 19 kinds of bacterial classes were presented at the class level with sequence reads over 1 fig 7b for the proteobacteria phylum the main class includes betaproteobacteria alpthaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria liu et al 2018 the abundance of alpthaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria was enhanced by nano fe3o4 for instance the gammaproteobacteria increased from 8 57 to 13 91 15 10 and 14 74 in r2 r4 mbr respectively the great removal of organic might be mainly caused by the gammaproteobacteria class fig 3 moreover betaproteobacteria class is the pioneer of membrane surface in mbr chen et al 2015 it decreased by 22 28 and 42 71 in r2 mbr and r4 mbr respectively therefore the slow increase of tmp occurred in r2 mbr and r4 mbr fig 1a besides sphingobacteriia class belongs to the bacteroidetes phylum which could deteriorate membrane fouling the r4 mbr had the lowest abundance of sphingobacteriia so that it expressed a highly effective anti pollution capability fig 1 chen et al 2015 in the genus level the top 30 genera were presented in fig 8 after a whole operation process the main microbial community of r1 mbr was norank o jg30 kf cm45 2 23 norank f saprospiraceae 8 93 norank f caldilineaceae 3 89 norank f anaerolineaceae 3 13 and neochlamydia 3 07 the norank f saprospiraceae is subordinate to the bacteroidetes phylum associated with the membrane fouling liu et al 2018 it declined to 6 57 5 15 and 4 00 in r2 r4 mbr respectively a lower percentage of norank f saprospiraceae also indicated a better membrane flux fig 1a besides the norank o jg30 kf cm45 attached to the proteobacteria and its abundance in r3 mbr was higher than others liu et al 2018 the norank f caldilineaceae was assigned to the chloroflexi growing at the anaerobic condition that connected with the removal of organics by anaerobe chen et al 2019 in r3 mbr its abundance increased by 65 79 then the best water quality of effluent was achieved in r3 mbr fig 3 the containing nano fe3o4 sludge had a better performance on the removal of organics fig 3 its abundant proteobacteria and nitrospirae phylum might play a key role in that fig 8a the coated nano fe3o4 membrane especially r4 mbr achieved a greater membrane flux after 40 days the lowest percentage of bacteroidetes 3 33 was a benefit for alleviating membrane fouling in r4 mbr superabundant nano fe3o4 deposited on the membrane biofilm because of sucking force in r4 mbr in biofilm that was harmful for the growth of functional bacteria such as proteobacteria and nitrospirae phylum fig 7 nevertheless the bacteroidetes was impregnable for it so r4 mbr had the best membrane flux fig 1a but the content of organics in the effluent was higher than r3 mbr fig 3 besides the variation of microflora could reduce the content of smp and eps liu et al 2018 then there was less smp and eps in containing nano fe3o4 sludge fig 5 3 5 the change of ahls in containing nano fe3o4 sludge the ahls was a kind of biological metabolite associated with the membrane fouling and its content was influenced by environmental factors yu et al 2016 so the content of ahls was detected after applying nano fe3o4 qs was bacteria that took intracellular and interspecies communication by the small molecular transmitter i e ahls in contrast qq was used to destroy qs process huang et al 2019 for the qq bacteria the total abundance of r2 mbr r3 mbr and r4 mbr were all higher than r1 mbr fig 9 a it suggested that the bacterial communication in activated sludge and biofilm was destroyed by nano fe3o4 particles yu et al 2016 that could decrease the content of smp and eps leading to a greater membrane flux fig 1 interestingly the best performance of membrane flux was achieved in r4 mbr but r3 mbr had the highest abundance of qq bacteria among all mbrs although the qq bacteria was prone to control membrane fouling the lowest abundance of bacteroidetes 3 33 might be the significant reason for alleviating membrane fouling in r4 mbr additionally high content of atp was in the biofilm of r3 mbr so that more smp and eps might be formed on the membrane surface resulting in decreasing membrane flux compared with that in r4 mbr meanwhile the abundance of qs and qq qs bacteria was both restricted by applied nano fe3o4 particle fig 9b c in fig 9d four kinds of ahls were detected in this study which were 3 oxo c8 hsl c8 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl and c14 hsl respectively the xic spectrum shown in fig s8 meanwhile the content of 3 oxo c8 hsl c8 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl and c14 hsl decreased by 26 53 33 03 33 78 and 53 30 in r3 mbr respectively fig 9e it indicated that the applied nano fe3o4 particle was effective for promoting ahls inactivating nano fe3o4 particle restricted qs bacteria with enhancing qq bacteria fig 9a c that formed a lower concentration of ahls in r3 mbr besides the applied nano fe3o4 particle was more prone to reduce the content of long chain ahls such as c14 hsl accorded with the previous study yu et al 2016 alleviating membrane fouling by applied nano fe3o4 particles depended on controlling the concentration of ahls by improving the percentage of qq fig 1 and restricting the growth of bacteroidetes phylum fig 7a meanwhile the particular community for effluent quality such as proteobacteria and nitrospirae phylum was enhanced by nano fe3o4 particles fig 7a and then removed more organics fig 3 conclusions the current study provides a promising method to improve the mbr performance by nano fe3o4 particles it could alleviate membrane fouling and elevate effluent quality by bio effect the main finding was shown below 1 the applied nano fe3o4 increased the abundance of proteobacteria leading to a greater removal of organics and r3 mbr achieved the peak value of 45 11 that was 1 8 times compared with r1 mbr 2 there was a lower percentage of bacteroidetes after applied nano fe3o4 particle which decreased from the 15 21 of r1 mbr to 10 01 4 76 and 3 33 in r2 r4 mbr respectively contributed to alleviating membrane fouling 3 nano fe3o4 particle could decline the concentration of smp and eps in active sludge such as the toc of smp lb eps and tb eps decreased by 27 07 30 74 and 21 00 compared with raw sludge respectively which was also benefit for a higher membrane flux 4 nano fe3o4 particle promoted the growth of qq bacterium and reduce the abundance of qs bacterium resulting in a less concentration of ahls in mbr such as the c14 hsl even decreased by 53 30 in r3 mbr compared with that in r1 mbr declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16396,this study would investigate the effect of nano fe3o4 particles on the performance of membrane bioreactor mbr including membrane fouling membrane rejection and microbial community it can effectively alleviate membrane fouling and improve the effluent quality in mbr by bio effect rather than nanoparticle adsorption the lowest membrane fouling resistance was achieved at r4 mbr sludge and membrane surface with nano fe3o4 which decreased by 46 08 meanwhile r3 mbr sludge with nano fe3o4 had the lowest concentration of cod in effluent which was below 20 mg l in the stable phase of mbr operation after applying nano fe3o4 the content of extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp were both reduced with a lower molecular weight from the microbial community analysis the abundance of proteobacteria increased from 25 06 to 45 11 at the phylum level in r3 mbr it contributed to removing organic substances in mbrs moreover the nano fe3o4 restricted bacteroidetes growth especially in r4 mbr leading to a more excellent performance of membrane flux besides the applied nano fe3o4 promoted the abundance of quorum quenching qq microorganism and declined the percentage of quorum sensing qs bacteria then a lower content of n acyl l homoserine lactones ahls in containing nano fe3o4 sludge that was also prone to control membrane fouling overall this study indicates the nano fe3o4 particle is appropriate for elevating mbr performance such as membrane fouling and effluent quality by bio effect graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nano fe3o4 particle membrane fouling microbial community n acyl l homoserine lactones 1 introduction the membrane bioreactor mbr process combines the conventional activated sludge treatment with membrane separation chen et al 2015 dong et al 2018 it has been widely applied in the wastewater treatment process because of its positive profits of efficient solid liquid separation performance decreasing floor space of treatment process reducing excess sludge production and long solids retention time srt judd 2016 liu et al 2018 luo et al 2018 neoh et al 2016 however membrane fouling including microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf is still a key obstacle to the mbr process for more comprehensive development deng et al 2016 le clech et al 2006 membrane fouling in mbr was mainly caused by the dispreferred deposition of inorganic suspended particles from mixed liquor suspended solids mlss organic fouling substances from the influent and biofouling drews 2010 malaeb et al 2013 wang et al 2014 meanwhile the microorganism absorbing and growing on the membrane surface plays a key role in biofouling it generates smp and eps leading to membrane pore blocking and forming cake layer guo et al 2012 meng et al 2009 ninomiya et al 2020 based on such background many methods are used to control membrane fouling in the mbr process including membrane modification technology aslam et al 2017 gas cleaning such as air in aerobic mbr and biogas in anaerobic mbr verrecht et al 2010 wibisono et al 2014 and changing sludge mixture performance jamal khan et al 2012 kurita et al 2015 but bring about apparent drawbacks the membrane modification technology increases operating costs chen et al 2017 miao et al 2017 while the gas cleaning requires high energy consumption verrecht et al 2010 previous research found that adding granular materials for improving sludge mixture performance is beneficial for controlling membrane fouling in mbrs xiang et al 2010 yuniarto et al 2013 zhou et al 2007 zhu et al 2012 for example powdered activated carbon could absorb organic substances especially smp in sludge mixture and reduce membrane fouling resistance in mbr torretta et al 2013 xiang et al 2010 besides powdered activated carbon could also be utilized by microorganisms as the carbon source ng et al 2013 however the applied adsorbents may elevate residual sludge volume with more dosage to maintain an excellent performance alvarino et al 2017 in addition magnetic activated sludge technology can control membrane fouling in mbr because it is separable by a magnetic field and biocompatible without deteriorating microbial activity liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 the magnetic fe3o4 particles were capable of changing microbial community structure and composition and improving the water quality of effluent liu et al 2018 without complex chemical waste sludge generation zhou et al 2015 in mbr the concentration of nh4 n in effluent decreased by 29 86 after applying the magnetic fe3o4 particles in the active sludge liu et al 2018 when the membrane surface was coated by fe3o4 particles its initial flux might decline due to the reduced membrane size however a smaller membrane size was a benefit for improving membrane rejection performance for instance the nanofiltration membrane coated with fe3o4 particles would elevate about 20 rejection ratio of salt bagheripour et al 2019 furthermore fe3o4 particles could also alleviate the membrane fouling by the formed rougher surface after a more prolonged operation besides the fexoy would change the hydrophilia and charge properties of the membrane surface to improve the membrane rejection and anti fouling ability zhao et al 2018 although the magnetic activated sludge has many advantages in improving sludge mixture performance its characteristics in controlling membrane fouling and mechanism in mbrs are limited liu et al 2018 ma et al 2017 meanwhile previously reported studies merely focused on the performance of magnetic activated sludge but overlooked the variation of bioeffect in mbrs by magnetic substance thus the nano fe3o4 particle formed by precipitation oxidization preparation was used to alleviate membrane fouling and improve effluent quality in mbr the collected nano fe3o4 particle was added into the sludge mixture or coated on the surface of membrane and then demonstrated their performance in mbr the following objectives would be achieved through this study 1 analyzing the effect of the nano fe3o4 particle on membrane flux membrane fouling resistance and membrane rejection performance 2 assessing the variation of microbial community and composition 3 analyzing the variation of qs and detecting the content of ahls 4 discussing the mechanism of the nano fe3o4 particle on improving mbr property 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr characteristic and operating condition four lab scale mbrs were set up which was r1 mbr sludge without nano fe3o4 and membrane surface without nano fe3o4 r2 mbr sludge without nano fe3o4 and membrane surface with nano fe3o4 r3 mbr sludge with nano fe3o4 and membrane surface without nano fe3o4 and r4 mbr sludge with nano fe3o4 and membrane surface with nano fe3o4 respectively the lab scale mbr was with a working volume of 6 l including anoxic tank 3 l and aerobic tank 3 l and the schematic description of mbr was shown in fig s1 meanwhile the 0 8 g l nano fe3o4 particles were added into activated sludge of r3 mbr and r4 mbr liu et al 2018 moreover the membrane module of r2 mbr and r4 mbr was immersed to 500 ml milli q with 0 6 g nano fe3o4 particle and stirred by magnetic stirrers then it was circulating pumped by a peristaltic pump at the flow rate of 0 1 m3 h for 48 h to ensure the particle was fully coated on the membrane surface the membrane module was made up by polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf flat membrane risingsun membrane technology co ltd beijing china with a nominal membrane pore size of 0 1 μm and its effective surface area was 0 0072 m2 all mbrs had the same hydraulic retention time of 10 h and the sludge retention time of 40 days activated sludge was collected from the sludge export of aao process in wenchang sewage treatment plant harbin china four mbrs were fed with the prepared synthetic wastewater by sodium acetate its parameters were shown in table s1 an air pump was used to supply air at the flow rate of about 0 1 m3 h for 40 days the peristaltic pump was carried out to extract filtrate from the membrane module at a constant permeate flux of 2 315 10 6 m s trans membrane pressure tmp was measured by a vacuum manometer 0 1 mpa capacity and manually recorded every 24 h the nano fe3o4 particle was prepared by the method of precipitation oxidization qiu et al 2018 a 40 ml 0 125 m ferric chloride solution was added into a three necked flask stirring at 600 rpm for 30 min and then 3 mmol fecl2 4h2o was doped into the flask with the n2 protection the reactor was heated at 80 c for 15 min in a water bath and adjusted ph to 11 by the 0 1 m naoh stirring at 600 rpm for 60 min after that the nano fe3o4 particle was separated by applying magnetic field and freeze dried by a freezer dryer besides the relevant characteristic of prepared nano fe3o4 was shown in fig s2 2 2 analysis method 2 2 1 smp and eps extraction smp and eps were extracted by the thermal and centrifugation method banti et al 2018 hwang et al 2010 the detailed description was shown in text s1 2 2 2 membrane fouling analysis the compressibility of the cake layer and membrane fouling resistance was used to analyze the effect of nano fe3o4 particles on controlling membrane fouling in mbr zheng et al 2018 the detailed process was presented in text s2 meanwhile the membrane fouling resistance including the total resistance rt the membrane resistance rm the cake layer resistance rc and the pore blocking resistance rp was analyzed by darcy s equation which was elaborated in text s3 2 2 3 microbial diversity analysis to analyze the change of microbial communities the biomass samples were collected on the 30th day because all reactors reached stability the collected sludge contained activated sludge and biofilm chen et al 2015 and the specific analysis method was shown in text s4 2 2 4 other analysis methods the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn were analyzed by the apha method miner 2006 toc of smp and eps was quantified by a toc analyzer toc vws shimadzu japan thermogravimetry measured the suspended solids ss of sludge mixed liquor at 103 105 c he et al 2018 protein pn and polysaccharide ps were measured by the coomassie brilliant blue g250 method with bovine serum albumin as the standard and anthrone method with glucose as the standard respectively li et al 2018 the ph was analyzed by a ph meter leici shanghai china the adenosine triphosphate atp analysis was measured by a bioluminescence detector spectramax m5 molecular devices san jose usa using fluorescein purchased from shanghai life ilab bio technology co ltd yang et al 2018 the measure of ahls was detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc waters usa coupling with a time of flight mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization esi waters usa yu et al 2016 the detailed description of the measure of ahls was profiled in text s5 a particle size analyzer malvern 2000 uk was used to detect the particle size distribution the scanning electron microscope hitachi su8000 japan was carried out to observe the membrane fouling and sludge floc morphology meanwhile the fluorescence microscope sunny xy rfl china was also used to analyze the morphology of sludge floc a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f7000 japan was carried out to measure the fluorescence spectra a high performance size exclusion chromatography detected the molecular weight distribution of smp and eps with a uv detector at 254 nm shimadzu japan the concentration of fe in the effluent was analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer agilent 5110 icp oes usa the content of nano fe3o4 particles on the membrane surface was measured by gravimetric method after the whole operation and the detailed expression was profiled in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of nano fe3o4 on membrane fouling 3 1 1 variations of membrane flux fig 1 a presented the variation of tmp for different mbrs during 40 days of operation for the control group r1 mbr the tmp slightly increased to 22 9 kpa and then rushed to 62 7 kpa on the 40th day but the tmp only increased to 41 9 kpa on the 40th day in r3 mbr the organic substance of influent such as tn and cod and the microbial metabolites of the formed biofilm including smp and eps were connected with the membrane fouling in mbr liu et al 2018 however the applied nano fe3o4 particle was invalid for absorbing tn and cod text s7 zhou et al 2014 then the concentration of smp and eps by biological metabolism might play a key role in r3 mbr ma et al 2017 therefore a higher membrane flux in r3 mbr might be ascribed to other reasons rather than the absorption of nano fe3o4 which would be discussed below liu et al 2018 for r2 mbr and r4 mbr it was only 35 3 and 30 8 kpa on the 40th day respectively during the operation of mbr the membrane surface would form biofilm the microbial community of biofilm could produce smp and eps that adhered on the membrane and deteriorated membrane flux xia et al 2010 heterogeneity of biofilm might produce a greater membrane flux in r2 mbr and r4 mbr zhou et al 2014 interestingly r4 mbr had a higher tmp at the initial stage compared with r2 mbr furthermore the tmp of r3 mbr was higher than that in r1 mbr 29 days when the nano fe3o4 particle was added into the sludge mixture i e r3 mbr and r4 mbr the membrane flux would be slightly lower than in r1 mbr in the initial operating period of mbr but r3 mbr achieved a better membrane flux at the end of a whole operation the similar phenomenon was also discovered by the previous study the coated nano fe3o4 particles could slightly reduce the membrane size and deteriorate membrane flux nevertheless the coated nanoparticles increase the roughness of membrane surface which was in favor of reducing membrane fouling by long term operation bagheripour et al 2019 in fig 1b the total membrane fouling resistance was 27 58 1012 m 1 in r1 mbr but it decreased to 20 23 1012 m 1 in r3 mbr nano fe3o4 particle could not absorb the organics of influent smp and eps text s7 so the nano fe3o4 particles in the sludge mixture might affect the microbial metabolism and change the concentration of smp and eps by non adsorption effect liu et al 2018 for r2 mbr and r4 mbr the total membrane fouling resistance decreased to 17 04 1012 and 14 87 1012 m 1 respectively besides pore blocking resistance was even reduced by 52 66 and 67 63 it might be ascribed to the effect of nano fe3o4 on the biofilm of membrane surface the nano fe3o4 particle was prone to alleviate membrane fouling whatever it was added into sludge or coated on the surface of membrane the n value of raw sludge was 2 30 but it declined to 1 42 in containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge from the analysis of cake layer compressibility fig s3 and table s3 so the containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge would induce a lower cake layer fouling accorded with fig 1b 3 1 2 sem analysis sem images were carried to analyze the morphology of membrane foulants the membrane surface of r1 mbr was covered with many sludge flocs which were nubby and tight fig 2 a the morphology of membrane fouling became granular and incompact in r3 mbr and some nano fe3o4 particle was observed in the cake layer fig 2c the nano fe3o4 particle improved the compressibility of the cake layer fig s3 nano fe3o4 particles of the sludge mixture in r3 mbr could be rejected on the membrane surface from text s6 then the nanoparticle might produce the higher compressibility of the cake layer according to the previous study there was a porous and loosened cake layer on the coated fe3o4 nanofiltration membrane after filtrating samples bagheripour et al 2019 zinadini et al 2014 for the r2 mbr its morphology was similar to r1 mbr fig 2b however the coated nano fe3o4 particle membrane had a lower tmp on the 40th day fig 1a it might be ascribed to the effect of nano fe3o4 particles on biofilm composition liu et al 2018 meanwhile there was more nano fe3o4 particle in the surface of contaminative membrane of r4 mbr compared with that in r2 mbr it might be ascribed to the adhesion of nano fe3o4 particle from sludge mixture by the sucking force of peristaltic pump fig 2d and text s6 then the cake layer was looser and presented some fine pore in r4 mbr therefore the applied nano fe3o4 particle effectively changed the membrane filtering performance in r2 r4 mbr the recovery capability of membrane flux was crucial for mbr so the backwashed membrane was observed by sem on the apparent the membrane of four mbrs were semblable after backwash but it presented distinct discrepancy in sem images figs s4 and 2 for the r1 mbr many foulants existed on the surface of membrane after washed which might be the smp and eps of sludge hazrati et al 2018 however only some microbial cell debris and nano fe3o4 particle emerged on the membrane surface in r2 mbr fig 2b besides fewer foulants were remained on the membrane surface of r3 mbr fig 2c the sludge or membrane surface with nano fe3o4 particles might produce less emplastic substance depositing on the membrane surface such as smp and eps iorhemen et al 2017 in fig 2d more nano fe3o4 particles were on the membrane surface after backwash compared with that in r2 mbr the nano fe3o4 particle in activated sludge might be rejected by membrane leading to more residual as discussed in text s6 the nano fe3o4 particle applied in the sludge not only improved membrane flux but was also contributed to membrane cleaning 3 2 characteristics of effluent fig 3 presented the variations of cod tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and org n in the effluent for the cod removal r3 mbr achieved a peak cod removal efficiency fig 3a so the applied nano fe3o4 particle could not deteriorate the effluent quality supported by the previous study liu et al 2018 besides the nano fe3o4 particle also improved the removal efficiency of tn nh4 n no3 n and no2 n however the effluent quality was deteriorated in r4 mbr as compared with that in r2 mbr and r3 mbr the sludge floc could settle on the membrane surface by suction force and electrostatic force forming biological film ivanovic and leiknes 2011 sun et al 2015 then some nano fe3o4 particles were transferred on the membrane surface from activated sludge text s6 the superfluous nano fe3o4 particle was toxic for microorganisms so the removal performance of organics in r4 mbr was lower than that in r2 mbr ma et al 2017 the concentration of atp for formed biofilm in r2 mbr and r4 mbr was also lower than others fig s5 a low concentration of atp with a high removal ratio of organics in r2 mbr might be ascribed to microbial community changes in biofilm by nano fe3o4 zheng et al 2018 additionally the nano fe3o4 particle was added in mbrs except r1 mbr so the concentration of fe in the effluent was detected its concentration of added nano fe3o4 particle group was slightly higher than that in r1 mbr fig 3f however all samples were lower than 0 3 mg l which was the limited value of chinese standard value gb3838 2002 zhou et al 2020 therefore the nano fe3o4 particle was fitting for improving effluent quality and alleviating membrane fouling in mbr 3 3 characteristics of containing nano fe3o4 sludge 3 3 1 morphology analysis of sludge nano fe3o4 particle improved the performance of mbr on organics removal fig 3 so the characteristic of containing nano fe3o4 sludge was investigated the raw sludge contained many fine particles surrounded by smp and eps translucence substance in the microscopic image fig 4 a meanwhile it was composed of a lot of particles forming the nubbly floc from sem image however the translucence substance contained some tiny granules in containing nano fe3o4 sludge it indicated the applied nano fe3o4 particle was embedded into the smp and eps fig 4b therefore the nano fe3o4 particle was integrated with the sludge floc the applied dosage of nano fe3o4 particle also affected the microbial activity ma et al 2017 however the concentration of dna was 65 6 μg l and 71 8 μg l in raw sludge and containing nano fe3o4 sludge respectively fig 4c a fraction of colony might produce maladjustment leading to the inactivation in containing nano fe3o4 sludge then some dna was released into supernate ning et al 2015 but the implanted nano fe3o4 particle in smp and eps of sludge could not excessively destroy the microbial cell the particle size distribution in the range of 0 150 μm increased and the range of 150 800 μm slightly decreased in containing nano fe3o4 sludge fig 4d meanwhile d90 of containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge declined from 292 17 to 266 74 μm fig 4e the agglomeration of microorganisms was connected by smp and eps of sludge forming sludge floc zhen et al 2018 after applying nano fe3o4 particles it acted on smp and eps which restricted the aggregation of sludge floc but microbial activity was impervious liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 3 3 2 smp and eps the concentration of toc for smp and eps in containing nano fe3o4 sludge was lower than that in raw sludge fig 5 a it decreased by 27 07 30 74 and 21 00 in smp lb eps and tb eps after 40 days respectively the smp and eps were the main membrane foulants in mbr so a low concentration of smp and eps could alleviate the membrane resistance in r3 mbr fig 1 the content of pn and ps in smp and lb eps presented similar variations although the pn content of tb eps increased in containing nano fe3o4 sludge it was weakly connected with the bio membrane fouling meng et al 2017 the variation of smp and eps content was simply caused by the change of microbial community liu et al 2018 on the other hand the applied nano fe3o4 particle decreased the average molecular weight of smp from 7339 to 5370 da but it played a small role on eps fig s6a the macromolecule organic matters including pn and ps were biodegraded to the micromolecule substance during the mbr operation the applied nano fe3o4 particle would enhance the biodegradation for organic matter so the r3 mbr had the best effluent quality fig 3 besides the building blocks substance also reduced in containing nano fe3o4 sludge fig s6b c that was prone to form membrane fouling so r3 mbr and r4 mbr achieved a lower membrane fouling resistance than the control group from fig 1b he et al 2021 liu et al 2018 the fluorescence spectra were carried out to analyze the variation of fluorescent material in smp and eps in fig 5b d three peaks were detected which was aromatic protein substance at ex em 225 235 330 350 peak a tryptophan protein like substance at ex em 280 285 330 340 peak b and a humic like substance at ex em 340 350 420 430 peak c liu et al 2016 zhen et al 2012b the intensity of three peaks for smp and eps all reduced in containing nano fe3o4 sludge especially the intensity of peak a for tb eps increased from 3180 to 3301 table s4 that might induce the increase of pn content for tb eps in containing nano particle sludge fig 5a moreover the intensity of peak a decreased by 33 84 and 47 53 and peak b decreased by 29 98 and 33 48 for smp and lb eps respectively it indicated that the nano particle principally influenced the synthesis of aromatic protein substances in smp and eps the membrane fouling included protein like and humic like substances in mbr hazrati et al 2018 then low content of aromatic protein would contribute to an excellent membrane flux fig 1 3 4 microbial activity and community analysis 3 4 1 microbial activity the eps was the microbial metabolites connected with microbial community composition and microbial activity and the concentration of atp could reflect the microbial activity of sludge mixture so it was detected fig 6 a xia et al 2010 zhen et al 2012a the concentration of atp in raw sludge was higher than that in containing nano fe3o4 sludge before the 10th day atp was formed by the breathing of live cells and then it can be set as a parameter for expressing the activation of microorganisms archibald et al 2001 yang et al 2018 the applied nano fe3o4 particle caused maladjustment for the certain microbial population because it changed the primary condition of microorganism growth ma et al 2017 in fig 3 the concentration of cod in the effluent of r3 mbr was also higher than r1 mbr before 10 days the concentration of atp persistently increased in containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge 35 days and was even better than that in raw sludge a previous study found the magnetic power could produce magnetic bio effect forming a high biological activity in mbr liu et al 2018 then the content of atp might persistently increase after microbial fully adapting to the new environment i e nano fe3o4 particle besides the high biological activity in containing nano fe3o4 particle sludge was a reason for a better removal ratio of organic substance in r3 mbr and r4 mbr fig 3 fig 6b showed the increment of suspended solid during the mbr operation in containing nano fe3o4 sludge the average increment of suspended solid was 0 19 g g cod however it reached 0 24 g g cod in raw sludge the r3 mbr had a better effluent quality fig 3 but it had a lower increment of suspended solid fig 6b as usually the great removal ratio of cod was relative to a high increment of suspended solids it might be caused by two main reasons which was the added nano particle coated on the surface of membrane during the filtration process leading to the enhancement of membrane rejection he et al 2014 the other was that the nano fe3o4 particle might change the microorganism species or microbial richness such as increasing certain microflora for organic substance removal liu et al 2018 3 4 2 microbial community and composition the high throughput sequencing measured the microbial community collected from the sludge and biofilm of different mbrs the diversity estimators including chao 1 ace shannon simpson and coverage were shown in table s5 the coverage of all samples exceeded 0 99 which suggested the actual microbial community of different mbrs could be fully expressed by sequencing depth chao 1 and ace expressed the microbial richness and shannon and simpson indicated the microbial diversity ding et al 2015 the raw sludge was different from the other sample by pcoa analysis fig s7 furthermore the major microbial community in r1 mbr and r2 mbr was similar the r3 mbr and r4 mbr were as a group but there was still otherness among different mbrs it suggested the applied nano fe3o4 particle could change microbial community when it was added into the sludge or coated on the membrane surface taxonomic classification of the microbial community at phylum level was shown in fig 7 a the nitrospirae and proteobacteria were dominant phyla in raw sludge after a whole operation period the bacteroidetes chloroflexi and proteobacteria became dominant phyla in four mbrs meanwhile all samples detected acidobacteria chlamydiate chlorobi firmicutes and planctomycetes which is the common phyla in the lab scale and pilot scale mbr fykse et al 2016 liu et al 2018 the proteobacteria was relevant with the contaminant removal because it included various functional bacteria to remove organic substances qi et al 2016 its percentage was 25 06 33 07 45 11 and 37 22 in r1 mbr r2 mbr r3 mbr and r4 mbr respectively the peak value of organics removal achieved in r3 mbr might be ascribed to a higher abundance of proteobacteria fig 3 meanwhile the proteobacteria also transformed smp from high to small molecules accorded with fig s6 and then alleviated membrane fouling fig 1 ding et al 2015 liu et al 2018 the chloroflexi is cultivated in the anaerobic condition so that it might reproduce at the anaerobic phase of mbr chen et al 2019 meanwhile the nano fe3o4 particle was no apparent influence on it besides bacteroidetes is considered as causing membrane fouling bacteroidetes can secrete many membrane foulants such as proteinaceous eps and attach to the applied particle by its fimbriae guo et al 2015 jo et al 2016 its abundance was 15 21 10 01 4 76 and 3 33 in four mbrs respectively the nano fe3o4 restricted its reproduction in sludge and biofilm and then achieved an outstanding performance on alleviating membrane fouling fig 1 the abundance of nitrospirae also increased in r2 r4 mbr compared with r1 mbr that was a benefit for the removal of nitrogenous substances accorded with fig 3b 19 kinds of bacterial classes were presented at the class level with sequence reads over 1 fig 7b for the proteobacteria phylum the main class includes betaproteobacteria alpthaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria liu et al 2018 the abundance of alpthaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria was enhanced by nano fe3o4 for instance the gammaproteobacteria increased from 8 57 to 13 91 15 10 and 14 74 in r2 r4 mbr respectively the great removal of organic might be mainly caused by the gammaproteobacteria class fig 3 moreover betaproteobacteria class is the pioneer of membrane surface in mbr chen et al 2015 it decreased by 22 28 and 42 71 in r2 mbr and r4 mbr respectively therefore the slow increase of tmp occurred in r2 mbr and r4 mbr fig 1a besides sphingobacteriia class belongs to the bacteroidetes phylum which could deteriorate membrane fouling the r4 mbr had the lowest abundance of sphingobacteriia so that it expressed a highly effective anti pollution capability fig 1 chen et al 2015 in the genus level the top 30 genera were presented in fig 8 after a whole operation process the main microbial community of r1 mbr was norank o jg30 kf cm45 2 23 norank f saprospiraceae 8 93 norank f caldilineaceae 3 89 norank f anaerolineaceae 3 13 and neochlamydia 3 07 the norank f saprospiraceae is subordinate to the bacteroidetes phylum associated with the membrane fouling liu et al 2018 it declined to 6 57 5 15 and 4 00 in r2 r4 mbr respectively a lower percentage of norank f saprospiraceae also indicated a better membrane flux fig 1a besides the norank o jg30 kf cm45 attached to the proteobacteria and its abundance in r3 mbr was higher than others liu et al 2018 the norank f caldilineaceae was assigned to the chloroflexi growing at the anaerobic condition that connected with the removal of organics by anaerobe chen et al 2019 in r3 mbr its abundance increased by 65 79 then the best water quality of effluent was achieved in r3 mbr fig 3 the containing nano fe3o4 sludge had a better performance on the removal of organics fig 3 its abundant proteobacteria and nitrospirae phylum might play a key role in that fig 8a the coated nano fe3o4 membrane especially r4 mbr achieved a greater membrane flux after 40 days the lowest percentage of bacteroidetes 3 33 was a benefit for alleviating membrane fouling in r4 mbr superabundant nano fe3o4 deposited on the membrane biofilm because of sucking force in r4 mbr in biofilm that was harmful for the growth of functional bacteria such as proteobacteria and nitrospirae phylum fig 7 nevertheless the bacteroidetes was impregnable for it so r4 mbr had the best membrane flux fig 1a but the content of organics in the effluent was higher than r3 mbr fig 3 besides the variation of microflora could reduce the content of smp and eps liu et al 2018 then there was less smp and eps in containing nano fe3o4 sludge fig 5 3 5 the change of ahls in containing nano fe3o4 sludge the ahls was a kind of biological metabolite associated with the membrane fouling and its content was influenced by environmental factors yu et al 2016 so the content of ahls was detected after applying nano fe3o4 qs was bacteria that took intracellular and interspecies communication by the small molecular transmitter i e ahls in contrast qq was used to destroy qs process huang et al 2019 for the qq bacteria the total abundance of r2 mbr r3 mbr and r4 mbr were all higher than r1 mbr fig 9 a it suggested that the bacterial communication in activated sludge and biofilm was destroyed by nano fe3o4 particles yu et al 2016 that could decrease the content of smp and eps leading to a greater membrane flux fig 1 interestingly the best performance of membrane flux was achieved in r4 mbr but r3 mbr had the highest abundance of qq bacteria among all mbrs although the qq bacteria was prone to control membrane fouling the lowest abundance of bacteroidetes 3 33 might be the significant reason for alleviating membrane fouling in r4 mbr additionally high content of atp was in the biofilm of r3 mbr so that more smp and eps might be formed on the membrane surface resulting in decreasing membrane flux compared with that in r4 mbr meanwhile the abundance of qs and qq qs bacteria was both restricted by applied nano fe3o4 particle fig 9b c in fig 9d four kinds of ahls were detected in this study which were 3 oxo c8 hsl c8 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl and c14 hsl respectively the xic spectrum shown in fig s8 meanwhile the content of 3 oxo c8 hsl c8 hsl 3 oxo c12 hsl and c14 hsl decreased by 26 53 33 03 33 78 and 53 30 in r3 mbr respectively fig 9e it indicated that the applied nano fe3o4 particle was effective for promoting ahls inactivating nano fe3o4 particle restricted qs bacteria with enhancing qq bacteria fig 9a c that formed a lower concentration of ahls in r3 mbr besides the applied nano fe3o4 particle was more prone to reduce the content of long chain ahls such as c14 hsl accorded with the previous study yu et al 2016 alleviating membrane fouling by applied nano fe3o4 particles depended on controlling the concentration of ahls by improving the percentage of qq fig 1 and restricting the growth of bacteroidetes phylum fig 7a meanwhile the particular community for effluent quality such as proteobacteria and nitrospirae phylum was enhanced by nano fe3o4 particles fig 7a and then removed more organics fig 3 conclusions the current study provides a promising method to improve the mbr performance by nano fe3o4 particles it could alleviate membrane fouling and elevate effluent quality by bio effect the main finding was shown below 1 the applied nano fe3o4 increased the abundance of proteobacteria leading to a greater removal of organics and r3 mbr achieved the peak value of 45 11 that was 1 8 times compared with r1 mbr 2 there was a lower percentage of bacteroidetes after applied nano fe3o4 particle which decreased from the 15 21 of r1 mbr to 10 01 4 76 and 3 33 in r2 r4 mbr respectively contributed to alleviating membrane fouling 3 nano fe3o4 particle could decline the concentration of smp and eps in active sludge such as the toc of smp lb eps and tb eps decreased by 27 07 30 74 and 21 00 compared with raw sludge respectively which was also benefit for a higher membrane flux 4 nano fe3o4 particle promoted the growth of qq bacterium and reduce the abundance of qs bacterium resulting in a less concentration of ahls in mbr such as the c14 hsl even decreased by 53 30 in r3 mbr compared with that in r1 mbr declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16397,ozonation of secondary treated wastewater for the abatement of micropollutants requires a reliable control of ozone doses changes in the uv absorbance of dissolved organic matter dom during ozonation allow to estimate micropollutant abatement on line and were therefore identified as feed back control parameter in this study the suitability of the electron donating capacity edc as an additional surrogate parameter which is independent of optical dom properties was evaluated during full scale ozonation for this purpose a recently developed edc analyzer was enhanced to enable continuous on line edc and uv absorbance measurements during a multi week monitoring campaign at the wastewater treatment plant of zurich switzerland specific ozone doses were varied from 0 13 to 0 91 mgo3 mgdoc 1 and selected micropollutants with different ozone reactivities were analyzed by lc ms in conjunction with bromate analysis by ic ms in agreement with previous laboratory studies the relative residual uv absorbance and edc both decreased exponentially as a function of the specific ozone dose and in comparison to the residual uv absorbance residual edc values showed a more pronounced decrease at low specific ozone doses 0 34 mgo3 mgdoc 1 logistic regression models allowed to estimate relative residual micropollutant concentrations in the ozonation effluent using either the residual uv absorbance or edc as explanatory variable averaging those models along the explanatory variables allowed to estimate target values in relative residual uv absorbances and edc for specific micropollutant abatement targets in addition both parameters allowed to identify conditions with elevated conversions of bromide to bromate taken together these findings show that the integration of relative residual edc values as a second control parameter can improve existing absorbance based ozonation control systems to meet micropollutant abatement targets particularly for treatment systems where low ozone doses are applied graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozonation micropollutant abatement electron donating capacity uv absorbance on line monitoring 1 introduction ozonation is increasingly applied for enhanced wastewater treatment to oxidize a wide range of organic micropollutants thereby mitigating their discharge to the aquatic environment eggen et al 2014 völker et al 2019 von gunten 2018 for this purpose ozone o3 is dosed to secondary treated wastewater where it selectively oxidizes micropollutants containing electron rich moieties such as olefins activated aromatics including phenols and neutral amines bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 at the same time o3 also reacts with dissolved organic matter dom and dissolved inorganic compounds forming hydroxyl radical oh a less selective oxidant which also contributes to the oxidation of micropollutants and dom buffle et al 2006b buffle and von gunten 2006 nöthe et al 2009 remucal et al 2020 the extent of micropollutant abatement is primarily determined by the exposure of the oxidants o3 and oh i e o3 and oh concentrations integrated over time and the rate constants of the reactions of these micropollutants with o3 and oh lee et al 2013 oxidant exposures not only depend on the o3 doses but also on complex reaction systems involving dom and inorganic compounds such as nitrite lee et al 2013 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 at the same time excessive oxidant exposures can cause the formation of problematic oxidation by products such as bromate a possible carcinogen and regulated drinking water contaminant soltermann et al 2016 von gunten and hoigné 1994 in addition the production of o3 consumes significant amounts of electrical energy katsoyiannis et al 2011 overall an accurate and reliable control of applied o3 doses is critical to reach optimal oxidant exposures and an energy efficient abatement of micropollutants with a minimal formation of oxidation by products because on line predictions or measurements of oxidant exposures and micropollutant concentrations are unfeasible in secondary treated wastewater changes in optical dom properties have been suggested as surrogate parameters for micropollutant abatement during full scale ozonation bahr et al 2007 deniere et al 2021 dickenson et al 2009 gerrity et al 2012 stapf et al 2016 wittmer et al 2015 ozonation induced decreases of the uv absorbance and fluorescence of dom reflect the oxidation of chromophoric dom moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wenk et al 2013 wert et al 2009a westerhoff et al 1999 numerous studies have reported correlations between relative decreases in uv absorbances and the abatement of individual micropollutants bahr et al 2007 buffle et al 2006a dickenson et al 2009 gerrity et al 2012 nanaboina and korshin 2010 song et al 2021 wert et al 2009b these relative decreases in uv absorbance proved to be suitable surrogate parameters for the on line estimation of micropollutant abatement and control of o3 doses in secondary treated municipal wastewater stapf et al 2016 wittmer et al 2015 besides changes in uv absorbance effects of ozonation on fluorescence signals have also been explored and used to expand existing surrogate models for the estimation of micropollutant abatement chys et al 2017 gerrity et al 2012 while these approaches proved useful the availability of a second surrogate parameter which is independent of optical dom properties would be beneficial to increase the accuracy reliability and resilience of existing on line process monitoring and control systems for the ozonation of secondary treated wastewater in laboratory experiments the electron donating capacity edc of dom was shown to potentially serve as such an additional independent surrogate parameter chon et al 2015 the edc is operationally defined as the number of electrons transferred from dom to an oxidant at a constant ph and reduction potential e h aeschbacher et al 2010 with the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulphonate abts as oxidant edc values were demonstrated to be a measure for the content of phenolic moieties of dom aeschbacher et al 2012 abts can be prepared through a chemical or electrochemical one electron oxidation of abts and can be detected electrochemically or photometrically e g at an absorption maximum at 730 nm aeschbacher et al 2012 chon et al 2015 scott et al 1993 walpen et al 2016 because ozonation of dom leads to the oxidation of phenolic moieties ramseier and von gunten 2009 remucal et al 2020 tentscher et al 2018 edc values decrease in parallel to the abatement of uv absorbances chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 wenk et al 2013 during the ozonation of secondary treated wastewater samples decreases in edc also correlated with the abatement of spiked micropollutants chon et al 2015 however these observations were only a proof of concept and limited to a small number of micropollutants and because of the lack of automated devices for the quantification of edc limited to a few laboratory ozonation experiments to advance the analytical techniques and to enable a continuous on line monitoring of changes in edc and uv absorbance we have recently developed an edc analyzer and validated the analyzer in the laboratory walpen et al 2020 yet the edc analyzer required further development for an entirely automated on site operation for this several practical issues have to be addressed including i the continuous supply with filtered sample solution ii a more rugged fluidic system suitable for an industrial environment and iii a robust and resilient device control because of the lack of an appropriate analytical device a systematic study correlating continuously measured decreases in edc and the abatement organic micropollutants during full scale ozonation to evaluate edc as a surrogate parameter under realistic conditions is still missing to address this gap this study assesses the suitability of on line edc measurements in comparison to uv absorbance measurements as surrogate parameter for micropollutant abatement during the full scale ozonation at a municipal wastewater treatment plant for this purpose the previously developed edc analyzer was further improved and completely automated to enable on line measurements of changes in edc and uv absorbance compared to the previously presented analyzer walpen et al 2020 the new device additionally included sample filtration modules a more robust fluidic system mounted to a mobile platform wagon and was completely automated using an industry grade programmable logical controller for continuous sampling and measurement a repeated analysis of a batch of influent and effluent of the ozonation reactors was performed to assess the analytical performance of the analyzer and it was applied to continuously monitor the residual uv absorbance and edc during full scale ozonation during this monitoring campaign o3 doses were varied and the resulting abatement of 22 selected micropollutants and formation of bromate were quantified in grab samples to assess on line edc measurements as surrogate parameter for micropollutant abatement regression models using either the residual uv absorbance or edc to estimate residual micropollutant concentrations were compared 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions for the edc analyzer the edc analyzer was supplied with two reactant solutions containing abts and chlorine respectively a phosphate buffer solution as well as deionized water and a 2 propanol water mixture 50 v v aliquots of the abts and chlorine solutions were automatically mixed during every measurement cycle to yield the oxidative reagent abts details see below the abts solution contained 1 mm abts 98 sigma aldrich and was acidified with sulfuric acid 95 w w sigma aldrich final concentration 18 mm to prevent microbial growth and to maintain a ph of 2 during the oxidation of abts to abts by chlorine the chlorine solution was prepared by diluting a concentrated hypochlorite stock solution 6 14 active chlorine sigma aldrich in water free available chlorine concentrations were quantified in dilute basic solution aliquots using the molar absorptivity of hypochlorite ε 292nm 350 m 1 cm 1 ph 11 soulard et al 1981 to stabilize the chlorine solution the ph was raised to 11 using a naoh solution 1 mm the phosphate buffer solution 500 mm phosphate disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate 99 5 sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate 99 0 102 0 merck was used to buffer the final reaction mixture of dom containing samples and the abts reagent solution at ph 7 the abts chlorine and buffer solutions were all prepared using ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 mω cm arium ultrapure water system sartorius germany otherwise deionized water was used quality not monitored all solutions were stored at room temperature in 1 l glass bottles except deionized water which was stored in 5 l polyethylene canisters the stability of the abts and chlorine solution was ensured by monitoring the resulting abts concentration in the final reaction mixtures of dom free blanks and abts reagent solution 1 decrease in a 730nm over 24 days see figure s1 supporting information si during routine operation the edc analyzer used approximately 24 ml abts solution and 10 ml chlorine solution per day both solutions were replaced at least every two months 2 2 design and operation of the edc analyzer the edc analyzer automatically determined the relative residual uv absorbance and the edc in sequential measurement cycles at a frequency of approximately one measurement per hour at the beginning of a measurement cycle a batch of abts reagent solution was prepared which was subsequently used to analyze a an ozonation influent b a dom free blank and c an ozonation effluent sample this measurement cycle was based on large parts on a previously validated procedure walpen et al 2020 transport of all liquids fig 1 was handled by a syringe pump cadent 3 imi precision equipped with a zero dead volume syringe v 2 5 ml connected to a 12 way rotary selector valve the syringe pump was connected to four modules which enabled i preparation of an abts reagent solution ii sample collection and filtration iii detection of uv absorbance and mixing and iv detection of edc to enable the automatic operation of the edc analyzer all active units and sensors were connected to a programmable logic controller pfc200 wago germany the controller was programmed to automatically start the measurement cycles including regular cleaning intervals see below once the device is supplied with electrical power and was therefore able to operate autonomously analysis results were stored locally on a memory card and downloaded via a lte connection to the controller 2 2 1 preparation of abts reagent solution to obtain a batch of abts reagent solution v 2 4 ml 1 ml of abts solution 1 mm 0 35 ml of chlorine solution 1 mm as well as 1 05 ml of water were sequentially aspirated by the syringe the entire batch of solution was immediately dispensed to a custom made mixing chamber v 3 ml poly methyl methacrylate and aspirated back into the syringe this transfer of solution was repeated five times for complete mixing to facilitate vertical mixing the solution was dispensed into the mixing chamber from the top and aspirated from the bottom the mixing resulted in a ph of 2 and the rapid oxidation abts to abts by the limiting reagent chlorine pinkernell et al 2000 1 hocl 2 abts h c l 2 abt s h 2 o subsequently the resulting abts reagent solution was dispensed to the mixing chamber for temporary storage for the duration of the measurement cycle 2 2 2 collection and filtration of in and effluent of the ozonation reactor to minimize microbial growth in the fluidic system and potential damages by particles to moving parts of the syringe pump sample solutions were filtered for this purpose sample solutions from the in and effluent of the ozonation reactors were each by passed through two separate containers v 18 l two solenoid pumps model dlx vft mbb etatron italy continuously aspirated water from both by pass containers through ceramic filter disks 0 45 µm pore size al2o3 15 cm diameter pmc model etl filtration technology germany and dispensed into two separate custom made overflow sample collection cylinders v 10 ml poly methyl methacrylate the by pass containers and the sample collection cylinder had a hydraulic residence time of 3 5 and 7 min respectively based on the measured flow rate and volumes of the vessels the filter discs membrane pumps and sample collection cylinders were connected with polyethylene tubing the syringe pump was connected to the sample collection cylinders through a three way two position valve which allowed to automatically select either in or effluent of the ozonation reactors 2 2 3 detection of uv absorbance and mixing with reagent solution the analysis of a sample or dom free blank solution involved the following steps first the sample solution was aspirated into the syringe and partly dispensed to the photometer for the quantification of the uv absorbance at 255 nm a 255nm the fixed wavelength of the led light source of the photometer is a negligible shift in wavelength compared to standard methods determining the uv absorbance at 254 nm next the phosphate buffer solution and an aliquot of the abts reagent solution was aspirated the entire reaction mixture was transferred to a second mixing chamber and back for mixing after a reaction time of 15 min the reaction mixture was finally dispensed to the photometer for the photometric quantification of residual abts concentration at a wavelength of 730 nm 2 2 4 detection and quantification the residual a255nm and edc for the measurement of a 255nm of the dom samples and the photometric quantification of the residual abts concentration in the reaction mixtures at a 730nm solutions were passed to a flow through photometer mikron 31 rs 485 prototype runge germany equipped with two leds λ 255 and 730 nm as light sources and a stainless steel flow cell with a 10 mm optical path length the relative residual a 255nm a 255 nm a 255 nm 0 1 was calculated as a 255nm of the ozonation effluent relative to the ozonation influent sample the edc of a dom sample was previously defined as the decrease in abts concentration due to the reduction by dom normalized by the doc concentration walpen et al 2020 2 edc a 730 n m b l a n k a 730 n m s a m p l e ε abt s l 1 c d o c where a 730 n m b l a n k and a 730

influent were not expected to contribute significantly to the measured edc because total iron concentrations were small 20 µg l 1 in ozonation influent grab samples figure s2 si and iron iii species were likely predominating the pool of total iron in particular after ozonation løgager et al 1992 2 2 5 maintenance of the edc analyzer the edc analyzer required regular automated as well as manual cleaning intervals during routine operation the syringe pump executed a daily automated chemical cleaning and disinfection of the sample line tubing sample mixing chamber syringe and photometer flow cell with diluted chlorine solution c o c l 0 2 µm 0 01 mg l 1 with this procedure bacterial growth could be avoided and no manual cleaning of the led photometer was required biofilm or residues on the surfaces of the ceramic filter disks were manually removed 2 3 times per week using a brush and warm water 2 3 full scale ozonation at the wastewater treatment plant of zurich the edc analyzer was installed at the ozonation reactors of the municipal wastewater treatment plant werdhölzli in zurich switzerland the treatment plant has a capacity of 670 000 person equivalents secondary treatment is performed in a nitrifying activated sludge system with alternating intermittent aeration followed by clarification subsequently the water is treated with o3 for micropollutant abatement in four parallel ozonation reactors each of which had a volume of 1 535 m3 each reactor is divided into eight compartments by vertical flow control baffles ozone containing gas is introduced in countercurrent mode through an array of diffusers at the bottom of the first and third compartment finally the ozonation effluent is passed through a sand filter for biological post treatment before discharge to a river the ozonation process was monitored by measuring i the absorption at 254 nm a 254nm of the unfiltered in and effluent using a flow through spectrophotometer equipped with a flash lamp cas51d endress hauser switzerland and ii the nitrite concentration in the influent using a nitrite analyzer ca80no endress hauser switzerland for routine operation the o3 dose was controlled based on a combination of feed forward flow rate doc concentration estimated based on a 254nm and nitrite concentration and feed back relative residual a 254nm control parameters the targeted value for the relative residual a 254nm was 68 this value had been obtained previously to reach a mean relative residual concentration of indicator compounds of 20 over the entire treatment plant as required by the swiss authorities federal office for the environment 2015 2 3 1 repeated sample analysis for performance assessment to initially assess the performance of the edc analyzer under real conditions a batch of 500 ml was collected from both the influent and the effluent of the ozonation reactors both batches were filtered 0 45 µm pore size and then analyzed repeatedly on site quantification limits loq were calculated based on the signal responses s and corresponding standard deviations σ of the analysis of dom free blanks loq s blank 10 σ blank 2 3 2 on line monitoring of residual a255nm and edc to observe the changes in a 255nm and edc during ozonation on line the edc analyzer monitored the common influent and effluent of two out of the four parallel ozonation reactors the edc analyzer had a constant sampling interval of 34 min and the hydraulic residence time of the ozonation reactor varied around a median of 29 6 min 25th and 75th percentiles were 25 3 and 38 4 min respectively depending on the total flow rate and the number of operating ozonation reactors this difference between the sampling interval and the hydraulic residence time was considered negligible in comparison to the slow changes of the water quality at the in and effluent 2 3 3 variation of o3 doses in full scale ozonation to vary the o3 dose during full scale ozonation the process control system was operated in an experimental mode based only on feed forward control parameters flow rate q doc concentration estimated based on on line a 254nm and on line nitrite concentration with different targeted specific o3 doses ranging from 0 06 to 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc 1 the targeted o3 doses were manually adjusted on six days in january and february of 2021 during two extended dry weather periods to minimize variations in the composition of the ozonation influent for selected time points pairs of in and effluent grab samples were collected from the sample collection cylinders immediately after aspiration of the sample by the syringe pump of the edc analyzer at this point the grab samples had already passed the ceramic filter disk and were stored at 4 c in the dark without any further sample treatment until further laboratory analyses 2 4 analyses of water quality parameters of ozonation influent samples concentrations of doc loq 0 5 mgdoc l 1 alkalinity loq 0 2 mm ammonium loq 5 µgn l 1 and nitrite loq 1 µgn l 1 were quantified in all grab samples as described in section 1 3 in the si 2 5 analysis of micropollutants by lc ms concentrations of 22 selected micropollutants including pharmaceuticals x ray contrast agents pesticides a food additive and a corrosion inhibitor were quantified in the sample pairs collected from the in and effluent of the ozonation reactor a complete list of micropollutants and corresponding apparent second order rate constants for the reactions with o3 and hydroxyl radical at ph 7 is provided in table s1 si the micropollutants were selected due to their typically high abundance in wwtp effluents their apparent second order rate constants for the reactions with o3 at ph 7 covered a wide range from 5 0 10 2 to 6 8 105 m 1s 1 table s1 si the listed apparent second order rate constants should be considered as approximations for the ph that prevailed during the monitoring campaigns i e ph 7 6 0 2 a subset of twelve micropollutants are also listed as indicator compounds for advanced wastewater treatment by the swiss regulators federal office for the environment 2015 micropollutant concentrations loq 100 ng l 1 were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms as detailed in section 1 5 of the si 2 6 analyses of bromide bromate iodide and iodate by ic ms the o3 reactive halogen species bromide and iodide as well as their oxidation products bromate and iodate were analyzed in the filtered grab samples by ion chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ic ms details on the analysis are described in section 1 6 of the si and table s2 si loqs were 5 1 5 and 2 5 µg l 1 for bromide bromate iodide and iodate respectively with a relative standard deviation of 10 2 7 statistical modeling exponential regression models were fitted to the relative residual a 255nm and edc as a function of specific o3 doses by a non linear least squares method logistic regression models were fitted to the relative residual micropollutant concentrations with a quasibinomial probability distribution a logit link function and the relative residual a 255nm and edc as estimators 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance assessment of the edc analyzer the repeatability of a 255nm and edc measurements was assessed by repeatedly analyzing a batch of influent and effluent of the ozonation reactors collected during routine full scale ozonation specific o3 dose 0 64 mgo3 mgc 1 measurements of a 255nm fig 2 a were highly repeatable with mean values of 0 088 0 001 cm 1 and 0 043 0 001 cm 1 mean value standard deviation n 28 for the in and effluent respectively and were significantly above the loq of 0 006 cm 1 non carbon normalized edc measurements edc c doc were also repeatable fig 2b with mean values for edc c doc of 16 2 0 4 μ m e and 3 6 0 3 μ m e n 28 respectively and were also above the loq of 2 8 μ m e as expected both parameters a 255nm and edc decreased significantly during ozonation to relative residual values of 49 1 and 22 2 fig 2c the slightly larger variations of edc values compared to a 255nm were due to errors introduced by the additional analytical steps required for the edc measurement i e i addition of reagent solutions and ii mixing of the resulting reaction mixture additional advancements and optimizations of the analyzer specifically of the liquid handling may further improve the precision of edc measurements nevertheless the repeatability and loqs demonstrated that the precision of the edc analyzer was suitable to monitor changes in a 255nm and edc during routine ozonation 3 2 on line monitoring of a255nm and edc during full scale ozonation an exemplary nine days series of on line measurement results obtained in february 2021 with the edc analyzer and process data from the ozonation system is shown in fig 3 an equivalent time series obtained in january 2021 is shown in figure s3 si both time series were recorded to a large part under typical dry weather conditions with high levels of nitrogen removal in the preceding nitrifying activated sludge treatment as evidenced by the low residual ammonium concentrations of 0 5 0 2 mgn l 1 in the influent of the ozonation reactor selected water quality parameters i e doc nitrite and ammonium concentrations and alkalinity ph and conductivity of the influent grab samples are shown in figure s4 si the consumption of o3 by nitrite will be addressed separately below 3 2 1 variability of a255nm and edc cdoc in ozonation influent in this time series fig 3 a 255nm and edc c doc of the ozonation influent exhibited minor diurnal fluctuations with stable daily average values values of a 255nm and edc c doc measured in the influent of the ozonation reactor ranged from 0 086 to 0 104 cm 1 and 17 9 22 0 μ m e respectively maximum daily values of a 255nm and edc c doc were reached around midnight between 22 00 and 02 00 h the largest relative daily increase was recorded on the second day during which a 255nm and edc c doc increased by 16 and 23 respectively nitrite concentrations measured on line ranged from 0 06 to 0 33 mgn l 1 in agreement with values for similar nitrifying wastewater treatment plants schindler wildhaber et al 2015 and also followed a diurnal pattern with maximum daily values typically reached between 17 00 and 19 00 these diurnal patterns were attributed to changes in the carbon and nitrogen loads entering the activated sludge treatment basins and the effectiveness of the activated sludge treatment overall the monitored parameters indicated stable process conditions throughout this time series the frequency of approximately one measurement per hour was considered sufficient to capture the diurnal patterns of a 255nm and edc c doc in the ozonation influent however it is conceivable that these parameters may vary more rapidly under certain circumstances for such cases a faster measuring frequency than currently available with the edc analyzer would be beneficial and could be achieved by shortening the reaction time or by parallel edc measurements of the ozonation in and effluent and the blank sample using multiple syringe pumps 3 2 2 stable decrease of a255nm and edc during routine ozonation during routine ozonation fig 3 gray horizontal bars the treatment plant s control system maintained a constant decrease in the uv absorption of the unfiltered in and effluent of the ozonation reactors this resulted in o3 doses of 2 9 4 9 mgo3 l 1 during the monitored time series fig 3 orange line during routine ozonation the primary driver for the variations in the o3 dose was the changes in nitrite concentrations in the ozonation influent because nitrite readily reacts with o3 via an o transfer reaction forming nitrate hoigné et al 1985 naumov et al 2010 the nitrite measured in the influent accounted for 7 43 of the o3 dose ozonation resulted in a significant and stable decreases in both a 255nm and edc independent of the water quality fluctuations in the influent the mean residual value of a 255nm decreased to 48 3 while the mean residual value of edc decreased to 19 3 these small relative standard deviations illustrate the reliability of the measurements obtained with the edc analyzer 3 3 variations of o3 doses during full scale ozonation to investigate the effects of changes in the specific o3 dose on a 255nm and edc during full scale ozonation the feed back control system was temporarily disabled and targeted specific o3 doses were varied using only the feed forward control fig 3 orange horizontal bars this resulted in o3 doses of 0 7 4 8 mgo3 l 1 similar experiments were conducted on two more days time series data shown in figure s3 si generally these o3 doses were lower compared to the doses which would have been applied during routine operation except on the second day of the time series when slightly higher o3 doses were reached 3 3 1 responses of residual a255nm and edc to lower o3 doses the lower o3 doses resulted in higher residual a 255nm and edc in comparison to routine ozonation with maximum values of 88 and 61 respectively fig 3 the slightly higher o3 doses on the second day only resulted in an additional decrease in the residual a 255nm but did not appear to affect residual edc values the time points at which grab samples were collected from the in and effluent of the ozonation reactors are indicated on the time axis in fig 3 circles the corresponding residual a 255nm and edc values circles in fig 4 b spanned the entire range observed for both parameters during the monitoring campaign 3 3 2 consumption of o3 by nitrite and iodide laboratory analyses of anions in and effluent grab samples indicated that nitrite and iodide competed with dom for o3 nitrite concentrations ranged from 0 09 to 0 55 mg n l 1 in the influent samples figure s5a si residual nitrite concentrations relative to the corresponding influent concentrations decreased proportionally to the applied o3 doses figure s5b si in agreement with the fast oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by o3 with k n o 2 5 83 105 m 1s 1 liu et al 2001 iodide was present at unexpectedly high concentrations in a subset of influent grab samples while iodide concentrations in the influent samples ranged between 2 6 and 11 0 µg l 1 on january 11 13 they ranged between 31 3 and 547 µg l 1 on february 22 26 figure s5c si exceeding the expected range for municipal wastewater gong et al 2018 by approximately one order of magnitude the source of those large iodine loads remained unclear as iodide is rapidly oxidized by o3 forming iodate bichsel and von gunten 1999 iodate formation also increased proportionally with increasing applied o3 doses figure s5d si for all time points the mean mass balance of iodide and iodate concentration from in to effluent i e c i e f f l c i o 3 e f f l c i i n f l c i o 3 i n f l was 102 20 figure s5e si indicating that o3 oxidized a fraction of iodide completely to iodate because of this significant consumption of o3 by nitrite and iodide both oxidation reactions were accounted for in the calculation of specific o3 doses see below 3 3 3 decreases in a255nm and edc during ozonation the variations in o3 doses allowed to monitor changes in a 255nm and edc as a function of the specific o3 dose in the grab samples specific o3 doses which were calculated by carbon normalizing o3 doses and correcting for nitrite consumption o3 no2 1 as well as iodate formation o3 io3 3 ranged from 0 13 to 0 91 mgo3 mgdoc 1 along this range the relative residual a 255nm and edc decreased exponentially with increasing specific o3 dose fig 4 a residual values of a 255nm decreased relatively uniformly to 42 at the highest specific o3 dose in comparison relative residual edc values showed a steeper decrease to 29 for specific o3 doses up to 0 34 mgo3 mgc 1 model estimate and plateaued towards higher ozone doses between 0 5 mgo3 mgdoc 1 and the highest specific o3 dose of 0 91 mgo3 mgdoc 1 the relative residual edc only further decreased from 22 to 17 therefore the current analytical method may not be sufficiently sensitive for o3 doses 0 5 mgo3 mgc 1 using edc as control parameter however the high sensitivity of edc towards small specific o3 doses implies that the edc is suited for treatment processes applying low specific o3 doses 0 5 mgo3 mgc 1 such as a combination of ozonation with activated carbon adsorption müller et al 2019 reungoat et al 2012 the fact that the data for both parameters each consistently followed the same exponential trend despite being obtained on six days distributed over two months i e january 5 to march 3 2021 suggests a high repeatability even over long periods of time moreover two time points were collected outside typical dry weather conditions figure s3 si and do not appear to deviate from the observed trends either indicated by yellow symbols in fig 4a indicating robust responses of both parameters also during different operational conditions the decreases in a 255nm and edc after full scale ozonation were both compared to results obtained previously in laboratory ozonation experiments for different secondary treated wastewater effluents chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 walpen et al 2020 as expected the relative residual values of a 255nm measured in this study were in good agreement with previous results figure s6 si in contrast relative residual edc values only agreed for specific o3 doses up to 0 25 mgo3 mgc 1 and then approached different end points for higher doses figure s6 si more specifically relative residual edc values found in this study and by önnby et al 2018 reached lower end points compared to values reported in chon et al 2015 and walpen et al 2020 the different trends likely originated from differences in i the chemical composition of secondary treated wastewater effluents or ii the analytical conditions used for the operationally defined quantification of edc of dom the first hypothesis is supported by the fact that relative residual edc values in this study are lower than reported in walpen et al 2020 despite the application of the same analytical conditions in addition the same source of sample was used in these two studies which further implies that storage time and conditions affect the edc of dom overall these results confirm that changes in a 254nm in laboratory ozonation experiments are representative for full scale systems yet a similar comparison for edc remains inconclusive and requires a systematic assessment 3 3 4 correlation between residual a255nm and edc during ozonation to directly compare the responses of both parameters the relative residual a 255nm was replotted as a function of the relative residual edc fig 4b the trajectory of these data pairs collected over a time span of two months i e january 5 to march 3 2021 were correlated non linearly for relative residual edc values 29 and relative residual a 255nm 71 i e for specific ozone doses 0 34 mgo3 mgc 1 the relative decrease in edc was more pronounced compared to the decrease in a 255nm this trend was inversed towards lower relative residual values of a 255nm and edc respectively the absence of significant deviations from this correlation suggests a consistent response of a 255nm and edc to ozonation for at least several weeks indicating a high degree of redundancy among the two parameters for a potential on line estimation of micropollutant abatement yet it is conceivable that changes in the chemical composition affecting either the uv absorbance or redox properties of the ozonation influent for example due to a contamination could result in irregular responses causing deviations from the observed trend in such a case the availability of two control parameters may facilitate the identification of such atypical process conditions 3 3 5 micropollutant abatement during ozonation concentrations of the 22 micropollutants determined in the in and effluent of the ozonation reactors are summarized in figure s7 si median influent concentrations of 19 micropollutants exceeded the quantification limit of 100 ng l 1 the highest median influent concentrations were measured for benzotriazole 3 7 µg l 1 iomeprol 2 7 µg l 1 diatrizoate 2 4 µg l 1 diclofenac 1 7 µg l 1 and gabapentin 1 5 µg l 1 as expected all sample pairs generally contained lower concentrations of micropollutants in the effluent than in the influent sample residual micropollutant concentrations are shown exemplary for diclofenac k app o3 6 8 105 m 1s 1 hydrochlorothiazide k app o3 8 5 104 m 1s 1 and benzotriazole k app o3 35 m 1s 1 as a function of specific o3 dose fig 4c shown for all 22 micropollutants in figure s8 si residual concentrations decreased proportionally to increasing specific o3 doses for all micropollutants except for the pesticide diuron and the metabolite n 4 acetylsulfamethoxazole for these two compounds no meaningful correlation was obtained because their concentrations were below the quantification limit in most samples overall the extent of abatement was correlated to the second order rate constants of the reactions of these compounds with o3 figure s9 si this observation is consistent with the presence of both ozone and hydroxyl radical as oxidants during the ozonation process bourgin et al 2017 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2013 while the observed micropollutants had a similar reactivity towards hydroxyl radicals their second order rate constants for the reaction with ozone ranged over eight orders of magnitude table s1 si which resulted in a more pronounced abatement of micropollutants with high ozone reactivity the extent of micropollutant abatement was comparable to previous reports from similar full scale ozonation systems bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 the relative residual micropollutant concentrations observed in this study were generally slightly higher at the same specific o3 dose figure s8 si implying marginally lower oxidant exposures in the ozonation reactors at the wastewater treatment plant in zurich for the same specific o3 dose 3 3 6 estimation of micropollutant abatement based on a255nm and edc the relative residual concentrations of diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide and benzotriazole were re plotted as a function of the relative residual a 255nm fig 5 a and edc fig 5b the relative residual concentrations of these three micropollutants decreased non linearly with the decrease of both parameters similar trends were also observed for the remaining set of micropollutants figures s10 and s11 si except for diuron and n 4 acetylsulfamethoxazole due to the limited data as described above for each of the 22 analyzed micropollutants a logistic regression model was fitted to the relative residual concentrations with either the relative residual a 255nm or edc as explanatory variable the fitted models are shown as solid lines in figs 5a and 5b for diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide and benzotriazole as well as in figures s10 and s11 si for the remaining set of micropollutants to compare the performance of both explanatory variables the quality of the regression models was summarized in a separate plot for both explanatory variables in fig 5c all observed relative residual concentrations for all micropollutants were plotted as a function of the corresponding value estimated using relative residual a 255nm as explanatory variable the same plot is shown in fig 5d for the relative residual edc as explanatory variable the closer the cloud of data points are to the 1 1 line the smaller are the residuals of the fitted models both explanatory variables the relative residual a 255nm and edc allowed to appropriately estimate the relative residual micropollutant concentration the estimated values show a slightly larger spread to the observed values if the relative residual edc is used fitted linear regression model has r 2 0 92 fig 5c compared to the relative residual a 255nm r 2 0 97 fig 5d this larger spread originated from the larger relative standard deviations of the edc compared to a 255nm however as described above instrumental improvements may further increase the precision of the method taken together the logistic regression models allowed to independently estimate micropollutant abatement based on either of the two monitored parameters measured on line 3 3 7 derivation of target values for the residual a255nm and edc based on the fitted logistic regression models target values of the relative residual a 255nm and edc could be derived for any arbitrary micropollutant abatement target to demonstrate this the micropollutant abatement was quantified according to the swiss regulatory framework by averaging the abatement of twelve indicator compounds see table s1 si therefore the models fitted to the relative residual concentration of the twelve indicator compounds were selected shown as light lines in figs 5e and f and averaged along the explanatory variables shown as bold line in figs 5e and f based on these model averages a micropollutant abatement target of e g 75 i e an average relative residual micropollutant concentration of 25 would correspond to a relative residual a 255nm of 57 and a relative residual edc of 19 respectively dotted lines in figs 5e and f in a practical application these target values for the relative residual a 255nm and edc could directly be applied in a feed back control system for the ozonation of secondary treated wastewater however as noted above the limited sensitivity of the edc as control parameter needs to be taken into account for o3 doses 0 5 mgo3 mgc 1 3 3 8 assessment of bromate formation based on a255nm and edc concentrations of bromide in the influent samples ranged from 124 to 807 µg l 1 figure s12a si indicating significant temporal variations in the load of bromide in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant ozonation resulted in the formation of the potentially carcinogenic oxidation by product bromate which was present at concentrations from 1 0 to 7 8 µg l 1 in the effluent samples figure s12b si the molar conversion of bromide to bromate was proportional to the specific o3 dose figure s12c si and increased exponentially to 2 1 at the highest specific o3 dose of 0 91 mgo3 mgc 1 both of which is consistent with previous studies bourgin et al 2018 soltermann et al 2016 molar conversion of bromide to bromate increased significantly to values 1 when the relative residual values of a 255nm and edc fell below a threshold of 49 and 18 respectively figures s12d and e si these threshold values may therefore help to identify ozonation conditions with relative bromide conversion of more than 1 however the relative residual edc is close to its observed end point value of 17 see above in addition these parameters are not suited to assess absolute bromate concentrations in ozonation effluents since its formation during ozonation is proportional to the bromide influent concentration and only absolute bromate concentrations are relevant for regulators 4 conclusions in this study an automated on line edc analyzer was used to continuously monitor the relative changes in a 255nm and edc during full scale ozonation of a secondary treated municipal wastewater variations of the specific o3 doses allowed to assess the responses in a 255nm and edc and their correlation with micropollutant abatement and bromate formation based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn during a multi week monitoring campaign with varying o3 doses responses in residual a 255nm and edc were correlated but non linearly this finding suggests that expanding existing absorbance based ozonation control framework by integrating edc as feedback control parameters could offer i robustness through the application of a second independent surrogate parameter to assess micropollutant abatement and ii additional options to detect problems in the process control relative residual values of a 255nm and edc both decreased exponentially with increasing specific o3 doses in comparison to relative residual a 255nm the relative residual edc responded more sensitive to increases in specific o3 doses 0 34 mgo3 mgc 1 whereas an opposite trend was observed for higher specific ozone doses this finding implies that monitoring residual edc in addition to a 255nm may be particularly interesting for low o3 dose applications such as combinations of ozonation and activated carbon adsorption for enhanced wastewater treatment for 20 out of 22 selected micropollutants relative residual concentrations decreased proportionally to increasing specific o3 doses and thus also to relative residual a 255nm and edc the fitted logistic regression models allowed to derive target values of relative residual a 255nm and edc for specific micropollutant abatement targets bromate concentrations in the effluent of the ozonation reactors cannot be predicted by decreases in uv absorption or edc during ozonation because they also depend on the bromide concentrations in the influent however both parameters are suitable to identify ozonation conditions with elevated conversions of bromide to bromate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16397,ozonation of secondary treated wastewater for the abatement of micropollutants requires a reliable control of ozone doses changes in the uv absorbance of dissolved organic matter dom during ozonation allow to estimate micropollutant abatement on line and were therefore identified as feed back control parameter in this study the suitability of the electron donating capacity edc as an additional surrogate parameter which is independent of optical dom properties was evaluated during full scale ozonation for this purpose a recently developed edc analyzer was enhanced to enable continuous on line edc and uv absorbance measurements during a multi week monitoring campaign at the wastewater treatment plant of zurich switzerland specific ozone doses were varied from 0 13 to 0 91 mgo3 mgdoc 1 and selected micropollutants with different ozone reactivities were analyzed by lc ms in conjunction with bromate analysis by ic ms in agreement with previous laboratory studies the relative residual uv absorbance and edc both decreased exponentially as a function of the specific ozone dose and in comparison to the residual uv absorbance residual edc values showed a more pronounced decrease at low specific ozone doses 0 34 mgo3 mgdoc 1 logistic regression models allowed to estimate relative residual micropollutant concentrations in the ozonation effluent using either the residual uv absorbance or edc as explanatory variable averaging those models along the explanatory variables allowed to estimate target values in relative residual uv absorbances and edc for specific micropollutant abatement targets in addition both parameters allowed to identify conditions with elevated conversions of bromide to bromate taken together these findings show that the integration of relative residual edc values as a second control parameter can improve existing absorbance based ozonation control systems to meet micropollutant abatement targets particularly for treatment systems where low ozone doses are applied graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozonation micropollutant abatement electron donating capacity uv absorbance on line monitoring 1 introduction ozonation is increasingly applied for enhanced wastewater treatment to oxidize a wide range of organic micropollutants thereby mitigating their discharge to the aquatic environment eggen et al 2014 völker et al 2019 von gunten 2018 for this purpose ozone o3 is dosed to secondary treated wastewater where it selectively oxidizes micropollutants containing electron rich moieties such as olefins activated aromatics including phenols and neutral amines bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2010 at the same time o3 also reacts with dissolved organic matter dom and dissolved inorganic compounds forming hydroxyl radical oh a less selective oxidant which also contributes to the oxidation of micropollutants and dom buffle et al 2006b buffle and von gunten 2006 nöthe et al 2009 remucal et al 2020 the extent of micropollutant abatement is primarily determined by the exposure of the oxidants o3 and oh i e o3 and oh concentrations integrated over time and the rate constants of the reactions of these micropollutants with o3 and oh lee et al 2013 oxidant exposures not only depend on the o3 doses but also on complex reaction systems involving dom and inorganic compounds such as nitrite lee et al 2013 schindler wildhaber et al 2015 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 at the same time excessive oxidant exposures can cause the formation of problematic oxidation by products such as bromate a possible carcinogen and regulated drinking water contaminant soltermann et al 2016 von gunten and hoigné 1994 in addition the production of o3 consumes significant amounts of electrical energy katsoyiannis et al 2011 overall an accurate and reliable control of applied o3 doses is critical to reach optimal oxidant exposures and an energy efficient abatement of micropollutants with a minimal formation of oxidation by products because on line predictions or measurements of oxidant exposures and micropollutant concentrations are unfeasible in secondary treated wastewater changes in optical dom properties have been suggested as surrogate parameters for micropollutant abatement during full scale ozonation bahr et al 2007 deniere et al 2021 dickenson et al 2009 gerrity et al 2012 stapf et al 2016 wittmer et al 2015 ozonation induced decreases of the uv absorbance and fluorescence of dom reflect the oxidation of chromophoric dom moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wenk et al 2013 wert et al 2009a westerhoff et al 1999 numerous studies have reported correlations between relative decreases in uv absorbances and the abatement of individual micropollutants bahr et al 2007 buffle et al 2006a dickenson et al 2009 gerrity et al 2012 nanaboina and korshin 2010 song et al 2021 wert et al 2009b these relative decreases in uv absorbance proved to be suitable surrogate parameters for the on line estimation of micropollutant abatement and control of o3 doses in secondary treated municipal wastewater stapf et al 2016 wittmer et al 2015 besides changes in uv absorbance effects of ozonation on fluorescence signals have also been explored and used to expand existing surrogate models for the estimation of micropollutant abatement chys et al 2017 gerrity et al 2012 while these approaches proved useful the availability of a second surrogate parameter which is independent of optical dom properties would be beneficial to increase the accuracy reliability and resilience of existing on line process monitoring and control systems for the ozonation of secondary treated wastewater in laboratory experiments the electron donating capacity edc of dom was shown to potentially serve as such an additional independent surrogate parameter chon et al 2015 the edc is operationally defined as the number of electrons transferred from dom to an oxidant at a constant ph and reduction potential e h aeschbacher et al 2010 with the radical cation of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulphonate abts as oxidant edc values were demonstrated to be a measure for the content of phenolic moieties of dom aeschbacher et al 2012 abts can be prepared through a chemical or electrochemical one electron oxidation of abts and can be detected electrochemically or photometrically e g at an absorption maximum at 730 nm aeschbacher et al 2012 chon et al 2015 scott et al 1993 walpen et al 2016 because ozonation of dom leads to the oxidation of phenolic moieties ramseier and von gunten 2009 remucal et al 2020 tentscher et al 2018 edc values decrease in parallel to the abatement of uv absorbances chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 wenk et al 2013 during the ozonation of secondary treated wastewater samples decreases in edc also correlated with the abatement of spiked micropollutants chon et al 2015 however these observations were only a proof of concept and limited to a small number of micropollutants and because of the lack of automated devices for the quantification of edc limited to a few laboratory ozonation experiments to advance the analytical techniques and to enable a continuous on line monitoring of changes in edc and uv absorbance we have recently developed an edc analyzer and validated the analyzer in the laboratory walpen et al 2020 yet the edc analyzer required further development for an entirely automated on site operation for this several practical issues have to be addressed including i the continuous supply with filtered sample solution ii a more rugged fluidic system suitable for an industrial environment and iii a robust and resilient device control because of the lack of an appropriate analytical device a systematic study correlating continuously measured decreases in edc and the abatement organic micropollutants during full scale ozonation to evaluate edc as a surrogate parameter under realistic conditions is still missing to address this gap this study assesses the suitability of on line edc measurements in comparison to uv absorbance measurements as surrogate parameter for micropollutant abatement during the full scale ozonation at a municipal wastewater treatment plant for this purpose the previously developed edc analyzer was further improved and completely automated to enable on line measurements of changes in edc and uv absorbance compared to the previously presented analyzer walpen et al 2020 the new device additionally included sample filtration modules a more robust fluidic system mounted to a mobile platform wagon and was completely automated using an industry grade programmable logical controller for continuous sampling and measurement a repeated analysis of a batch of influent and effluent of the ozonation reactors was performed to assess the analytical performance of the analyzer and it was applied to continuously monitor the residual uv absorbance and edc during full scale ozonation during this monitoring campaign o3 doses were varied and the resulting abatement of 22 selected micropollutants and formation of bromate were quantified in grab samples to assess on line edc measurements as surrogate parameter for micropollutant abatement regression models using either the residual uv absorbance or edc to estimate residual micropollutant concentrations were compared 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions for the edc analyzer the edc analyzer was supplied with two reactant solutions containing abts and chlorine respectively a phosphate buffer solution as well as deionized water and a 2 propanol water mixture 50 v v aliquots of the abts and chlorine solutions were automatically mixed during every measurement cycle to yield the oxidative reagent abts details see below the abts solution contained 1 mm abts 98 sigma aldrich and was acidified with sulfuric acid 95 w w sigma aldrich final concentration 18 mm to prevent microbial growth and to maintain a ph of 2 during the oxidation of abts to abts by chlorine the chlorine solution was prepared by diluting a concentrated hypochlorite stock solution 6 14 active chlorine sigma aldrich in water free available chlorine concentrations were quantified in dilute basic solution aliquots using the molar absorptivity of hypochlorite ε 292nm 350 m 1 cm 1 ph 11 soulard et al 1981 to stabilize the chlorine solution the ph was raised to 11 using a naoh solution 1 mm the phosphate buffer solution 500 mm phosphate disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate 99 5 sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate 99 0 102 0 merck was used to buffer the final reaction mixture of dom containing samples and the abts reagent solution at ph 7 the abts chlorine and buffer solutions were all prepared using ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 mω cm arium ultrapure water system sartorius germany otherwise deionized water was used quality not monitored all solutions were stored at room temperature in 1 l glass bottles except deionized water which was stored in 5 l polyethylene canisters the stability of the abts and chlorine solution was ensured by monitoring the resulting abts concentration in the final reaction mixtures of dom free blanks and abts reagent solution 1 decrease in a 730nm over 24 days see figure s1 supporting information si during routine operation the edc analyzer used approximately 24 ml abts solution and 10 ml chlorine solution per day both solutions were replaced at least every two months 2 2 design and operation of the edc analyzer the edc analyzer automatically determined the relative residual uv absorbance and the edc in sequential measurement cycles at a frequency of approximately one measurement per hour at the beginning of a measurement cycle a batch of abts reagent solution was prepared which was subsequently used to analyze a an ozonation influent b a dom free blank and c an ozonation effluent sample this measurement cycle was based on large parts on a previously validated procedure walpen et al 2020 transport of all liquids fig 1 was handled by a syringe pump cadent 3 imi precision equipped with a zero dead volume syringe v 2 5 ml connected to a 12 way rotary selector valve the syringe pump was connected to four modules which enabled i preparation of an abts reagent solution ii sample collection and filtration iii detection of uv absorbance and mixing and iv detection of edc to enable the automatic operation of the edc analyzer all active units and sensors were connected to a programmable logic controller pfc200 wago germany the controller was programmed to automatically start the measurement cycles including regular cleaning intervals see below once the device is supplied with electrical power and was therefore able to operate autonomously analysis results were stored locally on a memory card and downloaded via a lte connection to the controller 2 2 1 preparation of abts reagent solution to obtain a batch of abts reagent solution v 2 4 ml 1 ml of abts solution 1 mm 0 35 ml of chlorine solution 1 mm as well as 1 05 ml of water were sequentially aspirated by the syringe the entire batch of solution was immediately dispensed to a custom made mixing chamber v 3 ml poly methyl methacrylate and aspirated back into the syringe this transfer of solution was repeated five times for complete mixing to facilitate vertical mixing the solution was dispensed into the mixing chamber from the top and aspirated from the bottom the mixing

methacrylate the by pass containers and the sample collection cylinder had a hydraulic residence time of 3 5 and 7 min respectively based on the measured flow rate and volumes of the vessels the filter discs membrane pumps and sample collection cylinders were connected with polyethylene tubing the syringe pump was connected to the sample collection cylinders through a three way two position valve which allowed to automatically select either in or effluent of the ozonation reactors 2 2 3 detection of uv absorbance and mixing with reagent solution the analysis of a sample or dom free blank solution involved the following steps first the sample solution was aspirated into the syringe and partly dispensed to the photometer for the quantification of the uv absorbance at 255 nm a 255nm the fixed wavelength of the led light source of the photometer is a negligible shift in wavelength compared to standard methods determining the uv absorbance at 254 nm next the phosphate buffer solution and an aliquot of the abts reagent solution was aspirated the entire reaction mixture was transferred to a second mixing chamber and back for mixing after a reaction time of 15 min the reaction mixture was finally dispensed to the photometer for the photometric quantification of residual abts concentration at a wavelength of 730 nm 2 2 4 detection and quantification the residual a255nm and edc for the measurement of a 255nm of the dom samples and the photometric quantification of the residual abts concentration in the reaction mixtures at a 730nm solutions were passed to a flow through photometer mikron 31 rs 485 prototype runge germany equipped with two leds λ 255 and 730 nm as light sources and a stainless steel flow cell with a 10 mm optical path length the relative residual a 255nm a 255 nm a 255 nm 0 1 was calculated as a 255nm of the ozonation effluent relative to the ozonation influent sample the edc of a dom sample was previously defined as the decrease in abts

influent were not expected to contribute significantly to the measured edc because total iron concentrations were small 20 µg l 1 in ozonation influent grab samples figure s2 si and iron iii species were likely predominating the pool of total iron in particular after ozonation løgager et al 1992 2 2 5 maintenance of the edc analyzer the edc analyzer required regular automated as well as manual cleaning intervals during routine operation the syringe pump executed a daily automated chemical cleaning and disinfection of the sample line tubing sample mixing chamber syringe and photometer flow cell with diluted chlorine solution c o c l 0 2 µm 0 01 mg l 1 with this procedure bacterial growth could be avoided and no manual cleaning of the led photometer was required biofilm or residues on the surfaces of the ceramic filter disks were manually removed 2 3 times per week using a brush and warm water 2 3 full scale ozonation at the wastewater treatment plant of zurich the edc analyzer was installed at the ozonation reactors of the municipal wastewater treatment plant werdhölzli in zurich switzerland the treatment plant has a capacity of 670 000 person equivalents secondary treatment is performed in a nitrifying activated sludge system with alternating intermittent aeration followed by clarification subsequently the water is treated with o3 for micropollutant abatement in four parallel ozonation reactors each of which had a volume of 1 535 m3 each reactor is divided into eight compartments by vertical flow control baffles ozone containing gas is introduced in countercurrent mode through an array of diffusers at the bottom of the first and third compartment finally the ozonation effluent is passed through a sand filter for biological post treatment before discharge to a river the ozonation process was monitored by measuring i the absorption at 254 nm a 254nm of the unfiltered in and effluent using a flow through spectrophotometer equipped with a flash lamp cas51d endress hauser switzerland and ii the nitrite concentration in the influent using a nitrite analyzer ca80no endress hauser switzerland for routine operation the o3 dose was controlled based on a combination of feed forward flow rate doc concentration estimated based on a 254nm and nitrite concentration and feed back relative residual a 254nm control parameters the targeted value for the relative residual a 254nm was 68 this value had been obtained previously to reach a mean relative residual concentration of indicator compounds of 20 over the entire treatment plant as required by the swiss authorities federal office for the environment 2015 2 3 1 repeated sample analysis for performance assessment to initially assess the performance of the edc analyzer under real conditions a batch of 500 ml was collected from both the influent and the effluent of the ozonation reactors both batches were filtered 0 45 µm pore size and then analyzed repeatedly on site quantification limits loq were calculated based on the signal responses s and corresponding standard deviations σ of the analysis of dom free blanks loq s blank 10 σ blank 2 3 2 on line monitoring of residual a255nm and edc to observe the changes in a 255nm and edc during ozonation on line the edc analyzer monitored the common influent and effluent of two out of the four parallel ozonation reactors the edc analyzer had a constant sampling interval of 34 min and the hydraulic residence time of the ozonation reactor varied around a median of 29 6 min 25th and 75th percentiles were 25 3 and 38 4 min respectively depending on the total flow rate and the number of operating ozonation reactors this difference between the sampling interval and the hydraulic residence time was considered negligible in comparison to the slow changes of the water quality at the in and effluent 2 3 3 variation of o3 doses in full scale ozonation to vary the o3 dose during full scale ozonation the process control system was operated in an experimental mode based only on feed forward control parameters flow rate q doc concentration estimated based on on line a 254nm and on line nitrite concentration with different targeted specific o3 doses ranging from 0 06 to 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc 1 the targeted o3 doses were manually adjusted on six days in january and february of 2021 during two extended dry weather periods to minimize variations in the composition of the ozonation influent for selected time points pairs of in and effluent grab samples were collected from the sample collection cylinders immediately after aspiration of the sample by the syringe pump of the edc analyzer at this point the grab samples had already passed the ceramic filter disk and were stored at 4 c in the dark without any further sample treatment until further laboratory analyses 2 4 analyses of water quality parameters of ozonation influent samples concentrations of doc loq 0 5 mgdoc l 1 alkalinity loq 0 2 mm ammonium loq 5 µgn l 1 and nitrite loq 1 µgn l 1 were quantified in all grab samples as described in section 1 3 in the si 2 5 analysis of micropollutants by lc ms concentrations of 22 selected micropollutants including pharmaceuticals x ray contrast agents pesticides a food additive and a corrosion inhibitor were quantified in the sample pairs collected from the in and effluent of the ozonation reactor a complete list of micropollutants and corresponding apparent second order rate constants for the reactions with o3 and hydroxyl radical at ph 7 is provided in table s1 si the micropollutants were selected due to their typically high abundance in wwtp effluents their apparent second order rate constants for the reactions with o3 at ph 7 covered a wide range from 5 0 10 2 to 6 8 105 m 1s 1 table s1 si the listed apparent second order rate constants should be considered as approximations for the ph that prevailed during the monitoring campaigns i e ph 7 6 0 2 a subset of twelve micropollutants are also listed as indicator compounds for advanced wastewater treatment by the swiss regulators federal office for the environment 2015 micropollutant concentrations loq 100 ng l 1 were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms as detailed in section 1 5 of the si 2 6 analyses of bromide bromate iodide and iodate by ic ms the o3 reactive halogen species bromide and iodide as well as their oxidation products bromate and iodate were analyzed in the filtered grab samples by ion chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ic ms details on the analysis are described in section 1 6 of the si and table s2 si loqs were 5 1 5 and 2 5 µg l 1 for bromide bromate iodide and iodate respectively with a relative standard deviation of 10 2 7 statistical modeling exponential regression models were fitted to the relative residual a 255nm and edc as a function of specific o3 doses by a non linear least squares method logistic regression models were fitted to the relative residual micropollutant concentrations with a quasibinomial probability distribution a logit link function and the relative residual a 255nm and edc as estimators 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance assessment of the edc analyzer the repeatability of a 255nm and edc measurements was assessed by repeatedly analyzing a batch of influent and effluent of the ozonation reactors collected during routine full scale ozonation specific o3 dose 0 64 mgo3 mgc 1 measurements of a 255nm fig 2 a were highly repeatable with mean values of 0 088 0 001 cm 1 and 0 043 0 001 cm 1 mean value standard deviation n 28 for the in and effluent respectively and were significantly above the loq of 0 006 cm 1 non carbon normalized edc measurements edc c doc were also repeatable fig 2b with mean values for edc c doc of 16 2 0 4 μ m e and 3 6 0 3 μ m e n 28 respectively and were also above the loq of 2 8 μ m e as expected both parameters a 255nm and edc decreased significantly during ozonation to relative residual values of 49 1 and 22 2 fig 2c the slightly larger variations of edc values compared to a 255nm were due to errors introduced by the additional analytical steps required for the edc measurement i e i addition of reagent solutions and ii mixing of the resulting reaction mixture additional advancements and optimizations of the analyzer specifically of the liquid handling may further improve the precision of edc measurements nevertheless the repeatability and loqs demonstrated that the precision of the edc analyzer was suitable to monitor changes in a 255nm and edc during routine ozonation 3 2 on line monitoring of a255nm and edc during full scale ozonation an exemplary nine days series of on line measurement results obtained in february 2021 with the edc analyzer and process data from the ozonation system is shown in fig 3 an equivalent time series obtained in january 2021 is shown in figure s3 si both time series were recorded to a large part under typical dry weather conditions with high levels of nitrogen removal in the preceding nitrifying activated sludge treatment as evidenced by the low residual ammonium concentrations of 0 5 0 2 mgn l 1 in the influent of the ozonation reactor selected water quality parameters i e doc nitrite and ammonium concentrations and alkalinity ph and conductivity of the influent grab samples are shown in figure s4 si the consumption of o3 by nitrite will be addressed separately below 3 2 1 variability of a255nm and edc cdoc in ozonation influent in this time series fig 3 a 255nm and edc c doc of the ozonation influent exhibited minor diurnal fluctuations with stable daily average values values of a 255nm and edc c doc measured in the influent of the ozonation reactor ranged from 0 086 to 0 104 cm 1 and 17 9 22 0 μ m e respectively maximum daily values of a 255nm and edc c doc were reached around midnight between 22 00 and 02 00 h the largest relative daily increase was recorded on the second day during which a 255nm and edc c doc increased by 16 and 23 respectively nitrite concentrations measured on line ranged from 0 06 to 0 33 mgn l 1 in agreement with values for similar nitrifying wastewater treatment plants schindler wildhaber et al 2015 and also followed a diurnal pattern with maximum daily values typically reached between 17 00 and 19 00 these diurnal patterns were attributed to changes in the carbon and nitrogen loads entering the activated sludge treatment basins and the effectiveness of the activated sludge treatment overall the monitored parameters indicated stable process conditions throughout this time series the frequency of approximately one measurement per hour was considered sufficient to capture the diurnal patterns of a 255nm and edc c doc in the ozonation influent however it is conceivable that these parameters may vary more rapidly under certain circumstances for such cases a faster measuring frequency than currently available with the edc analyzer would be beneficial and could be achieved by shortening the reaction time or by parallel edc measurements of the ozonation in and effluent and the blank sample using multiple syringe pumps 3 2 2 stable decrease of a255nm and edc during routine ozonation during routine ozonation fig 3 gray horizontal bars the treatment plant s control system maintained a constant decrease in the uv absorption of the unfiltered in and effluent of the ozonation reactors this resulted in o3 doses of 2 9 4 9 mgo3 l 1 during the monitored time series fig 3 orange line during routine ozonation the primary driver for the variations in the o3 dose was the changes in nitrite concentrations in the ozonation influent because nitrite readily reacts with o3 via an o transfer reaction forming nitrate hoigné et al 1985 naumov et al 2010 the nitrite measured in the influent accounted for 7 43 of the o3 dose ozonation resulted in a significant and stable decreases in both a 255nm and edc independent of the water quality fluctuations in the influent the mean residual value of a 255nm decreased to 48 3 while the mean residual value of edc decreased to 19 3 these small relative standard deviations illustrate the reliability of the measurements obtained with the edc analyzer 3 3 variations of o3 doses during full scale ozonation to investigate the effects of changes in the specific o3 dose on a 255nm and edc during full scale ozonation the feed back control system was temporarily disabled and targeted specific o3 doses were varied using only the feed forward control fig 3 orange horizontal bars this resulted in o3 doses of 0 7 4 8 mgo3 l 1 similar experiments were conducted on two more days time series data shown in figure s3 si generally these o3 doses were lower compared to the doses which would have been applied during routine operation except on the second day of the time series when slightly higher o3 doses were reached 3 3 1 responses of residual a255nm and edc to lower o3 doses the lower o3 doses resulted in higher residual a 255nm and edc in comparison to routine ozonation with maximum values of 88 and 61 respectively fig 3 the slightly higher o3 doses on the second day only resulted in an additional decrease in the residual a 255nm but did not appear to affect residual edc values the time points at which grab samples were collected from the in and effluent of the ozonation reactors are indicated on the time axis in fig 3 circles the corresponding residual a 255nm and edc values circles in fig 4 b spanned the entire range observed for both parameters during the monitoring campaign 3 3 2 consumption of o3 by nitrite and iodide laboratory analyses of anions in and effluent grab samples indicated that nitrite and iodide competed with dom for o3 nitrite concentrations ranged from 0 09 to 0 55 mg n l 1 in the influent samples figure s5a si residual nitrite concentrations relative to the corresponding influent concentrations decreased proportionally to the applied o3 doses figure s5b si in agreement with the fast oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by o3 with k n o 2 5 83 105 m 1s 1 liu et al 2001 iodide was present at unexpectedly high concentrations in a subset of influent grab samples while iodide concentrations in the influent samples ranged between 2 6 and 11 0 µg l 1 on january 11 13 they ranged between 31 3 and 547 µg l 1 on february 22 26 figure s5c si exceeding the expected range for municipal wastewater gong et al 2018 by approximately one order of magnitude the source of those large iodine loads remained unclear as iodide is rapidly oxidized by o3 forming iodate bichsel and von gunten 1999 iodate formation also increased proportionally with increasing applied o3 doses figure s5d si for all time points the mean mass balance of iodide and iodate concentration from in to effluent i e c i e f f l c i o 3 e f f l c i i n f l c i o 3 i n f l was 102 20 figure s5e si indicating that o3 oxidized a fraction of iodide completely to iodate because of this significant consumption of o3 by nitrite and iodide both oxidation reactions were accounted for in the calculation of specific o3 doses see below 3 3 3 decreases in a255nm and edc during ozonation the variations in o3 doses allowed to monitor changes in a 255nm and edc as a function of the specific o3 dose in the grab samples specific o3 doses which were calculated by carbon normalizing o3 doses and correcting for nitrite consumption o3 no2 1 as well as iodate formation o3 io3 3 ranged from 0 13 to 0 91 mgo3 mgdoc 1 along this range the relative residual a 255nm and edc decreased exponentially with increasing specific o3 dose fig 4 a residual values of a 255nm decreased relatively uniformly to 42 at the highest specific o3 dose in comparison relative residual edc values showed a steeper decrease to 29 for specific o3 doses up to 0 34 mgo3 mgc 1 model estimate and plateaued towards higher ozone doses between 0 5 mgo3 mgdoc 1 and the highest specific o3 dose of 0 91 mgo3 mgdoc 1 the relative residual edc only further decreased from 22 to 17 therefore the current analytical method may not be sufficiently sensitive for o3 doses 0 5 mgo3 mgc 1 using edc as control parameter however the high sensitivity of edc towards small specific o3 doses implies that the edc is suited for treatment processes applying low specific o3 doses 0 5 mgo3 mgc 1 such as a combination of ozonation with activated carbon adsorption müller et al 2019 reungoat et al 2012 the fact that the data for both parameters each consistently followed the same exponential trend despite being obtained on six days distributed over two months i e january 5 to march 3 2021 suggests a high repeatability even over long periods of time moreover two time points were collected outside typical dry weather conditions figure s3 si and do not appear to deviate from the observed trends either indicated by yellow symbols in fig 4a indicating robust responses of both parameters also during different operational conditions the decreases in a 255nm and edc after full scale ozonation were both compared to results obtained previously in laboratory ozonation experiments for different secondary treated wastewater effluents chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 walpen et al 2020 as expected the relative residual values of a 255nm measured in this study were in good agreement with previous results figure s6 si in contrast relative residual edc values only agreed for specific o3 doses up to 0 25 mgo3 mgc 1 and then approached different end points for higher doses figure s6 si more specifically relative residual edc values found in this study and by önnby et al 2018 reached lower end points compared to values reported in chon et al 2015 and walpen et al 2020 the different trends likely originated from differences in i the chemical composition of secondary treated wastewater effluents or ii the analytical conditions used for the operationally defined quantification of edc of dom the first hypothesis is supported by the fact that relative residual edc values in this study are lower than reported in walpen et al 2020 despite the application of the same analytical conditions in addition the same source of sample was used in these two studies which further implies that storage time and conditions affect the edc of dom overall these results confirm that changes in a 254nm in laboratory ozonation experiments are representative for full scale systems yet a similar comparison for edc remains inconclusive and requires a systematic assessment 3 3 4 correlation between residual a255nm and edc during ozonation to directly compare the responses of both parameters the relative residual a 255nm was replotted as a function of the relative residual edc fig 4b the trajectory of these data pairs collected over a time span of two months i e january 5 to march 3 2021 were correlated non linearly for relative residual edc values 29 and relative residual a 255nm 71 i e for specific ozone doses 0 34 mgo3 mgc 1 the relative decrease in edc was more pronounced compared to the decrease in a 255nm this trend was inversed towards lower relative residual values of a 255nm and edc respectively the absence of significant deviations from this correlation suggests a consistent response of a 255nm and edc to ozonation for at least several weeks indicating a high degree of redundancy among the two parameters for a potential on line estimation of micropollutant abatement yet it is conceivable that changes in the chemical composition affecting either the uv absorbance or redox properties of the ozonation influent for example due to a contamination could result in irregular responses causing deviations from the observed trend in such a case the availability of two control parameters may facilitate the identification of such atypical process conditions 3 3 5 micropollutant abatement during ozonation concentrations of the 22 micropollutants determined in the in and effluent of the ozonation reactors are summarized in figure s7 si median influent concentrations of 19 micropollutants exceeded the quantification limit of 100 ng l 1 the highest median influent concentrations were measured for benzotriazole 3 7 µg l 1 iomeprol 2 7 µg l 1 diatrizoate 2 4 µg l 1 diclofenac 1 7 µg l 1 and gabapentin 1 5 µg l 1 as expected all sample pairs generally contained lower concentrations of micropollutants in the effluent than in the influent sample residual micropollutant concentrations are shown exemplary for diclofenac k app o3 6 8 105 m 1s 1 hydrochlorothiazide k app o3 8 5 104 m 1s 1 and benzotriazole k app o3 35 m 1s 1 as a function of specific o3 dose fig 4c shown for all 22 micropollutants in figure s8 si residual concentrations decreased proportionally to increasing specific o3 doses for all micropollutants except for the pesticide diuron and the metabolite n 4 acetylsulfamethoxazole for these two compounds no meaningful correlation was obtained because their concentrations were below the quantification limit in most samples overall the extent of abatement was correlated to the second order rate constants of the reactions of these compounds with o3 figure s9 si this observation is consistent with the presence of both ozone and hydroxyl radical as oxidants during the ozonation process bourgin et al 2017 hollender et al 2009 lee et al 2013 while the observed micropollutants had a similar reactivity towards hydroxyl radicals their second order rate constants for the reaction with ozone ranged over eight orders of magnitude table s1 si which resulted in a more pronounced abatement of micropollutants with high ozone reactivity the extent of micropollutant abatement was comparable to previous reports from similar full scale ozonation systems bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 the relative residual micropollutant concentrations observed in this study were generally slightly higher at the same specific o3 dose figure s8 si implying marginally lower oxidant exposures in the ozonation reactors at the wastewater treatment plant in zurich for the same specific o3 dose 3 3 6 estimation of micropollutant abatement based on a255nm and edc the relative residual concentrations of diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide and benzotriazole were re plotted as a function of the relative residual a 255nm fig 5 a and edc fig 5b the relative residual concentrations of these three micropollutants decreased non linearly with the decrease of both parameters similar trends were also observed for the remaining set of micropollutants figures s10 and s11 si except for diuron and n 4 acetylsulfamethoxazole due to the limited data as described above for each of the 22 analyzed micropollutants a logistic regression model was fitted to the relative residual concentrations with either the relative residual a 255nm or edc as explanatory variable the fitted models are shown as solid lines in figs 5a and 5b for diclofenac hydrochlorothiazide and benzotriazole as well as in figures s10 and s11 si for the remaining set of micropollutants to compare the performance of both explanatory variables the quality of the regression models was summarized in a separate plot for both explanatory variables in fig 5c all observed relative residual concentrations for all micropollutants were plotted as a function of the corresponding value estimated using relative residual a 255nm as explanatory variable the same plot is shown in fig 5d for the relative residual edc as explanatory variable the closer the cloud of data points are to the 1 1 line the smaller are the residuals of the fitted models both explanatory variables the relative residual a 255nm and edc allowed to appropriately estimate the relative residual micropollutant concentration the estimated values show a slightly larger spread to the observed values if the relative residual edc is used fitted linear regression model has r 2 0 92 fig 5c compared to the relative residual a 255nm r 2 0 97 fig 5d this larger spread originated from the larger relative standard deviations of the edc compared to a 255nm however as described above instrumental improvements may further increase the precision of the method taken together the logistic regression models allowed to independently estimate micropollutant abatement based on either of the two monitored parameters measured on line 3 3 7 derivation of target values for the residual a255nm and edc based on the fitted logistic regression models target values of the relative residual a 255nm and edc could be derived for any arbitrary micropollutant abatement target to demonstrate this the micropollutant abatement was quantified according to the swiss regulatory framework by averaging the abatement of twelve indicator compounds see table s1 si therefore the models fitted to the relative residual concentration of the twelve indicator compounds were selected shown as light lines in figs 5e and f and averaged along the explanatory variables shown as bold line in figs 5e and f based on these model averages a micropollutant abatement target of e g 75 i e an average relative residual micropollutant concentration of 25 would correspond to a relative residual a 255nm of 57 and a relative residual edc of 19 respectively dotted lines in figs 5e and f in a practical application these target values for the relative residual a 255nm and edc could directly be applied in a feed back control system for the ozonation of secondary treated wastewater however as noted above the limited sensitivity of the edc as control parameter needs to be taken into account for o3 doses 0 5 mgo3 mgc 1 3 3 8 assessment of bromate formation based on a255nm and edc concentrations of bromide in the influent samples ranged from 124 to 807 µg l 1 figure s12a si indicating significant temporal variations in the load of bromide in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant ozonation resulted in the formation of the potentially carcinogenic oxidation by product bromate which was present at concentrations from 1 0 to 7 8 µg l 1 in the effluent samples figure s12b si the molar conversion of bromide to bromate was proportional to the specific o3 dose figure s12c si and increased exponentially to 2 1 at the highest specific o3 dose of 0 91 mgo3 mgc 1 both of which is consistent with previous studies bourgin et al 2018 soltermann et al 2016 molar conversion of bromide to bromate increased significantly to values 1 when the relative residual values of a 255nm and edc fell below a threshold of 49 and 18 respectively figures s12d and e si these threshold values may therefore help to identify ozonation conditions with relative bromide conversion of more than 1 however the relative residual edc is close to its observed end point value of 17 see above in addition these parameters are not suited to assess absolute bromate concentrations in ozonation effluents since its formation during ozonation is proportional to the bromide influent concentration and only absolute bromate concentrations are relevant for regulators 4 conclusions in this study an automated on line edc analyzer was used to continuously monitor the relative changes in a 255nm and edc during full scale ozonation of a secondary treated municipal wastewater variations of the specific o3 doses allowed to assess the responses in a 255nm and edc and their correlation with micropollutant abatement and bromate formation based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn during a multi week monitoring campaign with varying o3 doses responses in residual a 255nm and edc were correlated but non linearly this finding suggests that expanding existing absorbance based ozonation control framework by integrating edc as feedback control parameters could offer i robustness through the application of a second independent surrogate parameter to assess micropollutant abatement and ii additional options to detect problems in the process control relative residual values of a 255nm and edc both decreased exponentially with increasing specific o3 doses in comparison to relative residual a 255nm the relative residual edc responded more sensitive to increases in specific o3 doses 0 34 mgo3 mgc 1 whereas an opposite trend was observed for higher specific ozone doses this finding implies that monitoring residual edc in addition to a 255nm may be particularly interesting for low o3 dose applications such as combinations of ozonation and activated carbon adsorption for enhanced wastewater treatment for 20 out of 22 selected micropollutants relative residual concentrations decreased proportionally to increasing specific o3 doses and thus also to relative residual a 255nm and edc the fitted logistic regression models allowed to derive target values of relative residual a 255nm and edc for specific micropollutant abatement targets bromate concentrations in the effluent of the ozonation reactors cannot be predicted by decreases in uv absorption or edc during ozonation because they also depend on the bromide concentrations in the influent however both parameters are suitable to identify ozonation conditions with elevated conversions of bromide to bromate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16398,anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor anombr attracted attention due to high quality effluent production with low energy demand and draw solute has significant effect on the system performance however the mutual relationship between draw solute induced salinity accumulation and microbial community had many unknown questions to be solved this study purpose was to construct two anombr to compare the impact of draw solutes of nacl and mgcl2 on the dynamic change of microbial ecology and membrane fouling the result indicated that the draw solute of mgcl2 caused less salinity and more membrane biofouling than that of the draw solute nacl multiple microbiological analysis methods were applied to discover keystone species related to the conductivity change and membrane fouling especially for the mgcl2 anombr system it was found that draw solute nacl could benefit the growth of proteobacteria to become the most abundant phylum to affect the membrane fouling while mg2 introduction could stimulate the growth of ns9 hydrogenphilaceae and pedosphaeraceae to potentially cause the biofouling furthermore phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens deeply analyzed the microbial structure difference under na and mg2 introduction and indicated that the family lentimicrobiaceae and candidatus kaiserbacteria were the keystone species in nacl anombr while two genus anaerolinea and swb02 and two families saprospiraceae and ns9 were discovered to have key effect in mgcl2 anombr due to their strong extracellular polymeric substances eps production ability for survival of other microorganisms this study was significant to give microbial targets under the impact of various draw solutes as the reference for the engineers to further investigate how to improve the microbial structure to enhance anombr performance and inhibit the membrane biofouling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactors draw solute salt accumulation microbial community membrane fouling 1 introduction anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor anombr was a technique to combine the forward osmosis fo and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr to allow a sustainable wastewater treatment with low energy demand chen et al 2014 gu et al 2015 anombr had higher wastewater treatment ability than the traditional anmbr because fo membrane was reported with higher rejection ability against complex compounds than traditional anmbr for example the previous study indicated that the anombr with the fo could achieve rejection efficiency against caffeine atenolol and atrazine at 93 1 99 6 and 93 3 respectively while traditional anmbr with uf could not remove caffeine or atenolol and atrazine was only reduced by 20 under anmbr kim et al 2017 wei et al 2016 also the anombr had higher removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and total phosphorus tp and achieved significant low dissolved ch4 in the wastewater effluent due to fo rejection effect for example the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tp in anombr were approximately 60 80 and 100 respectively and the dissolved ch4 concentration was low 2 5 ml ch4 l in the effluent chen et al 2014 gimenez et al 2012 gu et al 2015 smith et al 2013 thus the addition of fo could enable anombr to achieve better wastewater treatment efficiency than traditional anmbr cath et al 2006 wang et al 2016 despite these benefits of anombr there were still some challenges to be solved salt accumulation has significant impact on the feasibility of anombr due to reversed diffusion of the draw solutes draw solution ds salt selection is a key point for the anombr and the common draw solutes include nacl and mgcl2 the draw solute selection has important impact on water flux membrane fouling methane production and microbial community structure song et al 2018 xiao et al 2011 xue et al 2020 an important method to control the salinity buildup is to use a low diffusivity salt and mgcl2 was a promising draw solute to reduce the reversed salt flux achilli et al 2010 the impact of nacl and mgcl2 on the traditional aerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr has been deeply studied and mgcl2 was found with high economic technical advantage for the ombr achilli et al 2010 lebron et al 2021 wang et al 2016 however the influences of mgcl2 on the anombr were rarely studied there were only few previous studies about the impact of draw solute mgcl2 and main discovery focused on the relationship between mgcl2 concentration and methanogenic activity it was reported that excessive nacl or mgcl2 concentration caused higher ionic strength to finally cause plasmolysis and loss of activity of cells to cause cell death and methane production decline feng et al 2020 kargi and dincer 1996 zhao et al 2018 thus the main process of nacl or mgcl2 to affect the microbial activity and structure was to change the ionic strength to make inhibition based on the current studies however there were still multiple missing points about the impact of nacl or mgcl2 on other microbial species in the biofilm e g bacteria which needed further investigation in anombr the success of biological treatment of wastewater relies on microbial structure and functions salinity build up in the bioreactor can considerably affect the bacterial community structure of ombr several studies showed that almost the previously dominant species were replaced by halotolerant species due to salinity build up during the ombr operation luo et al 2017 qiu and ting 2013 wang et al and m j luján facundo found that the relative abundance of main phylum proteobacteria decreased as salt concentration increased due to salt inhibition while the relative abundance of another phylum bacteroidetes increased along with the increased reactor salinity lujan facundo et al 2018 wang et al 2017 similarly bacteroidetes was discovered to be more active in ombr than in the mbr luo et al 2017 therefore these results showed that the microbial species would change their abundance and activity to various salt concentrations however these studies only focused on the impacts of nacl on microbial relative abundance but this was not enough to analyze the function of each microbial taxon especially for rare studies focusing on mgcl2 more studies are needed to understand the impact of draw solute mgcl2 on microbial ecology of anombr in this study anombr were constructed with various draw solutes nacl and mgcl2 to investigate their impact on the microbial ecology and their relations with membrane fouling to give complete picture about the microbial structure difference high throughput sequencing heatmap factor analysis and phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens were applied together conductivity was set as the operational factor to trace the dynamic change of the microbial structure under the draw solute of nacl and mgcl2 and the relationship among the microbial species and parameters related to membrane fouling e g soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps was tracked under heatmap analysis furthermore pmens were used to identify the interaction patterns and ecological roles of co occurring taxa with huge contribution for wastewater treatment and membrane fouling wu et al 2016 this study was the first to give the complete picture of the dynamic change of microbial community under na and mg2 build up to perceive the effect of mgcl2 on the anombr microbial ecology and system performance which became the valuable guideline to refer to improve the future anaerobic wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation of anombr two laboratory scale anombr systems namely nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr were set up under the same operating conditions details of the anombr structure were reported in our previous study lee et al 2021 briefly continuous stirred tank reactors cstr of anombr had the working volume of 2 l with a side stream plate and frame fo module inside effective membrane area at 40 cm2 feed solution fs was the synthetic wastewater to simulate municipal wastewater and the components were described in supplementary information table s1 the toc nh3 n po4 p electric conductivity and ph of the feed solution were 165 5 mg l 45 2 mg l 5 0 0 2 mg l 1 1 0 1ms cm and 7 20 0 1 respectively the draw solutions for two systems were composed of 1 m nacl and 0 9 m mgcl2 respectively and a peristaltic pump was used to control the same initial flux of 8 55 0 5 l m 2 h 1 the inoculated sludge was taken from a beijing municipal wastewater treatment plant already acclimated in a 2 l fermentation flask fed with the synthetic wastewater for approximately 45 days at 35 0 5 c when the inoculated sludge achieved the toc removal efficiency at 90 the sludge was started to inoculate into the anombr the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 3 47 0 08 g l and 2 84 0 06 g l for both anombr respectively sludge was retained within the systems and hydraulic retention time varied depending on the water flux the produced biogas was collected through the gas sampling bags on top of the anombr the diluted ds solution was daily refreshed to minimize the effect of osmotic pressure reduction and electronic balances ms6002ts mettler toledo were used to weigh ds for the calculation of the volume change of the collected permeate over time fo membrane was also cleaned once the flux dropped to around 2 3 l m 2 h 1 for these two systems and the detailed cleaning procedures were described in supplementary information it should be noted that anombr were kept at a constant temperature of 35 0 5 c 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 mixed liquor characterization treatment performance was determined by the measurement of the multiple water parameters including toc nh4 n total nitrogen tn tp and other parameters for the biofouling related parameter measurement the extraction procedures for smp and eps were listed in the previous studies li and yang 2007 shen et al 2013 three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan was applied to characterize smp and eps under different conductivities and separation of the eem spectra were identified by parallel factor parafac modeling yu et al 2020 the fluorescence data were then modeled with the domfluor toolbox in matlab r2009a stedmon and bro 2008 the nonnegativity constraints split half and residual analysis was further performed to identify fluorescence components the maximum fluorescence intensities fmax r u were adopted to represent the relative level of each component 2 2 2 foulant layer characterization the fouled membrane was removed from the reactor and lyophilized in a freeze dryer fdu 1110 eyela japan at room temperature for 24 h for further analyses the membrane morphology and elemental composition of the fouling layer were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi s4800 japan and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher the u s respectively furthermore attenuated total reflection fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectroscopy was used to analyze the organic functional groups of the fouling layer confocal laser scanning microcopy clsm lsm710 3 channel zeiss germany was used to analyze the distribution of microorganisms polysaccharides and proteins in the biofouling layer with the help of different fluorescence dyes details about the fluorescence dyes were shown in supplementary information 2 3 microbiological analysis 2 3 1 dna extraction and community analysis the fouling biomass attached on the fo membrane surface and bulk sludge samples inside the anombr were all taken out from the reactor and then all samples were pretreated based on the previous study huang et al 2008 then the all samples were processed by dna extraction pcr magnification and illumina sequencing analysis the operational taxonomic units otus could be obtained by using the uparse function within usearch to select the qualified otus for the following measurement and analysis edgar 2010 complete linkage clustering was applied to complete the alpha analysis to obtain the richness and diversity indices including the number of sequences observed species pd whole tree diversity indices and shannon diversity indices to analyze the characteristics of the microbial community wei et al 2020 the details were shown in supplementary information 2 3 2 cca and pmen analysis microbial communities of all samples were clustered based on abundances of families using the cluster analysis ca correlation analysis among microbial species and five parameters i e conductivity toc smp lb eps and sludge size and microbial community structure was performed using canonical correspondence analysis cca to indicate the microbial structure difference and the factorial influence on the dynamic change of the microbial structure the pearson indices and significant correlation of all the correlations among all five operational factors were calculated by r studio v 3 0 2 cca analysis also identified the environmental basis for community ordination from the original point by extracting the maximum relationship between the microbial community composition from all the samples and measured environmental variables calculated and performed with r studio v 3 0 2 heatmap analysis based on the pearson s method was applied to determine the relationship among the microorganisms and operational factors pmens were applied to determine the keynote species and evaluate their importance inside the microbial community and the detailed methods were based on the previous studies wang et al 2020 ya et al 2021 basically the correlation matrices in pmen analysis were based on the relative abundance of otu numbers and fast greedy modularity was applied to separate each network corresponding random networks were produced by the maslov sneppen method to compare with the pmens to determine relative significance of all networks maslov and sneppen 2002 statistical analysis of r square characteristics was used to identify small world property and modular structure of the networks telesford et al 2011 and the network result was obtained by gephi software webatlas paris france 3 results and discussions 3 1 water flux and salt accumulation the trends of water flux and cleaning frequency of the nacl and mgcl2 anombr was shown in fig 1 a both reactors began with nearly the same initial water fluxes of 8 5 0 5 l m 2 h 1 compared to the nacl anombr the flux decline was more evident in the mgcl2 anombr while a substantial lower salinity was achieved in the mgcl2 anombr than that of the nacl anombr the greater flux drop of fo membrane in the mgcl2 reactor was the result of more severe membrane fouling and internal concentration polarization icp tang et al 2010 xu et al 2010 the salinity build up in mixed liquor was indicated by the conductivity increase and the conductivity change was indicated by fig 1b the mixed liquor conductivity in nacl and mgcl2 anombr increased from 2 43 to 29 30 and 3 07 to 21 05 ms cm respectively along the operational period and the salinity in nacl anombr was much higher than that of the mgcl2 anombr owing to more reversed flux of nacl compared to mgcl2 hu et al 2017 the results confirmed the previous study that the small monovalent draw solutes e g na were highly mobile for larger reversed flux compare to divalent solutes e g mg2 and how mg2 lower conductivity caused more severe membrane fouling warrants the following investigation hu et al 2017 song et al 2018 3 2 process performance the concentrations of toc nh4 n and tp in the influent supernatant effluent and the removal rates in anombr system was shown in fig 2 and dynamic change of ph in bulk mixed liquor was indicated in supplementary information fig s1 both anombr achieved high overall removal rate of toc up to 98 the excellent removal performance of toc in the systems were attributed to the stable biological degradation and high rejection of fo membrane cath et al 2006 gu et al 2015 for the methane comparison small amout of methane was detected in mgcl2 anombr while there was no methane detected in nacl anombr fig s2 the details were shown in supplementary information similarly tp removal efficiency in both reactors were more than 98 figs 2c and d and supernatant concentration was lower in the mgcl2 anombr than nacl anombr the nh4 n concentration of supernatant in the nacl and mgcl2 anombr fluctuated in a range of 21 to 63 mg l and 43 mg l respectively figs 2e and f the concentration of nh4 in ds of mgcl2 was lower than that of nacl indicating higher fo rejection efficiency in mgcl2 anombr as explained by the donnan potential for maintaining the charge balance between the fs and ds sides more na diffused into the mixed liquor when nacl was used as the ds and this would cause more nh4 n passing through the fo membrane to ds side on the contrary less mg2 would pass through the fo membrane into the mixed liquor and thereby lower amount of nh4 n would diffuse back into the ds of mgcl2 anombr hu et al 2017 the trend of tn was the same as the nh4 n during the operational time fig s3 thus mgcl2 anombr showed slightly better nh4 and tn removal efficiency than nacl anombr 3 3 mixed liquor characterization 3 3 1 changes of smp and eps microorganisms respond to salt stress by increasing endogenous respiration with the secretion of smp and eps to protect themselves and thus the variations of smp and eps concentrations of both reactors could be related to membrane fouling fig 3 in nacl anombr smp concentration increased from 12 1 to 21 9 mg g mlvss along with the salinity increase but both lb eps and tb eps was nearly not affected by the conductivity on the contrary the smp concentration also increased from 17 9 to 27 2 mg g mlvss but apparent increasing trend of lb eps and tb eps concentration was discovered in mgcl2 anombr from 27 7 to 33 2 mg g and 15 4 to 21 3 mg g mlvss respectively indicating the high microbial ability for eps secretion it should be noted that the microbially produced smp would be degraded but the actual smp concentrations in both nacl and mgcl2 anombr were increased indicating the rejection of fo membrane to maintain smp concentration chen et al 2014 gu et al 2015 on the contrary a previous study indicated that the salinity accumulation could affect microbial activity to affect the change of eps concentration song et al 2018 the reason for higher eps concentration in mgcl2 anombr was possible because the eps were linearly related with the increasing dose of mg2 since mg2 could enhance biofouling due to their cationic bridges with eps to form a thicker biofouling layer achilli et al 2010 wang et al 2016 3 3 2 eem fluorescence spectra of smp and eps parafac modeling was applied to confirm four components for the entire eem spectroscopy to trace the relationship between smp and eps and conductivity the details of eem spectra to confirm the four components were described in the supplementary information and the result of four components was shown in fig 4 including humic like compounds c1 c2 tyrosine like protein c3 and tryptophan like protein c4 parafac analysis was able to reveal the fluorescence intensity f max of the four components in smp lb eps and tb eps to show their changing trend along the conductivity change for the analysis of smp the f max of humic like substances c1 c2 of smp generally showed a declining or unchanging trend while the proteins like substances c3 c4 showed an increasing trend along the salinity increase in nacl anombr fig 4 in the comparison in mgcl2 anombr the f max of c2 c3 and c4 of smp showed increasing trend along the conductivity increase fig 4 the previous work also confirmed the result that the fluorescence intensity of protein like substances of smp also increased along the conductivity increase in the anombr chen et al 2014 however for the analysis of eps f max of c1 c4 for lb eps and tb eps was declining in nacl anombr fig 4 in contrast the fluorescence intensities of c1 c4 of lb eps and tb eps exhibited the increasing trends along with the conductivity increase in the mgcl2 anombr specially the tyrosine like protein c3 was the primary component in smp and lb eps with the conductivity increase in mgcl2 anombr and thus tyrosine like protein might be the contributing matter for the membrane fouling overall the eem parafac findings of smp and eps revealed that more protein like matters emerged with the increasing mg2 level in mgcl2 anombr than nacl anombr 3 4 fouling layer characterization the sem analysis was processed for the surface morphology of the fouling layer the sem images of nacl anombr depicted the crystal like salt deposits scattered on the fouled membrane surface while the foulant layer was much more compact and thicker on the fouled membrane in the mgcl2 anombr fig s5 xps spectra was applied to reveal the elemental composition for material and the virgin cellulose triacetate membrane cta was found to mainly contain c and o fig 5 a for the fouled membrane the presence of high n content indicated the existence of organic fouling protein like foulants she et al 2016 it should be noted that much higher percentage of mg and ca was present on the fouled membrane in mgcl2 anombr indicating the contrition of mg and ca on the membrane fouling fig 5a and table s2 the fouling layer composition was further investigated by the atr ftir and clsm analyses the atr ftir spectra exhibited new absorption peaks at wave numbers of 3287 cm 1 ch or oh stretching on the fouled membrane of both reactors related to polysaccharide like substances fig 5b gu et al 2015 sun et al 2016b also the presences of adsorption peaks at 1643 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 were respectively related to amide group i co stretching and ii nh bending and cn stretching of protein substances on the membrane surface gu et al 2015 sun et al 2016b zhu et al 2016 furthermore the enhanced foulant peak of the mgcl2 fouled membrane indicated the more severe membrane fouling the clsm images also suggested that the content of microorganisms proteins and β polysaccharides were much more on the membrane surface in mgcl2 anombr fig 5c mainly indicating more deposition of biofoulants induced by mg2 introduction in the anombr to sum up these results indicated the occurrence of organic and biofouling in both nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr comparatively mgcl2 anombr had denser biofilm implying that mg2 was more prone to enhancing the deposition of the biofoulants polysaccharides and proteins on the membrane surface to make more severe biofouling condition 3 5 microbial analysis the dynamic change of the community composition could reflect the microbial reactions on the membrane surface since the changes of microbial composition had huge impact on the membrane fouling guo et al 2015 this part is to comprehensively show the microbial community change and demonstrate key species for the system performance alpha diversity analysis was the first step to generally evaluate the richness and evenness of the community structure in nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr the indices of observed species chao1 and pd whole tree could indicate their richness and evenness and all indices were shown in fig s6 the result showed that the species richness and evenness was stably maintained at higher level for the mgcl2 anombr fig s6 thus the microbial community on fo surface in mgcl2 anombr had higher species richness with high potential for membrane fouling problem more details of alpha diversity analysis were shown in supplementary information furthermore the dynamic change of the relative abundance of dominant species in anombr system could reflect the performance of species in the phylum level there were 17 dominant phyla to be detected and 5 phyla were dominant including proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes firmicutes and patescibacteria except for firmicutes other four phyla showed higher abundance in both anombr the phylum proteobacteria showed highest relative abundance 30 fig 6 a due to its strong organic degradation ability liu et al 2016 also other three phyla chloroflexi bacteroidetes and patescibacteria were commonly involved in anaerobic fermentation liu et al 2016 thus the high abundance of these phyla indicated that anombr systems worked efficiently to achieve wastewater treatment most importantly comparison of the abundance difference could reflect the impact of nacl and mgcl2 phylum proteobacteria was generally most dominant in all microbial samples e g at 40 55 fig 6a the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the supernatant increased from 25 to 45 in nacl anombr fig 6a mainly due to higher salinity in nacl anombr than mgcl2 anombr since higher salinity was reported to benefit halotolerant phylum proteobacteria chang et al 2019 thus high saline pressure in nacl anombr was suitable for proteobacteria on the contrary mgcl2 anombr was better environment for other four phyla due to their higher richness fig s6 for example chloroflexi had similar evolution characteristics with proteobacteria and had high synergistic relationship with other methanogens eduok et al 2017 fig 6a showed that the phylum chloroflexi had increasing relative abundance in mgcl2 anombr from 17 day 0 up to 30 day 14 along the operational time indicating its more and more important role in mgcl2 anombr however the lower relative abundance of chloroflexi in nacl anombr system indicated that chloroflexi did not have strong halotolerant ability thus the lower salinity of mgcl2 anombr was beneficial for chloroflexi also bacteroidetes and patescibacteria had higher favorability in the low saline environment for higher abundance in mgcl2 anombr e g bacteroidetes increasing from 24 to 28 at day 0 to day 14 in mgcl2 anombr higher than around 20 from day 0 to day 14 in nacl anombr fig 6a the reason was their cell vulnerability under the saline environment xia et al 2019 thus low salinity in mgcl2 anombr was better for high species richness direct microbial analysis on the fo membrane surface could indicated the contribution on the biofouling the highest relative abundance on the fo membrane in mgcl2 anombr was patescibacteria fig 6a it was reported that patescibacteria had ultra small cell size and pili like membrane structure to be enriched on the membrane surface to clog inside the membrane pores tian et al 2020 thus this study gave important hint that patescibacteria was worth investigation related to the membrane fouling under mg2 introduction 3 5 1 cca and heatmap analysis the relationship between parameters and the microbial structure could give direction to optimize the anombr performance in this study cca and heatmap analysis were applied as useful tools to graphically describe the difference between microbial structure and operational factors monte carlo permutation test was performed to confirm that cca analysis had nonrandom distribution the first and second axis of the cca figure explained 40 3 and 28 7 of the significant correlation factors fig 6b all microbial samples were demonstrated by the sample dots fig 6b three green circles in the cca figure indicated the clustering similarity of microbial samples denoted as original sludge nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr respectively fig 6b the clear separation of three green circles indicated their significant difference of microbial structure fig 6b indicating the impact of various environment on the microbial change however it should be noted that all the microbial samples were not drastically changed along the operational time based on the arrow of operational time fig 6b this showed the high microbial stability of the microbial structure the core of cca analysis was to indicate the impact of parameters the environmental vectors indicated the correlations between the microbial samples and operational parameters for example vector direction of time was completely reversed to the sludge size fig 6b indicating that sludge particle size would decrease due to the flushing and breakdown effect and thus the solution eps and smp increased due to the sludge breakdown to produce small particles furthermore all three environmental vectors including toc smp and lp eps pointed to the first quadrant directing towards the green circle of mgcl2 anombr indicating the highly positive correlations between these three factors fig 6b it should be noted that the arrow direction of conductivity was similar with the arrow direction of operational time fig 6b matching up the experiment process that both anombr reactors had higher and higher conductivity along the operational time also since nacl anombr had higher conductivity than mgcl2 anombr at the end of the experimental process day 28 thus the arrow direction of mgcl2 anombr was closer to sample points of s1 d28 instead of s2 d28 fig 6b however the cca analysis only provided general correlation analysis and the detailed correlation with certain microorganisms was lacked heatmap is to show the detailed correlation among operational factors and certain microorganisms the correlation strength could be reflected by the statistical method to determine positive or negative effect on the activity of the specific microorganisms the heatmap for the top 20 abundant families were shown in figs 6c and d and the overall summary was shown in tables s3 and s4 in the heatmap analysis the square color blue and red in this study indicated positive and negative relationship among the microbial species and set variables e g conductivity toc smp lb eps and sludge size in this study the reliability of the heatmap analysis pearson s method was supported by p value calculation and both heatmaps could achieve the standard p value 0 05 to support the high reliability for the relationship between the microbial species and external variables microbial correlation with the conductivity change was different between two anombr in nacl anombr only few families have high conductivity tolerance the heatmap indicated that only four families including burkholderiaceae syntrophaceae lentimicrobiaceae and enterobacteriaceae was positively related with the conductivity increase fig 6c and table s3 the reason was possible due to the stimulation of the high salinity to improve their extracellular electron transportation eet for example the family syntrophaceae was reported to have strong syntrophic ability with other bacteria to reduce sulfate by the electron transportation harb et al 2016 one genus of the family syntrophaceae syntrophobacteraceae was discovered to consume acetate to achieve the sulfur reduction through the conductive media for eet e g metal surface zhuang et al 2019 also other genera within the family syntrophaceae such as desulfomonile also had high eet ability to complete the redox reaction tender et al 2002 thus the high salinity in the nacl anombr might benefit these eet bacteria to become dominant lower salinity of mgcl2 anombr system caused the different microbial structure to make other microorganisms have the positive relationship with the conductivity including ns9 hydrogenphilaceae and pedosphaeraceae fig 6d and table s4 the relationship difference indicated the impact of draw solute on the microbial structure change and the microorganisms that were favorable to lower conductivity or mg2 could become dominant furthermore mgcl2 anombr had more severe biofouling condition than nacl anombr and thus the species with positive relationship with smp and eps concentration in the mgcl2 anombr would be potential contributors for the membrane biofouling koók et al 2019 analysis of the smp and eps change under mgcl2 anombr would be significant reference for the fouling analysis and the analysis details were shown below 3 5 2 mg2 introduction on membrane biofouling mg2 introduction in the anombr system would possibly inhibit the growth of smp favorable microorganisms and reduce their contribution on the biofouling in this study mgcl2 anombr actually had more families with positive relationship 15 families with smp than nacl anombr 8 families tables s3 and s4 however mg2 introduction into mbr system was reported to reduce the microbial smp production due to bridging effect to bind hydrophobic smp for smp aggregation to reduce biofouling arabi and nakhla 2009 thus since smp concentration was inhibited under mg2 the positive related microorganisms with the smp would also be inhibited under mg2 thus these positive related families with smp were not the main contributor for the membrane fouling such as lentimicrobiaceae carnobacteriaceae table s4 on the contrary mg2 introduction in the anombr system possibly stimulated the eps favorable microorganisms heatmap analysis indicated that mgcl2 anombr had fewer families 4 families with positive relationship with eps than nacl anombr 10 families tables s3 and s4 it should be noted that mg2 introduction was reported to stimulate the increase of eps concentrations attributed to the cation bridging of divalent cations with the eps arabi and nakhla 2009 thus the mg2 introduction could assist the growth of positive related families with eps to cause biofouling and thus all four families with positive relationship with eps including ns9 desulfobulbaceae pedosphaeraceae and burkholderiaceae were perceived as contributors on the eps secretion and membrane biofouling fig 6f and table s4 for example desulfobulbaceae had high eps secretion ability under complicated environment to cause membrane fouling ogawa et al 2020 overall the variation of microbial structure under two various draw solutes caused the variation of main functions and more eps favorable species under mg2 resulted in severe biofouling the heatmap analysis indicated these four key candidates on the biofouling condition of anombr and this discovery could serve as reference for the further relationship investigation 3 5 3 microbial abundance change affected by salinity in this study the dynamic change of the microbial abundance was traced under all conductivities in both anombr to directly reflect the impact of na and mg2 on the microbial activity top 20 families of the relative abundance were selected out several families could increase their abundance along the conductivity increase and these families could be perceived as the key families for the biofouling for example all four families including rhodocyclaceae solibacteraceae saprospiraceae and ignavibacteriaceae increased their relative abundance with the conductivity increase in both anombr the family rhodocyclaceae was found to increase its relative abundance from 15 to 34 and 9 to 15 in nacl and mgcl2 anombr respectively figs 7 a and b and it reflected its high adaptability in the anombr however the family rhodocyclaceae showed limited contribution on the membrane fouling in mgcl2 anombr due to its lower relative abundance 15 than nacl anombr 34 since more severe membrane fouling occurred in mgcl2 anombr the relatively smaller abundance increase of rhodocyclaceae in the mgcl2 anombr reversely indicated its minor contribution on the membrane fouling figs 7a and b thus rhodocyclaceae was inferred not to be contributor for the membrane fouling on the contrary other families including saprospiraceae ignavibacteriaceae and solibacteraceae showed their higher growth rate with the conductivity increase in mgcl2 anombr for example saprospiraceae was the common family to dominate the aerobic granules with high production of eps and smp in wastewater treatment tavana et al 2019 thus the significant abundance increase of saprospiraceae in both anombr indicated its contributions on the membrane fouling similarly another family ignavibacteriaceae could achieve eet to degrade the aromatic compounds and reduce sulfate for strong metabolism and growth rate ghosh and dam 2009 furthermore both of saprospiraceae and ignavibacteriaceae had higher relative abundance increase in mgcl2 anombr than nacl anombr figs 7a and b confirming their potential candidates for the membrane biofouling specially for another family solibacteraceae there were few researches to investigate its relationship with the membrane biofouling thus this study was also to give information to emphasize the relationship between solibacteraceae and membrane biofouling the relative abundance of other families with no change or decrease was also shown in supplementary information figs s7 and s8 and these families were perceived with limited relationship with the conductivity increase overall the combination of the heatmap analysis and abundance tracing could revealed three candidate families for the membrane biofouling including saprospiraceae ignavibacteriaceae and solibacteraceae 3 5 4 pmen to identify keystone populations only dependence on relative abundance was not enough to reveal all keystone species thus to further identify the keystone species in the anombr pmens were constructed to reflect the species interactions with other microbes the basic parameters of pmens of nacl and mgcl2 reactors were to indicate the characteristics of the microbial structures parameters in tables s5 to s7 and these parameters confirmed that both pmens were eligible to indicate the key species more detailed analysis of these parameters was described in supplementary information pmen analysis and z p plot classification were applied to select the module hubs network hubs and connectors to indicate the keystone species inside the microbial community figs 8 a and b totally 7 and 10 species were selected out from nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr respectively figs 8c and d these species were candidates to affect the reactor performance and further investigation of these families were significant to discover their contribution on the anombr performance to assist the analysis of their contribution heatmap analysis was also applied to point out the relationship among these species and the operational parameters figs 8e and f z p plot could give the classification for all significant microorganisms and hubs in pmens were perceived as keynote species in the anombr in the nacl anombr f lentimicrobiaceae otu1076 was perceived as the only keystone species in the microbial community fig 8c tables s6 and s7 though the relative abundance of f lentimicrobiaceae was extremely low 0 08 the connectivity of this microorganism with other species confirmed its importance in the microbial structure it was previously reported that the family lentimicrobiaceae had the strong ability to surround other bacteria to assist their degradation of complex polysaccharides sun et al 2016a thus the family lentimicrobiaceae had high potential to affect the performance of nacl anombr and membrane fouling based on heatmap analysis lentimicrobiaceae had the negative relationship with the conductivity indicating that the high salinity caused by reversed salt flux of nacl would inhibit the growth of lentimicrobiaceae fig 8e thus the high salinity inhibition against lentimicrobiaceae might also inhibit the growth of other bacteria to release the biofouling and thus membrane fouling condition in nacl anombr was not as severe as that of mgcl2 anombr another microorganism o candidatus kaiserbacteria otu23 was also detected as the module hub in nacl anombr fig 8c tables s3 and s4 it should be noted that the relative abundance of o candidatus kaiserbacteria 1 04 was higher than lentimicrobiaceae due to its positive relationship with the conductivity fig 8e it was previously reported that other microorganisms in the same phylum such as candidatus cloacimonas acidaminovorans had syntrophic relationship with other methanogens to produce methane sieber et al 2012 thus the high abundance of o candidatus kaiserbacteria had high potential to benefit the methane production in the anombr furthermore due to low relative abundances of all other key species all under 0 25 table s7 o candidatus kaiserbacteria showed more significant impact on the methane production and membrane fouling in nacl anombr for the mgcl2 anombr more module hubs were discovered including g swb02 g anaerolinea two otus f saprospiraceae f ns9 two otus interestingly two otus of g anaerolinea and two otus of f ns9 were simultaneously discovered as keystone species fig 8d however two otus under the same classification had the opposite relationships with the conductivity fig 8d for example the genus g anaerolinea otu 208 and g anaerolinea otu 132 were both classified as the module hubs interestingly the genus anaerolinea otu 208 had the positive relationship with the conductivity while another genus anaerolinea otu 132 had the negative relationship fig 8d also these two taxa had the opposite relationship with the other parameters e g toc smp fig 8d thus the discovery indicated that various taxa even within the same classification would have various characteristics to behave in the anombr system thus the genus anaerolinea and the family ns9 could have various functions to connect other microorganisms to increase the microbial complexity under the effect of mgcl2 anombr similarly the detected otu 8 and otu 1702 in the family ns9 also had similar behavior and functions other two species f saprospiraceae and g swb02 were also spotted as important species in the mgcl2 anombr though these species had low relative abundance f saprospiraceae at 0 09 g swb02 at 0 20 respectively these microorganisms were at least to show important effect on the microbial structure thus their positive relationship with the conductivity and lb eps could be perceived as the important evidence to prove their high viability under mg2 to cause the membrane fouling overall this study was meaningful as the first study to dig out the candidates to make contribution for the membrane fouling and this study simultaneously gave complete picture about how multiple species performed and interacted in the anombr system 4 conclusion the study purpose was to simultaneously demonstrate the microbial ecology variance between nacl and mgcl2 anombr and discover the relationship between the keystone species and salinity buildup to affect the system performance and membrane biofouling the conclusion could be drawn as the following messages 1 draw solute of mgcl2 in anombr could cause less salinity and more severe membrane biofouling than the draw solute nacl 2 microbial analysis based on relative abundance comparison and correlation analysis indicated that proteobacteria was dominant phylum in nacl anombr while mgcl2 anombr had more complicated microbial structure including the key species of ns9 hydrogenphilaceae and pedosphaeraceae together to cause the membrane fouling 3 pmens demonstrated the microbial interactions in these two anombrs and discovered that the family lentimicrobiaceae was keystone species in nacl anombr while the genus anaerolinea and the family saprospiraceae were keystone species in mgcl2 anombr overall this study was the first to comprehensively show how nacl and mgcl2 affected the microbial structure and how the dynamic microbial change related the physicochemical parameters e g eps smp to affect the membrane

16398,anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor anombr attracted attention due to high quality effluent production with low energy demand and draw solute has significant effect on the system performance however the mutual relationship between draw solute induced salinity accumulation and microbial community had many unknown questions to be solved this study purpose was to construct two anombr to compare the impact of draw solutes of nacl and mgcl2 on the dynamic change of microbial ecology and membrane fouling the result indicated that the draw solute of mgcl2 caused less salinity and more membrane biofouling than that of the draw solute nacl multiple microbiological analysis methods were applied to discover keystone species related to the conductivity change and membrane fouling especially for the mgcl2 anombr system it was found that draw solute nacl could benefit the growth of proteobacteria to become the most abundant phylum to affect the membrane fouling while mg2 introduction could stimulate the growth of ns9 hydrogenphilaceae and pedosphaeraceae to potentially cause the biofouling furthermore phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens deeply analyzed the microbial structure difference under na and mg2 introduction and indicated that the family lentimicrobiaceae and candidatus kaiserbacteria were the keystone species in nacl anombr while two genus anaerolinea and swb02 and two families saprospiraceae and ns9 were discovered to have key effect in mgcl2 anombr due to their strong extracellular polymeric substances eps production ability for survival of other microorganisms this study was significant to give microbial targets under the impact of various draw solutes as the reference for the engineers to further investigate how to improve the microbial structure to enhance anombr performance and inhibit the membrane biofouling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactors draw solute salt accumulation microbial community membrane fouling 1 introduction anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor anombr was a technique to combine the forward osmosis fo and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr to allow a sustainable wastewater treatment with low energy demand chen et al 2014 gu et al 2015 anombr had higher wastewater treatment ability than the traditional anmbr because fo membrane was reported with higher rejection ability against complex compounds than traditional anmbr for example the previous study indicated that the anombr with the fo could achieve rejection efficiency against caffeine atenolol and atrazine at 93 1 99 6 and 93 3 respectively while traditional anmbr with uf could not remove caffeine or atenolol and atrazine was only reduced by 20 under anmbr kim et al 2017 wei et al 2016 also the anombr had higher removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and total phosphorus tp and achieved significant low dissolved ch4 in the wastewater effluent due to fo rejection effect for example the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tp in anombr were approximately 60 80 and 100 respectively and the dissolved ch4 concentration was low 2 5 ml ch4 l in the effluent chen et al 2014 gimenez et al 2012 gu et al 2015 smith et al 2013 thus the addition of fo could enable anombr to achieve better wastewater treatment efficiency than traditional anmbr cath et al 2006 wang et al 2016 despite these benefits of anombr there were still some challenges to be solved salt accumulation has significant impact on the feasibility of anombr due to reversed diffusion of the draw solutes draw solution ds salt selection is a key point for the anombr and the common draw solutes include nacl and mgcl2 the draw solute selection has important impact on water flux membrane fouling methane production and microbial community structure song et al 2018 xiao et al 2011 xue et al 2020 an important method to control the salinity buildup is to use a low diffusivity salt and mgcl2 was a promising draw solute to reduce the reversed salt flux achilli et al 2010 the impact of nacl and mgcl2 on the traditional aerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr has been deeply studied and mgcl2 was found with high economic technical advantage for the ombr achilli et al 2010 lebron et al 2021 wang et al 2016 however the influences of mgcl2 on the anombr were rarely studied there were only few previous studies about the impact of draw solute mgcl2 and main discovery focused on the relationship between mgcl2 concentration and methanogenic activity it was reported that excessive nacl or mgcl2 concentration caused higher ionic strength to finally cause plasmolysis and loss of activity of cells to cause cell death and methane production decline feng et al 2020 kargi and dincer 1996 zhao et al 2018 thus the main process of nacl or mgcl2 to affect the microbial activity and structure was to change the ionic strength to make inhibition based on the current studies however there were still multiple missing points about the impact of nacl or mgcl2 on other microbial species in the biofilm e g bacteria which needed further investigation in anombr the success of biological treatment of wastewater relies on microbial structure and functions salinity build up in the bioreactor can considerably affect the bacterial community structure of ombr several studies showed that almost the previously dominant species were replaced by halotolerant species due to salinity build up during the ombr operation luo et al 2017 qiu and ting 2013 wang et al and m j luján facundo found that the relative abundance of main phylum proteobacteria decreased as salt concentration increased due to salt inhibition while the relative abundance of another phylum bacteroidetes increased along with the increased reactor salinity lujan facundo et al 2018 wang et al 2017 similarly bacteroidetes was discovered to be more active in ombr than in the mbr luo et al 2017 therefore these results showed that the microbial species would change their abundance and activity to various salt concentrations however these studies only focused on the impacts of nacl on microbial relative abundance but this was not enough to analyze the function of each microbial taxon especially for rare studies focusing on mgcl2 more studies are needed to understand the impact of draw solute mgcl2 on microbial ecology of anombr in this study anombr were constructed with various draw solutes nacl and mgcl2 to investigate their impact on the microbial ecology and their relations with membrane fouling to give complete picture about the microbial structure difference high throughput sequencing heatmap factor analysis and phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens were applied together conductivity was set as the operational factor to trace the dynamic change of the microbial structure under the draw solute of nacl and mgcl2 and the relationship among the microbial species and parameters related to membrane fouling e g soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps was tracked under heatmap analysis furthermore pmens were used to identify the interaction patterns and ecological roles of co occurring taxa with huge contribution for wastewater treatment and membrane fouling wu et al 2016 this study was the first to give the complete picture of the dynamic change of microbial community under na and mg2 build up to perceive the effect of mgcl2 on the anombr microbial ecology and system performance which became the valuable guideline to refer to improve the future anaerobic wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation of anombr two laboratory scale anombr systems namely nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr were set up under the same operating conditions details of the anombr structure were reported in our previous study lee et al 2021 briefly continuous stirred tank reactors cstr of anombr had the working volume of 2 l with a side stream plate and frame fo module inside effective membrane area at 40 cm2 feed solution fs was the synthetic wastewater to simulate municipal wastewater and the components were described in supplementary information table s1 the toc nh3 n po4 p electric conductivity and ph of the feed solution were 165 5 mg l 45 2 mg l 5 0 0 2 mg l 1 1 0 1ms cm and 7 20 0 1 respectively the draw solutions for two systems were composed of 1 m nacl and 0 9 m mgcl2 respectively and a peristaltic pump was used to control the same initial flux of 8 55 0 5 l m 2 h 1 the inoculated sludge was taken from a beijing municipal wastewater treatment plant already acclimated in a 2 l fermentation flask fed with the synthetic wastewater for approximately 45 days at 35 0 5 c when the inoculated sludge achieved the toc removal efficiency at 90 the sludge was started to inoculate into the anombr the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 3 47 0 08 g l and 2 84 0 06 g l for both anombr respectively sludge was retained within the systems and hydraulic retention time varied depending on the water flux the produced biogas was collected through the gas sampling bags on top of the anombr the diluted ds solution was daily refreshed to minimize the effect of osmotic pressure reduction and electronic balances ms6002ts mettler toledo were used to weigh ds for the calculation of the volume change of the collected permeate over time fo membrane was also cleaned once the flux dropped to around 2 3 l m 2 h 1 for these two systems and the detailed cleaning procedures were described in supplementary information it should be noted that anombr were kept at a constant temperature of 35 0 5 c 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 mixed liquor characterization treatment performance was determined by the measurement of the multiple water parameters including toc nh4 n total nitrogen tn tp and other parameters for the biofouling related parameter measurement the extraction procedures for smp and eps were listed in the previous studies li and yang 2007 shen et al 2013 three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan was applied to characterize smp and eps under different conductivities and separation of the eem spectra were identified by parallel factor parafac modeling yu et al 2020 the fluorescence data were then modeled with the domfluor toolbox in matlab r2009a stedmon and bro 2008 the nonnegativity constraints split half and residual analysis was further performed to identify fluorescence components the maximum fluorescence intensities fmax r u were adopted to represent the relative level of each component 2 2 2 foulant layer characterization the fouled membrane was removed from the reactor and lyophilized in a freeze dryer fdu 1110 eyela japan at room temperature for 24 h for further analyses the membrane morphology and elemental composition of the fouling layer were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi s4800 japan and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher the u s respectively furthermore attenuated total reflection fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy atr ftir spectroscopy was used to analyze the organic functional groups of the fouling layer confocal laser scanning microcopy clsm lsm710 3 channel zeiss germany was used to analyze the distribution of microorganisms polysaccharides and proteins in the biofouling layer with the help of different fluorescence dyes details about the fluorescence dyes were shown in supplementary information 2 3 microbiological analysis 2 3 1 dna extraction and community analysis the fouling biomass attached on the fo membrane surface and bulk sludge samples inside the anombr were all taken out from the reactor and then all samples were pretreated based on the previous study huang et al 2008 then the all samples were processed by dna extraction pcr magnification and illumina sequencing analysis the operational taxonomic units otus could be obtained by using the uparse function within usearch to select the qualified otus for the following measurement and analysis edgar 2010 complete linkage clustering was applied to complete the alpha analysis to obtain the richness and diversity indices including the number of sequences observed species pd whole tree diversity indices and shannon diversity indices to analyze the characteristics of the microbial community wei et al 2020 the details were shown in supplementary information 2 3 2 cca and pmen analysis microbial communities of all samples were clustered based on abundances of families using the cluster analysis ca correlation analysis among microbial species and five parameters i e conductivity toc smp lb eps and sludge size and microbial community structure was performed using canonical correspondence analysis cca to indicate the microbial structure difference and the factorial influence on the dynamic change of the microbial structure the pearson indices and significant correlation of all the correlations among all five operational factors were calculated by r studio v 3 0 2 cca analysis also identified the environmental basis for community ordination from the original point by extracting the maximum relationship between the microbial community composition from all the samples and measured environmental variables calculated and performed with r studio v 3 0 2 heatmap analysis based on the pearson s method was applied to determine the relationship among the microorganisms and operational factors pmens were applied to determine the keynote species and evaluate their importance inside the microbial community and the detailed methods were based on the previous studies wang et al 2020 ya et al 2021 basically the correlation matrices in pmen analysis were based on the relative abundance of otu numbers and fast greedy modularity was applied to separate each network corresponding random networks were produced by the maslov sneppen method to compare with the pmens to determine relative significance of all networks maslov and sneppen 2002 statistical analysis of r square characteristics was used to identify small world property and modular structure of the networks telesford et al 2011 and the network result was obtained by gephi software webatlas paris france 3 results and discussions 3 1 water flux and salt accumulation the trends of water flux and cleaning frequency of the nacl and mgcl2 anombr was shown in fig 1 a both reactors began with nearly the same initial water fluxes of 8 5 0 5 l m 2 h 1 compared to the nacl anombr the flux decline was more evident in the mgcl2 anombr while a substantial lower salinity was achieved in the mgcl2 anombr than that of the nacl anombr the greater flux drop of fo membrane in the mgcl2 reactor was the result of more severe membrane fouling and internal concentration polarization icp tang et al 2010 xu et al 2010 the salinity build up in mixed liquor was indicated by the conductivity increase and the conductivity change was indicated by fig 1b the mixed liquor conductivity in nacl and mgcl2 anombr increased from 2 43 to 29 30 and 3 07 to 21 05 ms cm respectively along the operational period and the salinity in nacl anombr was much higher than that of the mgcl2 anombr owing to more reversed flux of nacl compared to mgcl2 hu et al 2017 the results confirmed the previous study that the small monovalent draw solutes e g na were highly mobile for larger reversed flux compare to divalent solutes e g mg2 and how mg2 lower conductivity caused more severe membrane fouling warrants the following investigation hu et al 2017 song et al 2018 3 2 process performance the concentrations of toc nh4 n and tp in the influent supernatant effluent and the removal rates in anombr system was shown in fig 2 and dynamic change of ph in bulk mixed liquor was indicated in supplementary information fig s1 both anombr achieved high overall removal rate of toc up to 98 the excellent removal performance of toc in the systems were attributed to the stable biological degradation and high rejection of fo membrane cath et al 2006 gu et al 2015 for the methane comparison small amout of methane was detected in mgcl2 anombr while there was no methane detected in nacl anombr fig s2 the details were shown in supplementary information similarly tp removal efficiency in both reactors were more than 98 figs 2c and d and supernatant concentration was lower in the mgcl2 anombr than nacl anombr the nh4 n concentration of supernatant in the nacl and mgcl2 anombr fluctuated in a range of 21 to 63 mg l and 43 mg l respectively figs 2e and f the concentration of nh4 in ds of mgcl2 was lower than that of nacl indicating higher fo rejection efficiency in mgcl2 anombr as explained by the donnan potential for maintaining the charge balance between the fs and ds sides more na diffused into the mixed liquor when nacl was used as the ds and this would cause more nh4 n passing through the fo membrane to ds side on the contrary less mg2 would pass through the fo membrane into the mixed liquor and thereby lower amount of nh4 n would diffuse back into the ds of mgcl2 anombr hu et al 2017 the trend of tn was the same as the nh4 n during the operational time fig s3 thus mgcl2 anombr showed slightly better nh4 and tn removal efficiency than nacl anombr 3 3 mixed liquor characterization 3 3 1 changes of smp and eps microorganisms respond to salt stress by increasing endogenous respiration with the secretion of smp and eps to protect themselves and thus the variations of smp and eps concentrations of both reactors could be related to membrane fouling fig 3 in nacl anombr smp concentration increased from 12 1 to 21 9 mg g mlvss along with the salinity increase but both lb eps and tb eps was nearly not affected by the conductivity on the contrary the smp concentration also increased from 17 9 to 27 2 mg g mlvss but apparent increasing trend of lb eps and tb eps concentration was discovered in mgcl2 anombr from 27 7 to 33 2 mg g and 15 4 to 21 3 mg g mlvss respectively indicating the high microbial ability for eps secretion it should be noted that the microbially produced smp would be degraded but the actual smp concentrations in both nacl and mgcl2 anombr were increased indicating the rejection of fo membrane to maintain smp concentration chen et al 2014 gu et al 2015 on the contrary a previous study indicated that the salinity accumulation could affect microbial activity to affect the change of eps concentration song et al 2018 the reason for higher eps concentration in mgcl2 anombr was possible because the eps were linearly related with the increasing dose of mg2 since mg2 could enhance biofouling due to their cationic bridges with eps to form a thicker biofouling layer achilli et al 2010 wang et al 2016 3 3 2 eem fluorescence spectra of smp and eps parafac modeling was applied to confirm four components for the entire eem spectroscopy to trace the relationship between smp and eps and conductivity the details of eem spectra to confirm the four components were described in the supplementary information and the result of four components was shown in fig 4 including humic like compounds c1 c2 tyrosine like protein c3 and tryptophan like protein c4 parafac analysis was able to reveal the fluorescence intensity f max of the four components in smp lb eps and tb eps to show their changing trend along the conductivity change for the analysis of smp the f max of humic like substances c1 c2 of smp generally showed a declining or unchanging trend while the proteins like substances c3 c4 showed an increasing trend along the salinity increase in nacl anombr fig 4 in the comparison in mgcl2 anombr the f max of c2 c3 and c4 of smp showed increasing trend along the conductivity increase fig 4 the previous work also confirmed the result that the fluorescence intensity of protein like substances of smp also increased along the conductivity increase in the anombr chen et al 2014 however for the analysis of eps f max of c1 c4 for lb eps and tb eps was declining in nacl anombr fig 4 in contrast the fluorescence intensities of c1 c4 of lb eps and tb eps exhibited the increasing trends along with the conductivity increase in the mgcl2 anombr specially the tyrosine like protein c3 was the primary component in smp and lb eps with the conductivity increase in mgcl2 anombr and thus tyrosine like protein might be the contributing matter for the membrane fouling overall the eem parafac findings of smp and eps revealed that more protein like matters emerged with the increasing mg2 level in mgcl2 anombr than nacl anombr 3 4 fouling layer characterization the sem analysis was processed for the surface morphology of the fouling layer the sem images of nacl anombr depicted the crystal like salt deposits scattered on the fouled membrane surface while the foulant layer was much more compact and thicker on the fouled membrane in the mgcl2 anombr fig s5 xps spectra was applied to reveal the elemental composition for material and the virgin cellulose triacetate membrane cta was found to mainly contain c and o fig 5 a for the fouled membrane the presence of high n content indicated the existence of organic fouling protein like foulants she et al 2016 it should be noted that much higher percentage of mg and ca was present on the fouled membrane in mgcl2 anombr indicating the contrition of mg and ca on the membrane fouling fig 5a and table s2 the fouling layer composition was further investigated by the atr ftir and clsm analyses the atr ftir spectra exhibited new absorption peaks at wave numbers of 3287 cm 1 ch or oh stretching on the fouled membrane of both reactors related to polysaccharide like substances fig 5b gu et al 2015 sun et al 2016b also the presences of adsorption peaks at 1643 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 were respectively related to amide group i co stretching and ii nh bending and cn stretching of protein substances on the membrane surface gu et al 2015 sun et al 2016b zhu et al 2016 furthermore the enhanced foulant peak of the mgcl2 fouled membrane indicated the more severe membrane fouling the clsm images also suggested that the content of microorganisms proteins and β polysaccharides were much more on the membrane surface in mgcl2 anombr fig 5c mainly indicating more deposition of biofoulants induced by mg2 introduction in the anombr to sum up these results indicated the occurrence of organic and biofouling in both nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr comparatively mgcl2 anombr had denser biofilm implying that mg2 was more prone to enhancing the deposition of the biofoulants polysaccharides and proteins on the membrane surface to make more severe biofouling condition 3 5 microbial analysis the dynamic change of the community composition could reflect the microbial reactions on the membrane surface since the changes of microbial composition had huge impact on the membrane fouling guo et al 2015 this part is to comprehensively show the microbial community change and demonstrate key species for the system performance alpha diversity analysis was the first step to generally evaluate the richness and evenness of the community structure in nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr the indices of observed species chao1 and pd whole tree could indicate their richness and evenness and all indices were shown in fig s6 the result showed that the species richness and evenness was stably maintained at higher level for the mgcl2 anombr fig s6 thus the microbial community on fo surface in mgcl2 anombr had higher species richness with high potential for membrane fouling problem more details of alpha diversity analysis were shown in supplementary information furthermore the dynamic change of the relative abundance of dominant species in anombr system could reflect the performance of species in the phylum level there were 17 dominant phyla to be detected and 5 phyla were dominant including proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes firmicutes and patescibacteria except for firmicutes other four phyla showed higher abundance in both anombr the phylum proteobacteria showed highest relative abundance 30 fig 6 a due to its strong organic degradation ability liu et al 2016 also other three phyla chloroflexi bacteroidetes and patescibacteria were commonly involved in anaerobic fermentation liu et al 2016 thus the high abundance of these phyla indicated that anombr systems worked efficiently to achieve wastewater treatment most importantly comparison of the abundance difference could reflect the impact of nacl and mgcl2 phylum proteobacteria was generally most dominant in all microbial samples e g at 40 55 fig 6a the relative abundance of proteobacteria in the supernatant increased from 25 to 45 in nacl anombr fig 6a mainly due to higher salinity in nacl anombr than mgcl2 anombr since higher salinity was reported to benefit halotolerant phylum proteobacteria chang et al 2019 thus high saline pressure in nacl anombr was suitable for proteobacteria on the contrary mgcl2 anombr was better environment for other four phyla due to their higher richness fig s6 for example chloroflexi had similar evolution characteristics with proteobacteria and had high synergistic relationship with other methanogens eduok et al 2017 fig 6a showed that the phylum chloroflexi had increasing relative abundance in mgcl2 anombr from 17 day 0 up to 30 day 14 along the operational time indicating its more and more important role in mgcl2 anombr however the lower relative abundance of chloroflexi in nacl anombr system indicated that chloroflexi did not have strong halotolerant ability thus the lower salinity of mgcl2 anombr was beneficial for chloroflexi also bacteroidetes and patescibacteria had higher favorability in the low saline environment for higher abundance in mgcl2 anombr e g bacteroidetes increasing from 24 to 28 at day 0 to day 14 in mgcl2 anombr higher than around 20 from day 0 to day 14 in nacl anombr fig 6a the reason was their cell vulnerability under the saline environment xia et al 2019 thus low salinity in mgcl2 anombr was better for high species richness direct microbial analysis on the fo membrane surface could indicated the contribution on the biofouling the highest relative abundance on the fo membrane in mgcl2 anombr was patescibacteria fig 6a it was reported that patescibacteria had ultra small cell size and pili like membrane structure to be enriched on the membrane surface to clog inside the membrane pores tian et al 2020 thus this study gave important hint that patescibacteria was worth investigation related to the membrane fouling under mg2 introduction 3 5 1 cca and heatmap analysis the relationship between parameters and the microbial structure could give direction to optimize the anombr performance in this study cca and heatmap analysis were applied as useful tools to graphically describe the difference between microbial structure and operational factors monte carlo permutation test was performed to confirm that cca analysis had nonrandom distribution the first and second axis of the cca figure explained 40 3 and 28 7 of the significant correlation factors fig 6b all microbial samples were demonstrated by the sample dots fig 6b three green circles in the cca figure indicated the clustering similarity of microbial samples denoted as original sludge nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr respectively fig 6b the clear separation of three green circles indicated their significant difference of microbial structure fig 6b indicating the impact of various environment on the microbial change however it should be noted that all the microbial samples were not drastically changed along the operational time based on the arrow of operational time fig 6b this showed the high microbial stability of the microbial structure the core of cca analysis was to indicate the impact of parameters the environmental vectors indicated the correlations between the microbial samples and operational parameters for example vector direction of time was completely reversed to the sludge size fig 6b indicating that sludge particle size would decrease due to the flushing and breakdown effect and thus the solution eps and smp increased due to the sludge breakdown to produce small particles furthermore all three environmental vectors including toc smp and lp eps pointed to the first quadrant directing towards the green circle of mgcl2 anombr indicating the highly positive correlations between these three factors fig 6b it should be noted that the arrow direction of conductivity was similar with the arrow direction of operational time fig 6b matching up the experiment process that both anombr reactors had higher and higher conductivity along the operational time also since nacl anombr had higher conductivity than mgcl2 anombr at the end of the experimental process day 28 thus the arrow direction of mgcl2 anombr was closer to sample points of s1 d28 instead of s2 d28 fig 6b however the cca analysis only provided general correlation analysis and the detailed correlation with certain microorganisms was lacked heatmap is to show the detailed correlation among operational factors and certain microorganisms the correlation strength could be reflected by the statistical method to determine positive or negative effect on the activity of the specific microorganisms the heatmap for the top 20 abundant families were shown in figs 6c and d and the overall summary was shown in tables s3 and s4 in the heatmap analysis the square color blue and red in this study indicated positive and negative relationship among the microbial species and set variables e g conductivity toc smp lb eps and sludge size in this study the reliability of the heatmap analysis pearson s method was supported by p value calculation and both heatmaps could achieve the standard p value 0 05 to support the high reliability for the relationship between the microbial species and external variables microbial correlation with the conductivity change was different between two anombr in nacl anombr only few families have high conductivity tolerance the heatmap indicated that only four families including burkholderiaceae syntrophaceae lentimicrobiaceae and enterobacteriaceae was positively related with the conductivity increase fig 6c and table s3 the reason was possible due to the stimulation of the high salinity to improve their extracellular electron transportation eet for example the family syntrophaceae was reported to have strong syntrophic ability with other bacteria to reduce sulfate by the electron transportation harb et al 2016 one genus of the family syntrophaceae syntrophobacteraceae was discovered to consume acetate to achieve the sulfur reduction through the conductive media for eet e g metal surface zhuang et al 2019 also other genera within the family syntrophaceae such as desulfomonile also had high eet ability to complete the redox reaction tender et al 2002 thus the high salinity in the nacl anombr might benefit these eet bacteria to become dominant lower salinity of mgcl2 anombr system caused the different microbial structure to make other microorganisms have the positive relationship with the conductivity including ns9 hydrogenphilaceae and pedosphaeraceae fig 6d and table s4 the relationship difference indicated the impact of draw solute on the microbial structure change and the microorganisms that were favorable to lower conductivity or mg2 could become dominant furthermore mgcl2 anombr had more severe biofouling condition than nacl anombr and thus the species with positive relationship with smp and eps concentration in the mgcl2 anombr would be potential contributors for the membrane biofouling koók et al 2019 analysis of the smp and eps change under mgcl2 anombr would be significant reference for the fouling analysis and the analysis details were shown below 3 5 2 mg2 introduction on membrane biofouling mg2 introduction in the anombr system would possibly inhibit the growth of smp favorable microorganisms and reduce their contribution on the biofouling in this study mgcl2 anombr actually had more families with positive relationship 15 families with smp than nacl anombr 8 families tables s3 and s4 however mg2 introduction into mbr system was reported to reduce the microbial smp production due to bridging effect to bind hydrophobic smp for smp aggregation to reduce biofouling arabi and nakhla 2009 thus since smp concentration was inhibited under mg2 the positive related microorganisms with the smp would also be inhibited under mg2 thus these positive related families with smp were not the main contributor for the membrane fouling such as lentimicrobiaceae carnobacteriaceae table s4 on the contrary mg2 introduction in the anombr system possibly stimulated the eps favorable microorganisms heatmap analysis indicated that mgcl2 anombr had fewer families 4 families with positive relationship with eps than nacl anombr 10 families tables s3 and s4 it should be noted that mg2 introduction was reported to stimulate the increase of eps concentrations attributed to the cation bridging of divalent cations with the eps arabi and nakhla 2009 thus the mg2 introduction could assist the growth of positive related families with eps to cause biofouling and thus all four families with positive relationship with eps including ns9 desulfobulbaceae pedosphaeraceae and burkholderiaceae were perceived as contributors on the eps secretion and membrane biofouling fig 6f and table s4 for example desulfobulbaceae had high eps secretion ability under complicated environment to cause membrane fouling ogawa et al 2020 overall the variation of microbial structure under two various draw solutes caused the variation of main functions and more eps favorable species under mg2 resulted in severe biofouling the heatmap analysis indicated these four key candidates on the biofouling condition of anombr and this discovery could serve as reference for the further relationship investigation 3 5 3 microbial abundance change affected by salinity in this study the dynamic change of the microbial abundance was traced under all conductivities in both anombr to directly reflect the impact of na and mg2 on the microbial activity top 20 families of the relative abundance were selected out several families could increase their abundance along the conductivity increase and these families could be perceived as the key families for the biofouling for example all four families including rhodocyclaceae solibacteraceae saprospiraceae and ignavibacteriaceae increased their relative abundance with the conductivity increase in both anombr the family rhodocyclaceae was found to increase its relative abundance from 15 to 34 and 9 to 15 in nacl and mgcl2 anombr respectively figs 7 a and b and it reflected its high adaptability in the anombr however the family rhodocyclaceae showed limited contribution on the membrane fouling in mgcl2 anombr due to its lower relative abundance 15 than nacl anombr 34 since more severe membrane fouling occurred in mgcl2 anombr the relatively smaller abundance increase of rhodocyclaceae in the mgcl2 anombr reversely indicated its minor contribution on the membrane fouling figs 7a and b thus rhodocyclaceae was inferred not to be contributor for the membrane fouling on the contrary other families including saprospiraceae ignavibacteriaceae and solibacteraceae showed their higher growth rate with the conductivity increase in mgcl2 anombr for example saprospiraceae was the common family to dominate the aerobic granules with high production of eps and smp in wastewater treatment tavana et al 2019 thus the significant abundance increase of saprospiraceae in both anombr indicated its contributions on the membrane fouling similarly another family ignavibacteriaceae could achieve eet to degrade the aromatic compounds and reduce sulfate for strong metabolism and growth rate ghosh and dam 2009 furthermore both of saprospiraceae and ignavibacteriaceae had higher relative abundance increase in mgcl2 anombr than nacl anombr figs 7a and b confirming their potential candidates for the membrane biofouling specially for another family solibacteraceae there were few researches to investigate its relationship with the membrane biofouling thus this study was also to give information to emphasize the relationship between solibacteraceae and membrane biofouling the relative abundance of other families with no change or decrease was also shown in supplementary information figs s7 and s8 and these families were perceived with limited relationship with the conductivity increase overall the combination of the heatmap analysis and abundance tracing could revealed three candidate families for the membrane biofouling including saprospiraceae ignavibacteriaceae and solibacteraceae 3 5 4 pmen to identify keystone populations only dependence on relative abundance was not enough to reveal all keystone species thus to further identify the keystone species in the anombr pmens were constructed to reflect the species interactions with other microbes the basic parameters of pmens of nacl and mgcl2 reactors were to indicate the characteristics of the microbial structures parameters in tables s5 to s7 and these parameters confirmed that both pmens were eligible to indicate the key species more detailed analysis of these parameters was described in supplementary information pmen analysis and z p plot classification were applied to select the module hubs network hubs and connectors to indicate the keystone species inside the microbial community figs 8 a and b totally 7 and 10 species were selected out from nacl anombr and mgcl2 anombr respectively figs 8c and d these species were candidates to affect the reactor performance and further investigation of these families were significant to discover their contribution on the anombr performance to assist the analysis of their contribution heatmap analysis was also applied to point out the relationship among these species and the operational parameters figs 8e and f z p plot could give the classification for all significant microorganisms and hubs in pmens were perceived as keynote species in the anombr in the nacl anombr f lentimicrobiaceae otu1076 was perceived as the only keystone species in the microbial community fig 8c tables s6 and s7 though the relative abundance of f lentimicrobiaceae was extremely low 0 08 the connectivity of this microorganism with other species confirmed its importance in the microbial structure it was previously reported that the family lentimicrobiaceae had the strong ability to surround other bacteria to assist their degradation of complex polysaccharides sun et al 2016a thus the family lentimicrobiaceae had high potential to affect the performance of nacl anombr and membrane fouling based on heatmap analysis lentimicrobiaceae had the negative relationship with the conductivity indicating that the high salinity caused by reversed salt flux of nacl would inhibit the growth of lentimicrobiaceae fig 8e thus the high salinity inhibition against lentimicrobiaceae might also inhibit the growth of other bacteria to release the biofouling and thus membrane fouling condition in nacl anombr was not as severe as that of mgcl2 anombr another microorganism o candidatus kaiserbacteria otu23 was also detected as the module hub in nacl anombr fig 8c tables s3 and s4 it should be noted that the relative abundance of o candidatus kaiserbacteria 1 04 was higher than lentimicrobiaceae due to its positive relationship with the conductivity fig 8e it was previously reported that other microorganisms in the same phylum such as candidatus cloacimonas acidaminovorans had syntrophic relationship with other methanogens to produce methane sieber et al 2012 thus the high abundance of o candidatus kaiserbacteria had high potential to benefit the methane production in the anombr furthermore due to low relative abundances of all other key species all under 0 25 table s7 o candidatus kaiserbacteria showed more significant impact on the methane production and membrane fouling in nacl anombr for the mgcl2 anombr more module hubs were discovered including g swb02 g anaerolinea two otus f saprospiraceae f ns9 two otus interestingly two otus of g anaerolinea and two otus of f ns9 were simultaneously discovered as keystone species fig 8d however two otus under the same classification had the opposite relationships with the conductivity fig 8d for example the genus g anaerolinea otu 208 and g anaerolinea otu 132 were both classified as the module hubs interestingly the genus anaerolinea otu 208 had the positive relationship with the conductivity while another genus anaerolinea otu 132 had the negative relationship fig 8d also these two taxa had the opposite relationship with the other parameters e g toc smp fig 8d thus the discovery indicated that various taxa even within the same classification would have various characteristics to behave in the anombr system thus the genus anaerolinea and the family ns9 could have various functions to connect other microorganisms to increase the microbial complexity under the effect of mgcl2 anombr similarly the detected otu 8 and otu 1702 in the family ns9 also had similar behavior and functions other two species f saprospiraceae and g swb02 were also spotted as important species in the mgcl2 anombr though these species had low relative abundance f saprospiraceae at 0 09 g swb02 at 0 20 respectively these microorganisms were at least to show important effect on the microbial structure thus their positive relationship with the conductivity and lb eps could be perceived as the important evidence to prove their high viability under mg2 to cause the membrane fouling overall this study was meaningful as the first study to dig out the candidates to make contribution for the membrane fouling and this study simultaneously gave complete picture about how multiple species performed and interacted in the anombr system 4 conclusion the study purpose was to simultaneously demonstrate the microbial ecology variance between nacl and mgcl2 anombr and discover the relationship between the keystone species and salinity buildup to affect the system performance and membrane biofouling the conclusion could be drawn as the following messages 1 draw solute of mgcl2 in anombr could cause less salinity and more severe membrane biofouling than the draw solute nacl 2 microbial analysis based on relative abundance comparison and correlation analysis indicated that proteobacteria was dominant phylum in nacl anombr while mgcl2 anombr had more complicated microbial structure including the key species of ns9 hydrogenphilaceae and pedosphaeraceae together to cause the membrane fouling 3 pmens demonstrated the microbial interactions in these two anombrs and discovered that the family lentimicrobiaceae was keystone species in nacl anombr while the genus anaerolinea and the family saprospiraceae were keystone species in mgcl2 anombr overall this study was the first to comprehensively show how nacl and mgcl2 affected the microbial structure and how the dynamic microbial change related the physicochemical parameters e g eps smp to affect the membrane

16399,bioretention systems are environmentally friendly measures to control the amount of water and pollutants in urban stormwater runoff and their treatment performance for inorganic n strongly depends on various microbial processes however microbial responses to variations of n mass reduction in bioretention systems are complex and poorly understood which is not conducive to management designs in the present study a series of bioretention columns were established to monitor their fate performance for inorganic n nh4 and no3 by using different configurations and by dosing with simulated stormwater events the results showed that nh4 was efficiently oxidized to no3 mainly by ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in the oxic media regardless of the configurations of the bioretention systems or stormwater conditions in contrast no3 removal pathways varied greatly in different columns the presence of vegetation efficiently improved no3 mass reduction through root assimilation and enhancement of microbial no3 reduction in the rhizosphere the construction of an organic rich saturation zone can make the redox potential too low for heterotrophic denitrification to occur so as to ensure high no3 mass reduction mainly via stimulating chemolithotrophic no3 reduction coupled with oxidation of reductive sulfur compounds derived from the bio reduction of sulfate in contrast in the organic poor saturation zone multiple oligotrophic no3 reduction pathways may be responsible for the high no3 mass reduction these findings highlight the necessity of considering the variation of n bio transformation pathways for inorganic n removal in the configuration of bioretention systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioretention nitrogen pollution nitrification saturation zone denitrification 1 introduction rapid urbanization has produced large areas of impervious surfaces e g parking lots paving roads buildings which greatly increase the intensity and volume of stormwater runoff and alter the hydrologic cycle of natural stormwater runoff in urban ecosystems du et al 2012 li et al 2009 liu et al 2014 after flowing over impervious

of the largest pollution sources of receiving environments e g drinking water systems rivers lakes oceans malmqvist 1983 takaijudin et al 2016 many effective strategies have been developed to manage stormwater runoff in order to minimize its negative impacts jefferson et al 2017 bioretention systems primarily consisting of a highly permeable filter medium i e porous sand and soil mixture with vegetation on top are one of the most promising strategies to control both stormwater runoff and pollution davis et al 2009 takaijudin et al 2016 after stormwater runoff enters the bioretention systems multiple processes co occur such as filtration precipitation adsorption and biological assimilation and transformation thus bioretention systems can retain a large amount of pollutants

et al 2009 smyth et al 2021 sun and davis 2007 tirpak et al 2021 however the removal of inorganic nitrogen especially no3 by bioretention systems fluctuated widely at both laboratory and field scales although many measures have been developed to improve n removal gold et al 2019 valenca et al 2021 for example vegetation is critical for media condition and can uptake n but its effect on n removal varied largely with plant species growth stages osman et al 2019 skorobogatov et al 2020 many types of organic substances e g wood compost biochar were also amended to stimulate no3 bioreduction but some of them resulted in high organic n release berger et al 2019 okaikue woodi et al 2020 further permanent saturation zones beneath were established to promote no3 bioreduction but sometimes exhibited little improvement on no3 and or total n removal cho et al 2009 zinger et al 2013 the removal of inorganic n primarily depends on microbial mediated n redox transformation processes which are traditionally thought to occur through stepwise nitrification nh4 no2 no3 and denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 fig s1 to convert inorganic n ultimately into gaseous n2 galloway et al 2004 igielski et al 2019 reisinger et al 2016 however microbial responses to specific niche modification in bioretention systems may be far more complex than regulation of nitrification denitrification empirically nitrifiers are chemoautotrophic aerobes need o2 but not organic substrate while denitrifiers are mainly heterotrophic anaerobes need organic substrates but not o2 thus the barren and aerated conditions in bioretention systems are conducive to the occurrence of nitrification but the removal of nh4 is temporary as its product is no3 but not to denitrification which makes microbial no3 reduction vital for n permanent removal in bioretention systems in recent years some unconventional microbial processes such as autotrophic no3 reduction with fe2 or reduced s as electron donors are newly discovered and found to play important roles in no3 reduction schaedler et al 2018 yang et al 2016b but their contribution in n removal is rarely recognized in bioretention systems osman et al 2019 furthermore some microbial groups may not be directly involved in n redox processes but they compete or cooperate with microorganisms related to n redox transformation which greatly affect no3 bioreduction for instance the bioavailability of different types organic substrates can strongly affect the activity of denitrifying bacteria and other microbial groups e g sulfate reducers methanogens which may account for the observed accidental by product emission such as organic n or ch4 in some bioretention systems bratieres et al 2008 halaburka et al 2017 iqbal et al 2015 however the effect of either the newly discovered denitrification pathways or the co existing microbial groups on n removal has never been explicitly investigated okaikue woodi et al 2020 therefore although emerging attention is being paid to the microbial n removal in bioretention systems most if not all previous studies provided basic microbial information such as the abundance or composition of nitrifiers denitrifiers chen et al 2013 morse et al 2018 norton et al 2017 waller et al 2018 there is still a lack of systematic and in depth investigation on the relationship between microbial mechanisms and n removal behaviors in different bioretention systems which greatly limits the improvement of treatment efficiency for n in stormwater runoff the objective of this study was to identify the underlying microbial mechanisms responsible for inorganic n nh4 and no3 mass reduction and transformation processes caused by different configurations of bioretention systems specifically a series of bioretention columns were established to compare the effects of media types and absence presence of vegetation and saturation zone fig 1 on the mass reduction of nh4 and no3 during various stormwater runoff dosing practices simulating different stormwater runoff size n concentration and antecedent intervals table 1 detailed information on inorganic n removal is discussed in a previous report li et al 2019 high resolution surveys of microbial abundance composition and potential function were conducted in the present work to explain the observed variation of inorganic n mass reduction the results provide fundamental and detailed microbial information on inorganic n mass reduction considering the variation of bioretention configuration characteristics and stormwater runoff conditions in the bioretention columns and also provide potential guides to achieve better n mass reduction efficiency in bioretention systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention column setup six groups of bioretention columns each in triplicate totally 18 fig 1 were constructed inside a greenhouse located in wuhan botanical garden china the basic configurations of the columns were detailed in the supplementary information four factors that may affect n mass reduction from stormwater runoff were considered in the configuration of bioretention columns and they were 1 media type 2 vegetation 3 saturation zone and 4 organic amendment specifically three types of media with different hydraulic conductivity were prepared by mixing different portions of river sand with local soil i e sandy loam sl 60 40 sand soil loamy sand ls 75 25 and sand s 90 10 tables s1 s2 chinese pennisetum pennisetum alopecuroides a popular landscape grass with strong roots was planted in the constructed bioretention columns except in the barren set lsnop the saturation zone was designed in two groups of columns with ls medium one without organic amendment ls sz and the other with 10 volume of poplar woodchips in the gravel of the draining zone ls sz c fig 1 2 2 dosing practices with synthetic stormwater runoff and chemistry measurements to monitor the n mass reduction by the constructed bioretention columns nine times of stormwater dosing runs with different conditions n levels precipitation sizes and antecedent intervals were sequentially conducted on all the columns according to the conditions listed in table 1 the same stormwater runoff prepared for each dosing practice was added into all the columns to compare the difference of n load reduction the synthetic stormwater runoff was prepared from dechlorinated tap water that was supplemented with different n concentrations to simulate low middle and high nutrient pollution levels 3 6 9 mg l nh4 no3 according to the n level of the stormwater runoff monitored from wuhan shanghai and chongqing city china li et al 2019 although particulate or dissolved organic n are also among the main species of n pollutants in stormwater runoff and may significantly affect n removal in bioretention systems their bio transformation processes are quite different from inorganic n as they need to be first transformed into inorganic n through microbial degradation and ammonification thus this study was focused on the behaviors of inorganic n instead of organic n at each concentration level three runs were performed to simulate small middle and heavy precipitations in wuhan 5 10 and 15 l corresponding to 7 5 15 and 22 5 mm rainfall respectively considering a bioretention area ratio of 10 1 and different antecedent intervals 3 6 and 12 days determined based on the averagely 6 day interval of local storm events with rainfall 5 mm li et al 2019 during each stormwater runoff dosing event volumes of influent and effluent water were quantified concentrations of n species total n dissolved n nh4 no2 no3 p species total p dissolved p po4 3 sulfate so4 2 ph dissolved oxygen do level oxidation reduction potential orp and conductivity in the influents and effluents were determined as detailed in the supplemental information at the completion of the experiment the aboveground plant biomass of each column was collected and the content of organic n was determined the water quality data presented here were collected as part of a larger study reported earlier li et al 2019 in the earlier study 18 additional stormwater runoff events were dosed and n speciation and mass removals were evaluated based on the column configurations 2 3 definition of mass reduction of nutrients by the bioretention columns in order to assess the mass reduction of nutrients including n species total n dissolved n nh4 no2 no3 p species total p dissolved p po4 3 and so4 2 in each column during each dosing experiment the mass reduction was calculated as follows 1 m in c in v in 2 m out c out v out 3 m red m in m out 4 e red m in m out m in where cin and cout represented the average concentration of nutrient in the inflow and outflow during each dosing run respectively the concentration data were analyzed using minitab v 21 1 with the nonparametric survival analysis method to deal with those under detection limits vin and vout were the input and output stormwater volume respectively min and mout indicated the total nutrient mass in the inflow and outflow respectively mred denoted the mass reduction during each stormwater runoff dosing experiment while e red represented the mass reduction ration compared to the input load 2 4 sampling for microbial and chemical analyses one week after the 9th dosing run the media and saturation zone waters in the bioretention columns were collected for microbial analysis in each column triplicate cores of media 1 5 cm in diameter 45 cm in length and about 15 cm away from each other were collected aseptically and sectioned into nine samples 5 cm each the resulting triplicate samples of the same depth in each column were homogenized and divided into two parts for microbial and n content analyses respectively the biomass for microbial analysis in the water from saturation zone was collected by filtering 200 250 ml water through 0 2 μm pore size membranes polycarbonate 25 mm diameter whatman usa in triplicate samples were kept at 4 c in the field 1 d and then stored at 80 c for microbial analysis and 4 c for n measurements in the lab until further analysis contents of nh4 no2 no3 and total n in the media were measured as detailed in the supplemental information 2 5 microbial analysis genomic dna was extracted from weighed media samples 0 5 g 160 samples in total or biomass containing filter membranes for the saturation zone water 18 samples in total using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals oh usa according to the manufacturer s instruction dna concentration and quality were assessed by using a nanodrop nd 1000 uv vis spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies de usa 2 5 1 quantification of n related functional genes the abundances of key functional genes for n redox processes as sketched in fig s1 were quantified by quantitative pcr qpcr the tested genes included amoa genes in ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea aob and aoa respectively for aerobic nh4 oxidation hzo and hzs genes in anammox for anaerobic nh4 oxidization nirs and nosz in denitrifiers for no2 no and n2o n2 respectively and nrfa gene for no2 reduction into nh4 the primer sets and pcr amplification conditions followed the corresponding studies listed in table s3 experimental details of qpcr determination are provided in the supplemental information 2 5 2 pyrosequencing and data processing microbial compositions in the media and saturation zone water of the bioretention columns were analyzed by high throughput pyrosequencing of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna genes on an illumina miseq platform the pyrosequencing preparation and data processing details are provided in the supplemental information and in table s4 in order to identify potential microbial ecological functions in the bioretention columns potential metabolic functions were annotated from the obtained bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna gene otu representative sequences with the use of the faprotax functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa www zoology ubc ca louca faprotax pipeline louca et al 2017 2016 the distribution of annotated otus and reads are detailed in tables s4 s5 2 6 statistical analysis alpha diversity indices chao1 and shannon were calculated at the 97 cutoff in the qiime pipeline caporaso et al 2010 non metric dimensional scaling nmds ordinations were created based on the bray curtis distance of the core otu composition at the 97 cutoff to determine microbial community structure similarity among the samples pairwise analysis of similarity anosim was performed to test for any significant similarity dissimilarity in community composition or water geochemistry between different bioretention columns with p and r values assessing the significance indicator taxa analysis at the otu level was further performed to identify the specific bacterial archaeal groups that were significantly affected by the configuration of bioretention systems using the r package indicspecies http cran r project org web packages indicspecies index html the metamds and envfit functions vegan package in the r software were used to display the correlations between microbial diversity and geochemical variables spearman tests were performed to confirm the correlations between microbial groups and environmental variables pairwise correlation analysis was performed between the tested functional genes abundances and geochemical variables in the media with the use of the past software v3 4 0 hammer et al 2009 3 results 3 1 biogeochemistry for n mass reduction affected by the configurations of the bioretention columns the n mass reduction in the bioretention systems for the nine stormwater runoff doses closely matched those of long term observation totally 27 doses as noted in our previous report li et al 2019 specifically all the bioretention columns were able to effectively retain incoming nh4 95 in concentration and mass fig s2a table s6 suggesting that nh4 mass reduction was not associated with bioretention designs or stormwater runoff conditions in contrast no3 mass reduction varied substantially and was enhanced both by the presence of plants and saturated zones as well as by the stormwater runoff volume fig 2 a table s7 spearman s p 0 001 the improvement in no3 mass reduction in the saturated columns ls sz and ls sz c was expected as do and orp in the effluents were much lower especially in the woodchip amended counterpart fig 2b c which favored anaerobic biological processes however it should be noted that so4 2 in the input stormwater was only strongly reduced in the ls sz c columns fig 2d indicating that the redox condition therein was low enough for microbial reduction of so4 2 much lower than that of no3 reduction overall the physicochemical properties of stormwater runoff changed greatly during transport through the saturated columns fig s2 detailed in table s6 especially through the woodchip amended ls sz c columns in contrast the do and orp of the effluent from the planted columns without saturation zones ls s sl were similar to those from the unplanted columns lsnop fig 2b c indicating that non reducing conditions developed in the bulk media even so it still leaves open possibility of micro zones of reductive conditions in the vegetation rhizosphere thus the microbial mechanisms for n mass reduction improvement by vegetation and stormwater runoff should be quite different from each other the residual n nh4 no3 and tn in the media of bioretention systems was determined after the ninth dosing contents of nh4 and tn were closely related to the sand soil ratio of different media type and increased with the relative abundance of soil in the media they were highest in the sl with 40 soil columns the lowest in s with 10 soil and similar in the four columns with the ls media fig s3a and b in contrast no3 contents showed a similar vertical decreasing trend from top to bottom in all the columns fig s3c compared with the contents of nh4 and no3 in the original media table s2 nh4 in the media increased significantly while no3 decreased greatly after nine dosing practices this may be due to the different adsorption behaviors of nh4 and no3 on the media particles i e more nh4 was adsorbed on the media while no3 was constantly washed off or consumed 3 2 n related microbial functional gene abundance the tested key functional genes for aerobic nitrification aob and aoa amoa were found in the column media while the anammox functional genes were under the detection limit 100 copies g dry soil in the solid media or the water of the saturation zone indicating that most if not all nh4 was oxidized aerobically fig s1 of the functional genes related to denitrification or no3 reduction nirs and norz genes were detected in all the samples while the nrfa gene was under the detection limit 100 copies g dry soil in most samples indicating that no3 removal into gases e g n2o n2 was mainly achieved by denitrification fig s1 in the media the abundance of aob amoa genes 2 104 6 4 106 copies g dry soil decreased by 10 100 times from top to bottom in all the columns fig 3 a which was positively correlated with the decrease of no3 in the media table s8 the amoa gene abundance of aoa 4 3 105 3 7 106 copies g dry soil fig 3b was slightly higher than that of aob and showed minimal top down decrease only slightly lower at the bottom statistical analysis revealed that the aoa amoa gene abundance was positively correlated with the contents of nh4 and tn table s8 that were highly dependent on the medium type neither aoa nor aob amoa gene abundance was affected by the presence absence of vegetation or saturation zone pairwise anova p 0 05 the abundances of nirs and nosz genes ranged 1 1 106 6 5 106 and 3 3 103 5 2 104 copies g dry soil respectively fig 3c and d and they significantly differed with the absence presence of vegetation pairwise anova p 0 05 between ls and lsnop and were the lowest in the lsnop columns the nirs and nosz gene abundances were slightly positively correlated with the tn contents related to the medium type but strongly correlated with each other table s8 suggesting that most denitrifiers containing nirs and nosz genes shared similar population and or similar niche adaptation in the studied columns in addition a positive correlation was observed between the abundances of the aoa amoa and denitrifying genes likely because they shared some similar physiological properties such as tolerance of low oxygen in the water of the saturation zone the woodchip amendment significantly stimulated the growth of denitrifiers especially those with nirs genes and aoa suggesting organic matter addition can greatly improve the efficiency of no3 removal in the water of saturation zone and aoa have better adaptability than aob under the condition of high organic matter content and strong reductive conditions aob amoa genes were extremely low in saturation zone fig 3 3 3 microbial composition and diversity in the upper solid media proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant bacteria and thaumarchaeota were the most abundant archaea in all the columns fig s4 however microbial community compositions were quite different in columns with different media i e in s sl and ls bonferroni corrected anosim p 0 005 fig 4a and b microbial diversity as indicated by chao1 and shannon indices was also affected by the medium type for example bacteria were most diverse in the ls columns while archaea were most diverse in the s columns fig s5 the significant influence of medium type on microbial composition may be expected because different indigenous microbial communities were developed in the original soil and sand and different portions of soil and sand were mixed in the three media table s2 consistently a significant correlation was observed between the nh4 content controlled by medium type and microbial composition spearman s p 0 05 fig 4 c and d the microbial communities were significantly anosim p 0 005 different between the lsnop columns and the planted ls medium columns i e ls ls sz ls sz c fig 4 indicating that vegetation significantly affected microbial compositions in the bioretention columns with the same medium the bacterial diversity in the lsnop columns was also significantly higher than in the ls columns pairwise anova p 0 001 but this trend was not observed for archaea fig s5 in contrast the microbial compositions in the three types of planted ls medium columns i e ls ls sz ls sz c were quite similar indicating that the saturation zone installation had little impact on the microbial community in the upper media although the medium type and vegetation had significant effects on the microbial compositions in the columns different species responded to the observed microbial difference as indicated by the indicator species analysis in addition to the microbial variations among the columns with different designs the bacterial and archaeal community compositions in each column also exhibited an apparent shift from top to bottom which was significantly correlated with the vertical decrease of no3 in the medium spearman s p 0 05 fig 4c and d the archaeal diversity also increased with the increasing depth of the matrix fig s5b d f thus the dosing of inorganic n in the bioretention systems appears to affect both the n redox microbial functional groups and the overall microbial communities in the media the microbial compositions in the saturation zone water were largely different from that in the upper solid media and were significantly and largely affected by woodchip amendment bonferroni corrected anosim p 0 001 fig 4a and b for example in the ls sz water the predominant bacteria and archaea were od1 and parvachaea respectively in contrast with the dominance of betaproteobacteria and methanomicrobia in the ls sz c water fig s3 the microbial diversity in the saturation zone water was also strongly affected by the woodchip amendment for example in the ls sz columns both bacterial and archaeal diversity in the saturation zone water were comparable to or even higher than in the upper solid media in contrast an opposite trend was observed in the woodchip amended saturation zone water ls sz c fig s5 also saturation zone installation slightly reduced the bacterial diversity in the upper solid media fig s5a and b probably because it changed the wettability of the media 3 4 microbial function prediction in the media most of the dominant annotated microbial metabolic functions were nitrification mainly no2 oxidation in bacteria and nh4 oxidation in archaea and denitrification fig 5 a b d and e see details in table s5 bacterial nitrification showed an apparent top down decrease in all the columns fig 5a and the ammonium nitrite oxidizing bacteria were positively corrected with the no3 content table s9 which was similar to the trend found in aob amoa gene abundance fig 3a in contrast bacterial denitrification only increased significantly with depth in the non vegetated columns lsnop but not in the planted columns fig 5b suggesting that plant roots may impose more uniform conditions for denitrification in the medium archaeal nitrification however was dominant in the media of all the columns fig 5d which was also similar to the trend of aoa amoa gene abundances fig 3b archaeal denitrification was quite low in most columns fig 5e in the saturation zone water bacterial and archaeal metabolic pathways were completely different from that in the upper solid media and were also changed by the woodchip amendment in the saturation zone water amended with woodchip ls sz c oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds e g sulfide sulfur and methanogenesis became the most abundant bacterial and archaeal functional groups respectively fig 5c and f while traditional n nitrification and denitrification were very low in the saturation zone water without woodchips ls sz archaeal nh4 oxidation and no3 reduction were substantially abundant fig 5d and e but the annotated archaea only contained 2 3 of total archaeal reads table s4 bacterial nitrification or denitrification were also quite low fig 5a and b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of microbial processes in media and saturation zone and plant assimilation on n mass reduction through pairwise comparison of the n mass balance in ls based columns i e lsnop ls ls sz and ls sz c rough evaluation was performed on the relative contributions of plant assimilation and microbial processes in media and in saturation zone to the mass reduction of inorganic nitrogen during each dosing experiment for example our one year monitoring experiment showed that other possible non microbial processes e g media adsorption evaporation contributed little 4 to n mass reduction li et al 2019 which indicates that microbial transformation in the media is the main way to remove the input n in lsnop columns thus microbial metabolism in the media contributed 4 5 69 4 of n mass reduction in lsnop media according to the calculated mass reduction ration ered in lsnop fig 2a table s10 and seemed to be stimulated by high n concentration spearman s r 0 05 table s11 plant assimilation mainly resulted in higher efficiency of n mass reduction in the ls columns than in lsnop columns although plant roots may stimulate microbial denitrification to be discussed below in 4 3 1 thus the difference in n mass reduction between ls and lsnop columns represented the rough contribution of plant assimilation to n removal in the media the results suggested that plant assimilation was strong at the beginning but decreased later table s10 which may be due to decreasing n demand when plants became mature negatively correlated with plant growth days spearman s r 0 05 table s11 assuming that the growth of plants was similar in the bioretention columns with ls sz ls sz c and without ls saturation zone the contribution of microbial reduction of no3 to n mass reduction in the saturation zone can be roughly estimated it was found that the two types of saturation zones with or without woodchip amendment had similar contributions to n mass reduction during most dosing runs table s10 and their contributions increased with larger water volume spearman s r 0 005 table s11 supporting their good capability to buffer oxygen flushing however it should be noted that the presence of the saturation zone may enhance plant growth by continuous water supply which may result in the underestimate of n assimilation by plants in ls sz and ls sz c so as to overestimate the contribution of microbial no3 reduction in the saturation zone in fact our long term monitoring found that the plant biomass produced in ls sz and ls sz c was higher than in ls columns li et al 2019 however as plant growth slowed down microbial roles in the saturation zone should become increasingly important gold et al 2019 valenca et al 2021 4 2 aerated media ensures efficient nh4 mass reduction nh4 was steadily retained in all the bioretention columns during each stormwater runoff dosing practice regardless of column designs or stormwater runoff conditions the highly efficient nh4 transformation in the well ventilated and aerated media should primarily occur via aerobic oxidation to no3 i e nitrification which was supported by the stable abundances of key nitrifying groups ammonium and nitrite oxidizing microorganisms such as aob aoa and nitrospirae in all the bioretention columns figs 3 and s4a thus although column designs such as media type or vegetation significantly altered the overall microbial communities it had little impact on microbial nh4 oxidation this is mainly due to the fact that small variations of key environmental factors will affect the nitrifiers among different columns for example oxygen ph temperature and nh4 concentration are commonly the strongest environmental driving factors for the development of different ammonia oxidizers lehtovirta morley 2018 stahl and de la torre 2012 but these factors varied little among different columns when the stormwater runoff dosing was the same thus the stability of nitrifying groups such as their abundance and composition is more important than the overall microbial community and it can be employed to predict the mass reduction of nh4 in bioretention systems the high efficiency of nh4 nitrification in the studied bioretention columns can be attributed to the recessive synergism of different nitrifying groups in the media typically nh4 is oxidized to no3 through two successive steps i e oxidation to no2 by aob aoa and then to no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with the first step being the rate limiting step of nitrification alternatively nh4 can be completely oxidized to no3 by a single species of nitrospira a traditionally known nob genus known as the comammox short for complete ammonia oxidation pathway daims et al 2015 kits et al 2017 van kessel et al 2015 among these nitrifying microorganisms aob usually show more active ammonium oxidation potential than aoa in nitrogen rich habitats di et al 2009 verhamme et al 2011 while aoa have higher affinity for nh4 and thus are more suitable under relatively harsher conditions e g low nh4 and o2 acidic ph gubry rangin et al 2011 martens habbena et al 2009 in contrast the comammox bacteria can energetically and kinetically outcompete the canonical two step nitrification hu and he 2017 such different responses of these groups to nh4 are key to understanding of the observed nh4 oxidation in bioretention systems in response to the addition of nh4 rich stormwater runoff aob and comammox should both substantially contribute to the fast nh4 oxidation in the media this hypothesis is supported by the observed strong positive correlation between the nitrifying bacteria and the no3 content from the top to the bottom in all the columns tables s8 s9 after most of the nh4 was consumed the residual low concentration of nh4 was further oxidized by aoa this premise is supported by the stable and high abundances of aoa in all the columns of course caution should be taken when functions are deduced from microbial abundance however this hypothesis can at least provide some insights into the roles of these nitrifiers in nh4 removal further investigation on the competitive and cooperative dynamic processes among different aerobic nh4 oxidizing groups i e aob aoa and nitrospira may help to ensure more stable nh4 mass reduction under different stormwater runoff flushing conditions in addition to the abovementioned aerobic processes microbial anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox i e oxidation of nh4 with no2 as an alternative electron acceptor was regarded as an alternative pathway for nh4 oxidation in the anoxic sections of bioretention systems in some previous studies sun et al 2017 however no anammox microorganisms were detected in the media or saturation zones suggesting that anammox processes do not significantly contribute to the oxidation of nh4 in the bioretention systems which agrees with a previous study coban et al 2015 anammox may not be important due to the lack of substrates no2 and nh4 in the saturation zone because nh4 was completely oxidized to no3 in the upper oxic media and no2 produced by partial denitrification of no3 was not produced in the hypoxic saturation zone therefore aerobic microbial oxidation appears to be the major pathway for nh4 transformation in the media of the columns in brief our results indicate that suitable medium conditions such as good ventilation and low organic content are more important than configurations e g vegetation or medium types of the bioretention columns for efficient nh4 removal and transformation by aerobic nitrifiers 4 3 different microbial mechanisms for no3 mass reduction enhanced by vegetation and saturation zone in contrast to the efficient nh4 oxidation in the oxic and barren media no3 input and nh4 oxidation product reduction was strongly depressed in the same media without the aid of vegetation or saturation zone lsnop columns in general a series of microbial reduction processes no3 no2 no n2o n2 are required to completely remove no3 these processes are generally carried out under anaerobic conditions and the enzymes that catalyze each step successively become more sensitive to o2 i e nosz for n2o n2 is less o2 tolerant than nirs for no3 no2 tiedje 1988 zumft 1997 however most denitrifiers are facultative bacteria that can use o2 or no3 as alternative electron acceptors to survive supported by the high abundance of nirs and nosz genes in the media fig 4c and d furthermore denitrifying enzymes even the most o2 sensitive nosz have been found to be successively expressed and active in aerobic anoxic environments guo et al 2014 marchant et al 2017 qu et al 2016 and confirmed in many isolates and microbiota coban et al 2015 he et al 2016 ji et al 2015 this explains the observation that a portion of no3 was still removed even in some dosing events of the lsnop columns especially when stormwater runoff volumes were small o2 load was relatively low fig 2a i e weak aerobic denitrification may have occurred in the media however in the bioretention columns with vegetation and saturation zone no3 mass reduction was greatly improved but the corresponding microbial mechanisms are quite different as discussed below 4 3 1 vegetation improves microbial no3 reduction in aerobic media the mass reduction of no3 in the vegetated bioretention columns without saturation zone was significantly higher than that of the barren ones lsnop during each stormwater runoff dosing suggesting that vegetation significantly improved no3 mass reduction in the whole aerobic media this enhancement may be achieved via two ways direct uptake by plants table s10 and enrichment of microbial denitrification activity morse et al 2018 in the early stage of vigorous growth plants can absorb substantial no3 nh4 as nutrients as discussed above 4 1 and observed in previous studies lucas and greenway 2008 read et al 2008 this may account for the more efficient removal of tn in the first several dosing practices in ls compared to lsnop in contrast in the late stages the last several dosing practices the mature grasses did not require as much n as in the early stage the vegetated columns still exhibited high performance for n mass reduction which should be attributed to the promotion of plant roots on microbial no3 removal indeed the planted ls columns developed significantly different microbial communities from the lsnop columns this finding was consistent with previous studies philippot et al 2013 zuo et al 2020 such consistency suggested that plant roots imposed considerable influence on microbiota even without changing the microbial composition or increasing the abundance of denitrifiers plant roots consume oxygen and secret organic exudates creating micro niches for denitrification more so than in the bulk media and promoting microbial denitrification in the rhizosphere henry et al 2008 kavehei et al 2021 in this study the abundance of key denitrifying functions nirs nosz was comparably high in the planted columns with different media s sl and ls fig 4 even though the microbial compositions therein were quite different indicating that the promoting effect of plants on denitrification may be primarily realized by increasing the activity of denitrifiers thus the roles of plants in bioretention systems lie not only in nitrogen uptake but also in the regulation of rhizosphere microbial activity and metabolism these observations indicate it is very important to consider the effect of rhizosphere microbe interactions on no3 mass reduction when selecting appropriate plants to construct bioretention systems this point awaits further investigation and is also of great significance to ensure the effective no3 mass reduction during plant dormancy 4 3 2 chemolithotrophic rather than heterotrophic no3 reduction in the organic rich saturation zone as demonstrated in this and previous studies the establishment of a reductive saturation zone is highly beneficial in ensuring high efficiency of no3 removal in bioretention systems however different from the previous understanding that heterotrophic denitrification accounts for no3 removal when supplied with organic substrates lopez ponnada et al 2020 tian et al 2019 our study revealed that unconventional no3 reduction pathways were also important to n mass reduction in the organic rich saturation zone in the context of our experiments in contrast to the high occurrence of annotated denitrifiers in the upper medium traditional denitrifiers were scarce in the woodchip amended saturation zone fig 5b and e but the abundances of nirs and nosz genes were high fig s3c and d this finding seems to be self contradictory however when closely examining the microbial composition we found that sulfur oxidation was the overwhelmingly predominant predicted bacterial function fig 5c carried out by only three species sulfurimonas sp 23 1 of total bacterial reads thiobacillus sp 2 6 and sulfuricurvum kujiense 0 9 table s5 interestingly these three species of bacteria are also chemolithotrophic denitrifiers figs 6 and s1 which couple no3 reduction with sulfur oxidation as shown below kodama and watanabe 2004 shao et al 2010 5 h s 8 n o 3 3 h 4 n 2 5 s o 4 2 4 h 2 o 5 s 0 6 no 3 2 h 2 o 3 n 2 5 so 4 2 4 h similarly in addition to reducing sulfur compounds other alternative electron donors like fe2 and h2 can also be used for nitrate chemolitho reduction di capua et al 2019 2 no 3 10 f e 2 12 h n 2 10 f e 3 6 h 2 o 5 h 2 2 no 3 2 h n 2 6 h 2 o these autotrophic denitrifying bacteria also contain putative denitrifying gene biomarkers such as nirs and nosz genes as in heterotrophic denitrifiers and found to contribute significantly to no3 removal in bioreactors soils and sewage dolejs et al 2015 yang et al 2016b 2012 this explains the high abundance of denitrifying genes nirs and nosz and the low content of heterotrophic denitrifiers in the woodchip amended saturation zone water however fe dependent no3 reduction is unlikely dominant in our studied bioretention columns because the iron content in the media is too low table s2 and there is no additional iron sources such as iron coated sands iron oxides in contrast so4 2 is one of the most abundant oxidants in stormwater runoff the content of so4 2 in rainwater depends on the level of air pollutants mostly ranging from tens to several ppm d aoust 2016 fitzgerald et al 2018 however after rinsing the impervious surfaces highly contaminated by human activities the content of so4 2 in rainwater runoff will increase greatly dozens to hundreds mg l zhang et al 2013 thus the content of so4 2 in most stormwater runoff is much higher than that of inorganic n may be 1 3 orders of magnitude higher and even higher than that of dissolved oxygen typically 6 14 mg l therefore the so4 2 level in the synthetic stormwater used in this study 28 41 mg l table s6 is comparable to that in urban stormwater runoff such abundant so4 2 ensures an effective supply of sulfur compounds formed by microbial so4 2 reduction for autotrophic no3 reduction another prerequisite for the occurrence of sulfur dependent no3 reduction is the low redox potential maintained in the woodchip amended saturation zone fig s2c for anaerobic microbial respiration using no3 fe3 so4 2 or co2 instead of o2 as electron acceptor heterotrophic denitrification usually occurs at the highest redox potential while methanogenesis requires the lowest redox potential kracke et al 2015 however the redox potential in the woodchip amended saturation zone was low enough to induce methanogenesis as the most dominant archaeal group fig 5f which may inhibit heterotrophic denitrification instead under such reductive conditions the abundant so4 2 in the stormwater runoff can be transformed to reduced s e g hs in ls sz c but not in other columns fig s2e because microbial so4 2 reduction occurs when the redox potential is slightly higher than that for methanogenesis in addition the degradation of organic s in woodchips can also release reduced s lepine et al 2016 as sulfur dependent no3 reduction can be effective in a wide range of s n ratio e g 0 3 6 dolejs et al 2015 yang et al 2016a 2016b the resulting reduced s serves as a preferential electron donor for no3 reduction under low redox potential therefore these findings suggested that chemolithotrophic denitrification i e sulfur dependent no3 reduction should play a vital role in the n transformation in the strongly reductive organic rich saturation zone of the tested bioretention columns but its pervasiveness in field bioretention systems still awaits further investigation notably low redox is mainly controlled by efficient microbial organic degradation that consumes most oxidants including heterotrophic nitrifiers and sulfate reducers while the bioavailability of different organic sources e g woodchip compost agriculture waste may vary significantly berger et al 2019 okaikue woodi et al 2020 however due to the limited information of microbial composition the specific regulation of organic matter sources on nitrate and or sulfate reducers in bioretention systems is not clear yet therefore it is vital to test the effect of organic types on microbial compositional variation and the n mass reduction in addition it is worth noting that strong degradation of organic matters may result in high emission of ch4 as an unwanted by product moorman et al 2010 warneke et al 2011 these findings shed light on possible future design strategies of saturation zone 4 3 3 unconventional no3 reduction in the organic poor saturation zone in the saturation zone without woodchip amendment microbial no3 reduction was more puzzling in the absence of additional organic matter the redox potential was not low enough for extensive so4 2 reduction to produce reduced sulfur fig s2c and e which would not favor the occurrence of sulfur dependent chemolithotrophic denitrification additionally the lack of organic substrate also constrained the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers fig 6b even if the redox potential was appropriate indeed neither known autotrophic nor heterotrophic denitrifiers were considerably recovered in the microbial community of the oligotrophic saturation zone fig s4 even so the efficiency of no3 mass reduction in the saturation zone without woodchip amendment was comparable to that with woodchip addition during most of the stormwater runoff dosing practices fig 2b although the abundance of nirs and nosz genes in the oligotrophic saturation zone were much lower than in the eutrophic saturation zone therefore some unconventional denitrification pathways may occur in the organic poor saturation zone the unconventional no3 reduction pathways in the oligotrophic saturation zone might include firstly no3 was transformed by no3 reducing archaea for example an archaeal otu affiliated with halobacteria halorubrum sp was annotated as the no3 reducer fig 5e halorubrum spp are capable of reducing no3 to no2 but did not grow during this process or conversion to nh4 for assimilation alcántara hernández et al 2009 cui et al 2007 kharroub et al 2006 nevertheless the halorubrum affiliated otu only accounted for 0 3 0 8 of total archaeal reads in the oligotrophic saturation zone with limited electron donors however how the reduction of no3 by archaea occurred and to what extent it promoted the removal of no3 still awaits further investigation secondly in the oligotrophic saturation zone the bacterial and archaeal groups without functional annotation were dominant and their metabolic characteristics were unknown they may play important roles in n redox processes in the studied bioretention columns for example candidate division od1 was the largest bacterial group in the studied oligotrophic saturation zone 35 5 of total bacterial sequences so far however this group has never been obtained in pure culture or enrichment so that it is impossible to know their physiological functions environmental genomic studies have shown that candidate division od1 bacteria may be involved in n respiration in suboxic water castelle et al 2017 solden et al 2016 finally aerobic denitrification may also take place more strongly in the oligotrophic suboxic water of the saturation zone as mentioned in the lsnop media this phenomenon has been previously reported in similar habitats such as coastal sediments and reservoir water marchant et al 2017 wang et al 2019 thus it is still an interesting problem to find efficient no3 reduction in the oligotrophic saturation zone although its key metabolic pathways need to be further studied this discovery suggested the complexity of biological n transforming processes which needs more detailed investigation in future study such as by 15n tracing experiments to determine the main groups of denitrifiers in oligotrophic saturation zone however the extension of plant roots in the saturation zone may also contribute significantly to the removal of no3 as a nutrient by n assimilation as discussed in 4 1 and 4 3 1 the cooperation competition between plant and microbial activities and their relative contribution to no3 removal in the saturation zone will vary with plant growth and stormwater conditions which will be an interesting aspect for further investigation nevertheless this discovery still helps to simplify the configuration of bioretention systems and reduce the possible negative environmental impact e g ch4 emission of organic amendments 5 conclusions the present study assessed the microbial mechanisms for transformation and mass reduction of inorganic n nh4 and no3 in constructed bioretention columns with different configurations the results revealed that aerobic nitrifying microbes e g ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria were capable of completely converting nh4 into no3 during stormwater runoff percolation in aerobic media independent of the column designs or stormwater runoff conditions fig 6a b thus the no3 transformation pathway is vital for the complete removal of inorganic n in stormwater runoff by bioretention systems for the ventilated bioretention media vegetation and saturation zone installation can both significantly improve no3 removal but their microbial mechanisms were quite different vegetation appears to enhance heterotrophic denitrification of no3 in the rhizosphere of the oxic media fig 6b therefore the benefits of vegetation on no3 removal can be vulnerable under unamiable stormwater runoff conditions especially in response to high o2 load caused by a large stormwater runoff volume in contrast the inclusion of a saturation zone created more stable reducing conditions which can buffer the high o2 load from stormwater runoff fig 6c d however the microbial processes of no3 reduction significantly varied depending on the specific physicochemical situation in the saturation zone under low redox potential sulfur dependent chemolithotrophic no3 reduction widely occurred in the organic rich saturation zone water fig 6d and multiple oligotrophic microbial no3 reduction pathways occurred in the organic poor saturation zone water fig 6c such unconventional no3 reduction pathways were accompanied by other microbial processes that may produce unexpected by products such as ch4 produced by methanogenesis our results suggest that in order to achieve efficient and stable nitrogen removal the variations of major n redox microbial processes especially for no3 reduction have to be considered in the bioretention systems which is vital for accurate prediction of n mass reduction performance in stormwater runoff treatments based on n mass balance observations several models have been developed to predict the impact of bioretention systems and stormwater runoff configurations such as organic amendment no3 loadings percolation time on no3 removal lynn et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 however most of these existing models do not consider the influence of microbial processes which is one of the most fundamental reasons for the variation of n mass reduction this work suggests that microbial no3 reduction such as heterotrophic or chemolithotrophic pathways is very important for the mass reduction of inorganic n in our constructed bioretention columns the relative contribution of different no3 bioreduction processes may be highly dependent on geochemical fluctuation such as redox potential range bioavailability and quality of alternative electron acceptors e g organic substrates reduced s compounds fe2 in the system therefore more investigations are needed in the field bioretention systems before a general model is drawn to better predict the behavior of inorganic n in summary this study provides some new insights into the n redox processes in bioretention columns at the laboratory scale and may provide some clues for the configuration of bioretention systems for no3 treatment in the future eqs 1 4 credit authorship contribution statement liuqin huang conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing junyue luo writing review editing

16399,bioretention systems are environmentally friendly measures to control the amount of water and pollutants in urban stormwater runoff and their treatment performance for inorganic n strongly depends on various microbial processes however microbial responses to variations of n mass reduction in bioretention systems are complex and poorly understood which is not conducive to management designs in the present study a series of bioretention columns were established to monitor their fate performance for inorganic n nh4 and no3 by using different configurations and by dosing with simulated stormwater events the results showed that nh4 was efficiently oxidized to no3 mainly by ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in the oxic media regardless of the configurations of the bioretention systems or stormwater conditions in contrast no3 removal pathways varied greatly in different columns the presence of vegetation efficiently improved no3 mass reduction through root assimilation and enhancement of microbial no3 reduction in the rhizosphere the construction of an organic rich saturation zone can make the redox potential too low for heterotrophic denitrification to occur so as to ensure high no3 mass reduction mainly via stimulating chemolithotrophic no3 reduction coupled with oxidation of reductive sulfur compounds derived from the bio reduction of sulfate in contrast in the organic poor saturation zone multiple oligotrophic no3 reduction pathways may be responsible for the high no3 mass reduction these findings highlight the necessity of considering the variation of n bio transformation pathways for inorganic n removal in the configuration of bioretention systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioretention nitrogen pollution

vegetation on top are one of the most promising strategies to control both stormwater runoff and pollution davis et al 2009 takaijudin et al 2016 after stormwater runoff enters the bioretention systems multiple processes co occur such as filtration precipitation adsorption and biological assimilation and transformation thus bioretention systems can retain a large amount of pollutants

et al 2009 smyth et al 2021 sun and davis 2007 tirpak et al 2021 however the removal of inorganic nitrogen especially no3 by bioretention systems fluctuated widely at both laboratory and field scales although many measures have been developed to improve n removal gold et al 2019 valenca et al 2021 for example vegetation is critical for media condition and can uptake n but its effect on n removal varied largely with plant species growth stages osman et al 2019 skorobogatov et al 2020 many types of organic substances e g wood compost biochar were also amended to stimulate no3 bioreduction but some of them resulted in high organic n release berger et al 2019 okaikue woodi et al 2020 further permanent saturation zones beneath were established to promote no3 bioreduction but sometimes exhibited little improvement on no3 and or total n removal cho et al 2009 zinger et al 2013 the removal of inorganic n primarily depends on microbial mediated n redox transformation processes which are traditionally thought to occur through stepwise nitrification nh4 no2 no3 and denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 fig s1 to convert inorganic n ultimately into gaseous n2 galloway et al 2004 igielski et al 2019 reisinger et al 2016 however microbial responses to specific niche modification in bioretention systems may be far more complex than regulation of nitrification denitrification empirically nitrifiers are chemoautotrophic aerobes need o2 but not organic substrate while denitrifiers are mainly heterotrophic anaerobes need organic substrates but not o2 thus the barren and aerated conditions in bioretention systems are conducive to the occurrence of nitrification but the removal of nh4 is temporary as its product is no3 but not to denitrification which makes microbial no3 reduction vital for n permanent removal in bioretention systems in recent years some unconventional microbial processes such as autotrophic no3 reduction with fe2 or reduced s as electron donors are newly discovered and found to play important roles in no3 reduction schaedler et al 2018 yang et al 2016b but their contribution in n removal is rarely recognized in bioretention systems osman et al 2019 furthermore some microbial groups may not be directly involved in n redox processes but they compete or cooperate with microorganisms related to n redox transformation which greatly affect no3 bioreduction for instance the bioavailability of different types organic substrates can strongly affect the activity of denitrifying bacteria and other microbial groups e g sulfate reducers methanogens which may account for the observed accidental by product emission such as organic n or ch4 in some bioretention systems bratieres et al 2008 halaburka et al 2017 iqbal et al 2015 however the effect of either the newly discovered denitrification pathways or the co existing microbial groups on n removal has never been explicitly investigated okaikue woodi et al 2020 therefore although emerging attention is being paid to the microbial n removal in bioretention systems most if not all previous studies provided basic microbial information such as the abundance or composition of nitrifiers denitrifiers chen et al 2013 morse et al 2018 norton et al 2017 waller et al 2018 there is still a lack of systematic and in depth investigation on the relationship between microbial mechanisms and n removal behaviors in different bioretention systems which greatly limits the improvement of treatment efficiency for n in stormwater runoff the objective of this study was to identify the underlying microbial mechanisms responsible for inorganic n nh4 and no3 mass reduction and transformation processes caused by different configurations of bioretention systems specifically a series of bioretention columns were established to compare the effects of media types and absence presence of vegetation and saturation zone fig 1 on the mass reduction of nh4 and no3 during various stormwater runoff dosing practices simulating different stormwater runoff size n concentration and antecedent intervals table 1 detailed information on inorganic n removal is discussed in a previous report li et al 2019 high resolution surveys of microbial abundance composition and potential function were conducted in the present work to explain the observed variation of inorganic n mass reduction the results provide fundamental and detailed microbial information on inorganic n mass reduction considering the variation of bioretention configuration characteristics and stormwater runoff conditions in the bioretention columns and also provide potential guides to achieve better n mass reduction efficiency in bioretention systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention column setup six groups of bioretention columns each in triplicate totally 18 fig 1 were constructed inside a greenhouse located in wuhan botanical garden china the basic configurations of the columns were detailed in the supplementary information four factors that may affect n mass reduction from stormwater runoff were considered in the configuration of bioretention columns and they were 1 media type 2 vegetation

bioretention columns nine times of stormwater dosing runs with different conditions n levels precipitation sizes and antecedent intervals were sequentially conducted on all the columns according to the conditions listed in table 1 the same stormwater runoff prepared for each dosing practice was added into all the columns to compare the difference of n load reduction the synthetic stormwater runoff was prepared from dechlorinated tap water that was supplemented with different n concentrations to simulate low middle and high nutrient pollution levels 3 6 9 mg l nh4 no3 according to the n level of the stormwater runoff monitored from wuhan shanghai and chongqing city china li et al 2019 although particulate or dissolved organic n are also among the main species of n pollutants in stormwater runoff and may significantly affect n removal in bioretention systems their bio transformation processes are quite different from inorganic n as they need to be first transformed into inorganic n through microbial degradation and ammonification thus this study was focused on the behaviors of inorganic n instead of organic n at each concentration level three runs were performed to simulate small middle and heavy precipitations in wuhan 5 10 and 15 l corresponding to 7 5 15 and 22 5 mm rainfall respectively considering a bioretention area ratio of 10 1 and different antecedent

bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna genes on an illumina miseq platform the pyrosequencing preparation and data processing details are provided in the supplemental information and in table s4 in order to identify potential microbial ecological functions in the bioretention columns potential metabolic functions were annotated from the obtained bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna gene otu representative

detailed in tables s4 s5 2 6 statistical analysis alpha diversity indices chao1 and shannon were calculated at the 97 cutoff in the qiime pipeline caporaso et al 2010 non metric dimensional scaling nmds ordinations were created based on the bray curtis distance of the core otu composition at the 97 cutoff to determine microbial community structure similarity among the samples pairwise analysis of similarity anosim was performed to test for any significant similarity dissimilarity in community composition or water geochemistry between different bioretention columns with p and r values assessing the significance indicator taxa analysis at the otu level was further performed to identify the specific bacterial archaeal groups that were significantly affected by the configuration of bioretention systems using the r package indicspecies http cran r project org web packages indicspecies index html the metamds and envfit functions vegan package in the r software were used to display the correlations between microbial diversity and geochemical variables spearman tests were performed to confirm the correlations between microbial groups and environmental variables pairwise correlation analysis was performed between the tested functional genes abundances and geochemical variables in the media with the use of the past software v3 4 0 hammer et al 2009 3 results 3 1 biogeochemistry for n mass reduction affected by the configurations of the bioretention columns the n mass reduction in the bioretention systems for the nine stormwater runoff doses closely matched those of long term observation totally 27 doses as noted in our previous report li et al 2019 specifically all the bioretention columns were able to effectively retain incoming nh4 95 in concentration and mass fig s2a table s6 suggesting that nh4 mass reduction was not associated with bioretention designs or stormwater runoff conditions in contrast no3 mass reduction varied substantially and was enhanced both by the presence of plants and saturated zones as well as by the stormwater runoff volume fig 2 a table s7 spearman s p 0 001 the improvement in no3 mass reduction in the saturated columns ls sz and ls sz c was expected as do and orp in the effluents were much lower especially in the woodchip amended counterpart fig 2b c which favored anaerobic biological processes however it should be noted that so4 2 in the input stormwater was only strongly reduced in the ls sz c columns fig 2d indicating that the redox condition therein was low enough for microbial reduction of so4 2 much lower than that of no3 reduction overall the physicochemical properties of stormwater runoff changed greatly during transport through the saturated columns fig s2 detailed in table s6 especially through the woodchip amended ls sz c columns in contrast the do and orp of the effluent from the planted columns without saturation zones ls s sl were similar to those from the unplanted columns lsnop fig 2b c indicating that non reducing conditions developed in the bulk media even so it still leaves open possibility of micro zones of reductive conditions in the vegetation rhizosphere thus the microbial mechanisms for n mass reduction improvement by vegetation and stormwater runoff should be quite different from each other the residual n nh4 no3 and tn in the media of bioretention systems was determined after the ninth dosing contents of nh4 and tn were closely related to the sand soil ratio of different media type and increased with the relative abundance of soil in the media they were highest in the sl with 40 soil columns the lowest in s with 10 soil and similar in the four columns with the ls media fig s3a and b in contrast no3 contents showed a similar vertical decreasing trend from top to bottom in all the columns fig s3c compared with the contents of nh4 and no3 in the original media table s2 nh4 in the media increased significantly while no3 decreased greatly after nine dosing practices this may be due to the different adsorption behaviors of nh4 and no3 on the media particles i e more nh4 was adsorbed on the media while no3 was constantly washed off or consumed 3 2 n related microbial functional gene abundance the tested key functional genes for aerobic nitrification aob and aoa amoa were found in the column media while the anammox functional genes were under the detection limit 100 copies g dry soil in the solid media or the water of the saturation zone indicating that most if not all nh4 was oxidized aerobically fig s1 of the functional genes related to denitrification or no3 reduction nirs and norz genes were detected in all the samples while the nrfa gene was under the detection limit 100 copies g dry soil in most samples indicating that no3 removal into gases e g n2o n2 was mainly achieved by denitrification fig s1 in the media the abundance of aob amoa genes 2 104 6 4 106 copies g dry soil decreased by 10 100 times from top to bottom in all the columns fig 3 a which was positively correlated with the decrease of no3 in the media table s8 the amoa gene abundance of aoa 4 3 105 3 7 106 copies g dry soil fig 3b was slightly higher than that of aob and showed minimal top down decrease only slightly lower at the bottom statistical analysis revealed that the aoa amoa gene abundance was positively correlated with the contents of nh4 and tn table s8 that were highly dependent on the medium type neither aoa nor aob amoa gene abundance was affected by the presence absence of vegetation or saturation zone pairwise anova p 0 05 the abundances of nirs and nosz genes ranged 1 1 106 6 5 106 and 3 3 103 5 2 104 copies g dry soil respectively fig 3c and d and they significantly differed with the absence presence of vegetation pairwise anova p 0 05 between ls and lsnop and were the lowest in the lsnop columns the nirs and nosz gene abundances were slightly positively correlated with the tn contents related to the medium type but strongly correlated with each other table s8 suggesting that most denitrifiers containing nirs and nosz genes shared similar population and or similar niche adaptation in the studied columns in addition a positive correlation was observed between the abundances of the aoa amoa and denitrifying genes likely because they shared some similar physiological properties such as tolerance of low oxygen in the water of the saturation zone the woodchip amendment significantly stimulated the growth of denitrifiers especially those with nirs genes and aoa suggesting organic matter addition can greatly improve the efficiency of no3 removal in the water of saturation zone and aoa have better adaptability than aob under the condition of high organic matter content and strong reductive conditions aob amoa genes were extremely low in saturation zone fig 3 3 3 microbial composition and diversity in the upper solid media proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant bacteria and thaumarchaeota were the most abundant archaea in all the columns fig s4 however microbial community compositions were quite different in columns with different media i e in s sl and ls bonferroni corrected anosim p 0 005 fig 4a and b microbial diversity as indicated by chao1 and shannon indices was also affected by the medium type for example bacteria were most diverse in the ls columns while archaea were most diverse in the s columns fig s5 the significant influence of medium type on microbial composition may be expected because different indigenous microbial communities were developed in the original soil and sand and different portions of soil and sand were mixed in the three media table s2 consistently a significant correlation was observed between the nh4 content controlled by medium type and microbial composition spearman s p 0 05 fig 4 c and d the microbial communities were significantly anosim p 0 005 different between the lsnop columns and the planted ls medium columns i e ls ls sz ls sz c fig 4 indicating that vegetation significantly affected microbial compositions in the bioretention columns with the same medium the bacterial diversity in the lsnop columns was also significantly higher than in the ls columns pairwise anova p 0 001 but this trend was not observed for archaea fig s5 in contrast the microbial compositions in the three types of planted ls medium columns i e ls ls sz ls sz c were quite similar indicating that the saturation zone installation had little impact on the microbial community in the upper media although the medium type and vegetation had significant effects on the microbial compositions in the columns different species responded to the observed microbial difference as indicated by the indicator species analysis in addition to the microbial variations among the columns with different designs the bacterial and archaeal community compositions in each column also exhibited an apparent shift from top to bottom which was significantly correlated with the vertical decrease of no3 in the medium spearman s p 0 05 fig 4c and d the archaeal diversity also increased with the increasing depth of the matrix fig s5b d f thus the dosing of inorganic n in the bioretention systems appears to affect both the n redox microbial functional groups and the overall microbial communities in the media the microbial compositions in the saturation zone water were largely different from that in the upper solid media and were significantly and largely affected by woodchip amendment bonferroni corrected anosim p 0 001 fig 4a and b for example in the ls sz water the predominant bacteria and archaea were od1 and parvachaea respectively in contrast with the dominance of betaproteobacteria and methanomicrobia in the ls sz c water fig s3 the microbial diversity in the saturation zone water was also strongly affected by the woodchip amendment for example in the ls sz columns both bacterial and archaeal diversity in the saturation zone water were comparable to or even higher than in the upper solid media in contrast an opposite trend was observed in the woodchip amended saturation zone water ls sz c fig s5 also saturation zone installation slightly reduced the bacterial diversity in the upper solid media fig s5a and b probably because it changed the wettability of the media 3 4 microbial function prediction in the media most of the dominant annotated microbial metabolic functions were nitrification mainly no2 oxidation in bacteria and nh4 oxidation in archaea and denitrification fig 5 a b d and e see details in table s5 bacterial nitrification showed an apparent top down decrease in all the columns fig 5a and the ammonium nitrite oxidizing bacteria were positively corrected with the no3 content table s9 which was similar to the trend found in aob amoa gene abundance fig 3a in contrast bacterial denitrification only increased significantly with depth in the non vegetated columns lsnop but not in the planted columns fig 5b suggesting that plant roots may impose more uniform conditions for denitrification in the medium archaeal nitrification however was dominant in the media of all the columns fig 5d which was also similar to the trend of aoa amoa gene abundances fig 3b archaeal denitrification was quite low in most columns fig 5e in the saturation zone water bacterial and archaeal metabolic pathways were completely different from that in the upper solid media and were also changed by the woodchip amendment in the saturation zone water amended with woodchip ls sz c oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds e g sulfide sulfur and methanogenesis became the most abundant bacterial and archaeal functional groups respectively fig 5c and f while traditional n nitrification and denitrification were very low in the saturation zone water without woodchips ls sz archaeal nh4 oxidation and no3 reduction were substantially abundant fig 5d and e but the annotated archaea only contained 2 3 of total archaeal reads table s4 bacterial nitrification or denitrification were also quite low fig 5a and b 4 discussion 4 1 effects of microbial processes in media and saturation zone and plant assimilation on n mass reduction through pairwise comparison of the n mass balance in ls based columns i e lsnop ls ls sz and ls sz c rough evaluation was performed on the relative contributions of plant assimilation and microbial processes in media and in saturation zone to the mass reduction of inorganic nitrogen during each dosing experiment for example our one year monitoring experiment showed that other possible non microbial processes e g media adsorption evaporation contributed little 4 to n mass reduction li et al 2019 which indicates that microbial transformation in the media is the main way to remove the input n in lsnop columns thus microbial metabolism in the media contributed 4 5 69 4 of n mass reduction in lsnop media according to the calculated mass reduction ration ered in lsnop fig 2a table s10 and seemed to be stimulated by high n concentration spearman s r 0 05 table s11 plant assimilation mainly resulted in higher efficiency of n mass reduction in the ls columns than in lsnop columns although plant roots may stimulate microbial denitrification to be discussed below in 4 3 1 thus the difference in n mass reduction between ls and lsnop columns represented the rough contribution of plant assimilation to n removal in the media the results suggested that plant assimilation was strong at the beginning but decreased later table s10 which may be due to decreasing n demand when plants became mature negatively correlated with plant growth days spearman s r 0 05 table s11 assuming that the growth of plants was similar in the bioretention columns with ls sz ls sz c and without ls saturation zone the contribution of microbial reduction of no3 to n mass reduction in the saturation zone can be roughly estimated it was found that the two types of saturation zones with or without woodchip amendment had similar contributions to n mass reduction during most dosing runs table s10 and their contributions increased with larger water volume spearman s r 0 005 table s11 supporting their good capability to buffer oxygen flushing however it should be noted that the presence of the saturation zone may enhance plant growth by continuous water supply which may result in the underestimate of n assimilation by plants in ls sz and ls sz c so as to overestimate the contribution of microbial no3 reduction in the saturation zone in fact our long term monitoring found that the plant biomass produced in ls sz and ls sz c was higher than in ls columns li et al 2019 however as plant growth slowed down microbial roles in the saturation zone should become increasingly important gold et al 2019 valenca et al 2021 4 2 aerated media ensures efficient nh4 mass reduction nh4 was steadily retained in all the bioretention columns during each stormwater runoff dosing practice regardless of column designs or stormwater runoff conditions the highly efficient nh4 transformation in the well ventilated and aerated media should primarily occur via aerobic oxidation to no3 i e nitrification which was supported by the stable abundances of key nitrifying groups ammonium and nitrite oxidizing microorganisms such as aob aoa and nitrospirae in all the bioretention columns figs 3 and s4a thus although column designs such as media type or vegetation significantly altered the overall microbial communities it had little impact on microbial nh4 oxidation this is mainly due to the fact that small variations of key environmental factors will affect the nitrifiers among different columns for example oxygen ph temperature and nh4 concentration are commonly the strongest environmental driving factors for the development of different ammonia oxidizers lehtovirta morley 2018 stahl and de la torre 2012 but these factors varied little among different columns when the stormwater runoff dosing was the same thus the stability of nitrifying groups such as their abundance and composition is more important than the overall microbial community and it can be employed to predict the mass reduction of nh4 in bioretention systems the high efficiency of nh4 nitrification in the studied bioretention columns can be attributed to the recessive synergism of different nitrifying groups in the media typically nh4 is oxidized to no3 through two successive steps i e oxidation to no2 by aob aoa and then to no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with the first step being the rate limiting step of nitrification alternatively nh4 can be completely oxidized to no3 by a single species of nitrospira a traditionally known nob genus known as the comammox short for complete ammonia oxidation pathway daims et al 2015 kits et al 2017 van kessel et al 2015 among these nitrifying microorganisms aob usually show more active ammonium oxidation potential than aoa in nitrogen rich habitats di et al 2009 verhamme et al 2011 while aoa have higher affinity for nh4 and thus are more suitable under relatively harsher conditions e g low nh4 and o2 acidic ph gubry rangin et al 2011 martens habbena et al 2009 in contrast the comammox bacteria can energetically and kinetically outcompete the canonical two step nitrification hu and he 2017 such different responses of these groups to nh4 are key to understanding of the observed nh4 oxidation in bioretention systems in response to the addition of nh4 rich stormwater runoff aob and comammox should both substantially contribute to the fast nh4 oxidation in the media this hypothesis is supported by the observed strong positive correlation between the nitrifying bacteria and the no3 content from the top to the bottom in all the columns tables s8 s9 after most of the nh4 was consumed the residual low concentration of nh4 was further oxidized by aoa this premise is supported by the stable and high abundances of aoa in all the columns of course caution should be taken when functions are deduced from microbial abundance however this hypothesis can at least provide some insights into the roles of these nitrifiers in nh4 removal further investigation on the competitive and cooperative dynamic processes among different aerobic nh4 oxidizing groups i e aob aoa and nitrospira may help to ensure more stable nh4 mass reduction under different stormwater runoff flushing conditions in addition to the abovementioned aerobic processes microbial anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox i e oxidation of nh4 with no2 as an alternative electron acceptor was regarded as an alternative pathway for nh4 oxidation in the anoxic sections of bioretention systems in some previous studies sun et al 2017 however no anammox microorganisms were detected in the media or saturation zones suggesting that anammox processes do not significantly contribute to the oxidation of nh4 in the bioretention systems which agrees with a previous study coban et al 2015 anammox may not be important due to the lack of substrates no2 and nh4 in the saturation zone because nh4 was completely oxidized to no3 in the upper oxic media and no2 produced by partial denitrification of no3 was not produced in the hypoxic saturation zone therefore aerobic microbial oxidation appears to be the major pathway for nh4 transformation in the media of the columns in brief our results indicate that suitable medium conditions such as good ventilation and low organic content are more important than configurations e g vegetation or medium types of the bioretention columns for efficient nh4 removal and transformation by aerobic nitrifiers 4 3 different microbial mechanisms for no3 mass reduction enhanced by vegetation and saturation zone in contrast to the efficient nh4 oxidation in the oxic and barren media no3 input and nh4 oxidation product reduction was strongly depressed in the same media without the aid of vegetation or saturation zone lsnop columns in general a series of microbial reduction processes no3 no2 no n2o n2 are required to completely remove no3 these processes are generally carried out under anaerobic conditions and the enzymes that catalyze each step successively become more sensitive to o2 i e nosz for n2o n2 is less o2 tolerant than nirs for no3 no2 tiedje 1988 zumft 1997 however most denitrifiers are facultative bacteria that can use o2 or no3 as alternative electron acceptors to survive supported by the high abundance of nirs and nosz genes in the media fig 4c and d furthermore denitrifying enzymes even the most o2 sensitive nosz have been found to be successively expressed and active in aerobic anoxic environments guo et al 2014 marchant et al 2017 qu et al 2016 and confirmed in many isolates and microbiota coban et al 2015 he et al 2016 ji et al 2015 this explains the observation that a portion of no3 was still removed even in some dosing events of the lsnop columns especially when stormwater runoff volumes were small o2 load was relatively low fig 2a i e weak aerobic denitrification may have occurred in the media however in the bioretention columns with vegetation and saturation zone no3 mass reduction was greatly improved but the corresponding microbial mechanisms are quite different as discussed below 4 3 1 vegetation improves microbial no3 reduction in aerobic media the mass reduction of no3 in the vegetated bioretention columns without saturation zone was significantly higher than that of the barren ones lsnop during each stormwater runoff dosing suggesting that vegetation significantly improved no3 mass reduction in the whole aerobic media this enhancement may be achieved via two ways direct uptake by plants table s10 and enrichment of microbial denitrification activity morse et al 2018 in the early stage of vigorous growth plants can absorb substantial no3 nh4 as nutrients as discussed above 4 1 and observed in previous studies lucas and greenway 2008 read et al 2008 this may account for the more efficient removal of tn in the first several dosing practices in ls compared to lsnop in contrast in the late stages the last several dosing practices the mature grasses did not require as much n as in the early stage the vegetated columns still exhibited high performance for n mass reduction which should be attributed to the promotion of plant roots on microbial no3 removal indeed the planted ls columns developed significantly different microbial communities from the lsnop columns this finding was consistent with previous studies philippot et al 2013 zuo et al 2020 such consistency suggested that plant roots imposed considerable influence on microbiota even without changing the microbial composition or increasing the abundance of denitrifiers plant roots consume oxygen and secret organic exudates creating micro niches for denitrification more so than in the bulk media and promoting microbial denitrification in the rhizosphere henry et al 2008 kavehei et al 2021 in this study the abundance of key denitrifying functions nirs nosz was comparably high in the planted columns with different media s sl and ls fig 4 even though the microbial compositions therein were quite different indicating that the promoting effect of plants on denitrification may be primarily realized by increasing the activity of denitrifiers thus the roles of plants in bioretention systems lie not only in nitrogen uptake but also in the regulation of rhizosphere microbial activity and metabolism these observations indicate it is very important to consider the effect of rhizosphere microbe interactions on no3 mass reduction when selecting appropriate plants to construct bioretention systems this point awaits further investigation and is also of great significance to ensure the effective no3 mass reduction during plant dormancy 4 3 2 chemolithotrophic rather than heterotrophic no3 reduction in the organic rich saturation zone as demonstrated in this and previous studies the establishment of a reductive saturation zone is highly beneficial in ensuring high efficiency of no3 removal in bioretention systems however different from the previous understanding that heterotrophic denitrification accounts for no3 removal when supplied with organic substrates lopez ponnada et al 2020 tian et al 2019 our study revealed that unconventional no3 reduction pathways were also important to n mass reduction in the organic rich saturation zone in the context of our experiments in contrast to the high occurrence of annotated denitrifiers in the upper medium traditional denitrifiers were scarce in the woodchip amended saturation zone fig 5b and e but the abundances of nirs and nosz genes were high fig s3c and d this finding seems to be self contradictory however when closely examining the microbial composition we found that sulfur oxidation was the overwhelmingly predominant predicted bacterial function fig 5c carried out by only three species sulfurimonas sp 23 1 of total bacterial reads thiobacillus sp 2 6 and sulfuricurvum kujiense 0 9 table s5 interestingly these three species of bacteria are also chemolithotrophic denitrifiers figs 6 and s1 which couple no3 reduction with sulfur oxidation as shown below kodama and watanabe 2004 shao et al 2010 5 h s 8 n o 3 3 h 4 n 2 5 s o 4 2 4 h 2 o 5 s 0 6 no 3 2 h 2 o 3 n 2 5 so 4 2 4 h similarly in addition to reducing sulfur compounds other alternative electron donors like fe2 and h2 can also be used for nitrate chemolitho reduction di capua et al 2019 2 no 3 10 f e 2 12 h n 2 10 f e 3 6 h 2 o 5 h 2 2 no 3 2 h n 2 6 h 2 o these autotrophic denitrifying bacteria also contain putative denitrifying gene biomarkers such as nirs and nosz genes as in heterotrophic denitrifiers and found to contribute significantly to no3 removal in bioreactors soils and sewage dolejs et al 2015 yang et al 2016b 2012 this explains the high abundance of denitrifying genes nirs and nosz and the low content of heterotrophic denitrifiers in the woodchip amended saturation zone water however fe dependent no3 reduction is unlikely dominant in our studied bioretention columns because the iron content in the media is too low table s2 and there is no additional iron sources such as iron coated sands iron oxides in contrast so4 2 is one of the most abundant oxidants in stormwater runoff the content of so4 2 in rainwater depends on the level of air pollutants mostly ranging from tens to several ppm d aoust 2016 fitzgerald et al 2018 however after rinsing the impervious surfaces highly contaminated by human activities the content of so4 2 in rainwater runoff will increase greatly dozens to hundreds mg l zhang et al 2013 thus the content of so4 2 in most stormwater runoff is much higher than that of inorganic n may be 1 3 orders of magnitude higher and even higher than that of dissolved oxygen typically 6 14 mg l therefore the so4 2 level in the synthetic stormwater used in this study 28 41 mg l table s6 is comparable to that in urban stormwater runoff such abundant so4 2 ensures an effective supply of sulfur compounds formed by microbial so4 2 reduction for autotrophic no3 reduction another prerequisite for the occurrence of sulfur dependent no3 reduction is the low redox potential maintained in the woodchip amended saturation zone fig s2c for anaerobic microbial respiration using no3 fe3 so4 2 or co2 instead of o2 as electron acceptor heterotrophic denitrification usually occurs at the highest redox potential while methanogenesis requires the lowest redox potential kracke et al 2015 however the redox potential in the woodchip amended saturation zone was low enough to induce methanogenesis as the most dominant archaeal group fig 5f which may inhibit heterotrophic denitrification instead under such reductive conditions the abundant so4 2 in the stormwater runoff can be transformed to reduced s e g hs in ls sz c but not in other columns fig s2e because microbial so4 2 reduction occurs when the redox potential is slightly higher than that for methanogenesis in addition the degradation of organic s in woodchips can also release reduced s lepine et al 2016 as sulfur dependent no3 reduction can be effective in a wide range of s n ratio e g 0 3 6 dolejs et al 2015 yang et al 2016a 2016b the resulting reduced s serves as a preferential electron donor for no3 reduction under low redox potential therefore these findings suggested that chemolithotrophic denitrification i e sulfur dependent no3 reduction should play a vital role in the n transformation in the strongly reductive organic rich saturation zone of the tested bioretention columns but its pervasiveness in field bioretention systems still awaits further investigation notably low redox is mainly controlled by efficient microbial organic degradation that consumes most oxidants including heterotrophic nitrifiers and sulfate reducers while the bioavailability of different organic sources e g woodchip compost agriculture waste may vary significantly berger et al 2019 okaikue woodi et al 2020 however due to the limited information of microbial composition the specific regulation of organic matter sources on nitrate and or sulfate reducers in bioretention systems is not clear yet therefore it is vital to test the effect of organic types on microbial compositional variation and the n mass reduction in addition it is worth noting that strong degradation of organic matters may result in high emission of ch4 as an unwanted by product moorman et al 2010 warneke et al 2011 these findings shed light on possible future design strategies of saturation zone 4 3 3 unconventional no3 reduction in the organic poor saturation zone in the saturation zone without woodchip amendment microbial no3 reduction was more puzzling in the absence of additional organic matter the redox potential was not low enough for extensive so4 2 reduction to produce reduced sulfur fig s2c and e which would not favor the occurrence of sulfur dependent chemolithotrophic denitrification additionally the lack of organic substrate also constrained the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers fig 6b even if the redox potential was appropriate indeed neither known autotrophic nor heterotrophic denitrifiers were considerably recovered in the microbial community of the oligotrophic saturation zone fig s4 even so the efficiency of no3 mass reduction in the saturation zone without woodchip amendment was comparable to that with woodchip addition during most of the stormwater runoff dosing practices fig 2b although the abundance of nirs and nosz genes in the oligotrophic saturation zone were much lower than in the eutrophic saturation zone therefore some unconventional denitrification pathways may occur in the organic poor saturation zone the unconventional no3 reduction pathways in the oligotrophic saturation zone might include firstly no3 was transformed by no3 reducing archaea for example an archaeal otu affiliated with halobacteria halorubrum sp was annotated as the no3 reducer fig 5e halorubrum spp are capable of reducing no3 to no2 but did not grow during this process or conversion to nh4 for assimilation alcántara hernández et al 2009 cui et al 2007 kharroub et al 2006 nevertheless the halorubrum affiliated otu only accounted for 0 3 0 8 of total archaeal reads in the oligotrophic saturation zone with limited electron donors however how the reduction of no3 by archaea occurred and to what extent it promoted the removal of no3 still awaits further investigation secondly in the oligotrophic saturation zone the bacterial and archaeal groups without functional annotation were dominant and their metabolic characteristics were unknown they may play important roles in n redox processes in the studied bioretention columns for example candidate division od1 was the largest bacterial group in the studied oligotrophic saturation zone 35 5 of total bacterial sequences so far however this group has never been obtained in pure culture or enrichment so that it is impossible to know their physiological functions environmental genomic studies have shown that candidate division od1 bacteria may be involved in n respiration in suboxic water castelle et al 2017 solden et al 2016 finally aerobic denitrification may also take place more strongly in the oligotrophic suboxic water of the saturation zone as mentioned in the lsnop media this phenomenon has been previously reported in similar habitats such as coastal sediments and reservoir water marchant et al 2017 wang et al 2019 thus it is still an interesting problem to find efficient no3 reduction in the oligotrophic saturation zone although its key metabolic pathways need to be further studied this discovery suggested the complexity of biological n transforming processes which needs more detailed investigation in future study such as by 15n tracing experiments to determine the main groups of denitrifiers in oligotrophic saturation zone however the extension of plant roots in the saturation zone may also contribute significantly to the removal of no3 as a nutrient by n assimilation as discussed in 4 1 and 4 3 1 the cooperation competition between plant and microbial activities and their relative contribution to no3 removal in the saturation zone will vary with plant growth and stormwater conditions which will be an interesting aspect for further investigation nevertheless this discovery still helps to simplify the configuration of bioretention systems and reduce the possible negative environmental impact e g ch4 emission of organic amendments 5 conclusions the present study assessed the microbial mechanisms for transformation and mass reduction of inorganic n nh4 and no3 in constructed bioretention columns with different configurations the results revealed that aerobic nitrifying microbes e g ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria were capable of completely converting nh4 into no3 during stormwater runoff percolation in aerobic media independent of the column designs or stormwater runoff conditions fig 6a b thus the no3 transformation pathway is vital for the complete removal of inorganic n in stormwater runoff by bioretention systems for the ventilated bioretention media vegetation and saturation zone installation can both significantly improve no3 removal but their microbial mechanisms were quite different vegetation appears to enhance heterotrophic denitrification of no3 in the rhizosphere of the oxic media fig 6b therefore the benefits of vegetation on no3 removal can be vulnerable under unamiable stormwater runoff conditions especially in response to high o2 load caused by a large stormwater runoff volume in contrast the inclusion of a saturation zone created more stable reducing conditions which can buffer the high o2 load from stormwater runoff fig 6c d however the microbial processes of no3 reduction significantly varied depending on the specific physicochemical situation in the saturation zone under low redox potential sulfur dependent chemolithotrophic no3 reduction widely occurred in the organic rich saturation zone water fig 6d and multiple oligotrophic microbial no3 reduction pathways occurred in the organic poor saturation zone water fig 6c such unconventional no3 reduction pathways were accompanied by other microbial processes that may produce unexpected by products such as ch4 produced by methanogenesis our results suggest that in order to achieve efficient and stable nitrogen removal the variations of major n redox microbial processes especially for no3 reduction have to be considered in the bioretention systems which is vital for accurate prediction of n mass reduction performance in stormwater runoff treatments based on n mass balance observations several models have been developed to predict the impact of bioretention systems and stormwater runoff configurations such as organic amendment no3 loadings percolation time on no3 removal lynn et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 however most of these existing models do not consider the influence of microbial processes which is one of the most fundamental reasons for the variation of n mass reduction this work suggests that microbial no3 reduction such as heterotrophic or chemolithotrophic pathways is very important for the mass reduction of inorganic n in our constructed bioretention columns the relative contribution of different no3 bioreduction processes may be highly dependent on geochemical fluctuation such as redox potential range bioavailability and quality of alternative electron acceptors e g organic substrates reduced s compounds fe2 in the system therefore more investigations are needed in the field bioretention systems before a general model is drawn to better predict the behavior of inorganic n in summary this study provides some new insights into the n redox processes in bioretention columns at the laboratory scale and may provide some clues for the configuration of bioretention systems for no3 treatment in the future eqs 1 4 credit authorship contribution statement liuqin huang conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing junyue luo writing review editing
