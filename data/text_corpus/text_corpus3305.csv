16525,perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos normally present in groundwater and surface water is an emerging environmental contaminants but is extremely difficult to be degraded due to high energy of the c f bond here an electrocoagulation ec technique coupled with peroxymonosulfate pms activation was used to deeply degrade pfos results showed that approximately 100 pfos was removed from the solution in the monopolar serial ms mode within 60 min and achieved a high kinetic rate of 0 074 min 1 which was significantly higher than those of reported studies table s3 energy consumption 2 06 kwh kg in the ms mode was significantly lower than that of al 52 30 kwh kg and zn 213 50 kwh kg electrodes which further confirmed the potential application prospects of ec technique the quenching experiments electron spin response esr analysis and dft calculations can verify that oh was the main radical from the reaction of fe2 oh reaction site with pms in addition results from fluorine balance and toc removal also indicated the complete mineralization and degradation of pfos in the ec process quantum chemical calculations can confirm the pfos degradation mechanism and key active sites for direct electron transfer and radical attack after five cycle operations of pfos degradation the ec process was still effective in degrading pfos with a removal efficiency above 98 thus this work provided a novel alternative for the high effective treatment of pfos from contaminated environmental water bodies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctane sulfonate quantum chemical calculation electrocoagulation electrode connection modes degradation mechanism 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl substances pfass with fully fluorinated alkyl chains have been commonly used as chemicals since the 1950s because of their surfactant properties and thermal stability thus pfass can be found in various products such as medical equipment food wrappings raincoats lubricants and firefighting foams chou and lin 2020 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a these substances exhibit antibiodegradable anti oxidative and antiphotolysis properties owing to their high energy c f bond 116 kcal mol key et al 1997 and helical conformation among these pfass perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa have received significant attention because of their bioaccumulation environmental resistance and potential toxicity in diverse living organisms and various toxicities such as hepatotoxicity and immunotoxicity duan et al 2020 pfos a representative persistent organic pollutant has been added to the list of persistent organic pollutants by the stockholm convention in 2009 trojanowicz et al 2020 calling for restricted uses worldwide the us environmental protection agency has also classified pfos as an emerging contaminant of concern with a nonenforceable health advisory level of 70 Î¼g l u s e p 2020 however pfos is still used in some counties because of its significant effect in the production of some products which pollutes some natural water bodies kong et al 2018 soil wang et al 2018 and even in drinking water rahman et al 2014 for example pfos has been detected in source and treated water from 14waterworks in osaka japan indicating that traditional approaches to pfos removal are inefficient takagi et al 2008 further bao et al discovered a high level of pfos in groundwater 524 ng l and river water 668 ng l in river xi china bao et al 2011 thus controlling pfos pollution in different natural waters is critical recently pfos removal technologies such as adsorption jian et al 2019 ultrasonic irradiation gole et al 2018 reverse osmosis choi et al 2021 photocatalysis sun et al 2021 electrochemical oxidation zhuo et al 2020 have developed rapidly however these technologies had several limitations such as high energy consumption restricted treatment conditions or high cost which made removing pfos a difficult it has been established that sorption is a highly effective method for removing pfass with different concentrations from wastewater lei et al 2021 various adsorptions have been developed and assessed such as activated carbon biomaterials resins and mineral materials shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 among these materials granular activated carbon is the most commonly used adsorption for wastewater treatment but it has a limited sorption capacity of 0 4 mmol g for pfass yang et al 2016 the adsorption method only moved the pfos and did not achieve a degrading effect the adsorptions still had to be treated which can result in secondary pollutants furthermore these adsorptions will require a long equilibrium time to complete the adsorption process and adsorption regeneration will significantly increase operational difficulty and complexity in an application shi et al 2021 yang et al 2016 therefore developing cost effective and ecofriendly pfos using high mineralization technologies is necessary electrocoagulation process ec an environmentally friendly and effective electrochemical technique has been widely used to treat various wastewater including dyes wastewater oily wastewater textile wastewater tannery wastewater mineral wastewater steel processing wastewater laundry wastewater and some the other wastewater chow and pham 2019 criado et al 2020 mcbeath et al 2020 although ec process has been verified to be an efficient technique to treat the above wastewater it still has some challenge to meet industrial conditions the anode electrode is needed to continuously dissolve to produce metal ions which act as flocculant for adsorption during ec process an oxide layer will be formed on the surface of the cathode electrode bringing ec failure to run in a successively manner ahangarnokolaei et al 2021 heffron et al 2019 ingelsson et al 2020 in addition the formed flocs contained a large amount of metal ions to cause great challenges fernandes et al 2015 the anode electrode with strong conductivity and stable dimension is beneficial to electron transport and will otherwise block electron transmission and inhibits removal of pollutants guo et al 2022 the cathode electrode without the oxide layer is not beneficial to the electrochemical reaction in ec process if the released metal ions in solution cannot be effectively utilized which will cause secondary pollution chow and pham 2021 ingelsson et al 2020 it should be noted that high current density will bring high ohmic drop between electrodes along with promoted voltage that causes higher costs wagle et al 2019 in addition costs can be minimized along with high effective removal efficiency of pfos by decreasing electrode distance and promoting electrolyte conductivity and electrode surface area as previously stated the orientation and configuration of the electrodes in the ec process have a significant effect on the performance of pollutant removal chow and pham 2021 ingelsson et al 2020 determining the release of oh flocs and bubble distribution is important and it can also affect the mixing conditions the mass transfer process and the contaminant removal pathway ingelsson et al 2020 consequently it is very important to control these parameters to boost the removal efficiency of pfos although the above studies can effectively remove pfos or pfoa the strong absorption effect of oh flocs for pfos can result in potential secondary pollutants recently peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely developed for the degradation of various organic contaminants due to the generation of reactive oxidation species ros via high redox potentials li et al 2022 wang et al 2020c the generation of ros can effectively degrade organic pollutants from large to small molecules including co2 and h2o preventing the formation of secondary pollutants du et al 2020 some active radicals included hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 are generated from the aops based on pms activation and these active radicals with strong oxidation can be efficiently degraded organic pollutants huang et al 2017 although these radicals have strong oxidative ability they still cannot effectively degrade pfos due to high energy of the c f bond 116 kcal mol in the molecular structure of pfos shin et al 2019 in recent years only a few studies have reported pfos degradation using an ec process combined with a pms advanced oxidation process here the ec process coupled with pms activation was used to high effectively degrade pfos first of all electron was released into the electrolyte from electrochemical process and then the produced electron further attacked pfos molecule to break down some chemical bonds further producing unstable intermediates of pfos subsequently flocs from ec reaction can react with pms to generate some active radicals oh and so4 finally these radicals can further attack the intermediates from pfos degradation to generate short chain products even hf co2 and h2o although numerous studies have investigated the pfos degradation pathway lin et al 2013 wang et al 2020b the changes of the gibbs free energy in the reaction pathway have been evaluated and the corresponding deep degradation mechanism has not been clarified quantum chemical calculation was conducted to investigate the detailed reaction pathway and change of free energy in the degradation process of pfos to further explore the key reaction sites for the release of ros and its degradation mechanism the ec process with different electrode configuration modes was also investigated to minimize energy consumption and achieve optimal pfos removal efficiency in our study ec process was firstly coupled with aops to construct a novel ec aops technology here pms based aops process can utilize the metal ion from the ec process to generate active radicals which can significantly reduce the risk of secondary pollutants of metal ions in addition the release of small amount of metal ions can satisfy pms activation reaction which can obviously decrease current density input in the ec process and greatly decrease costs more importantly the formation of cathode oxide layer will not affect the degradation reaction of pfos which will bring a wide selection to the cathode electrode in comparison with other technologies such as uv technology ec process aops process and photo catalysis technologies the coupled technology in our study can not only high effectively degrade organic pollutants but also significantly reduce technical costs consequently ec coupled with aops technology is a potential and promising technology for remediation and purification of wastewater containing pfos 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the fe plates 99 were supplied by a local metal processing plant in shenzhen and cut into 40 40 5 mm as electrodes pfos purity 98 and isotopically labeled standard perfluoro n 1 2 3 4 13c4 octanoic sulfonate 13c4 pfos were purchased from wellington laboratory ontario canada pms ethanol etoh tert butanol tba 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 99 and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from aladdin reagent inc china all chemical agents used in the experiment were analytical grade or higher 2 2 cell construction and experiments the electrochemical reactor was an organic glass cell 100 80 80 mm with an effective volume of 640 ml four fe plates are completely immersed vertically in pfos and a magnetic stirrer is used to maintain uniform mass transfer these electrodes are connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 1 parallel or series plate electrodes with bipolar and monopolar connections were used with different electrode connection modes mp modes which refer to anodes and cathodes in parallel connections with monopolar electrodes and require the use of an external wire connection to a power supply are shown in fig 1 in the ms mode the outer electrodes are also wired to the power supply as are the inner electrodes in the bs modes there is no power supply connection between inner electrodes and only the outer electrodes are connected to the power supply during the ec process the initial pfos concentration is 5 mg l the space between electrodes is 2 cm the stirring speed is 800 r min the processing voltage is set in the range of 20 40 v the concentration of nacl is 0 1 mol l and the initial pms concentration is 20 200 mg l the initial ph is adjusted to the desired value using a solution of hcl and naoh the samples are collected at different intervals and filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m glass fiber membrane for the analysis of pfos concentration all experiments are repeated triple after performing each experiment the electrodes are washed to remove surface solid residues 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of pfos is detected using an api 4000 q trap spectrometer and a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy hplc ms ms system table s1 contains detailed information regarding the lc ms ms conditions used for pfos analysis the mineralization degree of pfos solution is determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu co japan the concentration of the released fluorine ions is obtained using an in chromatograph system dionex as22 50 4 mm and a separation column the flocs formed during the electrocoagulation process were collected and freeze dried and their surface morphologies were observed and analyzed via scanning electron microscopy coupling with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds jsm 7610f jeol japan the phase and crystallinity of the flocs were analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd bruker germany with a cu kÎ± radiation source operating at 40 kv the functional groups in the flocs were detected using the fourier transform infrared spectrum ftir ary 650 ge usa in the frequency range of 4000 400 cm 1 radicals generated during the electrocoagulation process were measured using an electron spin response esr bruker usa spectrum with dmpo as the spin trapping reagent the electrical energy consumption was calculated in terms of kwh kg using the following equation 1 w i u t 1000 Î´ m where w is the energy consumption of removing per unit weight of pfos kwh kg i is the input current a u is the average input voltage v t is the pfos removal time and m is the weight of pfos removal kg 2 4 theoretical calculation to optimize the molecular structure the vibrational frequency the transition state ts and transformation products frisch et al 2009 lu and chen 2012 density functional theory dft calculations were performed at m062x level using gaussian 09 software with a basis set 6 31 g d the intrinsic reaction coordinate was calculated to verify the optimal reaction pathway at the same level as above gonzalez and schlegel 1989 furthermore the fukui function and electrostatic potential esp were calculated to explore the key sites of a radical attack on the pfos molecule the fukui index based on the electrophilic attack was obtained using the equation given below lu and chen 2012 2 f q n 1 a q n 1 a where qa denote the atom charge of atom a and n denotes the charge quantity number the obtained charge value was used to confirm the reactive sites 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfso degradation by different electrode connection modes the electrode configuration mode is generally considered a critical factor for treating wastewater in the ec process which can affect the degradation rate of pfos and energy consumption three electrode configuration modes mp ms and bs modes were used to degrade pfos in the ec process under the same operating conditions as shown in fig 1 pfos was rapidly degraded in these configuration modes as shown in fig 2 a and approximately 100 pfos was removed from the solution in the ms mode within 60 min ms mode achieved a high kinetic rate of 0 074 min 1 however to achieve the same pfos degradation efficiency the mp and bs modes required more time and kinetic rates of 0 036 and 0 021 min 1 were obtained for mp and bs mode respectively which were lower than that of ms mode in the mp mode the current was divided because of the parallel mode between anode and cathode zaied et al 2020 although the voltage was the same in this configuration the output current for each electrode was significantly lower than that in ms mode under the same conditions furthermore the mp mode had higher resistance requiring a higher potential through all connected electrodes for the same electron flow in the bs mode only the outer electrodes were connected to the power supply whereas the inner electrodes were not connected consequently the bs mode configuration provided a simple setup and required less maintenance in the ec process however the current in the bs mode flowed more easily in the solution through the bipolar electrodes resulting in a current loss for the ms mode the internal anode and cathode were connected but not linked to the outer electrodes this cell configuration was equivalent to one cell with multiple electrodes thus a higher current was obtained in this mode based on the given potential the high current boosted the electrochemical reaction and accelerated the pfos degradation reaction kobya et al confirmed that the mp mode was the most effective connection to remove pollutants under lower cost and energy consumption kobya et al 2011 furthermore as shown in fig 2b energy consumption which is a critical factor was used to evaluate the performance of various modes the value of energy consumption of ms mode 2 06 kwh kg was lower than that of mp 2 12 kwh kg and bs modes 2 19 kwh kg other studies found that the energy consumption in the ms mode with fe plate electrodes was significantly lower than that of al 52 30 kwh kg and zn 213 50 kwh kg electrodes liu et al 2018 consequently the fe plate electrodes can achieve excellent electrochemical performance and pfos removal efficiency in the ms mode in the ec process some comprehensive factors result in the removal of pfos as shown in fig 3 only 4 2 pfos was removed in the absence of voltage and pms under ms mode with a significantly low removal rate of 0 001 min 1 implying that pure fe plates cannot effectively remove pfos and only simple adsorption behavior on fe plate occurred however adding pms to the solution resulted in only a minor improvement in pfos removal indicating that pms cannot effectively degrade pfos notably in the presence of an input voltage fe plate electrodes can remove pfos under ms mode with 36 1 removal achieved although pfos cannot be removed the removal rate 0 008 min 1 of pfos achieved a significant increase the improvement was mainly attributed to flocculation during the ec process interestingly in the presence of pms and voltage input in the ec process pfos can be completely removed furthermore a high kinetic rate of 0 074 min 1 was obtained which was significantly larger than those obtained without pms or voltage input this significant change in pfos removal must be attributed to some reaction 3 2 identification of reactive oxidation species ros the relative contribution of different radicals was determined by the ec process using the scavenger quenching test etoh with three a h loaded to the carbon atom adjacent to the hydroxyl group can react with both oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 whereas tba without a h can react with oh faster 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 than so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 duan et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 a the addition of tba tba pms 50 1 and etoh etoh pms 50 1 inhibited the degradation of pfos but the etoh has greater inhibition effects than tba because of the high reaction rate degradation efficiencies of 81 9 and 55 4 were achieved for pfos with corresponding kinetic rates of 0 039 and 0 012 min 1 respectively as the tba tba pms 200 1 and etoh etoh pms 200 1 dosages were further increased the inhibition effects also increased and the corresponding pfos kinetic rates rapidly decreased from 0 074 to 0 005 and 0 003 min 1 the contribution in the pfos degradation efficiency between etoh and tba was estimated to be 21 1 and 29 9 respectively indicating that the so4 radical was accounted for the 8 8 of pfos degradation whereas oh radical was responsible for 91 2 in this study the findings demonstrated that oh radicals produced by the ec process or the reaction of fe2 oh and pms was the dominant radical for pfos degradation electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy with dmpo as a spin trapping agent was used to further demonstrate the existence of different radicals esr spectra exhibited unstable fluctuations as well as numerous miscellaneous peaks even after 5 min the spectra yielded similar results indicating that pure pms cannot release radicals in the electrolyte fig 4b interestingly the esr spectra shown in fig 5 c showed multiple peaks containing oh radicals of four lines peaks but did not achieve the relative densities of 1 2 2 1 which was mainly attributed to the generation of h2o2 via a fenton like reaction with fe2 fig 5d shows that with the addition of pms the characteristic signals of dmpo so4 an 13 2 g ah 9 6 g ah 1 48 g and ah 0 78 g and dmpooh an ah 14 9 g were observed tang et al 2018 furthermore the signal density of dmpooh was significantly higher than that of smpo so4 implying a higher concentration of produced oh radical which was consistent with the radical quenching experiment revealing that the oh radical was dominant for pfos degradation moreover it is also found that the signal density of dmpooh became much weaker as the reaction progressed because more radicals were consumed by pfos during the ec process based on the above studies the conclusion that the oh radical was the key active species for pfos degradation in this study can be confirmed 3 3 pfos degradation mechanism when an anode and cathode electrode electrolytic system was connected with a power supply a redox reaction occurred at the electrode surface and in the solution the possible electrochemical reactions through ec are as follows at the anode surface fe can be oxidized to metal ions eqs 3 6 and water molecules can be decomposed into radical oxygen and hydrogen ions eqs 6 and 7 kim et al 2020 3 f e 0 f e 2 2 e 4 f e 2 f e 3 e 5 f e 0 f e 3 3 e 6 h 2 o oh h e 7 2 h 2 o o

oxygen in the electrolyte eqs 12 and 13 the produced metal ions can form insoluble iron hydroxide as the reaction progresses in addition these insoluble precipitates were easy to form flocs which were used to remove organic pollutants through precipitation adsorption coagulation and flocculation singh et al 2016 notably iron can exist in the form of fe ion under acidic conditions and a fenton like reaction can occur because of the reaction of the produced fe2 and h2o2 eqs 2 10 bruguera casamada et al 2019 here oh radicals in the electrolyte can be released via the fenton like reaction the produced oh radical via water decomposition eq 3 and fenton like reactions eq 14 exhibits a high oxidation potential e0 2 80 v she and can effectively degrade pfos in the solution eq 15 fig 3 shows that the ec process without pms exhibited low removal efficiency 36 1 of pfos which was not beneficial for the treatment of pfos containing wastewater the introduction of pms can significantly increase pfos removal efficiency achieving a high kinetic rate of 0 074 min 1 the findings can be attributed to the generation of numerous radicals in the presence of pms the generated fe ions can react with pms to produce fe ions so5 and so4 radicals eqs 16 and 17 pms can reduce fe3 to fe2 and the electron from fe2 can be transferred to pms to achieve fe3 regeneration as the so4 radical is produced li et al 2019 the reactive radicles oh so5 and so4 radical have been considered in the degradation system however so5 radical with low potential 1 1 v cannot cause chemical bond cleavage and exhibits significantly weak performance ji et al 2021 as shown in fig 5a oh 1 8 2 7 v and so4 radical 2 5 3 1 v have a high potential to attack the chemical bond in the target contaminants resulting in degradation 16 f e 3 h s o 5 f e 2 s o 5 h 17 f e 2 h s o 5 f e 3 s o 4 o h with the generation of so4 radical more chemical reactions start releasing oh radicals increasing its concentration to boost the degradation of pfos to further investigate the key reaction site dft calculations were used to calculate the activation energy of oh radical generation the reaction energy of radicals and pms activation energy by reaction species such as so4 pms fe and fe2 are shown in fig 5b these reactions can be divided into two phases the formation eqs 18 21 and cleavage eq 22 25 of tss notably the reaction of fe2 oh and pms is thermodynamically spontaneous with a gibbs free energy value of 35 54 kcal mol however the binding of so4 and oh was not feasible because of the high g1 2 value of 200 25 kcal mol compared with g1 2 value the gibbs free energy value 299 06 kcal mol between fe and pms is much higher which is unfavorable for the thermodynamic process although the binding of so4 and water molecules has low free energy of 63 17 kcal mol compared with the above reaction the free energy is not feasible for the thermodynamic process for the formation of oh radical the cracking of ts4 is more favorable because of its low gibbs free energy 17 06 kcal mol consequently the fe2 oh is the key reaction site for pms activation to produce oh radical in the ec process 18 s o 4 h 2 o ts 1 g 1 1

electrochemical degradation process of pfos the mass balance of fluorine and toc removal after 60 min was explored in this study the fluorine mass balance obtained from mf ion mf undegraded pfos mf intermediates mf initial pfos were in the range of 96 6 89 7 in the ec process as shown in fig 6 a similarly the fluorine ion showed a significant increase from 25 9 to 87 7 with the reaction time in ec process with pms solution interestingly the increase of fluorine ion in the ec process without pms solution was much slower than that in the ec process with pms solution indicating that pms has an activating effect on pfos degradation f mass balance exhibited a decreasing trend implying that some intermediates were not detected or quantified in the solution as shown in fig 6b the toc removal rate increased significantly with the reaction time from 34 7 to 95 8 showing that pfos was degraded in the ec process and the corresponding defluorination rate reached 87 7 after 60 min of electrolysis consequently the high removal rate of carbon and fluorine was attributed to the mineralization and degradation of pfos in the ec process 3 4 the possible pathway for pfos degradation dft calculations were conducted to explore the active species attack on pfos molecules for accurately proposing the pfos degradation pathway in the ec process the optimized molecular structure and corresponding fukui function values are shown in fig 7 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest occupied molecular orbital lumo can lose and gain electrons in the reaction process respectively fanaei et al 2019 fig 7c and d previous studies have confirmed that dft calculations based on the fukui index and frontier molecular orbital theory can accurately describe the nucleophilic and electrophilic reactivity of molecules at key reaction sites cai et al 2019 peng et al 2021 in the above study dft calculations confirmed that the main active species were hydroxyl radicals which are commonly recognized as electrophilic radicals for degrading reactions as shown in fig 7 the red and green region represents the electron rich and electron poor regions of the pfos molecule respectively meanwhile the homo was mainly found at the c f bond which was easily attacked by radicals such oh through electrophilic reaction the fukui index of different reaction sites of pfos is shown in table s1 and the larger fukui index indicates a greater tendency for radical reaction these sites with higher fukui index of 27o f 0 0851 28o f 0 0972 29o f 0 0480 and 10s f 0 0458 are active sites that can be first attacked by active species interestingly the 27o and 28o showed the saturated chemical site and cannot be accepted as an external radical however 29o and 10s are key active sites for active species attacking the esp on the pfos molecule surface fig 7b also demonstrated that the 29o and 10s were the easiest to be attacked resulting in chemical bond cleavage and decomposition under electrochemical conditions e 3 67 v she the electron in the pfos molecule was easily lost to form c8f17so3 eq 26 dft calculations revealed that the gibbs free energy for the reaction between c8f17so3 and oh is 10 02 kcal mol fig 8 indicating that once c8f17so3 is formed via pfos oxidation through direct electron transfer radicals will attack the 10s site in pfos molecule the reaction will cause desulfurization and form c8f17oh eq 27 under the ec process the formed c8f17oh is unstable and easily decomposes to produce c8f16o through a defluorination reaction with a more favorable free energy 38 61 kcal mol eq 28 compared with the c8f17oh generation reaction furthermore the c8f16o can rapidly react with water to generate c7f15coo via defluorination reaction with a more favorable free energy 46 73 kcal mol eq 29 the formed c7f15coo is further transformed into c7f15coo because of the direct electron transfer in the ec process eq 30 then c7f15coo was further decomposed into c7f15 releasing co2 with a more favorable free energy 29 86 kcal mol eq 31 under oh action c7f15 was transformed into c7f15oh eq 32 the formed c7f15oh can undergo a stepwise decomposition and radical reaction cycle resulting in the rip off of a cf2 unit at each step until total mineralization as shown in fig 8 electron density with a high energy gap is concentrated on the side of the sulfonate confirming the key attacking sites for ros reaction consequently a series of reactions under the ec process combined with pms activation can achieve complete mineralization of pfos 26 c 8 f 17 s o 3 e c 8 f 17 s o 3 27 c 8 f 17 s o 3 oh c 8 f 17 o h s o 3 28 c 8 f 17 o h c 8 f 16 o h f 29 c 8 f 16 o h 2 o c 7 f 15 c o o h f 30 c 7 f 15 c o o e c 7 f 15 c o o 31 c 7 f 15 c o

fe plate electrodes to explore the morphology properties of hydroxide flocs the generated flocs in the presence of pms exhibited a uniform flake like structure fig 9 a e in the presence of pfos the flocs exhibited an even pore structure fig 9b f indicating that the pfos was absorbed on the surface of the flocs in the presence of pfos and pms the flocs fig 9c g exhibited a more crystalline flower like structure and aggregate characteristics as the degradation of pfos progressed the floc structure showed little change in 60 min fig 9d h furthermore elemental mapping fig 9i j1 j7 and eds analysis fig 9k confirmed that carbon c 0 23 wt oxygen o 0 18 wt iron fe 0 29 wt sodium na 0 09 wt sulfur s 0 08 wt and fluorine f 0 13 wt were uniformly distributed on the surface of hydroxide flocs the presence of s and f elements in the flocs indicates that pfos or its byproducts containing fluorine were absorbed precipitated and decomposed into the flocs however with the addition of pms under the ec process pfos and its byproducts can be mineralized and degraded to small molecules and fluorine ions xrd spectrum analysis of hydroxide flocs in situ generated in the ec process was performed under different conditions as shown in fig 10 a the characteristic diffraction peaks of hydroxide flocs in 40 min appeared at 2Î¸ 30 2 35 6 43 3 53 3 57 3 and 62 9 which are assigned to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of fe2o3 pdf 39 1346 compared with the xrd spectra of the other flocs the locations of all diffraction peaks were consistent with flocs in 40 min suggesting that fe2o3 can be obtained from these flocs moreover eight diffraction peaks were also observed from the flocs in the presence of pms at 2Î¸ 18 2 26 3 35 2 39 5 46 5 55 3 61 3 and 63 7 which belonged to 210 310 212 302 113 522 004 and 204 planes of fe16o16 so4 3 oh 10 10h2o pdf 47 1775 however the flocs in the absence of pms showed no characteristic diffraction peaks indicating that the addition of pms can significantly change the composition of hydroxide flocs under the ec process to further explore the properties of hydroxide flocs in situ generated from the ec process ftir of the flocs was recorded to show the variation of functional groups in pfos as shown in fig 10b a variation peak at approximately 1215 cm 1 corresponding to the variation of cf2 and cf3 groups can be used to identify the organic fluorine lin et al 2015 furthermore a variation located at 1180 cm 1 can be assigned to the vibration of o s o which was a pfos symbolic functional group however these functional groups cannot be detected from the flocs when no pfos was added to the electrolyte proving that pfos containing several c f bonds was removed and decomposed on the flocs via adsorption and degradation process in addition the other variation peaks at 1634 and 3423 cm 1 were due to the variation of oh indicating that some mixture containing oh was formed in the flocs which were consistent with the xrd spectrum results and further confirmed that the flocs was in the form of fe16o16 so4 3 oh 10 10h2o furthermore after the ec process the pfos solution was filtered using a vacuum pump and the collected flocs were dissolved in 0 1 m hcl solution with triplicated tests in the absence of pms the results indicated that the released rate of pfos from flocs was 95 8 2 5 interestingly the released rate showed a significant increase in the presence of pms rising to 18 2 2 8 in the presence of pms the results meant that pfos was mainly removed through degradation rather than adsorption five reuse cycles of pfos degradation experiments were conducted with the same electrodes under the ec process to study the degradation stability fig 11 a shows that the ec process can effectively degrade pfos in five cycle operations with a removal efficiency 98 furthermore the corresponding pfos degradation kinetics rate changed from 0 074 to 0 072 min 1 fig 11b the results showed that pms activation deeply degraded pfos in the ec process and ec coupled pms activation was a highly effective and stable method for pfos removal 4 conclusions the findings of this work indicated ec process combined with electrochemical activation may be a feasible approach for degradation or purification of pfos contaminants water pfos can be rapidly adsorbed on the surface of iron hydroxide flocs in site produced during ec process and then degraded by oh generated from pms activation pfos can be effectively degraded within 60 min via the ms mode in the reaction system achieving a high degradation rate of 0 074 min 1 in addition epr analysis and dft calculations confirmed that oh was the main active species and fe2 oh is the key reaction site for generating oh here this study investigated the possibility of complete pfos degradation by ec process coupled with pms activation providing critical insight into pfass remediation in contaminated environments quantum chemical calculations were conducted to explore the attacking sites and degradation mechanism through the ec process combined with pms activation which was a useful technique in the remediation of water pollution ec technology has been developed and applied in various wastewater purification for many years this technology exhibits great flexibility and is suitable for combining other treatment techniques such as pms activation fenton microbial fuel cell and electrochemical degradation to promote the degradation efficiency unlike the traditional technologies ec coupled with pms activation in our study can achieve deep degradation of pfos and it is not necessary to combine the other technologies to treat pollutants the technique can not only cut costs but also avoid the emergency of secondary pollution compared with the previous studies table s3 reported on the degradation of pfos such as permanganate combined with ultrasonic system hu et al 2018 uv photolysis of nitrilotriacetic acid sun et al 2022 uv coupled with photocatalysis chen et al 2011 and ultrasonic coupled with sonoluminescenc system wood et al 2020 the treatment condition of the current study is mild and have been proved to be a high effective

16525,perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos normally present in groundwater and surface water is an emerging environmental contaminants but is extremely difficult to be degraded due to high energy of the c f bond here an electrocoagulation ec technique coupled with peroxymonosulfate pms activation was used to deeply degrade pfos results showed that approximately 100 pfos was removed from the solution in the monopolar serial ms mode within 60 min and achieved a high kinetic rate of 0 074 min 1 which was significantly higher than those of reported studies table s3 energy consumption 2 06 kwh kg in the ms mode was significantly lower than that of al 52 30 kwh kg and zn 213 50 kwh kg electrodes which further confirmed the potential application prospects of ec technique the quenching experiments electron spin response esr analysis and dft calculations can verify that oh was the main radical from the reaction of fe2 oh reaction site with pms in addition results from fluorine balance and toc removal also indicated the complete mineralization and degradation of pfos in the ec process quantum chemical calculations can confirm the pfos degradation mechanism and key active sites for direct electron transfer and radical attack after five cycle operations of pfos degradation the ec process was still effective in degrading pfos with a removal efficiency above 98 thus this work provided a novel alternative for the high effective treatment of pfos from contaminated environmental water bodies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctane sulfonate quantum chemical calculation electrocoagulation electrode connection modes degradation mechanism 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl substances pfass with fully fluorinated alkyl chains have been commonly used as chemicals since the 1950s because of their surfactant properties and thermal stability thus pfass can be found in various products such as medical equipment food wrappings raincoats lubricants and firefighting foams chou and lin 2020 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a these substances exhibit antibiodegradable anti oxidative and antiphotolysis properties owing to their high energy c f bond 116 kcal mol key et al 1997 and helical conformation among these pfass perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa have received significant attention because of their bioaccumulation environmental resistance and potential toxicity in diverse living organisms and various toxicities such as hepatotoxicity and immunotoxicity duan et al 2020 pfos a representative persistent organic pollutant has been added to the list of persistent organic pollutants by the stockholm convention in 2009 trojanowicz et al 2020 calling for restricted uses worldwide the us environmental protection agency has also classified pfos as an emerging contaminant of concern with a nonenforceable health advisory level of 70 Î¼g l u s e p 2020 however pfos is still used in some counties because of its significant effect in the production of some products which pollutes some natural water bodies kong et al 2018 soil wang et al 2018 and even in drinking water rahman et al 2014 for example pfos has been detected in source and treated water from 14waterworks in osaka japan indicating that traditional approaches to pfos removal are inefficient takagi et al 2008 further bao et al discovered a high level of pfos in groundwater 524 ng l and river water 668 ng l in river xi china bao et al 2011 thus controlling pfos pollution in different natural waters is critical recently pfos removal technologies such as adsorption jian et al 2019 ultrasonic irradiation gole et al 2018 reverse osmosis choi et al 2021 photocatalysis sun et al 2021 electrochemical oxidation zhuo et al 2020 have developed rapidly however these technologies had several limitations such as high energy consumption restricted treatment conditions or high cost which made removing pfos a difficult it has been established that sorption is a highly effective method for removing pfass with different concentrations from wastewater lei et al 2021 various adsorptions have been developed and assessed such as activated carbon biomaterials resins and mineral materials shi et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 among these materials granular activated carbon is the most commonly used adsorption for wastewater treatment but it has a limited sorption capacity of 0 4 mmol g for pfass yang et al 2016 the adsorption method only moved the pfos and did not achieve a degrading effect the adsorptions still had to be treated which can result in secondary pollutants furthermore these adsorptions will require a long equilibrium time to complete the adsorption process and adsorption regeneration will significantly increase operational difficulty and complexity in an application shi et al 2021 yang et al 2016 therefore developing cost effective and ecofriendly pfos using high mineralization technologies is necessary electrocoagulation process ec an environmentally friendly and effective electrochemical technique has been widely used to treat various wastewater including dyes wastewater oily wastewater textile wastewater tannery wastewater mineral wastewater steel processing wastewater laundry wastewater and some the other wastewater chow and pham 2019 criado et al 2020 mcbeath et al 2020 although ec process has been verified to be an efficient technique to treat the above wastewater it still has some challenge to meet industrial conditions the anode electrode is needed to continuously dissolve to produce metal ions which act as flocculant for adsorption during ec process an oxide layer will be formed on the surface of the cathode electrode bringing ec failure to run in a successively manner ahangarnokolaei et al 2021 heffron et al 2019 ingelsson et al 2020 in addition the formed flocs contained a large amount of metal ions to cause great challenges fernandes et al 2015 the anode electrode with strong conductivity and stable dimension is beneficial to electron transport and will otherwise block electron transmission and inhibits removal of pollutants guo et al 2022 the cathode electrode without the oxide layer is not beneficial to the electrochemical reaction in ec process if the released metal ions in solution cannot be effectively utilized which will cause secondary pollution chow and pham 2021 ingelsson et al 2020 it should be noted that high current density will bring high ohmic drop between electrodes along with promoted voltage that causes higher costs wagle et al 2019 in addition costs can be minimized along with high effective removal efficiency of pfos by decreasing electrode distance and promoting electrolyte conductivity and electrode surface area as previously stated the orientation and configuration of the electrodes in the ec process have a significant effect on the performance of pollutant removal chow and pham 2021 ingelsson et al 2020 determining the release of oh flocs and bubble distribution is important and it can also affect the mixing conditions the mass transfer process and the contaminant removal pathway ingelsson et al 2020 consequently it is very important to control these parameters to boost the removal efficiency of pfos although the above studies can effectively remove pfos or pfoa the strong absorption effect of oh flocs for pfos can result in potential secondary pollutants recently peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely developed for the degradation of various organic contaminants due to the generation of reactive oxidation species ros via high redox potentials li et al 2022 wang et al 2020c the generation of ros can effectively degrade organic pollutants from large to small molecules including co2 and h2o preventing the formation of secondary pollutants du et al 2020 some active radicals included hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 are generated from the aops based on pms activation and these active radicals with strong oxidation can be efficiently degraded organic pollutants huang et al 2017 although these radicals have strong oxidative ability they still cannot effectively degrade pfos due to high energy of the c f bond 116 kcal mol in the molecular structure of pfos shin et al 2019 in recent years only a few studies have reported pfos degradation using an ec process combined with a pms advanced oxidation process here the ec process coupled with pms activation was used to high effectively degrade pfos first of all electron was released into the electrolyte from electrochemical process and then the produced electron further attacked pfos molecule to break down some chemical bonds further producing unstable intermediates of pfos subsequently flocs from ec reaction can react with pms to generate some active radicals oh and so4 finally these radicals can further attack the intermediates from pfos degradation to generate short chain products even hf co2 and h2o although numerous studies have investigated the pfos degradation pathway lin et al 2013 wang et al 2020b the changes of the gibbs free energy in the reaction pathway have been evaluated and the corresponding deep degradation mechanism has not been clarified quantum chemical calculation was conducted to investigate the detailed reaction pathway and change of free energy in the degradation process of pfos to further explore the key reaction sites for the release of ros and its degradation mechanism the ec process with different electrode configuration modes was also investigated to minimize energy consumption and achieve optimal pfos removal efficiency in our study ec process was firstly coupled with aops to construct a novel ec aops technology here pms based aops process can utilize the metal ion from the ec process to generate active radicals which can significantly reduce the risk of secondary pollutants of metal ions in addition the release of small amount of metal ions can satisfy pms activation reaction which can obviously decrease current density input in the ec process and greatly decrease costs more importantly the formation of cathode oxide layer will not affect the degradation reaction of pfos which will bring a wide selection to the cathode electrode in comparison with other technologies such as uv technology ec process aops process and photo catalysis technologies the coupled technology in our study can not only high effectively degrade organic pollutants but also significantly reduce technical costs consequently ec coupled with aops technology is a potential and promising technology for remediation and purification of wastewater containing pfos 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the fe plates 99 were supplied by a local metal processing plant in shenzhen and cut into 40 40 5 mm as electrodes pfos purity 98 and isotopically labeled standard perfluoro n 1 2 3 4 13c4 octanoic sulfonate 13c4 pfos were purchased from wellington laboratory ontario canada pms ethanol etoh tert butanol tba 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 99 and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from aladdin reagent inc china all chemical agents used in the experiment were analytical grade or higher 2 2 cell construction and experiments the electrochemical reactor was an organic glass cell 100 80 80 mm with an effective volume of 640 ml four fe plates are completely immersed vertically in pfos and a magnetic stirrer is used to maintain uniform mass transfer these electrodes are connected to a dc power supply as shown in fig 1 parallel or series plate electrodes with bipolar and monopolar connections were used with different electrode connection modes mp modes which refer to anodes and cathodes in parallel connections with monopolar electrodes and require the use of an external wire connection to a power supply are shown in fig 1 in the ms mode the outer electrodes are also wired to the power supply as are the inner electrodes in the bs modes there is no power supply connection between inner electrodes and only the outer electrodes are connected to the power supply during the ec process the initial pfos concentration is 5 mg l the space between electrodes is 2 cm the stirring speed is 800 r min the processing voltage is set in the range of 20 40 v the concentration of nacl is 0 1 mol l and the initial pms concentration is 20 200 mg l the initial ph is adjusted to the desired value using a solution of hcl and naoh the samples are collected at different intervals and filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m glass fiber membrane for the analysis of pfos concentration all experiments are repeated triple after performing each experiment the electrodes are washed to remove surface solid residues 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of pfos is detected using an api 4000 q trap spectrometer and a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy hplc ms ms system table s1 contains detailed information regarding the lc ms ms conditions used for pfos analysis the mineralization degree of pfos solution is determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu co japan the concentration of the released fluorine ions is obtained using an in chromatograph system dionex as22 50 4 mm and a separation column the flocs formed during the electrocoagulation process were collected and freeze dried and their surface morphologies were observed and analyzed via scanning electron microscopy coupling with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds jsm 7610f jeol japan the phase and crystallinity of the flocs were analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd bruker germany with a cu kÎ± radiation source operating at 40 kv the functional groups in the flocs were

electron spin response esr bruker usa spectrum with dmpo as the spin trapping reagent the electrical energy consumption was calculated in terms of kwh kg using the following equation 1 w i u t 1000 Î´ m where w is the energy consumption of removing per unit weight of pfos kwh kg i is the input current a u is the average input voltage v t is the pfos removal time and m is the weight of pfos removal kg 2 4 theoretical calculation to optimize the molecular structure the vibrational frequency the transition state ts and transformation products frisch et al 2009 lu and chen 2012 density functional theory dft calculations were performed at m062x level using gaussian 09 software with a basis set 6 31 g d the intrinsic reaction coordinate was calculated to verify the optimal reaction pathway at the same level as above gonzalez and schlegel 1989 furthermore the fukui function and electrostatic potential esp were calculated to explore the key sites of a radical attack on the pfos molecule the fukui index based on the electrophilic attack was obtained using the equation given below lu and chen 2012 2 f q n 1 a q n 1 a where qa denote the atom charge of atom a and n denotes the charge quantity number the obtained charge value was used to confirm the reactive sites 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfso degradation by different electrode connection modes the electrode configuration mode is generally considered a critical factor for treating wastewater in the ec process which can affect the degradation rate of pfos and energy consumption three electrode configuration modes mp ms and bs modes were used to degrade pfos in the ec process under the same operating conditions as shown in fig 1 pfos was rapidly degraded in these configuration modes as shown in fig 2 a and approximately 100 pfos was removed from the solution in the ms mode within 60 min ms mode achieved a high kinetic rate of 0 074 min 1 however to achieve the same pfos degradation efficiency the mp and bs modes required more time and kinetic rates of 0 036 and 0 021 min 1 were obtained for mp and bs mode respectively which were lower than that of ms mode in the mp mode the current was divided because of the parallel mode between anode and cathode zaied et al 2020 although the voltage was the same in this configuration the output current for each electrode was significantly lower than that in ms mode under the same conditions furthermore the mp mode had higher resistance requiring a higher potential through all connected electrodes for the same electron flow in the bs mode only the outer electrodes were connected to the power supply whereas the inner electrodes were not connected consequently the bs mode configuration provided a simple setup and required less maintenance in the ec process however the current in the bs mode flowed more easily in the solution through the bipolar electrodes resulting in a current loss for the ms mode the internal anode and cathode were connected but not linked to the outer electrodes this cell configuration was equivalent to one cell with multiple electrodes thus a higher current was obtained in this mode based on the given potential the high current boosted the electrochemical reaction and accelerated the pfos degradation reaction kobya et al confirmed that the mp mode was the most effective connection to remove pollutants under lower cost and energy consumption kobya et al 2011 furthermore as shown in fig 2b energy consumption which is a critical factor was used to evaluate the performance of various modes the value of energy consumption of ms mode 2 06 kwh kg was lower than that of mp 2 12 kwh kg and bs modes 2 19 kwh kg other studies found that the energy consumption in the ms mode with fe plate electrodes was significantly lower than that of al 52 30 kwh kg and zn 213 50 kwh kg electrodes liu et al 2018 consequently the fe plate electrodes can achieve excellent electrochemical performance and pfos removal efficiency in the ms mode in the ec process some comprehensive factors result in the removal of pfos as shown in fig 3 only 4 2 pfos was removed in the absence of voltage and pms under ms mode with a significantly low removal rate of 0 001 min 1 implying that pure fe plates cannot effectively remove pfos and only simple adsorption behavior on fe plate occurred however adding pms to the solution resulted in only a minor improvement in pfos removal indicating that pms cannot effectively degrade pfos notably in the presence of an input voltage fe plate electrodes can remove pfos under ms mode with 36 1 removal achieved although pfos cannot be removed the removal rate 0 008 min 1 of pfos achieved a significant increase the improvement was mainly attributed to flocculation during the ec process interestingly in the presence of pms and voltage input in the ec process pfos can be completely removed furthermore a high kinetic rate of 0 074 min 1 was obtained which was significantly larger than those obtained without pms or voltage input this significant change in pfos removal must be attributed to some reaction 3 2 identification of reactive oxidation species ros the relative contribution of different radicals was determined by the ec process using the scavenger quenching test etoh with three a h loaded to the carbon atom adjacent to the hydroxyl group can react with both oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 whereas tba without a h can react with oh faster 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 than so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 duan et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 a the addition of tba tba pms 50 1 and etoh etoh pms 50 1 inhibited the degradation of pfos but the etoh has greater inhibition effects than tba because of the high reaction rate degradation efficiencies of 81 9 and 55 4 were achieved for pfos with corresponding kinetic rates of 0 039 and 0 012 min 1 respectively as the tba tba pms 200 1 and etoh etoh pms 200 1 dosages were further increased the inhibition effects also increased and the corresponding pfos kinetic rates rapidly decreased from 0 074 to 0 005 and 0 003 min 1 the contribution in the pfos degradation efficiency between etoh and tba was estimated to be 21 1 and 29 9 respectively indicating that the so4 radical was accounted for the 8 8 of pfos degradation whereas oh radical was responsible for 91 2 in this study the findings demonstrated that oh radicals produced by the ec process or the reaction of fe2 oh and pms was the dominant radical for pfos degradation electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy with dmpo as a spin trapping agent was used to further demonstrate the existence of different radicals esr spectra exhibited unstable fluctuations as well as numerous miscellaneous peaks even after 5 min the spectra yielded similar results indicating that pure pms cannot release radicals in the electrolyte fig 4b interestingly the esr spectra shown in fig 5 c showed multiple peaks containing oh radicals of four lines peaks but did not achieve the relative densities of 1 2 2 1 which was mainly attributed to the generation of h2o2 via a fenton like reaction with fe2 fig 5d shows that with the addition of pms the characteristic signals of dmpo so4 an 13 2 g ah 9 6 g ah 1 48 g and ah 0 78 g and dmpooh an ah 14 9 g were observed tang et al 2018 furthermore the signal density of dmpooh was significantly higher than that of smpo so4 implying a higher concentration of produced oh radical which was consistent with the radical quenching experiment revealing that the oh radical was dominant for pfos degradation moreover it is also found that the signal density of dmpooh became much weaker as the reaction progressed because more radicals were consumed by pfos during the ec process based on the above studies the conclusion that the oh radical was the key active species for pfos degradation in this study can be confirmed 3 3 pfos degradation mechanism when an anode and cathode electrode electrolytic system was connected with a power supply a redox reaction occurred at the electrode surface and in the solution the possible electrochemical reactions through ec are as follows at the anode surface fe can be oxidized to metal ions eqs 3 6 and water molecules can be decomposed into radical oxygen and hydrogen ions eqs 6 and 7 kim et al 2020 3 f e 0 f e 2 2 e 4 f e 2 f e 3 e 5 f e 0 f e 3 3 e 6 h 2 o oh h e 7 2 h 2 o o

oxygen in the electrolyte eqs 12 and 13 the produced metal ions can form insoluble iron hydroxide as the reaction progresses in addition these insoluble precipitates were easy to form flocs which were used to remove organic pollutants through precipitation adsorption coagulation and flocculation singh et al 2016 notably iron can exist in the form of fe ion under acidic conditions and a fenton like reaction can occur because of the reaction of the produced fe2 and h2o2 eqs 2 10 bruguera casamada et al 2019 here oh radicals in the electrolyte can be released via the fenton like reaction the produced oh radical via water decomposition eq 3 and fenton like reactions eq 14 exhibits a high oxidation potential e0 2 80 v she and can effectively degrade pfos in the solution eq 15 fig 3 shows that the ec process without pms exhibited low removal efficiency 36 1 of pfos which was not beneficial for the treatment of pfos containing wastewater the introduction of pms can significantly increase pfos removal efficiency achieving a high kinetic rate of 0 074 min 1 the findings can be attributed to the generation of numerous radicals in the presence of pms the generated fe ions can react with pms to produce fe ions so5 and so4 radicals eqs 16 and 17 pms can reduce fe3 to fe2 and the electron from fe2 can be transferred to pms to achieve fe3 regeneration as the so4 radical is produced li et al 2019 the reactive radicles oh so5 and so4 radical have been considered in the degradation system however so5 radical with low potential 1 1 v cannot cause chemical bond cleavage and exhibits significantly weak performance ji et al 2021 as shown in fig 5a oh 1 8 2 7 v and so4 radical 2 5 3 1 v have a high potential to attack the chemical bond in the target contaminants resulting in degradation 16 f e 3 h s o 5 f e 2 s o 5 h 17 f e 2 h s o 5 f e 3 s o 4 o h with the generation of so4 radical more chemical reactions start releasing oh radicals increasing its concentration to boost the degradation of pfos to further investigate the key reaction site dft calculations were used to calculate the activation energy of oh radical generation the reaction energy of radicals and pms activation energy by reaction species such as so4 pms fe and fe2 are shown in fig 5b these reactions can be divided into two phases the formation eqs 18 21 and cleavage eq 22 25 of tss notably the reaction of fe2 oh and pms is thermodynamically spontaneous with a gibbs free energy value of 35 54 kcal mol however the binding of so4 and oh was not feasible because of the high g1 2 value of 200 25 kcal mol compared with g1 2 value the gibbs free energy value 299 06 kcal mol between fe and pms is much higher which is unfavorable for the thermodynamic process although the binding of so4 and water molecules has low free energy of 63 17 kcal mol compared with the above reaction the free energy is not feasible for the thermodynamic process for the formation of oh radical the cracking of ts4 is more favorable because of its low gibbs free energy 17 06 kcal mol consequently the fe2 oh is the key reaction site for pms activation to produce oh radical in the ec process 18 s o 4 h 2 o ts 1 g 1 1

electrochemical degradation process of pfos the mass balance of fluorine and toc removal after 60 min was explored in this study the fluorine mass balance obtained from mf ion mf undegraded pfos mf intermediates mf initial pfos were in the range of 96 6 89 7 in the ec process as shown in fig 6 a similarly the fluorine ion showed a significant increase from 25 9 to 87 7 with the reaction time in ec process with pms solution interestingly the increase of fluorine ion in the ec process without pms solution was much slower than that in the ec process with pms solution indicating that pms has an activating effect on pfos degradation f mass balance exhibited a decreasing trend implying that some intermediates were not detected or quantified in the solution as shown in fig 6b the toc removal rate increased significantly with the reaction time from 34 7 to 95 8 showing that pfos was degraded in the ec process and the corresponding defluorination rate reached 87 7 after 60 min of electrolysis consequently the high removal rate of carbon and fluorine was attributed to the mineralization and degradation of pfos in the ec process 3 4 the possible pathway for pfos degradation dft calculations were conducted to explore the active species attack on pfos molecules for accurately proposing the pfos degradation pathway in the ec process the optimized molecular structure and corresponding fukui function values are shown in fig 7 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest occupied molecular orbital lumo can lose and gain electrons in the reaction process respectively fanaei et al 2019 fig 7c and d previous studies have confirmed that dft calculations based on the fukui index and frontier molecular orbital theory can accurately describe the nucleophilic and electrophilic reactivity of molecules at key reaction sites cai et al 2019 peng et al 2021 in the above study dft calculations confirmed that the main active species were hydroxyl radicals which are commonly recognized as electrophilic radicals for degrading reactions as shown in fig 7 the red and green region represents the electron rich and electron poor regions of the pfos molecule respectively meanwhile the homo was mainly found at the c f bond which was easily attacked by radicals such oh through electrophilic reaction the fukui index of different reaction sites of pfos is shown in table s1 and the larger fukui index indicates a greater tendency for radical reaction these sites with higher fukui index of 27o f 0 0851 28o f 0 0972 29o f 0 0480 and 10s f 0 0458 are active sites that can be first attacked by active species interestingly the 27o and 28o showed the saturated chemical site and cannot be accepted as an external radical however 29o and 10s are key active sites for active species attacking the esp on the pfos molecule surface fig 7b also demonstrated that the 29o and 10s were the easiest to be attacked resulting in chemical bond cleavage and decomposition under electrochemical conditions e 3 67 v she the electron in the pfos molecule was easily lost to form c8f17so3 eq 26 dft calculations revealed that the gibbs free energy for the reaction between c8f17so3 and oh is 10 02 kcal mol fig 8 indicating that once c8f17so3 is formed via pfos oxidation through direct electron transfer radicals will attack the 10s site in pfos molecule the reaction will cause desulfurization and form c8f17oh eq 27 under the ec process the formed c8f17oh is unstable and easily decomposes to produce c8f16o through a defluorination reaction with a more favorable free energy 38 61 kcal mol eq 28 compared with the c8f17oh generation reaction furthermore the c8f16o can rapidly react with water to generate c7f15coo via defluorination reaction with a more favorable free energy 46 73 kcal mol eq 29 the formed c7f15coo is further transformed into c7f15coo because of the direct electron transfer in the ec process eq 30 then c7f15coo was further decomposed into c7f15 releasing co2 with a more favorable free energy 29 86 kcal mol eq 31 under oh action c7f15 was transformed into c7f15oh eq 32 the formed c7f15oh can undergo a stepwise decomposition and radical reaction cycle resulting in the rip off of a cf2 unit at each step until total mineralization as shown in fig 8 electron density with a high energy gap is concentrated on the side of the sulfonate confirming the key attacking sites for ros reaction consequently a series of reactions under the ec process combined with pms activation can achieve complete mineralization of

fe plate electrodes to explore the morphology properties of hydroxide flocs the generated flocs in the presence of pms exhibited a uniform flake like structure fig 9 a e in the presence of pfos the flocs exhibited an even pore structure fig 9b f indicating that the pfos was absorbed on the surface of the flocs in the presence of pfos and pms the flocs fig 9c g exhibited a more crystalline flower like structure and aggregate characteristics as the degradation of pfos progressed the floc structure showed little change in 60 min fig 9d h furthermore elemental mapping fig 9i j1 j7 and eds analysis fig 9k confirmed that carbon c 0 23 wt oxygen o 0 18 wt iron fe 0 29 wt sodium na 0 09 wt sulfur s 0 08 wt and fluorine f 0 13 wt were uniformly distributed on the surface of hydroxide flocs the presence of s and f elements in the flocs indicates that pfos or its byproducts containing fluorine were absorbed precipitated and decomposed into the flocs however with the addition of pms under the ec process pfos and its byproducts can be mineralized and degraded to small molecules and fluorine ions xrd spectrum analysis of hydroxide flocs in situ generated in the ec process was performed under different conditions as shown in fig 10 a the characteristic diffraction peaks of hydroxide flocs in 40 min appeared at 2Î¸ 30 2 35 6 43 3 53 3 57 3 and 62 9 which are assigned to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes of fe2o3 pdf 39 1346 compared with the xrd spectra of the other flocs the locations of all diffraction peaks were consistent with flocs in 40 min suggesting that fe2o3 can be obtained from these flocs moreover eight diffraction peaks were also observed from the flocs in the presence of pms at 2Î¸ 18 2 26 3 35 2 39 5 46 5 55 3 61 3 and 63 7 which belonged to 210 310 212 302 113 522 004 and 204 planes of fe16o16 so4 3 oh 10 10h2o pdf 47 1775 however the flocs in the absence of pms showed no characteristic diffraction peaks indicating that the addition of pms can significantly change the composition of hydroxide flocs under the ec process to further explore the properties of hydroxide flocs in situ generated from the ec process ftir of the flocs was recorded to show the variation of functional groups in pfos as shown in fig 10b a variation peak at approximately 1215 cm 1 corresponding to the variation of cf2 and cf3 groups can be used to identify the organic fluorine lin et al 2015 furthermore a variation located at 1180 cm 1 can be assigned to the vibration of o s o which was a pfos symbolic functional group however these functional groups cannot be detected from the flocs when no pfos was added to the electrolyte proving that pfos containing several c f bonds was removed and decomposed on the flocs via adsorption and degradation process in addition the other variation peaks at 1634 and 3423 cm 1 were due to the variation of oh indicating that some mixture containing oh was formed in the flocs which were consistent with the xrd spectrum results and further confirmed that the flocs was in the form of fe16o16 so4 3 oh 10 10h2o furthermore after the ec process the pfos solution was filtered using a vacuum pump and the collected flocs were dissolved in 0 1 m hcl solution with triplicated tests in the absence of pms the results indicated that the released rate of pfos from flocs was 95 8 2 5 interestingly the released rate showed a significant increase in the presence of pms rising to 18 2 2 8 in the presence of pms the results meant that pfos was mainly removed through degradation rather than adsorption five reuse cycles of pfos degradation experiments were conducted with the same electrodes under the ec process to study the degradation stability fig 11 a shows that the ec process can effectively degrade pfos in five cycle operations with a removal efficiency 98 furthermore the corresponding pfos degradation kinetics rate changed from 0 074 to 0 072 min 1 fig 11b the results showed that pms activation deeply degraded pfos in the ec process and ec coupled pms activation was a highly effective and stable method for pfos removal 4 conclusions the findings of this work indicated ec process combined with electrochemical activation may be a feasible approach for degradation or purification of pfos contaminants water pfos can be rapidly adsorbed on the surface of iron hydroxide flocs in site produced during ec process and then degraded by oh generated from pms activation pfos can be effectively degraded within 60 min via the ms mode in the reaction system achieving a high degradation rate of 0 074 min 1 in addition epr analysis and dft calculations confirmed that oh was the main active species and fe2 oh is the key reaction site for generating oh here this study investigated the possibility of complete pfos degradation by ec process coupled with pms activation providing critical insight into pfass remediation in contaminated environments quantum chemical calculations were conducted to explore the attacking sites and degradation mechanism through the ec process combined with pms activation which was a useful technique in the remediation of water pollution ec technology has been developed and applied in various wastewater purification for many years this technology exhibits great flexibility and is suitable for combining other treatment techniques such as pms activation fenton microbial fuel cell and electrochemical degradation to promote the degradation efficiency unlike the traditional technologies ec coupled with pms activation in our study can achieve deep degradation of pfos and it is not necessary to combine the other technologies to treat pollutants the technique can not only cut costs but also avoid the emergency of secondary pollution compared with the previous studies table s3 reported on the degradation of pfos such as permanganate combined with ultrasonic system hu et al 2018 uv photolysis of nitrilotriacetic acid sun et al 2022 uv coupled with photocatalysis chen et al 2011 and ultrasonic coupled with sonoluminescenc system wood et al 2020 the treatment condition of the current study is mild and have been proved to be a high effective

16526,gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas are frequently used for magnetic resonance imaging to improve image contrast these inert complexes are excreted unmetabolized from the human body and pass through wastewater treatment plants almost unaffected leading to a significant release of anthropogenic gd into the environment however long term ecotoxicological effects of gbcas are mainly unknown and thus powerful methods of speciation analysis are required to monitor their distribution and fate in aquatic systems in this work a rapid and efficient monitoring method was developed utilizing a fully automated single platform system for total metal analysis and syringe driven chromatography in combination with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms an anion exchange chromatography ic method was developed and applied to achieve a rapid separation and sensitive detection of the five complexes gd hp do3a gd bt do3a gd dota gd dtpa and gd bopta that are commonly administered in the european union furthermore the use of an automated inline dilution function allowed a fast external calibration from single stock standards a chromatographic run time of less than 2 min and species specific detection limits between 11 and 19 pmol l 1 on a quadrupole icp ms proved to be competitive compared to previously published methods but without the use of aerosol desolvation and or sector field icp ms to enhance sensitivity the automated ic icp ms method was applied for quantitative gbca monitoring in a multitude of surface water samples that were obtained in the german state of north rhine westphalia the complexes gd hp do3a gd bt do3a and gd dota were detected and quantified in addition the occurrence of an unidentified gd species was observed for one of the sampled river systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gadolinium based contrast agents water monitoring speciation analysis ion exchange chromatography inductively coupled

more than 70 million annual applications worldwide most of them taking place in europe and the united states paramagnetic gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas are administered in about 40 of all examinations to enhance mr signal and consequently image contrast lohrke et al 2016 wahsner et al 2019 due to the acute toxicity of free gd3 which acts as a ca2 antagonist polyaminocarboxylic acid ligands are used to create thermodynamically stable chelate complexes caravan et al 1999 idÃ©e et al 2006 several gd complexes have been developed and commercialized during the past three decades making the gbca substance class one of the most successful metallodrugs tircsÃ³ et al 2021 a selection of the most commonly administered substances in the european union eu is displayed in fig 1 based on the ligand design gbcas are differentiated into the macrocyclic compounds gadoteridol gd hp do3a gadobutrol gd bt do3a and gadoterate gd dota as well as the linear gadopentetate gd dtpa and gadobenate gd bopta furthermore they can be distinguished as ionic and non ionic molecules in general the highly stable complexes are considered to be safe but especially for the linear gbcas there is an increased risk of side effects caused by gd deposition inside the human body haneder et al 2015 runge 2017 therefore in 2017 the european medicines agency decided to suspend the use of linear gbcas or restrict their administration to special examinations e g gd dtpa and gd bopta european medicines agency ema 2017 after intravenous administration the highly polar molecules are excreted unmetabolized within a few hours and also pass through wastewater treatment plants wwtps almost unaffected due to their inert nature idÃ©e et al 2006 telgmann et al 2013 balancing experiments by telgmann et al revealed that only approximately 10 of the gd input is removed during biological wastewater treatment telgmann et al 2012a hence it can be estimated that in europe alone up to 19 tons of gd are discharged into the environment every year making gbcas an emerging contaminant in aquatic systems brÃ¼njes and hofmann 2020 as a result anthropogenic gd anomalies can be observed in river lake coastal and even drinking waters rogowska et al 2018 due to its persistence anthropogenic gd is considered a highly sensitive hydrological tracer for other polar microcontaminants e g pesticides and steroids boester and rÃ¼de 2020 kulaksiz and bau 2011 mÃ¶ller et al 2000 schwesig and bergmann 2011 however different studies reported the enrichment of gd in water organisms and an impact on the growth of vertebrate cells was considered lindner et al 2013 lingott et al 2016 parant et al 2019 previous observations indicate that gbcas can undergo species transformation during sewage treatment which was also seen in laboratory tests including transmetalation and degradation experiments birka et al 2016a okabayashi et al 2021 telgmann et al 2012a 2012b nevertheless there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the behavior of gbcas in aquatic environments and further studies are required to assess their long term ecotoxicological properties rogowska et al 2018 thomsen 2017 trapasso et al 2021 unruh et al 2020 efficient selective and sensitive analytical methods are required to monitor the distribution and fate of gbcas in aquatic environments and to address potential concerns regarding these contaminants in 1996 bau and dulski presented a robust and sensitive quantification of anthropogenic gd by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms bau and dulski 1996 the authors normalized the concentrations of all rare earth elements in water samples against reference sediment allowing the discrimination of anthropogenic gd from geogenic background concentrations since total metal analysis by icp ms does not provide any species related information several chromatographic hyphenations have been explored for speciation analysis clases et al 2018 a summary of all publications that include the speciation analysis of gbcas in environmental samples is given in the supplementary information table s1 birka et al 2016b 2013 horstmann et al 2021 kÃ¼nnemeyer et al 2009 lindner et al 2015 2013 okabayashi et al 2021 raju et al 2010 telgmann et al 2012a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic in particular has proven to be a powerful tool for separating the highly polar gd species the first application of hilic for such a task was published in 2009 by kÃ¼nnemeyer et al who achieved a separation of up to five different contrast agents in wastewater samples in less than 30 min with limits of detection lods down to 1 nmol l 1 kÃ¼nnemeyer et al 2009 in recent years hilic icp ms methods have been dramatically improved in terms of robustness sensitivity and chromatographic efficiency in 2015 lindner et al presented a suitable method for quantifying gbcas in tap water samples with detection limits between 8 9 and 22 pmol l 1 lindner et al 2015 one year later similar lods 8 14 pmol l 1 were achieved by birka et al who improved the sensitivity of an icp sector field ms icp sf ms by using ultrasonic nebulization and were therefore able to trace the pathway of gbcas in drinking water purification processes birka et al 2016b recently horstmann et al demonstrated how increasing ion extraction ion transmission and mass filter bandwidth could radically improve the sensitivity of conventional quadrupole based icp ms methods horstmann et al 2021 furthermore the authors employed a relatively fast 3 min hilic separation and an automated micro solid phase extraction strategy to determine up to four different contrast agents in seawater samples conventional hilic methods usually require high amounts of organic solvents in the mobile phase in order to prevent the deposition of carbon on the cones of the plasma interface during icp ms analysis oxygen must be introduced into the plasma which can reduce sensitivity and involves additional technical measures however recently okabayashi et al were able to separate up to six different gbcas in 13 3 min using a hilic method that was based on an aqueous mobile phase only okabayashi et al 2021 purely aqueous conditions such as those used in ion exchange chromatography ic might be a favorable alternative to separate the polar to ionic gd species pfundstein et al 2011 telgmann et al 2012a in general organic solvent free approaches address an important aspect of green analytical chemistry anastas 1999 another vital aspect is the utilization of direct and automated methods which is in addition to accelerated sample throughput also a relevant feature of efficient water monitoring processes gaÅuszka et al 2013 with this work we present the development of a fast and automated method to monitor gbcas in environmental samples using a single platform system for total metal analysis and syringe driven chromatography a novel ic icp ms method was employed enabling the rapid separation and detection of the five most commonly administered gd complexes in the eu the optimized method was evaluated in terms of its analytical figures of merit and finally applied for quantitative speciation analysis of several surface water samples 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and consumables all eluents samples and standards were prepared in doubly distilled dd water that was purified with an aquatron a400d water still system barloworld scientific nemours france contrast agents were obtained as solutions for medical injections from their respective pharmaceutical

metal analysis an in icp standard solution 1000 mg l 1 was purchased from sigma aldrich steinheim germany nitric acid 65 normapur and ethanol 96 v v chromanorm were acquired from vwr international llc radnor pa united states eluents were prepared with ammonium nitrate and carbonate for analysis from applichem gmbh darmstadt germany and ammonia solution 25 for analysis from grÃ¼ssing gmbh filsum germany for sample collection and storage bottles made of polyethylene pe were obtained from vwr sample tubes made of polypropylene pp and 0 2 Âµm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe syringe filters diameter 25 mm were purchased from fisher scientific gmbh schwerte germany to be used during sample preparation such as disposable pp syringes from b braun ag melsungen germany 2 2 preparation of samples and standards samples were collected from several surface waters around the city of mÃ¼nster located in the northwest of the german state of north rhine westphalia sampling was carried out between september and december 2019 using 250 ml pe containers that were rinsed thoroughly with the corresponding water matrix before the samples were collected in a depth of approximately 10 cm the obtained samples were immediately cooled to below 10 c on site and were subsequently frozen and stored in the dark at 20 c further details about sampling locations and time are provided in table s2 for analysis samples were thawed at room temperature and a 25 ml aliquot was filtered through 0 2 Âµm ptfe syringe filters that were previously conditioned with 50 v v ethanol after discarding the first 10 ml the remaining filtrate was collected in pp tubes no further preparation steps were necessary for chromatographic analysis and if not otherwise stated every sample filtrate was injected three times a stock solution containing 5 nmol l 1 each of gd hp do3a gd bt do3a gd dota gd dtpa and gd bopta in dd water was freshly prepared every day to be used for species identification and quantification the concentration of each contrast agent solution was validated by their total gd content sample preparation for total metal analysis was carried out in triplicate for this 2 8 ml of the sample filtrates were filled into pp tubes and 0 2 ml 30 nitric acid which contained 1 5 Âµg l 1 rh as internal standard was added a stock solution containing 1 Âµg l 1 of gd and rh respectively in 2 nitric acid was prepared for quantification 2 3 instrumentation ion chromatography and total metal analysis were carried out utilizing a prepfast ic system elemental scientific inc omaha ne united states equipped with several metal free syringe pumps for eluent transport and a prepfast m5 sample preparation module for an automated sample dilution and internal standard addition a scheme of the instrumental setup is shown in fig 2 samples and standards are placed in pp tubes on an autosampler rack to be drawn up into a sample loop using a loading syringe or a vacuum pump when applying a carrier eluent flow the solutions are pushed into an injection loop and at the same time adjustable amounts of diluent are added to create exact dilutions furthermore the simultaneous addition of a constant volume of internal standard is possible the diluted sample is injected onto the column and after separation an additional post column internal standard flow can be added to the mobile phase when performing total metal analysis the column will be bypassed automatically using a column valve and the sample is transferred directly to the icp ms the prepfast ic was connected to an icap tq icp ms thermo fisher scientific bremen germany that was operated with the software qtegra 2 10 thermo fisher scientific a microflow pfa st nebulizer elemental scientific was used for nebulization a double pass quartz cyclonic spray chamber was cooled to 2 7 c and the aerosol was transferred into the plasma via a 2 5 mm quartz injector sampler and skimmer cones consisted of nickel and a high sensitivity skimmer insert was mounted all measurements were performed in triple quadrupole mode using helium and oxygen gas flows to improve sensitivity and avoid polyatomic interferences torch assembly lenses and gas flows were tuned daily for optimal sensitivity and a ceo ce ratio below 2 5 general instrumental parameters are summarized in table s3 2 4 ic icp ms analysis the optimized chromatographic separation was performed at a flow rate of 1000 Âµl min 1 utilizing a polymer based elemental scientific anion exchange column that was functionalized by quaternary ammonium alkyls cf gd 01 50 4 mm 500 Âµl sample and injection loops were used after uptake the water samples were diluted with dd water by a factor of 2x and the diluted samples were injected onto the column for 3 s which is the equivalent of 50 Âµl injection volume due to the eluent s flow rate the mobile phases consisted of an aqueous ammonium nitrate buffer that was adjusted to ph 9 2 using ammonia solution elution was carried out applying a two step gradient neutral and ionic species were eluted first using a 14 mmol l 1 solution 50 s after injection the mobile phase concentration was changed to 125 mmol l 1 to allow the elution of di ionic species after separation a 100 Âµl min 1 flow of an in solution 1 Âµg l 1 was added as a post column internal standard the mass to charge ratios of 115in and 158gd16o were monitored by icp ms in time resolved acquisition mode with individual dwell times of 100 ms chromatographic run time was 2 min and an additional reset time of 60 s was set in order to refill the eluent syringes and equilibrate the column for quantification varying dilution factors between 200x and 2x were applied to the 5 nmol l 1 species stock solution to create external calibration curves ranging from 25 to 2500 pmol l 1 chromatographic data were processed using originpro 2019 originlab corporation northampton ma united states the obtained gd traces were normalized to the time resolved in internal standard intensity and the normalized chromatograms were smoothed using a second polynomial order savitzky golay filter over 10 data points the quantification of each contrast agent was carried out using the respective peak areas of the processed chromatograms 2 5 total metal analysis for total metal analysis the prepfast ic was operated in direct mode equipped with 1000 Âµl sample loops the acidified samples were diluted by factors between 4x and 2x using 2 nitric acid simultaneously constant amounts of an in solution final in concentration was 500 ng l 1 were added to monitor auto dilution performance and plasma stability the diluted samples were transferred into the icp ms utilizing a 2 nitric acid carrier flow at 500 Âµl min 1 uptake time was set to 40 s and a 60 s wash time was applied to rinse and refill the prepfast system prior to the following sample the mass to charge ratios of 103rh 115in and 157gd16o were detected with dwell times of 100 ms respectively external calibration curves ranging from 5 to 500 ng l 1 were generated via auto dilution of the 1 Âµg l 1 gd rh stock solution with varying dilution factors between 200x and 2x 3 results and discussion 3 1 method development a substantial dispersion and the resulting low concentrations are probably the most challenging aspects in monitoring gbcas in surface waters and therefore highly sensitive speciation analytical techniques based on icp ms must be applied additionally efficient high throughput screening of numerous water samples requires fast and straightforward analytical methods as presented in this manuscript the employment of an automated single platform system for speciation analysis is very advantageous since it significantly reduces preparative and instrumental efforts quarles et al 2020a 2020b 2019 2018 for the rapid differentiation of multiple gd species a novel ic icp ms method was developed the anion exchange column which was utilized for this purpose enables a chromatographic separation of polar molecules based on their charge and hydrodynamic radius aqueous solutions of ammonium carbonate and ammonium nitrate were tested as mobile phases a two step concentration gradient at a flow rate of 1000 Âµl min 1 was applied to accelerate the elution of more highly charged complexes fig 3 a displays the elution behavior of five tested gbcas using an ammonium nitrate eluent that was adjusted to a ph value of 7 4 to maintain physiological conditions according to the principle of anion exchange chromatography the neutral species gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a are eluted first followed by the ionic complex gd dota higher retentions occur for the di ionic contrast agents gd dtpa and gd bopta however the neutral molecules show a very similar retention behavior under the applied conditions so that a co elution of gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a can be observed since changes to the flow rate and eluent molarity did not improve this phenomenon either the basicity of the mobile phase was increased to reinforce the anionic properties of the complexes during elution a ph value of 9 2 was found to be appropriate and offers the additional advantages of an ammonium buffer solution when applying these conditions separation of gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a can be achieved as shown in the chromatogram of fig 3b the increased retention can be explained by deprotonation under alkaline ph conditions which may occur in two different sectors of the nine coordinate gd complexes in addition to the octadentate chelate ligand another binding site of the central atom is coordinated by a solvent water molecule which could be affected by changing ph conditions caravan et al 1999 an influence on aquo ligands might explain the slightly increased retention that can also be observed for other species compared to the chromatograms obtained at physiological ph furthermore it can be assumed that the polyaminocarboxylate structures are affected as well for example the structures of the hp do3a and bt do3a ligands contain side chains with hydroxyl moieties in contrast to hp do3a the alcoholic groups of bt do3a have a higher acidity which is probably the main reason for the relatively large retention time t r shift of the respective gd complex tÃ³th et al 1996 additional chromatograms comparing the influence of different eluent compositions at ph 9 2 are shown in figure s1 in contrast to ammonium nitrate eluents figure s1b the use of aqueous ammonium carbonate figure s1a leads to a co elution of gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a that also cannot be improved by adjusting the mobile phase concentration besides the anionic species gd dota gd dtpa and gd bopta show significantly higher retention times and worse peak shapes although similar mobile phase concentrations and gradient profiles were applied unlike the hard lewis base no3 which is completely deprotonated an equilibrium between the pearson hard co3 2 ion and its counterpart hco3 exists under the employed alkaline conditions resulting in weaker elution properties of the carbonate eluent and a worse chromatographic resolution further adjustments of the carbonate eluent appear to be not effective hence ammonium nitrate eluents at ph 9 2 were used for subsequent method development the injection volume was evaluated empirically over a range of 10 to 100 Âµl considering peak shapes and intensities an injection volume of 50 Âµl was found to be appropriate since higher column loading partially led to excessive peak broadening compared to conventional hilic methods for gbca speciation however relatively large sample amounts can be injected onto the column proving to be beneficial for increased sensitivity chromatograms that were obtained under optimized conditions are shown in fig 4 for a standard mixture at varying concentrations as can be seen it was possible to detect gd signals down to 25 pmol l 1 regardless of the standard concentration a separation of the five mainly administered contrast agents can be achieved in less than 2 min which is a significant improvement compared to previously published methods table s1 when employing eluent molarity of 14 mmol l 1 the neutral and ionic complexes gd hp do3a gd bt do3a and gd dota are eluted first then 50 s after injection mobile phase concentration is increased to 125 mmol l 1 facilitating the elution of the di ionic complexes gd dtpa and gd bopta under these conditions the elution times are 22 32 62 77 and 96 s for gd hp do3a gd bt do3a gd dota gd dtpa and gd bopta respectively the obtained peak areas resemble each other for all species except for gd bopta which shows lower signal intensities 3 2 figures of merit the standard injections at varying concentrations shown in fig 4 were all generated from a 5 nmol l 1 stock solution by utilizing the inline dilution function of the employed automation system the figures of merit of respective calibration curves generated by triplicate measurements are summarized for each gd species and the total metal analysis in table 1 lod and limit of quantification loq were calculated using the 3Ï and 10Ï criteria corresponding to the model of rodrÃ­guez et al 1993 for total gadolinium the determination coefficient r 2 of the linear calibration function was found to be 0 9999 and the relative standard deviation rsd of the slope was 0 4 indicating an adequate performance of the auto dilution function lod and loq were 0 27 and 0 91 pmol l 1 respectively depending on the single contrast agents r 2 values differ from 0 9942 to 0 9997 and the relative slope standard errors were 2 6 or below the calculated lod for gd bt do3a and gd dota was as low as 11 pmol l 1 respectively and 14 pmol l 1 for gd hp do3a as well as gd dtpa due to the lower peak intensity a slightly higher detection limit of 19 pmol l 1 was determined for gd bopta the corresponding loqs ranged from 38 to 65 pmol l 1 in comparison to the literature values summarized in table s1 the detection limits achieved in this study can be considered as excellent particularly when considering that they were achieved with a quadrupole based instrument and without aerosol desolvation thus the obtained lods are in the same concentration range as those published by lindner et al and birka et al whose most sensitive hilic icp ms methods targeted the analysis of drinking water samples birka et al 2016b lindner et al 2015 other validation parameters of the presented speciation method are given in table 2 based on the average of ten standard injections the rsd of the retention time varies from 0 3 to 2 3 for the individual contrast agents column recoveries were calculated as the ratio of the peak areas detected by ic icp ms and flow injection icp ms the determined column recoveries were 90 9 for gd hp do3a 90 5 for gd bt do3a 91 8 for gd dota and 85 8 for gd dtpa column recovery of 77 5 was calculated for gd bopta which is probably caused by stronger retention of the highly anionic species to the stationary phase and might also be the reason for the lower intensity of the respective peak method recoveries were determined by spiking blank water samples with a gbca standard mixture the spiked samples underwent the previously described preparation procedure and the quantified concentrations were compared to the theoretical expectations the spiking recoveries were distributed between 93 9 and 104 5 for the individual complexes indicating the general applicability of the developed method for the quantitative speciation analysis of surface water samples 3 3 monitoring of surface water samples the ic icp ms method was finally applied for the quantitative gbca monitoring of several water samples that were obtained from five different river and creek systems all sampled surface waters are affected by the discharge of municipal wwtps and are also relevant for the local drinking water supply as an example fig 5 gives an overview of the ems river sampling area where seven water samples were collected due to the sufficient sensitivity of the ic icp ms method and the use of aqueous eluents preparative efforts could be kept low because no additional enrichment or extraction steps were necessary therefore samples were filtered only for column care and in the case of total metal analysis the samples were manually acidified with nitric acid exemplary chromatograms of sample e1 and a dd water blank are displayed in fig 6 in contrast to the blank injection intense peaks at 22 31 and 63 s were observed for sample e1 which match the elution times of the macrocyclic contrast agents gd hp do3a gd bt do3a and gd dota respectively another signal which was slightly above the lod appears at 77 s correlating with the retention time of gd dtpa subsequent spiking experiments confirmed the classification of individual contrast agents based on the retention times but one remaining peak that elutes at 57 s could not be assigned to any of the tested contrast agents and is therefore referred to as unknown gd species the quantification of individual gd species and total gd was achieved via automated external calibration and the concentrations determined for the ems river samples are summarized in table 3 further results for samples obtained from other rivers and creeks are recorded in the supplementary information table s4 the linear complex gd bopta was not detected n d in any of the 35 analyzed water samples and gd dtpa was in most cases below lod or at least loq these observations are consistent with national regulations as the administration of linear contrast agents is severely restricted within the eu the complex gd dota could be determined for all sampling locations and in general the macrocyclic compounds gd bt do3a and gd dota appear to be the most abundant gd species in the monitored surface waters a signal assigned to the complex gd hp do3a was also detected in most of the samples the lowest gbca concentrations were obtained for the samples from the dortmund ems canal and highest values up to 9 7 nmol l 1 total gd sample r1 were found in the sampling area rieselfelder nature preserve that is directly located at the effluent of the largest wwtp in the region besides the ems river has the highest gd level compared to other major water streams within the local area gd concentrations between 2 4 and 1 4 nmol l 1 were determined for the samples e1 e5 that were collected in september 2019 for a seasonal comparison the samples e4 and e5 were obtained three months later at the respective sampling points this time total gd values were much lower with concentrations of 0 86 and 0 82 nmol l 1 respectively which might be caused by a more substantial dilution in more rainy winter months for the samples e1 e5 fig 7 visualizes the gd concentrations along the sampling route and the respective proportion of the single species to the total gd content due to the relatively high starting concentrations at sampling point e1 it is difficult to recognize and estimate the impact of individual wttps located at the ems river or smaller tributaries based on total gd values because of the increasing input of anthropogenic gd along the ems river rising gd loads in the course of the water stream can be expected and changes in the relative amounts of the individual contrast agents already indicate a local dynamic in the release and distribution of gbcas within the inspected area a calculation of the gd flow based on the volumetric discharge of the river at the respective sampling points might allow a more detailed insight however only very limited hydrological data are available for this area as only the flow rates close to sampling point e4 e4 at the river ems are monitored using a streamgage streamgage data was collected by the german federal waterways and shipping administration wasserstraÃen und schifffahrtsverwaltung des bundes streamgage fuestrup and provided by the german federal institute of hydrology bundesanstalt fÃ¼r gewÃ¤sserkunde exemplary calculations were carried out for the gd levels at the sampling point e4 e4 that can be correlated with the volumetric discharge table s5 for sample e4 that was collected in september 2019 a total gd flow of 3 80 g h 1 24 2 mmol h 1 was calculated and interestingly a much higher total gd flow of 14 3 g h 1 90 8 mmol h 1 was determined for sample e4 that was obtained three months later the comparison of the total gd concentration and the summed gbca concentrations reveals that samples e1 e5 have mass balances between 97 9 and 101 1 accounting for all of the samples analyzed in this study mass balances differ from 65 5 to 101 1 for samples with low gd levels a gap in this normalization can be explained by species concentrations below their respective loq moreover a minor geogenic gd background can be expected for environmental samples bau and dulski 1996 mass balances close to or above 100 were found to be within the uncertainty range 2sd of the chromatographic quantification therefore it can be verified that the presented method is suitable for quantitative gbca monitoring in water samples interestingly the unknown species mentioned above could only be detected in samples collected from the ems river for samples e1 e4 the concentration was below loq and has fallen below lod for sample e5 this phenomenon is not limited seasonally as indicated by the samples e4 and e5 the amount of unknown species was even higher with concentrations of 120 and 83 5 pmol l 1 respectively making up to 13 9 of total gd content in order to identify the source of this contamination and investigate why its occurrence is limited to ems river samples only a close meshed sampling of the upper river course should be carried out a degradation or transmetalation of commercially used gbcas might explain the origin of this unknown species however an elution of free gd3 was excluded experimentally since this species seemed to precipitate under the applied mobile phase conditions recently okabayashi et al also described the occurrence of an unidentified gd species in river water samples okabayashi et al 2021 the authors suggested that gd3 can be dissociated during sewage treatment to re complex with organic or inorganic matter e g detergents as it was observed earlier by telgmann et al 2012a according to the underlying separation mechanism and considering the elution close to the retention time of gd dota it can be assumed that the unknown species is an anionic complex yet more tests involving spiking experiments with other chelators and the utilization of additional spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques are required to provide more detailed structural information and assess a potential environmental impact 4 conclusion the development and application of a powerful method for the automated speciation analysis of gd based contrast agents gbcas is presented in this manuscript a rapid separation of five commonly administered gbcas was achieved by means of anion exchange chromatography ic the chromatographic run time of the optimized method was below 2 min which is a significant improvement compared to previously published methods detection was carried out utilizing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms species specific detection limits between 11 and 19 pmol l 1 have proven to be competitive with earlier studies that also involved speciation analysis of gbcas in surface and drinking waters the organic solvent free chromatography the simplified preparation workflow the automation approach and the minimal sample to sample time match central principles of green analytical chemistry and turned out to be beneficial for accelerated gbca monitoring as proof of concept the optimized ic icp ms method was applied for high throughput screening of several water samples which were obtained from different river and creek systems in the vicinity of mÃ¼nster the complex gd dota appeared to be the most abundant species as it was identified in all analyzed samples but also other macrocyclic compounds like gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a could be detected and quantified in contrast no determinable amounts of linear contrast agents were found matching the current national regulations for gbca administration for one sampling area the occurrence of an un assignable gd peak could be observed potential sources of this unknown species were discussed but the detailed structure could not be elucidated thus far however findings like this

16526,gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas are frequently used for magnetic resonance imaging to improve image contrast these inert complexes are excreted unmetabolized from the human body and pass through wastewater treatment plants almost unaffected leading to a significant release of anthropogenic gd into the environment however long term ecotoxicological effects of gbcas are mainly unknown and thus powerful methods of speciation analysis are required to monitor their distribution and fate in aquatic systems in this work a rapid and efficient monitoring method was developed utilizing a fully automated single platform system for total metal analysis and syringe driven chromatography in combination with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms an anion exchange chromatography ic method was developed and applied to achieve a rapid separation and sensitive detection of the five complexes gd hp do3a gd bt do3a gd dota gd dtpa and gd bopta that are commonly administered in the european union furthermore the use of an automated inline dilution function allowed a fast external calibration from single stock standards a chromatographic run time of less than 2 min and species specific detection limits between 11 and 19 pmol l 1 on a quadrupole icp ms proved to be competitive compared to previously published methods but without the use of aerosol desolvation and or sector field icp ms to enhance sensitivity the automated ic icp ms method was applied for quantitative gbca monitoring in a multitude of surface water samples that were obtained in the german state of north rhine westphalia the complexes gd hp do3a gd bt do3a and gd dota were detected and quantified in addition the occurrence of an unidentified gd species was observed for one of the sampled river systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gadolinium based contrast agents water monitoring speciation analysis ion exchange chromatography inductively coupled

more than 70 million annual applications worldwide most of them taking place in europe and the united states paramagnetic gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas are administered in about 40 of all examinations to enhance mr signal and consequently image contrast lohrke et al 2016 wahsner et al 2019 due to the acute toxicity of free gd3 which acts as a ca2 antagonist polyaminocarboxylic acid ligands are used to create thermodynamically stable chelate complexes caravan et al 1999 idÃ©e et al 2006 several gd complexes have been developed and commercialized during the past three decades making the gbca substance class one of the most successful metallodrugs tircsÃ³ et al 2021 a selection of the most commonly administered substances in the european union eu is displayed in fig 1 based on the ligand design gbcas are differentiated into the macrocyclic compounds gadoteridol gd hp do3a gadobutrol gd bt do3a and gadoterate gd dota as well as the linear gadopentetate gd dtpa and gadobenate gd bopta furthermore they can be distinguished as ionic and non ionic molecules in general the highly stable complexes are considered to be safe but especially for the linear gbcas there is an increased risk of side effects caused by gd deposition inside the human body haneder et al 2015 runge 2017 therefore in 2017 the european medicines agency decided to suspend the use of linear gbcas or restrict their administration to special examinations e g gd dtpa and gd bopta european medicines agency ema 2017 after intravenous administration the highly polar molecules are excreted unmetabolized within a few hours and also pass through wastewater treatment plants wwtps almost unaffected due to their inert nature idÃ©e et al 2006 telgmann et al 2013 balancing experiments by telgmann et al revealed that only approximately 10 of the gd input is removed during biological wastewater treatment telgmann et al 2012a hence it can be estimated that in europe alone up to 19 tons of gd are discharged into the environment every year making gbcas an emerging contaminant in aquatic systems brÃ¼njes and hofmann 2020 as a result anthropogenic gd anomalies can be observed in river lake coastal and even drinking waters rogowska et al 2018 due to its persistence anthropogenic gd is considered a highly sensitive hydrological tracer for other polar microcontaminants e g pesticides and steroids boester and rÃ¼de 2020 kulaksiz and bau 2011 mÃ¶ller et al 2000 schwesig and bergmann 2011 however different studies reported the enrichment of gd in water organisms and an impact on the growth of vertebrate cells was considered lindner et al 2013 lingott et al 2016 parant et al 2019 previous observations indicate that gbcas can undergo species transformation during sewage treatment which was also seen in laboratory tests including transmetalation and degradation experiments birka et al 2016a okabayashi et al 2021 telgmann et al 2012a 2012b nevertheless there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the behavior of gbcas in aquatic environments and further studies are required to assess their long term ecotoxicological properties rogowska et al 2018 thomsen 2017 trapasso et al 2021 unruh et al 2020 efficient selective and sensitive analytical methods are required to monitor the distribution and fate of gbcas in aquatic environments and to address potential concerns regarding these contaminants in 1996 bau and dulski presented a robust and sensitive quantification of anthropogenic gd by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms bau and dulski 1996 the authors normalized the concentrations of all rare earth elements in water samples against reference sediment allowing the discrimination of anthropogenic gd from geogenic background concentrations since total metal analysis by icp ms does not provide any species related information several chromatographic hyphenations have been explored for speciation analysis clases et al 2018 a summary of all publications that include the speciation analysis of gbcas in environmental samples is given in the supplementary information table s1 birka et al 2016b 2013 horstmann et al 2021 kÃ¼nnemeyer et al 2009 lindner et al 2015 2013 okabayashi et al 2021 raju et al 2010 telgmann et al 2012a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic in particular has proven to be a powerful tool for separating the highly polar gd species the first application of hilic for such a task was published in 2009 by kÃ¼nnemeyer et al who achieved a separation of up to five different contrast agents in wastewater samples in less than 30 min with limits of detection lods down to 1 nmol l 1 kÃ¼nnemeyer et al 2009 in recent years hilic icp ms methods have been dramatically improved in terms of robustness sensitivity and chromatographic efficiency in 2015 lindner et al presented a suitable method for quantifying gbcas in tap water samples with detection limits between 8 9 and 22 pmol l 1 lindner et al 2015 one year later similar lods 8 14 pmol l 1 were achieved by birka et al who improved the sensitivity of an icp sector field ms icp sf ms by using ultrasonic nebulization and were therefore able to trace the pathway of gbcas in drinking water purification processes birka et al 2016b recently horstmann et al demonstrated how increasing ion extraction ion transmission and mass filter bandwidth could radically improve the sensitivity of conventional quadrupole based icp ms methods horstmann et al 2021 furthermore the authors employed a relatively fast 3 min hilic separation and an automated micro solid phase extraction strategy to determine up to four different contrast agents in seawater samples conventional hilic methods usually require high amounts of organic solvents in the mobile phase in order to prevent the deposition of carbon on the cones of the plasma interface during icp ms analysis oxygen must be introduced into the plasma which can reduce sensitivity and involves additional technical measures however recently okabayashi et al were able to separate up to six different gbcas in 13 3 min using a hilic method that was based on an aqueous mobile phase only okabayashi et al 2021 purely aqueous conditions such as those used in ion exchange chromatography ic might be a favorable alternative to separate the polar to ionic gd species pfundstein et al 2011 telgmann et al 2012a in general organic solvent free approaches address an important aspect of green analytical chemistry anastas 1999 another vital aspect is the utilization of direct and automated methods which is in addition to accelerated sample throughput also a relevant feature of efficient water monitoring processes gaÅuszka et al 2013 with this work we present the development of a fast and automated method to monitor gbcas in environmental samples using a single platform system for total metal analysis and syringe driven chromatography a novel ic icp ms method was employed enabling the rapid separation and detection of the five most commonly administered gd complexes in the eu the optimized method was evaluated in terms of its analytical figures of merit and finally applied for quantitative speciation analysis of several surface water samples 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and consumables all eluents samples and standards were prepared in doubly distilled dd water that was purified with an aquatron a400d water still system barloworld scientific nemours france contrast agents were obtained as solutions for medical injections from their respective pharmaceutical distributors gd dota dotarem 0 5 mol l 1 from guerbet gmbh sulzbach germany gd bopta multihance 0 5 mol l 1 and gd hp do3a prohance 0 5 mol l 1 from bracco imaging konstanz germany gd bt do3a gadovist 1 0 mol l 1 and gd dtpa magnevist 0 5 mol l 1 from bayer vital gmbh leverkusen germany certified icp standard solutions of gd and rh 1000 mg l 1 from merck kgaa darmstadt germany were used for total metal analysis an in icp standard solution 1000 mg l 1 was purchased from sigma aldrich steinheim germany nitric acid 65 normapur and ethanol 96 v v chromanorm were acquired from vwr international llc radnor pa united states eluents were prepared with ammonium nitrate and carbonate for analysis from applichem gmbh darmstadt germany and ammonia solution 25 for analysis from grÃ¼ssing gmbh filsum germany for sample collection and storage bottles made of polyethylene pe were obtained from vwr sample tubes made of polypropylene pp and 0 2 Âµm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe syringe filters diameter 25 mm were purchased from fisher scientific gmbh schwerte germany to be used during sample preparation such as disposable pp syringes from b braun ag melsungen germany 2 2 preparation of samples and standards samples were collected from several surface waters around the city of mÃ¼nster located in the northwest of the german state of north rhine westphalia sampling was carried out between september and december 2019 using 250 ml pe containers that were rinsed thoroughly with the corresponding water matrix before the samples were collected in a depth of approximately 10 cm the obtained samples were immediately cooled to below 10 c on site and were subsequently frozen and stored in the dark at 20 c further details about sampling locations and time are provided in table s2 for analysis samples were thawed at room temperature and a 25 ml aliquot was filtered through 0 2 Âµm ptfe syringe filters that were previously conditioned with 50 v v ethanol after discarding the first 10 ml the remaining filtrate was collected in pp tubes no further preparation steps were necessary for chromatographic analysis and if not otherwise stated every sample filtrate was injected three times a stock solution containing 5 nmol l 1 each of gd hp do3a gd bt do3a gd dota gd dtpa and gd bopta in dd water was freshly prepared every day to be used for species identification and quantification the concentration of each contrast agent solution was validated by their total gd content sample preparation for total metal analysis was carried out in triplicate for this 2 8 ml of the sample filtrates were filled into pp tubes and 0 2 ml 30 nitric acid which contained 1 5 Âµg l 1 rh as internal standard was added a stock solution containing 1 Âµg l 1 of gd and rh respectively in 2 nitric acid was prepared for quantification 2 3 instrumentation ion chromatography and total metal analysis were carried out utilizing a prepfast ic system elemental scientific inc omaha ne united states equipped with several metal free syringe pumps for eluent transport and a prepfast m5 sample preparation module for an automated sample dilution and internal standard addition a scheme of the instrumental setup is shown in fig 2 samples and standards are placed in pp tubes on an autosampler rack to be drawn up into a sample loop using a loading syringe or a vacuum pump when applying a carrier eluent flow the solutions are pushed into an injection loop and at the same time adjustable amounts of diluent are added to create exact dilutions furthermore the simultaneous addition of a constant volume of internal standard is possible the diluted sample is injected onto the column and after separation an additional post column internal standard flow can be added to the mobile phase when performing total metal analysis the column will be bypassed automatically using a column valve and the sample is transferred directly to the icp ms the prepfast ic was connected to an icap tq icp ms thermo fisher scientific bremen germany that was operated with the software qtegra 2 10 thermo fisher scientific a microflow pfa st nebulizer elemental scientific was used for nebulization a double pass quartz cyclonic spray chamber was cooled to 2 7 c and the aerosol was transferred into the plasma via a 2 5 mm quartz injector sampler and skimmer cones consisted of nickel and a high sensitivity skimmer insert was mounted all measurements were performed in triple quadrupole mode using helium and oxygen gas flows to improve sensitivity and avoid polyatomic interferences torch assembly lenses and gas flows were tuned daily for optimal sensitivity and a ceo ce ratio below 2 5 general instrumental parameters are summarized in table s3 2 4 ic icp ms analysis the optimized chromatographic separation was performed at a flow rate of 1000 Âµl min 1 utilizing a polymer based elemental scientific anion exchange column that was functionalized by quaternary ammonium alkyls cf gd 01 50 4 mm 500 Âµl sample and injection loops were used after uptake the water samples were diluted with dd water by a factor of 2x and the diluted samples were injected onto the column for 3 s which is the equivalent of 50 Âµl injection volume due to the eluent s flow rate the mobile phases consisted of an aqueous ammonium nitrate buffer that was adjusted to ph 9 2 using ammonia solution elution was carried out applying a two step gradient neutral and ionic species were eluted first using a 14 mmol l 1 solution 50 s after injection the mobile phase concentration was changed to 125 mmol l 1 to allow the elution of di ionic species after separation a 100 Âµl min 1 flow of an in solution 1 Âµg l 1 was added as a post column internal standard the mass to charge ratios of 115in and 158gd16o were monitored by icp ms in time resolved acquisition mode with individual dwell times of 100 ms chromatographic run time was 2 min and an additional reset time of 60 s was set in order to refill the eluent syringes and equilibrate the column for quantification varying dilution factors between 200x and 2x were applied to the 5 nmol l 1 species stock solution to create external calibration curves ranging from 25 to 2500 pmol l 1 chromatographic data were processed using originpro 2019 originlab corporation northampton ma united states the obtained gd traces were normalized to the time resolved in internal standard intensity and the normalized chromatograms were smoothed using a second polynomial order savitzky golay filter over 10 data points the quantification of each contrast agent was carried out using the respective peak areas of the processed chromatograms 2 5 total metal analysis for total metal analysis the prepfast ic was operated in direct mode equipped with 1000 Âµl sample loops the acidified samples were diluted by factors between 4x and 2x using 2 nitric acid simultaneously constant amounts of an in solution final in concentration was 500 ng l 1 were added to monitor auto dilution performance and plasma stability the diluted samples were transferred into the icp ms utilizing a 2 nitric acid carrier flow at 500 Âµl min 1 uptake time was set to 40 s and a 60 s wash time was applied to rinse and refill the prepfast system prior to the following sample the mass to charge ratios of 103rh 115in and 157gd16o were detected with dwell times of 100 ms respectively external calibration curves ranging from 5 to 500 ng l 1 were generated via auto dilution of the 1 Âµg l 1 gd rh stock solution with varying dilution factors between 200x and 2x 3 results and discussion 3 1 method development a substantial dispersion and the resulting low concentrations are probably the most challenging aspects in monitoring gbcas in surface waters and therefore highly sensitive speciation analytical techniques based on icp ms must be applied additionally efficient high throughput screening of numerous water samples requires fast and straightforward analytical methods as presented in this manuscript the employment of an automated single platform system for speciation analysis is very advantageous since it significantly reduces preparative and instrumental efforts quarles et al 2020a 2020b 2019 2018 for the rapid differentiation of multiple gd species a novel ic icp ms method was developed the anion exchange column which was utilized for this purpose enables a chromatographic separation of polar molecules based on their charge and hydrodynamic radius aqueous solutions of ammonium carbonate and ammonium nitrate were tested as mobile phases a two step concentration gradient at a flow rate of 1000 Âµl min 1 was applied to accelerate the elution of more highly charged complexes fig 3 a displays the elution behavior of five tested gbcas using an ammonium nitrate eluent that was adjusted to a ph value of 7 4 to maintain physiological conditions according to the principle of anion exchange chromatography the neutral species gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a are eluted first followed by the ionic complex gd dota higher retentions occur for the di ionic contrast agents gd dtpa and gd bopta however the neutral molecules show a very similar retention behavior under the applied conditions so that a co elution of gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a can be observed since changes to the flow rate and eluent molarity did not improve this phenomenon either the basicity of the mobile phase was increased to reinforce the anionic properties of the complexes during elution a ph value of 9 2 was found to be appropriate and offers the additional advantages of an ammonium buffer solution when applying these conditions separation of gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a can be achieved as shown in the chromatogram of fig 3b the increased retention can be explained by deprotonation under alkaline ph conditions which may occur in two different sectors of the nine coordinate gd complexes in addition to the octadentate chelate ligand another binding site of the central atom is coordinated by a solvent water molecule which could be affected by changing ph conditions caravan et al 1999 an influence on aquo ligands might explain the slightly increased retention that can also be observed for other species compared to the chromatograms obtained at physiological ph furthermore it can be assumed that the polyaminocarboxylate structures are affected as well for example the structures of the hp do3a and bt do3a ligands contain side chains with hydroxyl moieties in contrast to hp do3a the alcoholic groups of bt do3a have a higher acidity which is probably the main reason for the relatively large retention time t r shift of the respective gd complex tÃ³th et al 1996 additional chromatograms comparing the influence of different eluent compositions at ph 9 2 are shown in figure s1 in contrast to ammonium nitrate eluents figure s1b the use of aqueous ammonium carbonate figure s1a leads to a co elution of gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a that also cannot be improved by adjusting the mobile phase concentration besides the anionic species gd dota gd dtpa and gd bopta show significantly higher retention times and worse peak shapes although similar mobile phase concentrations and gradient profiles were applied unlike the hard lewis base no3 which is completely deprotonated an equilibrium between the pearson hard co3 2 ion and its counterpart hco3 exists under the employed alkaline conditions resulting in weaker elution properties of the carbonate eluent and a worse chromatographic resolution further adjustments of the carbonate eluent appear to be not effective hence ammonium nitrate eluents at ph 9 2 were used for subsequent method development the injection volume was evaluated empirically over a range of 10 to 100 Âµl considering peak shapes and intensities an injection volume of 50 Âµl was found to be appropriate since higher column loading partially led to excessive peak broadening compared to conventional hilic methods for gbca speciation however relatively large sample amounts can be injected onto the column proving to be beneficial for increased sensitivity chromatograms that were obtained under optimized conditions are shown in fig 4 for a standard mixture at varying concentrations as can be seen it was possible to detect gd signals down to 25 pmol l 1 regardless of the standard concentration a separation of the five mainly administered contrast agents can be achieved in less than 2 min which is a significant improvement compared to previously published methods table s1 when employing eluent molarity of 14 mmol l 1 the neutral and ionic complexes gd hp do3a gd bt do3a and gd dota are eluted first then 50 s after injection mobile phase concentration is increased to 125 mmol l 1 facilitating the elution of the di ionic complexes gd dtpa and gd bopta under these conditions the elution times are 22 32 62 77 and 96 s for gd hp do3a gd bt do3a gd dota gd dtpa and gd bopta respectively the obtained peak areas resemble each other for all species except for gd bopta which shows lower signal intensities 3 2 figures of merit the standard injections at varying concentrations shown in fig 4 were all generated from a 5 nmol l 1 stock solution by utilizing the inline dilution function of the employed automation system the figures of merit of respective calibration curves generated by triplicate measurements are summarized for each gd species and the total metal analysis in table 1 lod and limit of quantification loq were calculated using the 3Ï and 10Ï criteria corresponding to the model of rodrÃ­guez et al 1993 for total gadolinium the determination coefficient r 2 of the linear calibration function was found to be 0 9999 and the relative standard deviation rsd of the slope was 0 4 indicating an adequate performance of the auto dilution function lod and loq were 0 27 and 0 91 pmol l 1 respectively depending on the single contrast agents r 2 values differ from 0 9942 to 0 9997 and the relative slope standard errors were 2 6 or below the calculated lod for gd bt do3a and gd dota was as low as 11 pmol l 1 respectively and 14 pmol l 1 for gd hp do3a as well as gd dtpa due to the lower peak intensity a slightly higher detection limit of 19 pmol l 1 was determined for gd bopta the corresponding loqs ranged from 38 to 65 pmol l 1 in comparison to the literature values summarized in table s1 the detection limits achieved in this study can be considered as excellent particularly when considering that they were achieved with a quadrupole based instrument and without aerosol desolvation thus the obtained lods are in the same concentration range as those published by lindner et al and birka et al whose most sensitive hilic icp ms methods targeted the analysis of drinking water samples birka et al 2016b lindner et al 2015 other validation parameters of the presented speciation method are given in table 2 based on the average of ten standard injections the rsd of the retention time varies from 0 3 to 2 3 for the individual contrast agents column recoveries were calculated as the ratio of the peak areas detected by ic icp ms and flow injection icp ms the determined column recoveries were 90 9 for gd hp do3a 90 5 for gd bt do3a 91 8 for gd dota and 85 8 for gd dtpa column recovery of 77 5 was calculated for gd bopta which is probably caused by stronger retention of the highly anionic species to the stationary phase and might also be the reason for the lower intensity of the respective peak method recoveries were determined by spiking blank water samples with a gbca standard mixture the spiked samples underwent the previously described preparation procedure and the quantified concentrations were compared to the theoretical expectations the spiking recoveries were distributed between 93 9 and 104 5 for the individual complexes indicating the general applicability of the developed method for the quantitative speciation analysis of surface water samples 3 3 monitoring of surface water samples the ic icp ms method was finally applied for the quantitative gbca monitoring of several water samples that were obtained from five different river and creek systems all sampled surface waters are affected by the discharge of municipal wwtps and are also relevant for the local drinking water supply as an example fig 5 gives an overview of the ems river sampling area where seven water samples were collected due to the sufficient sensitivity of the ic icp ms method and the use of aqueous eluents preparative efforts could be kept low because no additional enrichment or extraction steps were necessary therefore samples were filtered only for column care and in the case of total metal analysis the samples were manually acidified with nitric acid exemplary chromatograms of sample e1 and a dd water blank are displayed in fig 6 in contrast to the blank injection intense peaks at 22 31 and 63 s were observed for sample e1 which match the elution times of the macrocyclic contrast agents gd hp do3a gd bt do3a and gd dota respectively another signal which was slightly above the lod appears at 77 s correlating with the retention time of gd dtpa subsequent spiking experiments confirmed the classification of individual contrast agents based on the retention times but one remaining peak that elutes at 57 s could not be assigned to any of the tested contrast agents and is therefore referred to as unknown gd species the quantification of individual gd species and total gd was achieved via automated external calibration and the concentrations determined for the ems river samples are summarized in table 3 further results for samples obtained from other rivers and creeks are recorded in the supplementary information table s4 the linear complex gd bopta was not detected n d in any of the 35 analyzed water samples and gd dtpa was in most cases below lod or at least loq these observations are consistent with national regulations as the administration of linear contrast agents is severely restricted within the eu the complex gd dota could be determined for all sampling locations and in general the macrocyclic compounds gd bt do3a and gd dota appear to be the most abundant gd species in the monitored surface waters a signal assigned to the complex gd hp do3a was also detected in most of the samples the lowest gbca concentrations were obtained for the samples from the dortmund ems canal and highest values up to 9 7 nmol l 1 total gd sample r1 were found in the sampling area rieselfelder nature preserve that is directly located at the effluent of the largest wwtp in the region besides the ems river has the highest gd level compared to other major water streams within the local area gd concentrations between 2 4 and 1 4 nmol l 1 were determined for the samples e1 e5 that were collected in september 2019 for a seasonal comparison the samples e4 and e5 were obtained three months later at the respective sampling points this time total gd values were much lower with concentrations of 0 86 and 0 82 nmol l 1 respectively which might be caused by a more substantial dilution in more rainy winter months for the samples e1 e5 fig 7 visualizes the gd concentrations along the sampling route and the respective proportion of the single species to the total gd content due to the relatively high starting concentrations at sampling point e1 it is difficult to recognize and estimate the impact of individual wttps located at the ems river or smaller tributaries based on total gd values because of the increasing input of anthropogenic gd along the ems river rising gd loads in the course of the water stream can be expected and changes in the relative amounts of the individual contrast agents already indicate a local dynamic in the release and distribution of gbcas within the inspected area a calculation of the gd flow based on the volumetric discharge of the river at the respective sampling points might allow a more detailed insight however only very limited hydrological data are available for this area as only the flow rates close to sampling point e4 e4 at the river ems are monitored using a streamgage streamgage data was collected by the german federal waterways and shipping administration wasserstraÃen und schifffahrtsverwaltung des bundes streamgage fuestrup and provided by the german federal institute of hydrology bundesanstalt fÃ¼r gewÃ¤sserkunde exemplary calculations were carried out for the gd levels at the sampling point e4 e4 that can be correlated with the volumetric discharge table s5 for sample e4 that was collected in september 2019 a total gd flow of 3 80 g h 1 24 2 mmol h 1 was calculated and interestingly a much higher total gd flow of 14 3 g h 1 90 8 mmol h 1 was determined for sample e4 that was obtained three months later the comparison of the total gd concentration and the summed gbca concentrations reveals that samples e1 e5 have mass balances between 97 9 and 101 1 accounting for all of the samples analyzed in this study mass balances differ from 65 5 to 101 1 for samples with low gd levels a gap in this normalization can be explained by species concentrations below their respective loq moreover a minor geogenic gd background can be expected for environmental samples bau and dulski 1996 mass balances close to or above 100 were found to be within the uncertainty range 2sd of the chromatographic quantification therefore it can be verified that the presented method is suitable for quantitative gbca monitoring in water samples interestingly the unknown species mentioned above could only be detected in samples collected from the ems river for samples e1 e4 the concentration was below loq and has fallen below lod for sample e5 this phenomenon is not limited seasonally as indicated by the samples e4 and e5 the amount of unknown species was even higher with concentrations of 120 and 83 5 pmol l 1 respectively making up to 13 9 of total gd content in order to identify the source of this contamination and investigate why its occurrence is limited to ems river samples only a close meshed sampling of the upper river course should be carried out a degradation or transmetalation of commercially used gbcas might explain the origin of this unknown species however an elution of free gd3 was excluded experimentally since this species seemed to precipitate under the applied mobile phase conditions recently okabayashi et al also described the occurrence of an unidentified gd species in river water samples okabayashi et al 2021 the authors suggested that gd3 can be dissociated during sewage treatment to re complex with organic or inorganic matter e g detergents as it was observed earlier by telgmann et al 2012a according to the underlying separation mechanism and considering the elution close to the retention time of gd dota it can be assumed that the unknown species is an anionic complex yet more tests involving spiking experiments with other chelators and the utilization of additional spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques are required to provide more detailed structural information and assess a potential environmental impact 4 conclusion the development and application of a powerful method for the automated speciation analysis of gd based contrast agents gbcas is presented in this manuscript a rapid separation of five commonly administered gbcas was achieved by means of anion exchange chromatography ic the chromatographic run time of the optimized method was below 2 min which is a significant improvement compared to previously published methods detection was carried out utilizing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms species specific detection limits between 11 and 19 pmol l 1 have proven to be competitive with earlier studies that also involved speciation analysis of gbcas in surface and drinking waters the organic solvent free chromatography the simplified preparation workflow the automation approach and the minimal sample to sample time match central principles of green analytical chemistry and turned out to be beneficial for accelerated gbca monitoring as proof of concept the optimized ic icp ms method was applied for high throughput screening of several water samples which were obtained from different river and creek systems in the vicinity of mÃ¼nster the complex gd dota appeared to be the most abundant species as it was identified in all analyzed samples but also other macrocyclic compounds like gd hp do3a and gd bt do3a could be detected and quantified in contrast no determinable amounts of linear contrast agents were found matching the current national regulations for gbca administration for one sampling area the occurrence of an un assignable gd peak could be observed potential sources of this unknown species were discussed but the detailed structure could not be elucidated thus far however findings like this underline the ongoing need for efficient gbca monitoring in aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16527,anthropogenic regulation of hydrographs is a widespread approach to river management however the effects of river regulation on habitat conditions and aquatic communities have rarely been studied in this study we analyzed the physical chemical and biological data from the lower nakdong river in south korea from 2005 to 2009 before weir construction and from 2012 to 2016 after weir construction a partial least square path model pls pm was applied to delineate the complex interrelationships of diatoms and cyanobacteria with physicochemical parameters nutrients zooplankton grazing and hydrological parameters inferential modeling using the hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea allowed the identification of differences in the importance and threshold conditions of population dynamics drivers of diatoms and cyanobacteria before and after flow regulation the annually averaged trajectories of limnological variables displayed significant shifts in seasonality and magnitudes of phytoplankton zooplankton and nutrient concentrations between the two periods the results of pls pm indicated that after flow regulation diatoms and cyanobacteria were directly affected by nutrients and zooplankton densities and the path coefficients of hydrological parameters decreased or even were insignificant the inferential models suggested that diatom dynamics were essentially shaped by threshold conditions of water temperature wt and ph before regulation but mainly by those of rotifers below 51 1 ind l 1 after regulation as for cyanobacteria dynamics wt was identified as a critical threshold condition before and after regulation and the threshold of po4 concentration above 145 4 l 1 was identified as the reason for occasional blooms during the post regulation period overall the results suggest that flow regulation gradually alters habitat conditions typically of rivers to those of stagnant waters these findings must be taken into account for sustainable management strategies of regulated rivers keywords river regulation threshold partial least square path model hybrid evolutionary algorithm phytoplankton phenology 1 introduction extensive human settlement and activities along waterways entail river engineering works such as dams weirs and artificial levees although alterations in river water flows are inevitable for securing water resources for humans even the most carefully engineered dams can cause unforeseen ecological problems milliman 1997 substantial changes in habitat conditions through flow regime modifications can trigger important changes in the composition of river flora and fauna favoring lentic over lotic species zhou et al 2008 wu et al 2010 river impoundment is often associated with changes in nutrient concentrations which are outwardly responsible for drastic shifts in phytoplankton species composition and abundance e g humborg et al 1997 domingues et al 2012 as primary production by phytoplankton determines the productivity and ecological integrity of large rivers there has been an increasing effort to ascertain the effects of river regulation with regard to phytoplankton dynamics river regulation can have a direct effect on species abundance or composition according to their adaptability to altered flow regimes bowling et al 2013 qu et al 2019 altered physicochemical properties affect phytoplankton communities indirectly through nutrition and trophic interactions with grazers ibÃ¡Ã±ez et al 2012 currently the majority of the literature regarding river regulation does not focus on the effects of altered hydraulic conditions on phytoplankton however delineating the key ecological processes affected by multiple stressors is a prerequisite for a robust bio assessment as well as the sustainable management of regulated rivers an improved understanding of the interrelationships between stressors and phytoplankton communities is a prerequisite for determining remediation strategies for ecological shifts in regulated rivers according to reynolds et al 1994 and isabwe et al 2018 the formation of phytoplankton communities in rivers is primarily driven and regulated by physical drivers rather than by chemical factors and biotic interactions however some authors have concluded that algal responses to well mixed conditions are also susceptible to nutrient enrichment and grazing pressure sullivan et al 1991 caraco et al 2006 thus there remain conflicting assumptions regarding the role of physical chemical and biotic mechanisms in shaping phytoplankton communities in regulated rivers the nakdong river is one main river in south korea that serves as the drinking water source of the nation through four multipurpose dams eight weirs were constructed along the main channel of the nakdong river between 2010 and 2011 as part of the four major rivers restoration project where 22 trillion krw approximately 20 billion usd was invested the project was expected to have various policy outcomes including water security assurance water quality improvement and flood damage prevention cha et al 2011 lah et al 2015 but the ecological effects of these human disturbances on aquatic ecosystems have rarely been investigated because the nakdong river experiences severe blooms of diatoms in winter and cyanobacteria in summer kim et al 2020 this study aimed to gain insights into the medium term effects of flow regulation on the habitat conditions that determine the population dynamics of diatoms and cyanobacteria limnological datasets monitored before and after implementing flow regulation measures were analyzed for changes in causal relationships the importance of drivers and correlations between physicochemical and biological drivers and phytoplankton populations both the nature of the data and their qualitative and quantitative analyses resulted in novel findings that may aid in informed river management under the regional conditions of the nakdong river changes in the phenology of habitat conditions diatoms and cyanobacteria were investigated using averaged multi annual trajectories before and after flow regulation causal relationships between physicochemical and biological factors and the population dynamics of diatoms and cyanobacteria were delineated using the partial least square path model pls pm the threshold conditions of key drivers that triggered high abundances of diatoms and cyanobacteria were revealed using a hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea this analytical framework allowed us to test the following research questions 1 does flow regulation affect the phenology and interrelationships of habitat conditions and phytoplankton 2 if flow regulation alters driver importance and thresholds for the population dynamics of diatoms and cyanobacteria what are the associated mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nakdong river is located in the south eastern part of the korean peninsula with a length of 511 km and a catchment area of 23 690 km2 the river has a typical temperate monsoon climate with air temperatures ranging from 7 6 to 31 7 c and a mean annual precipitation of approximately 1500 mm owing to the concentrated rainfall during summer there is a need to regulate river discharge by impounding channels since the river system has been regulated by multipurpose dams and an estuary dam the lower reach of the river has been deemed as a river reservoir system van sluis and lijklema 1984 jeong et al 2006 furthermore eight weirs established approximately 25 km intervals apart were additionally built from upstream to downstream and the sandy riverbed was dredged from 2009 to 2011 under the four major rivers restoration project leading to the river having a more stagnant flow regime than before 2 2 sampling and data preparation field sampling was conducted weekly from january 2005 to december 2016 at a floating dock approximately 20 m offshore of mulgeum which is located at the lower reach of the nakdong river approximately 30 km upstream from the estuarine barrage fig 1 we postulated that changes in hydrological and habitat characteristics of the site which were relatively stagnant for a river can indicate changes in other upstream sites except for the weir construction period from 2010 to 2011 10 years of data from mulgeum were characterized by two hydrographic periods pre regulation 2005 2009 and post regulation 2012 2016 surface water samples 0 5 m were collected using a van dorn sampler and transported to perform phytoplankton zooplankton and chemical analyses samples for phytoplankton were immediately fixed with 3 lugol s solution zooplankton samples were collected using 8 l water samples filtered through a 35 Î¼m net and preserved in 5 formalin physicochemical and nutrient variables were measured according to the methods described in our previous study kim et al 2020 briefly water temperature wt dissolved oxygen oxygen saturation electrical conductivity ec ph and water transparency secchi depth were recorded in situ and alkalinity and turbidity were determined in the laboratory water filtered using glass microfiber filters was analyzed for the concentrations of nitrate no3 n orthophosphate po4 p and silica sio2 using a spectrophotometer uv 1601 shimadzu corp tokyo japan in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater a p h a 1995 two hydrological variables water level and discharge were collected from the national water resource management information system during the study period at the nearest station wolchon which is 4 6 km from the study site for phytoplankton species identification samples were gently shaken and a 100 Î¼l aliquot was smeared on a sedgewick rafter counting chamber the quantitative assessment of phytoplankton was performed by counting the independent cells according to legresley and mcdermott 2010 units cells colonies and filaments were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and counted under multiple magnifications 200 and 400 of an upright microscope axioskop 40 carl zeiss inc gÃ¶ttingen germany species enumeration followed the identification keys were provided by akiyama 1977 and yamagishi and akiyama 1984 the average individual cell dimensions were measured from 30 randomly chosen cells of each species for biovolume estimation and biovolume calculations were based on standard geometric formulae hillebrand et al 1999 species abundance based biovolume results were converted into biomass for further analyses using the wetzel and likens 2000 conversion factor 1 mm3 l 1 1 mg l 1 to observe the top down effects on phytoplankton zooplankton species were also identified through light microscopy observations large zooplankton species e g copepods and cladocerans were counted using an inverted microscope at magnifications of 25 and 50 and small zooplankton species e g rotifers were counted at magnifications of 200 and 400 the abundance of zooplankton communities was also counted and identified to the genus or species level using koste 1978 smirnov and timms 1983 and einsle 1993 in this study zooplankton species were categorized using systematic affiliation rotifers copepods and cladocerans with their individual densities ind l 1 to investigate the responses of diatoms and cyanobacteria to multiple drivers we categorized the environmental drivers into four groups hydrological regime h discharge and water level physicochemical condition p wt ph conductivity and secchi depth nutrients n no3 po4 and sio2 and grazing pressure g rotifers cladocerans and copepods the densities of rotifers cladocerans and copepods were used as a measure of grazing pressure sommer et al 2001 table s1 provides a statistical summary of the data used in this study to investigate the ecological effects of the weir construction on the river we analyzed the data from 2005 to 2009 that represents the pre regulation period and those from 2012 to 2016 to represent the post regulation period of the river 2 3 statistical analyses the wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon 1945 was used to detect differences in all abiotic and biotic variables between pre and post regulation periods to evaluate the interrelated effects of h p n and g on response variables r biomass of diatom and cyanobacteria we performed partial least squares path modeling plspm in the r package plspm to estimate complex cause effect relationship models with latent variables the pls pm consists of an inner model representing the relationships between latent variables and an outer model representing the relationships between each latent variable and its indicators sanchez 2013 to develop a consistent model it is necessary to check the unidimensionality communality and cross loadings of indicators that explain latent variables gÃ¶tz et al 2010 we removed or negatively assigned indicator variables to achieve unidimensionality with dillon goldstein s rho 0 6 communality with values 0 5 and cross loadings with values 0 5 after cleaning and processing the dataset we ran pls pm using 999 bootstraps to validate the estimates of the path coefficients coefficients of determination and goodness of fit gof values the gof index for the pls pm is a compromise between the quality of the measurement model and the quality of the structural model by considering the communality and r 2 coefficients mean communality mean r 2 from the models with the greatest support 95 confidence intervals for the interaction estimates were obtained through parametric bootstrapping if the confidence interval of an estimated parameter crossed zero it was considered to be non significant all statistical analyses were performed using r ver 1 1 463 2 4 threshold analyses using hea evolutionary computation infers models from data based on the principles of natural selection and evolution holland et al 1986 the hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea cao et al 2014 2016 has been designed as a universal tool for predictive modeling of multivariate nonlinear data by integrating genetic programming and differential evolution to evolve the fittest if then else models from the data see fig 2 it has been successfully applied to develop models for early warning and meta analysis of cyanobacteria and forecast phenological asynchrony in plankton communities e g recknagel et al 2017a 2017b 2019 2021 as described by koza and koza 1992 1992 hea applies genetic programming to evolve the optimum structure of if then else models and differential evolution as detailed by storn and price 1997 to optimize the parameters of rule models since genetic programming typically operates on parse trees rather than on bit strings it suits the evolution of if then else models for multivariate relationships the manner in which genetic programming applies cross over mutation and reproduction to create if then else models by means of logic functions fl and or comparison functions fc and arithmetic functions fa exp ln has been illustrated by recknagel et al 2017a differential evolution extracts information on the distance and direction of current solutions models toward the global optimum guiding the search for optimal parameters in the if then else models as outlined by cao et al 2014 the hea software automatically performs sensitivity analyses for the input variables of each model for this purpose the output trajectories are calculated separately for each input range mean sd by keeping the remaining input variables constant at mean values the resulting sensitivity curves visualize the output trajectories in percentage terms 0 100 within the range of each input in this study the c version of hea was run by cloud computing in a cyclic bootstrap scheme that created 80 generations of models by randomly selecting 75 of all data points for training and 25 of all data points for testing see fig 2 after 100 bootstrap runs the overall fittest model of all generations was determined by cross validation for each of the 5 year data sets before and after river regulation the fittest models were determined by the lowest root mean square error and the highest coefficient of determination r 2 3 results 3 1 phenology of limnological variables before and after river flow regulation the changes in seasonal patterns of the limnological variables between the pre and post regulation periods of the river are shown in figs 3 and s1 the r variables biovolumes of diatoms and cyanobacteria decreased after river regulation wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 001 fig 3 diatom abundance declined from january to march before slightly increasing in april and remained low between may and august during the post regulation period compared with those in the pre regulation period the cyanobacteria reached high peaks during spring late summer and autumn but had low abundances during mid summer in the post regulation period wt was slightly higher in the post regulation period 16 3 c than in the pre regulation period 16 0 c p 0 001 although ph values from may to august were high during the post regulation period they significantly decreased after the project p 0 001 all three n variables no3 po4 and sio2 diminished during the post regulation period p 0 001 among the g variables only rotifers had no significant differences between the two periods p 0 05 discharge the h variable showed similar seasonal patterns between both periods with lower magnitudes during the post regulation period than during the pre regulation period average water levels the other h variable outside summer were higher during the post regulation than during the pre regulation period 3 2 analysis of causal relationships between environmental drivers and phytoplankton populations using pls pm the reflective indicators for the four latent variables differed between the pre and post regulation periods secchi depth orthophosphate and rotifers were excluded and wt and nitrate were included as negative values for the pls pm in the pre regulation period and wt nitrate and cladocerans were excluded from the pls pm in the post regulation period the gof value of pls pm for the diatom biomass in the pre regulation period was the highest at 0 433 followed by cyanobacteria in the pre regulation period 0 425 and that for cyanobacteria 0 341 and diatoms 0 335 in the post regulation period significant direct effects of latent environmental variables on r variables diatoms and cyanobacteria were different between the pre and post regulation periods fig 4 a b only the physicochemical variables displayed significant positive effects 0 465 on diatoms in the pre regulation period whereas grazing and nutrient variables showed inhibitory effects 0 201 and 0 322 respectively on diatoms in the post regulation period although the inhibitory effects on cyanobacteria were suggested by both hydrological variables 0 150 and physicochemical variables 0 359 before regulation the physicochemical and nutrient variables positively affected cyanobacteria after regulation notably the effects of hydrological regimes on other environmental variables p g and n were low and became non significant in the post regulation period fig 4c d the negative effects of h on p in the pls pm for both diatoms and cyanobacteria decreased during post regulation and the positive effect of h on n in the pls pm for cyanobacteria also decreased the direct effects of h on g in the pls pm for both diatoms and cyanobacteria became insignificant in the post regulation period indicating that the influence of h on phytoplankton community dynamics weakened after regulation of the river water flows these changes in the interrelationships between environmental variables might indirectly affect the dynamics 3 3 analysis of driver importance and thresholds for diatom and cyanobacteria populations using hea hea evaluates successive generations of mutated and optimized models as a guide for the search for the overall fittest model within highly complex and diverse input relationships across long term data as a result the models learn and select key drivers based on their weight within the numerous data patterns over 1000 s of model generation runs reflected by the driver selection frequencies fig 5a shows the driver selection frequencies recorded for the 50 fittest hea models for diatoms indicating that wt and ph ranked the highest during pre regulation diatoms displayed a slight negative sensitivity for rising wts fig 5b whereas rising ph values corresponded with growing abundance fig 5c in contrast sio2 concentrations and rotifer densities ranked the highest as drivers of diatoms during the post regulation period fig 5a fig 5d indicates that sio2 was a limiting nutrient with the highest diatom abundances coinciding with the lowest sio2 concentrations as shown in fig 5f wt and secchi depths appeared to be key drivers for cyanobacteria during the pre regulation period the input sensitivities revealed that increases in both wt fig 5g and secchi depth fig 5h resulted in the growth of cyanobacteria during the post regulation period wt and po4 concentrations appeared to be key drivers for cyanobacteria with positive sensitivities for both variables fig 5i j the fittest models for diatoms developed by hea for both periods are shown in fig 6a d the model during the pre regulation period achieved an r2 0 52 and determined wt 18 7 c and ph 8 6 as threshold conditions for the high abundance of diatoms corresponding with the findings of the sensitivity analysis above the fittest model of diatoms during the post regulation period achieved an r2 0 56 and revealed rotifers 51 ind l 1 as the threshold condition for the highest abundance of diatoms the fittest models for cyanobacteria for both periods are shown in fig 6e h the model developed for the pre regulation period had an r2 0 59 fig 6e f and suggested wt 28 2 c as the threshold condition for the highest cyanobacteria abundance the fittest model for the post regulation period resulted in an r2 0 57 fig 6g h and identified 23 3 wt c 28 9 or po4 145 4 Âµg l 1 as threshold conditions for the high abundance of cyanobacteria 4 discussion 4 1 differences in phenology and interrelationships of environmental variables the low abundance of diatoms and cyanobacteria in the lower nakdong river during the post regulation period may have been caused by changes in multiple environmental stressors species that rely on natural flow regimes fluvial habitats and nutrient dynamics may be diminished by increased water levels reduced nutrient loads and discharge pringle et al 2000 da silva et al 2020 moreover reduced nutrient concentrations may also reduce phytoplankton growth several studies have addressed the declining effects of oligotrophication on phytoplankton populations in river systems hilt et al 2011 ibÃ¡Ã±ez et al 2012 additionally increased wt and consolidated zooplankton populations may also influence the phytoplankton dynamics to better understand and prevent unwanted shifts in the state of river ecosystems the complex effects of multiple stressors on phytoplankton need to be further investigated foley et al 2015 our pls pm models showed that the direct influences of hydrological variables on other environmental variables became weaker or even disappeared after river regulation consequently changes in habitat conditions impacted major phytoplankton communities riverine phytoplankton are known to be highly sensitive to changes in hydrology and phytoplankton communities have become reassembled due to river regulation da silva et al 2020 nutrient concentrations are exceedingly important for phytoplankton regulation in a lacustrine system whereas they are less important than in river systems hardenbicker et al 2014 however the causal relationships and response patterns of each variable in the post regulation period encompassed the direct effects of g and n on diatoms and cyanobacteria this means that the direct effect of discharge on phytoplankton is of relatively low importance and the main focus concerning plankton regulation in a regulated river system should be on grazing nutrient and physicochemical characteristics these changes in causalities indicate that flow regulation can significantly alter the underlying processes that shapes phytoplankton dynamics downstream 4 2 impacts on diatom population as the effect of h variables on p variables decreased and that on g variables became insignificant after flow regulation g and n variables appeared to be more inhibitive on diatoms than on other latent variables in the pre regulation period when diatoms could access the euphotic zone with water turbulence p variables were the only factors affecting their biomass directly however the zooplankton community and their grazing effect benefitted from hydrologically stable conditions gosselain et al 1998 keckeis et al 2003 and was reflected in the maintenance of their abundance in this study due to the changes in interrelationships defining habitat conditions diatom biomass significantly decreased and the peak events generally observed from autumn to winter disappeared this may be attributed to i high rotifer densities representing increased grazing pressure mainly influencing diatoms in spring autumn and ii reduced sio2 loads causing nutrient limitation for diatoms the input sensitivities from the hea models during the post regulation period can be explained by the limiting effects of sio2 and rotifers on diatoms displayed by their rapid sio2 consumption and grazing losses to rotifers diatoms are the only phytoplankton group that relies on sio2 as a nutrient with low discharge li et al 2017 as the concentrations of sio2 significantly decreased after the flow regulation they appeared to be deficient in terms of sustaining their population as much as before furthermore the threshold rotifers 51 ind l 1 as a condition for the high abundance of diatoms highlighted the importance of rotifers as key drivers under post regulation conditions these results correspond with the findings of kim et al 2000 and levine et al 1999 who suggested that microzooplankton such as rotifers achieved higher grazing rates on diatoms than macrozooplankton such as cladocerans and copepods interestingly only rotifers maintained their biomass among the biotic communities i e phytoplankton and zooplankton in the post regulation period thus consolidated zooplankton communities and limiting nutrient concentrations appeared to be the key drivers of diatoms rather than physicochemical factors in regulated rivers inferential modeling using hea identified water temperatures 18 7 c and ph 8 6 as conditions for high abundances of diatoms during the pre regulation period these results can be explained by the well known preference of diatoms for cool water temperatures in spring and autumn reynolds 2006 and are consistent with the observations of kim et al 2008 who identified 5 c in the field and 10 c in the laboratory as the optimum water temperatures for stephanodiscus sp from the nakdong river the ph threshold reflects the co2 consumption caused by photosynthesis during intensive algal growth shapiro 1990 as shown by the findings of the sensitivity analysis with rising ph in response to growing diatom abundance 4 3 impacts on cyanobacteria population with respect to cyanobacteria the effect of n variables became significant in the post regulation period instead of h variables which indicates that the hydrological characteristics of the nakdong river during this period are not limited and essentially support cyanobacterial development these changes in causal relationships might be attributed to a decrease in all nutrient concentrations after the river project kim et al 2020 suggested that decreasing trends in nutrients can alter algal development and phosphorus is the primary limiting nutrient for growth in the nakdong river although their biomass significantly decreased after flow regulation with the corresponding decreasing trends in nutrients it was found that their growing seasons were extended and two peaks occurred this may be because during the post regulation period i the long water residence time allowed early and high peaks in spring early summer despite low water temperatures ii po4 limitation prevented mid summer peaks and iii late summer peaks were triggered by monsoon instigated pulses of po4 concentrations higher than a threshold level the preference of cyanobacteria for calm and warm waters has been well documented across various climatic regions mowe et al 2015 yang et al 2016 scholz et al 2017 lÃ¼rling et al 2013 reported 29 2 c as the optimum water temperature for cyanobacteria growth based on laboratory experiments and 27 2 c as that for various freshwater systems the inferential models developed by hea identified high abundances of cyanobacteria at wt 28 2 c during the pre regulation period and at 23 3 wt 28 9 c as well as at po4 145 4 Âµg l 1 during the post regulation period the threshold condition of po4 145 4 Âµg l 1 for high cyanobacterial abundance is relevant for the monsoon season when spiking pulses of po4 concentrations triggered the highest cyanobacteria peak in the post regulation and pre regulation period since 2011 advanced wastewater treatment facilities implemented in river catchments have successfully diminished the average po4 concentration in rivers however the highest non point nutrient loads to the nakdong river have always occurred during the korean monsoon season from july to september coinciding with the growing season of cyanobacteria reza et al 2016 pulses of average po4 concentrations during summer in the post regulation period were in the range of 200 250 Âµg l 1 maintaining po4 concentrations below 140 Âµg l 1 during the monsoon season appears to be a realistic and feasible management goal to avoid extreme bloom events of cyanobacteria such as those observed in 2011 and 2012 5 conclusions our study analyzed changes in the underlying causal relationships between multiple environmental variables and associated mechanisms that determine the biomass of diatoms and cyanobacteria under the influence of river regulation the outcomes of this study revealed the following effects of flow regulation on the nakdong river flow regulated alterations in physicochemical habitat conditions resulted in lower risks of severe diatom blooms between autumn and spring and distinct blooms of cyanobacteria in summer showing significantly lower biomass after the river project flow regulation consolidated the zooplankton community strengthening the biological control mechanisms on diatoms with a threshold of rotifer densities of 51 1 ind l 1 occasional bloom events of cyanobacteria in late summer may still be triggered by po4 pulses with concentrations exceeding 145 4 l 1 during the monsoon season which are not prevented by current flow regulation strategies even though the outcomes are specific to the nakdong river they may also improve the understanding of the ecological implications of river regulation in general and aid sustainable river management future research will extend this study by focusing on the role of bacterioplankton benthic macroinvertebrates and planktivorous fish in the context of river regulation to attain ecological integrity funding

phytoplankton zooplankton and nutrient concentrations between the two periods the results of pls pm indicated that after flow regulation diatoms and cyanobacteria were directly affected by nutrients and zooplankton densities and the path coefficients of hydrological parameters decreased or even were insignificant the inferential models suggested that diatom dynamics were essentially shaped by threshold conditions of water temperature wt and ph before regulation but mainly by those of rotifers below 51 1 ind l 1 after regulation as for cyanobacteria dynamics wt was identified as a critical threshold condition before and after regulation and the threshold of po4 concentration above 145 4 l 1 was identified as the reason for occasional blooms during the post regulation period overall the results suggest that flow regulation gradually alters habitat conditions typically of rivers to those of stagnant waters these findings must be taken into account for sustainable management strategies of regulated rivers keywords river regulation threshold partial least square path model hybrid evolutionary algorithm phytoplankton phenology 1 introduction extensive human settlement and activities along waterways entail river engineering works such as dams weirs and artificial levees although alterations in river water flows are inevitable for securing water resources for humans even the most carefully engineered dams can cause unforeseen ecological problems milliman 1997 substantial changes in habitat conditions through flow regime modifications can trigger important changes in the composition of river flora and fauna favoring lentic over lotic species zhou et al 2008 wu et al 2010 river impoundment is often associated with changes in nutrient concentrations which are outwardly responsible for drastic shifts in phytoplankton species composition and abundance e g humborg et al 1997 domingues et al 2012 as primary production by phytoplankton determines the productivity and ecological integrity of large rivers there has been an increasing effort to ascertain the effects of river regulation with regard to phytoplankton dynamics river regulation can have a direct effect on species abundance or composition according to their adaptability to altered flow regimes bowling et al 2013 qu et al 2019 altered physicochemical properties affect phytoplankton communities indirectly through nutrition and trophic interactions with grazers ibÃ¡Ã±ez et al 2012 currently the majority of the literature regarding river regulation does not focus on the effects of altered hydraulic conditions on phytoplankton however delineating the key ecological processes affected by multiple stressors is a prerequisite for a robust bio assessment as well as the sustainable management of regulated rivers an improved understanding of the interrelationships between stressors and phytoplankton communities is a prerequisite for determining remediation strategies for ecological shifts in regulated rivers according to reynolds et al 1994 and isabwe et al 2018 the formation of phytoplankton communities in rivers is primarily driven and regulated by physical drivers rather than by chemical factors and biotic interactions however some authors have concluded that algal responses to well mixed conditions are also susceptible to nutrient enrichment and grazing pressure sullivan et al 1991 caraco et al 2006 thus there remain conflicting assumptions regarding the role of physical chemical and biotic mechanisms in shaping phytoplankton communities in regulated rivers the nakdong river is one main river in south korea that serves as the drinking water source of the nation through four multipurpose dams eight weirs were constructed along the main channel of the nakdong river between 2010 and 2011 as part of the four major rivers restoration project where 22 trillion krw approximately 20 billion usd was invested the project was expected to have various policy outcomes including water security assurance water quality improvement and flood damage prevention cha et al 2011 lah et al 2015 but the ecological effects of these human disturbances on aquatic ecosystems have rarely been investigated because the nakdong river experiences severe blooms of diatoms in winter and cyanobacteria in summer kim et al 2020 this study aimed to gain insights into the medium term effects of flow regulation on the habitat conditions that determine the population dynamics of diatoms and cyanobacteria limnological datasets monitored before and after implementing flow regulation measures were analyzed for changes in causal relationships the importance of drivers and correlations between physicochemical and biological drivers and phytoplankton populations both the nature of the data and their qualitative and quantitative analyses resulted in novel findings that may aid in informed river management under the regional conditions of the nakdong river changes in the phenology of habitat conditions diatoms and cyanobacteria were investigated using averaged multi annual trajectories before and after flow regulation causal relationships between physicochemical and biological factors and the population dynamics of diatoms and cyanobacteria were delineated using the partial least square path model pls pm the threshold conditions of key drivers that triggered high abundances of diatoms and cyanobacteria were revealed using a hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea this analytical framework allowed us to test the following research questions 1 does flow regulation affect the phenology and interrelationships of habitat conditions and phytoplankton 2 if flow regulation alters driver importance and thresholds for the population dynamics of diatoms and cyanobacteria what are the associated mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nakdong river is located in the south eastern part of the korean peninsula with a length of 511 km and a catchment area of 23 690 km2 the river has a typical temperate monsoon climate with air temperatures ranging from 7 6 to 31 7 c and a mean annual precipitation of approximately 1500 mm owing to the concentrated rainfall during summer there is a need to regulate river discharge by impounding channels since the river system has been regulated by multipurpose dams and an estuary dam the lower reach of the river has been deemed as a river reservoir system van sluis and lijklema 1984 jeong et al 2006 furthermore eight weirs established approximately 25 km intervals apart were additionally built from upstream to downstream and the sandy riverbed was dredged from 2009 to 2011 under the four major rivers restoration project leading to the river having a more stagnant flow regime than before 2 2 sampling and data preparation field sampling was conducted weekly from january 2005 to december 2016 at a floating dock approximately 20 m offshore of mulgeum which is located at the lower reach of the nakdong river approximately 30 km upstream from the estuarine barrage fig 1 we postulated that changes in hydrological and habitat characteristics of the site which were relatively stagnant for a river can indicate changes in other upstream sites except for the weir construction period from 2010 to 2011 10 years of data from mulgeum were characterized by two hydrographic periods pre regulation 2005 2009 and post regulation 2012 2016 surface water samples 0 5 m were collected using a van dorn sampler and transported to perform phytoplankton zooplankton and chemical analyses samples for phytoplankton were immediately fixed with 3 lugol s solution zooplankton samples were collected using 8 l water samples filtered through a 35 Î¼m net and preserved in 5 formalin physicochemical and nutrient variables were measured according to the methods described in our previous study kim et al 2020 briefly water temperature wt dissolved oxygen oxygen saturation electrical conductivity ec ph and water transparency secchi depth were recorded in situ and alkalinity and turbidity were determined in the laboratory water filtered using glass microfiber filters was analyzed for the concentrations of nitrate no3 n orthophosphate po4 p and silica sio2 using a spectrophotometer uv 1601 shimadzu corp tokyo japan in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater a p h a 1995 two hydrological variables water level and discharge were collected from the national water resource management information system during the study period at the nearest station wolchon which is 4 6 km from the study site for phytoplankton species identification samples were gently shaken and a 100 Î¼l aliquot was smeared on a sedgewick rafter counting chamber the quantitative assessment of phytoplankton was performed by counting the independent cells according to legresley and mcdermott 2010 units cells colonies and filaments were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and counted under multiple magnifications 200 and 400 of an upright microscope axioskop 40 carl zeiss inc gÃ¶ttingen germany species enumeration followed the identification keys were provided by akiyama 1977 and yamagishi and akiyama 1984 the average individual cell dimensions were measured from 30 randomly chosen cells of each species for biovolume estimation and biovolume calculations were based on standard geometric formulae hillebrand et al 1999 species abundance based biovolume results were converted into biomass for further analyses using the wetzel and likens 2000 conversion factor 1 mm3 l 1 1 mg l 1 to observe the top down effects on phytoplankton zooplankton species were also identified through light microscopy observations large zooplankton species e g copepods and cladocerans were counted using an inverted microscope at magnifications of 25 and 50 and small zooplankton species e g rotifers were counted at magnifications of 200 and 400 the abundance of zooplankton communities was also counted and identified to the genus or species level using koste 1978 smirnov and timms 1983 and einsle 1993 in this study zooplankton species were categorized using systematic affiliation rotifers copepods and cladocerans with their individual densities ind l 1 to investigate the responses of diatoms and cyanobacteria to multiple drivers we categorized the environmental drivers into four groups hydrological regime h discharge and water level physicochemical condition p wt ph conductivity and secchi depth nutrients n no3 po4 and sio2 and grazing pressure g rotifers cladocerans and copepods the densities of rotifers cladocerans and copepods were used as a measure of grazing pressure sommer et al 2001 table s1 provides a statistical summary of the data used in this study to investigate the ecological effects of the weir construction on the river we analyzed the data from 2005 to 2009 that represents the pre regulation period and those from 2012 to 2016 to represent the post regulation period of the river 2 3 statistical analyses the wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon 1945 was used to detect differences in all abiotic and biotic variables between pre and post regulation periods to evaluate the interrelated effects of h p n and g on response variables r biomass of diatom and cyanobacteria we performed partial least squares path modeling plspm in the r package plspm to estimate complex cause effect relationship models with latent variables the pls pm consists of an inner model representing the relationships between latent variables and an outer model representing the relationships between each latent variable and its indicators sanchez 2013 to develop a consistent model it is necessary to check the unidimensionality communality and cross loadings of indicators that explain latent variables gÃ¶tz et al 2010 we removed or negatively assigned indicator variables to achieve unidimensionality with dillon goldstein s rho 0 6 communality with values 0 5 and cross loadings with values 0 5 after cleaning and processing the dataset we ran pls pm using 999 bootstraps to validate the estimates of the path coefficients coefficients of determination and goodness of fit gof values the gof index for the pls pm is a compromise between the quality of the measurement model and the quality of the structural model by considering the communality and r 2 coefficients mean communality mean r 2 from the models with the greatest support 95 confidence intervals for the interaction estimates were obtained through parametric bootstrapping if the confidence interval of an estimated parameter crossed zero it was considered to be non significant all statistical analyses were performed using r ver 1 1 463 2 4 threshold analyses using hea evolutionary computation infers models from data based on the principles of natural selection and evolution holland et al 1986 the hybrid evolutionary algorithm hea cao et al 2014 2016 has been designed as a universal tool for predictive modeling of multivariate nonlinear data by integrating genetic programming and differential evolution to evolve the fittest if then else models from the data see fig 2 it has been successfully applied to develop models for early warning and meta analysis of cyanobacteria and forecast phenological asynchrony in plankton communities e g recknagel et al 2017a 2017b 2019 2021 as described by koza and koza 1992 1992 hea applies genetic programming to evolve the optimum structure of if then else models and differential evolution as detailed by storn and price 1997 to optimize the parameters of rule models since genetic programming typically operates on parse trees rather than on bit strings it suits the evolution of if then else models for multivariate relationships the manner in which genetic programming applies cross over mutation and reproduction to create if then else models by means of logic functions fl and or comparison functions fc and arithmetic functions fa exp ln has been illustrated by recknagel et al 2017a differential evolution extracts information on the distance and direction of current solutions models toward the global optimum guiding the search for optimal parameters in the if then else models as outlined by cao et al 2014 the hea software automatically performs sensitivity analyses for the input variables of each model for this purpose the output trajectories are calculated separately for each input range mean sd by keeping the remaining input variables constant at mean values the resulting sensitivity curves visualize the output trajectories in percentage terms 0 100 within the range of each input in this study the c version of hea was run by cloud computing in a cyclic bootstrap scheme that created 80 generations of models by randomly selecting 75 of all data points for training and 25 of all data points for testing see fig 2 after 100 bootstrap runs the overall fittest model of all generations was determined by cross validation for each of the 5 year data sets before and after river regulation the fittest models were determined by the lowest root mean square error and the highest coefficient of determination r 2 3 results 3 1 phenology of limnological variables before and after river flow regulation the changes in seasonal patterns of the limnological variables between the pre and post regulation periods of the river are shown in figs 3 and s1 the r variables biovolumes of diatoms and cyanobacteria decreased after river regulation wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 001 fig 3 diatom abundance declined from january to march before slightly increasing in april and remained low between may and august during the post regulation period compared with those in the pre regulation period the cyanobacteria reached high peaks during spring late summer and autumn but had low abundances during mid summer in the post regulation period wt was slightly higher in the post regulation period 16 3 c than in the pre regulation period 16 0 c p 0 001 although ph values from may to august were high during the post regulation period they significantly decreased after the project p 0 001 all three n variables no3 po4 and sio2 diminished during the post regulation period p 0 001 among the g variables only rotifers had no significant differences between the two periods p 0 05 discharge the h variable showed similar seasonal patterns between both periods with lower magnitudes during the post regulation period than during the pre regulation period average water levels the other h variable outside summer were higher during the post regulation than during the pre regulation period 3 2 analysis of causal relationships between environmental drivers and phytoplankton populations using pls pm the reflective indicators for the four latent variables differed between the pre and post regulation periods secchi depth orthophosphate and rotifers were excluded and wt and nitrate were included as negative values for the pls pm in the pre regulation period and wt nitrate and cladocerans were excluded from the pls pm in the post regulation period the gof value of pls pm for the diatom biomass in the pre regulation period was the highest at 0 433 followed by cyanobacteria in the pre regulation period 0 425 and that for cyanobacteria 0 341 and diatoms 0 335 in the post regulation period significant direct effects of latent environmental variables on r variables diatoms and cyanobacteria were different between the pre and post regulation periods fig 4 a b only the physicochemical variables displayed significant positive effects 0 465 on diatoms in the pre regulation period whereas grazing and nutrient variables showed inhibitory effects 0 201 and 0 322 respectively on diatoms in the post regulation period although the inhibitory effects on cyanobacteria were suggested by both hydrological variables 0 150 and physicochemical variables 0 359 before regulation the physicochemical and nutrient variables positively affected cyanobacteria after regulation notably the effects of hydrological regimes on other environmental variables p g and n were low and became non significant in the post regulation period fig 4c d the negative effects of h on p in the pls pm for both diatoms and cyanobacteria decreased during post regulation and the positive effect of h on n in the pls pm for cyanobacteria also decreased the direct effects of h on g in the pls pm for both diatoms and cyanobacteria became insignificant in the post regulation period indicating that the influence of h on phytoplankton community dynamics weakened after regulation of the river water flows these changes in the interrelationships between environmental variables might indirectly affect the dynamics 3 3 analysis of driver importance and thresholds for diatom and cyanobacteria populations using hea hea evaluates successive generations of mutated and optimized models as a guide for the search for the overall fittest model within highly complex and diverse input relationships across long term data as a result the models learn and select key drivers based on their weight within the numerous data patterns over 1000 s of model generation runs reflected by the driver selection frequencies fig 5a shows the driver selection frequencies recorded for the 50 fittest hea models for diatoms indicating that wt and ph ranked the highest during pre regulation diatoms displayed a slight negative sensitivity for rising wts fig 5b whereas rising ph values corresponded with growing abundance fig 5c in contrast sio2 concentrations and rotifer densities ranked the highest as drivers of diatoms during the post regulation period fig 5a fig 5d indicates that sio2 was a limiting nutrient with the highest diatom abundances coinciding with the lowest sio2 concentrations as shown in fig 5f wt and secchi depths appeared to be key drivers for cyanobacteria during the pre regulation period the input sensitivities revealed that increases in both wt fig 5g and secchi depth fig 5h resulted in the growth of cyanobacteria during the post regulation period wt and po4 concentrations appeared to be key drivers for cyanobacteria with positive sensitivities for both variables fig 5i j the fittest models for diatoms developed by hea for both periods are shown in fig 6a d the model during the pre regulation period achieved an r2 0 52 and determined wt 18 7 c and ph 8 6 as threshold conditions for the high abundance of diatoms corresponding with the findings of the sensitivity analysis above the fittest model of diatoms during the post regulation period achieved an r2 0 56 and revealed rotifers 51 ind l 1 as the threshold condition for the highest abundance of diatoms the fittest models for cyanobacteria for both periods are shown in fig 6e h the model developed for the pre regulation period had an r2 0 59 fig 6e f and suggested wt 28 2 c as the threshold condition for the highest cyanobacteria abundance the fittest model for the post regulation period resulted in an r2 0 57 fig 6g h and identified 23 3 wt c 28 9 or po4 145 4 Âµg l 1 as threshold conditions for the high abundance of cyanobacteria 4 discussion 4 1 differences in phenology and interrelationships of environmental variables the low abundance of diatoms and cyanobacteria in the lower nakdong river during the post regulation period may have been caused by changes in multiple environmental stressors species that rely on natural flow regimes fluvial habitats and nutrient dynamics may be diminished by increased water levels reduced nutrient loads and discharge pringle et al 2000 da silva et al 2020 moreover reduced nutrient concentrations may also reduce phytoplankton growth several studies have addressed the declining effects of oligotrophication on phytoplankton populations in river systems hilt et al 2011 ibÃ¡Ã±ez et al 2012 additionally increased wt and consolidated zooplankton populations may also influence the phytoplankton dynamics to better understand and prevent unwanted shifts in the state of river ecosystems the complex effects of multiple stressors on phytoplankton need to be further investigated foley et al 2015 our pls pm models showed that the direct influences of hydrological variables on other environmental variables became weaker or even disappeared after river regulation consequently changes in habitat conditions impacted major phytoplankton communities riverine phytoplankton are known to be highly sensitive to changes in hydrology and phytoplankton communities have become reassembled due to river regulation da silva et al 2020 nutrient concentrations are exceedingly important for phytoplankton regulation in a lacustrine system whereas they are less important than in river systems hardenbicker et al 2014 however the causal relationships and response patterns of each variable in the post regulation period encompassed the direct effects of g and n on diatoms and cyanobacteria this means that the direct effect of discharge on phytoplankton is of relatively low importance and the main focus concerning plankton regulation in a regulated river system should be on grazing nutrient and physicochemical characteristics these changes in causalities indicate that flow regulation can significantly alter the underlying processes that shapes phytoplankton dynamics downstream 4 2 impacts on diatom population as the effect of h variables on p variables decreased and that on g variables became insignificant after flow regulation g and n variables appeared to be more inhibitive on diatoms than on other latent variables in the pre regulation period when diatoms could access the euphotic zone with water turbulence p variables were the only factors affecting their biomass directly however the zooplankton community and their grazing effect benefitted from hydrologically stable conditions gosselain et al 1998 keckeis et al 2003 and was reflected in the maintenance of their abundance in this study due to the changes in interrelationships defining habitat conditions diatom biomass significantly decreased and the peak events generally observed from autumn to winter disappeared this may be attributed to i high rotifer densities representing increased grazing pressure mainly influencing diatoms in spring autumn and ii reduced sio2 loads causing nutrient limitation for diatoms the input sensitivities from the hea models during the post regulation period can be explained by the limiting effects of sio2 and rotifers on diatoms displayed by their rapid sio2 consumption and grazing losses to rotifers diatoms are the only phytoplankton group that relies on sio2 as a nutrient with low discharge li et al 2017 as the concentrations of sio2 significantly decreased after the flow regulation they appeared to be deficient in terms of sustaining their population as much as before furthermore the threshold rotifers 51 ind l 1 as a condition for the high abundance of diatoms highlighted the importance of rotifers as key drivers under post regulation conditions these results correspond with the findings of kim et al 2000 and levine et al 1999 who suggested that microzooplankton such as rotifers achieved higher grazing rates on diatoms than macrozooplankton such as cladocerans and copepods interestingly only rotifers maintained their biomass among the biotic communities i e phytoplankton and zooplankton in the post regulation period thus consolidated zooplankton communities and limiting nutrient concentrations appeared to be the key drivers of diatoms rather than physicochemical factors in regulated rivers inferential modeling using hea identified water temperatures 18 7 c and ph 8 6 as conditions for high abundances of diatoms during the pre regulation period these results can be explained by the well known preference of diatoms for cool water temperatures in spring and autumn reynolds 2006 and are consistent with the observations of kim et al 2008 who identified 5 c in the field and 10 c in the laboratory as the optimum water temperatures for stephanodiscus sp from the nakdong river the ph threshold reflects the co2 consumption caused by photosynthesis during intensive algal growth shapiro 1990 as shown by the findings of the sensitivity analysis with rising ph in response to growing diatom abundance 4 3 impacts on cyanobacteria population with respect to cyanobacteria the effect of n variables became significant in the post regulation period instead of h variables which indicates that the hydrological characteristics of the nakdong river during this period are not limited and essentially support cyanobacterial development these changes in causal relationships might be attributed to a decrease in all nutrient concentrations after the river project kim et al 2020 suggested that decreasing trends in nutrients can alter algal development and phosphorus is the primary limiting nutrient for growth in the nakdong river although their biomass significantly decreased after flow regulation with the corresponding decreasing trends in nutrients it was found that their growing seasons were extended and two peaks occurred this may be because during the post regulation period i the long water residence time allowed early and high peaks in spring early summer despite low water temperatures ii po4 limitation prevented mid summer peaks and iii late summer peaks were triggered by monsoon instigated pulses of po4 concentrations higher than a threshold level the preference of cyanobacteria for calm and warm waters has been well documented across various climatic regions mowe et al 2015 yang et al 2016 scholz et al 2017 lÃ¼rling et al 2013 reported 29 2 c as the optimum water temperature for cyanobacteria growth based on laboratory experiments and 27 2 c as that for various freshwater systems the inferential models developed by hea identified high abundances of cyanobacteria at wt 28 2 c during the pre regulation period and at 23 3 wt 28 9 c as well as at po4 145 4 Âµg l 1 during the post regulation period the threshold condition of po4 145 4 Âµg l 1 for high cyanobacterial abundance is relevant for the monsoon season when spiking pulses of po4 concentrations triggered the highest cyanobacteria peak in the post regulation and pre regulation period since 2011 advanced wastewater treatment facilities implemented in river catchments have successfully diminished the average po4 concentration in rivers however the highest non point nutrient loads to the nakdong river have always occurred during the korean monsoon season from july to september coinciding with the growing season of cyanobacteria reza et al 2016 pulses of average po4 concentrations during summer in the post regulation period were in the range of 200 250 Âµg l 1 maintaining po4 concentrations below 140 Âµg l 1 during the monsoon season appears to be a realistic and feasible management goal to avoid extreme bloom events of cyanobacteria such as those observed in 2011 and 2012 5 conclusions our study analyzed changes in the underlying causal relationships between multiple environmental variables and associated mechanisms that determine the biomass of diatoms and cyanobacteria under the influence of river regulation the outcomes of this study revealed the following effects of flow regulation on the nakdong river flow regulated alterations in physicochemical habitat conditions resulted in lower risks of severe diatom blooms between autumn and spring and distinct blooms of cyanobacteria in summer showing significantly lower biomass after the river project flow regulation consolidated the zooplankton community strengthening the biological control mechanisms on diatoms with a threshold of rotifer densities of 51 1 ind l 1 occasional bloom events of cyanobacteria in late summer may still be triggered by po4 pulses with concentrations exceeding 145 4 l 1 during the monsoon season which are not prevented by current flow regulation strategies even though the outcomes are specific to the nakdong river they may also improve the understanding of the ecological implications of river regulation in general and aid sustainable river management future research will extend this study by focusing on the role of bacterioplankton benthic macroinvertebrates and planktivorous fish in the context of river regulation to attain ecological integrity funding

16528,in this paper a new regional methodological approach for determining direct and indirect emissions from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is proposed additionally an entire territorial wastewater treatment service located in the northern italy and serving 411 484 pe was assessed the most accurate emission factor identification is presented using appropriate on site measurements

per the size of the plants the most impactful categories were identified for indirect emissions associated with dissolved ghgs discharged in the surface water body and due to energy consumption which

carbon and circular economy regional policy ec 2014 and actions to decarbonise urban water management can have a relevant impact ballard et al 2018 especially when territorial pathways are developed in recent years environmental legislations such as the urban wastewater treatment directive uwwtd directive 91 271 ec currently under revision introduced more stringent quality standards for the effluents of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps that led to increase in energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg emissions gu et al 2016 in many european countries urban water cycle accounts for 1 3 of the total electric energy consumption longo et al 2016 and 3 10 of the global warming potential gwp by contributing towards ghg emissions into the atmosphere both as direct and indirect footprints samuelsson et al 2018 as per the u s environmental protection agency epa the emissions of co2 ch4 and n2o constitute the largest part of cf of wwtps and global ghg emissions of the wastewater sector are predicted to increase by up to 27 by 2030 caniani et al 2019 huang et al 2020 in this context several national and international initiatives and activities have been started to support the transition to low carbon regions and urban water utility wacclim 2020 crippa et al 2019 in italy the national regulatory authority for energy networks and environment arera 2017 introduced the carbon footprint of the wastewater treatment service as one of the key performance indicators to analyse and assess the technical quality standard of the activities carried out by water utilities on one hand this regulatory driver can make a substantial shift towards the low carbon water utilities on the other hand the authority could only guide the operators by indicating the adoption of the general iso 14 064 1 2019 in fact while for energy audits a standardised european methodology was developed in the h2020 project enerwater to assess the energy footprint of wwtps longo et al 2019 for cf same standard approach is missing today several tools and software have been developed in recent years to quantify cf although they do not follow any specific normalised or standard methodologies mannina et al 2016 moreover one of the most critical aspects is the appropriate identification of representative and validated emission factors efs in fact some referenced databases were developed to collect and update the efs mainly at the international or national level such as emission factor database efdb by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc nevertheless the wastewater sector is typically characterised by wide local variations in influent characteristics and different process parameters or operative conditions vasilaki et al 2019 therefore site specific efs need to be considered parravicini et al 2016 through long term sampling campaigns especially for evaluating direct emissions from the main processes and indirect dissolved ghgs present in the final effluents this paper goes beyong the current state of the art because a new normalised methodological approach according to the guidelines of iso 14 064 wweecarb is proposed for the determination both of direct and indirect emissions in wwtps and of the overall cf of regional wastewater service carried out by a water utility most of the considered emissions factors were validated by site specific measurements campaigns and emissions categories included both fossil and biogenic origin of the main ghgs this validated approach can contribute to the standardization of the methodology for carbon footprint assessment in wastewater treatment service and to identify mitigation actions and priorities for regional decarbonisation this methodology was applied to territorial wastewater service 52 municipalities and 1376 km2s located in the northern italy 411 484 pe managed by a single public owned water utility the most accurate ef identification is presented by using the real operational data and appropriate measurements of emitted and dissolved ghgs from different operational units of 12 wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 general guideline iso 14 064 1 iso standard iso 14064 1 2019 provides specifications with guidance at the organization level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals several aspects and steps should be followed to apply the iso standard at organisation level 1 reporting boundaries should be defined 2 direct and indirect emissions must be aggregated into inventory categories including direct emissions and removals and indirect emissions from imported energy transportation products used by the organisation associated with the use of products from the organisation and other sources and 3 different ghgs i e co2 ch4 n2o nf3 and sf6 associated with the type of organisation have to be separately quantified and 4 anthropogenic biogenic non anthropogenic biogenic or fossil origin of co2 should be distinguished moreover cf determination should be annually referred and the result should be reported in tonnes of co2eq using appropriate gwps towprayoon et al 2019 finally based on the general principles of consistency and accuracy iso 14 064 1 requires the definition of quantitative and or qualitative uncertainty associated with the method used for the quantification of the emissions 2 2 description of the territorial wastewater service the proposed approach was applied to determine the cf of wastewater services in the region managed by the italian water utility alto trevigiano servizi consisting of 52 municipalities in the province of treviso italy with a total served population of 411 484 pe the regional wastewater treatment service is operated by 5 wwtps with a design treatment capacity of more than 40 000 pe by 3 wwtps with the capacities range of 15 000 40 000 pe 27 wwtps with less than 15 000 pe capacity and 28 septic tanks the representative wwtps to be monitored over the long term were selected by considering both the treatment capacity of the wwtps and the representative characteristics therefore site specific ef measurements were carried out in 12 wwtps 8 wwtps with capacities higher than 15 000 pe and 4 smaller wwtps covering approximately 90 of the total served population the characteristics of these wwtps in terms of process configuration influent loads and removals efficiencies are summarized in table 1 the selected wwtps included both conventional activated sludge in the modified ludzack ettinger mle configuration n 10 and intermittent aeration ia processes n 2 the innovative technology of short cut enhanced nutrients abatement scena n 1 https www smart plant eu for the nitrite treatment of nutrient rich anaerobic rejected liquor from the sludge line was studied all the aerated units of different water and sludge lines aerated degritting unit biological reactor aerobic stabilisation via nitrite supernatant treatment and biofilter were monitored the operation data were collected for all the plants over one whole year the cf results of the monitored wwtps were reported as the entire data tonco2eq y and specific coefficients scf tonco2eq pe y scfs were used to quantify the ghg impacts of the unselected wwtps septic tank emissions were also calculated according to the methodology mentioned in towprayoon et al 2019 considering proposed efs for both direct and indirect contributions of the dissolved ghgs in the effluent 2 3 direct emissions and dissolved gases measurements campaigns each selected wwtp was monitored for one month during the on site campaign aerated points were considered as direct emission sources aerated de sanding units aerobic biological processes aerobic stabilisations of sludge and biofilters measurements were performed for at least one week in each sampling unit monitoring was continuously carried out for the biggest wwtps wwtp1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and discontinuously for the smaller ones wwtp7 8 9 10 11 and 12 experimental equipment for the analysis of direct ghg mainly consisted of two devices for continuous measurements the gas analyser mir 9000 cld type envea it with a membrane air dryer mgf sky 30 7 m was used under controlled thermal conditions with the online acquisition of emitted ghg concentrations one data every 5 min the measurements of ch4 co2 and n2o were performed using the standard infrared absorption unichim method and istisan 91 41 report the system was also calibrated each week using gas cylinders at the standard concentrations ch4 at 40 6 ppm co2 at 2 33 and n2o at 160 ppm the gaseous samples were conveyed to the analyser through a heated gas line at 120 c a cooling device hiref solution https hiref it was used to reduce the temperature of the gases to 4 c thus minimising the water vapour content every 3 h a compressor was activated for ambient air sampling as a zero reference in addition a floating chamber was used to convey the samples to the analyser for the design and construction of the chamber guideline indications reported for similar measurements were followed spinelli et al 2018 caniani et al 2019 kwok et al 2015 the floating system was made from high density polyethylene with a total volume of 310 l and a bottom area of 1 m2 some specific sampling campaigns were carried out in the discontinuous mode for wwtps with less than 25 000 pe capacity specifically peristaltic pump and gas bags 5 l were used to acquire the gaseous samples three replicates for each point subsequently ghg concentrations were determined using photoacoustic spectroscopy brÃ¼el kjaer multi gas monitor type 1302 moreover composite liquid samples from the influent and effluent of each wwtp were collected twice a week the dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o were measured to calculate the possible indirect emissions of the ghg mass loads discharged in the water bodies in this case it was assumed that the dissolved gases are totally stripped after the discharge in the water body since the fate of dissolved ghgs is not uniquely predictable the hypothesis allows to be conservative for the footprint calculation stripping the pre treatment at 20 c ultrasonic sonication sonorex model followed by photoacoustic spectroscopy determination brÃ¼el kjaer multi gas monitor type 1302 were carried out finally the main conventional physical and chemical characterisations chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp of the wastewaters were analysed apha 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 audit of predictive tool and models technical and scientific literature shows that several tools and software solutions have been developed for different purposes simple stationary i e carbon footprint calculation tool cfct or dynamic calculations mannina et al 2016 have been proposed in recent decades table 2 simulation models models 6 7 8 and 9 were implemented to calculate the emissions generated mainly from biological processes such as activated sludge model asm and benchmark simulation model bsm while specific tools were implemented for determining the cf of a single wwtp tools 1 2 and 3 or for the entire water and wastewater service tools 4 5 and 10 direct emissions in most of these existing tools are mainly considered from the biological processes of the water line and only in some few cases from biogas production other aerated stages such as degritting units aerobic stabilisations of sludge biofilters and anaerobic supernatant treatments are not usually considered notwithstanding their wide impact on the global emissions of the plants demir et al 2019 moreover most of the analysed models and tools focus mainly on direct n2o emissions while ch4 is generally considered only from the sludge line nevertheless depending on the wastewater treatment configurations and influent characteristics methane emissions could also represent a relevant contribution to the mainstream water line even higher than n2o emissions zhan et al 2017 moreover co2 concentrations have typically accounted only for the fossil origin while biogenic part derived from microbial respiration during the biological processes has usually not been quantified finally only a few studies have considered the dissolved fractions in the liquid of the gases even when their contributions seemed relevant in fact the last report of the european commission jrc 2020 also underlined the importance of considering the ghg impacts of an integrated system including sewer network wastewater treatment sludge disposal and final discharge into water bodies additionally even when emissions sources are located outside the physical boundaries of the wwtps they are strictly associated with the water utility management choices thus indirect impacts due to energy consumption chemical dosing transport and waste disposal have to be considered in wastewater cf assessment brown et al 2010 currently in the existing models efs are usually set by using internal libraries without the possibility of editing default values and considering case specific factors which are crucial to achieve real evidence based results in heterogeneous sectors such as the wastewater treatment service a few applications included co2eq mitigations such as carbon sequestration from the soils and substitution of mineral fertiliser when sludge is applied in agriculture fields in contrast normalised approach proposed in this study wweecarb was applied to the entire wastewater service considering 1 all main ghgs both biogenic and of fossil origin 2 direct emissions generated from different operational units of the wwtp 3 indirect emissions due to energy and chemical consumptions and transportation 4 dissolved gases present in the effluent 5 emissions and removals related to sludge disposal and reuse and 6 editable efs derived from both onsite measurement campaigns and technical literature libraries finally the standard deviations of efs were considered to evaluate the uncertainty and accuracy of the cf results 3 2 proposed methodology for carbon footprint estimation in wastewater service the methodology was developed based on iso 14 064 1 2019 standard and adapted to a wastewater service with systemic and territorial approaches in this context the operational control principle defined by uni iso 14 064 1 2019 was applied as a reporting boundary criterion for cf quantification the reporting boundaries were set considering 1 the physical operative limits of the wwtps to define the direct emissions 2 impacts of energy and chemical supplies 3 waste and reagent transportations and 4 emissions caused by the final sludge disposal or recovery valorisation specifically direct emissions included the ghgs from i biogas combustion ii different aerated units aerated degritting unit biological reactor aerobic sludge stabilisation and biofilter of the wwtp and iii fugitive gases of the sludge line in contrast emissions from the dissolved gases on the water body energy and chemical consumptions transportation and sludge disposal were considered as indirect the indirect emissions from sludge reuse and related mitigations such as carbon sequestration and synthetic fertiliser substitution were estimated cf was calculated based on the contribution of three main ghgs methane carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide nguyen et al 2019 each relevant ghg contribution fossil or biogenic co2 was distinguished based on the origin of the emission table 3 emissions were determined based on eq 1 1 e m i s s

assessment report ar5 towprayoon et al 2019 in general activity data ad represents the quantity generated or used of energy mass or volume representing the key parameter for each emission category the types of ad considered in this study are listed in table 4 the efs used were collected from the literature guidelines and databases or measured with specific on site campaigns table 4 and fig 1 the logical flow scheme of the proposed approach according to iso 14 064 1 is reported in fig 2 the overall calculation of cf considering the on site measured emissions was carried out by following several phases 1 elaboration of 1 year plant operation data of 12 wwtps such as temperature wastewater flowrate airflow rate influent and effluent cod and tn mass loads 2 calculation of the mass loads of emitted co2 ch4 and n2o 3 normalisation at 20 c and 4 conversion into co2 equivalent 3 3 measurement campaigns direct emitted ghg concentrations results from the measurement campaigns showed concentration variability in ghgs emitted from the biological processes of different wwtps as reported in previously literature studies tumendelger et al 2019 the average values of n2o concentrations were less than 4 mg m3 of air for the largest wwtps wwtp1 6 while they ranged from 4 to 15 mg m3 for the smallest plants wwtp7 12 fig 2 a similar behaviour was observed for co2 quantification values lower than 5 g co2 m3 were detected for the largest wwtps and in the range of 7 16 g co2 m3 in other cases fig 2 especially for n2o emissions the difference in the contributions of the largest wwtps could be justified by the usually higher efficiencies of the aeration systems and more elevated removals as reported by valkova et al 2020 in contrast for directly emitted ch4 concentrations a strict correlation was not identified with the size of the wwtps fig 3 furthermore an important relationship was observed during the rain events that occurred during the sampling campaigns it was evident example shown for wwtp1 in fig 3 that wet periods affected the direct ghg emissions with higher concentrations mainly for n2o and ch4 both emitting from the aerated degritting units and biological processes it can be noticed that the emitted ch4 and n2o detected during the rain events were more than 3 6 times higher than the those detected during the dry period fig 4 a c b and d these variations were probably dependent on sewage system characteristics and a corresponding increase in the dissolved gases in the influent flow during the rain events urban sewer systems can cause several contaminant degradations which can generate dissolved gaseous sub products as previously reported by jin et al 2019 moreover from the measurement campaigns the directly emitted ghg concentrations were also found to be spatially varying at different points of the same biological reactor as discussed by pan et al 2016 for wwtp5 the average emitted concentrations at the beginning and end of the aerobic reaction volume decreased from 6 17 mgn2o m3 50 41 mgch4 m3 and 5 2 gco2 m3 to 3 5 mgn2o m3 22 28 mg ch4 m3 and 5 2 g co2 m3 respectively it was observed that for n2o and ch4 higher concentrations were observed in the initial section of the reaction volume where the influent macro contaminant mass loads cod and tn were also probably higher on the other hand co2 concentrations mainly generated from biomass respiration remained almost stable throughout the entire biological unit zhan et al 2017 for the calculation of the emitted mass loads average concentrations of ghgs for each unit were considered 3 4 measured direct emissions factors ghg loads were calculated from the measured concentrations and normalised to identify different efs reported in terms of average values and standard deviations in figs 5 6 and 7 for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively biological treatment was typically characterised by the highest emissions with the values ranging from 6 7 10 8 to 0 02 kg n2o kgnrem 2 2 10 8 to 0 003 kg ch4 kgcodin and 1 8 10 5 to 3 1 kg co2 kgcodrem it was also observed that the ef values were inversely proportional to the wwtp size resulting in higher specific values for the smallest wwtps wwtp7 12 in the short cut biological process treating nutrient rich anaerobic rejected liquor via nitrite resulted in significantly high efs in terms of n2o 0 27 kg n2o kgtnrem while ch4 and co2 impacts were consistent with other biological treatments aerated degritting units showed the values of less than 2 6 10 4 kg n2o kgnrem in the range of 1 3 10 4 1 5 10 3 kg ch4 kgcodin and 4 1 10 3 0 1 kgco2 kgcodrem aerated sludge stabilisation measured with a continuous monitoring campaign for wwtp 6 yielded the efs for co2 1 3 10 3 kg co2 kgts higher than those of n2o and ch4 8 9 10 8 kg n2o kgts and 3 8 10 7 kg ch4 kgts respectively finally for biofilters the normalised values per cubic meter of the treated air changed from 1 2 10 6 to 6 10 6 kg n2o m3 2 6 10 5 to 7 5 10 5 kg ch4 m3 and 4 10 4 to 8 3 10 4 kg co2 m3 highlighting the significant impact of methane on the final global emission from these air treatment units 3 5 measured indirect emission factors the dissolved ghg concentrations in the effluents of the wwtps varied in the range of 0 2 24 mg l for n2o 0 1 1 mg l for ch4 and 1 8 52 mg l for co2 specifically for the largest wwtps from 1 to 6 the average values were 4 6 9 4 mg l for n2o 0 4 0 3 mg l for ch4 and 30 19 mg l for co2 meanwhile the values were generally found to be lower and respectively equal to 0 8 0 5 0 3 0 2 and 16 4 2 5 mg l for the smaller wwtps from 7 to 12 scientific literature on the measured values of dissolved ghgs in the effluents of wwtps is scarce in general these values have been found to range from 0 009 to 24 mg l for n2o 0 009 to 4 5 mg l for ch4 and 245 to 1352 mg l for co2 caniani et al 2019 masuda et al 2015 2018 vieira et al 2019 this variability indicates the need for site specific campaigns for properly evaluating the indirect emissions due to dissolved ghg contributions moreover during the sampling campaigns dissolved ghgs in the influent streams of the wwtps from the sewage systems were monitored specifically in the largest wwtps from 1 to 6 the dissolved ghg influent concentrations were found to be 12 5 26 1 1 1 2 and 76 86 mg l for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively while the values were found to be 0 5 0 4 mg n2o l 0 3 0 2 mg ch4 l and 50 16 mg co2 l for the smaller wwtps from 7 to 12 these aspects indicated that a relevant contribution of dissolved ghg comes directly from the sewage networks especially for plants with higher capacities furthermore for smaller wwtps the dissolved ghg concentrations in the effluent were higher than those of the influent stream this confirmed that for smaller wwtps which are usually subjected to more limiting operative conditions such as low carbon nitrogen c n ratio unstable or optimised process parameters and inefficient aeration supply kumar et al 2021 additional contributions of ghgs were generated during the biological processes which remained dissolved in the liquid stream the efs of dissolved ghg emission category varied in the ranges of 33 782 g n2o kgneff 4 132 g ch4 kgcodeff and 553 358 g co2 kgcodeff for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively table 5 the standard deviations of the dissolved ghg efs obtained for the six continuously monitored wwtps were significantly relevant and heterogeneous ranging from 34 to 136 with respect to the average values moreover the ef values were found to be inversely proportional to the wwtp size resulting in the higher specific factors for the smallest wwtps table 5 3 6 specific ghg contributions on measured direct and dissolved emissions the main contributions of different ghgs to the direct and dissolved emission categories were calculated as a percentage of the total emissions fig 8 the reported percentages of different ghg contributions were expressed as the percentage of equivalent co2 the values as the gaseous flows were directly transferred to the atmosphere showed that the main impacts were attributed to co2 for smaller plants 15 000 pe while n2o was the main responsible in largest wwtps 15 000 pe on the other hand ch4 emissions accounted for about 11 12 for all the sizes for indirect emissions into the water body the main contributor was n2o followed by co2 and ch4 3 7 carbon footprint results after the long term sampling periods the entire cf of each selected wwtp was calculated by adding the different contributions of the categories based on the normalised proposed approach table 6 the final values ranged from a minimum 210 tonco2eq y wwtp10 to a maximum 4047 tonco2eq y wwtp 3 in general the most impactful categories fig 9 were the indirect emissions associated with dissolved ghgs present in the water body which influenced 13 70 of the cf of each wwtp indirect emissions due to energy consumption accounted for 10 40 and as expected this category is directly related to the carbon and nitrogen removed loads in the different wwtps table 6 moreover direct emissions from treatment processes contribution approximately 19 on an average the disposal of sewage sludge and use of chemicals affected 6 34 and 1 9 respectively the impacts and their variabilities especially for direct and dissolved ghg contributions further underlined the already discussed importance of the measurement campaigns to obtain more appropriate and proper data for the specific conditions of each plant the scfs of the wwtps were finally calculated and were found to be between 0 04 and 0 20 tonco2eq pe y fig 10 the obtained scfs were indirectly dependent on the size of the plants and were more widely distributed for the wwtps with less than 15 000 pe capacity similarly the average scfs were found to be 0 091 0 038 tonco2eq pe y for the wwtps with more than 15 000 pe capacity and 0 153 0 045 tonco2eq pe y for smaller facilities these scf results were found to be more variable and almost 1 7 times higher than those of the larger size 15 000 pe notwithstanding that the calculation procedure was not perfectly comparable these results were consistent with those mentioned in other published research which reported the values in the range of 0 07 0 108 tonco2eq pe y gustavsson and tumlin 2013 0 023 0 1 tonco2eq pe y maktabifard et al 2020 and 0 062 0 161 tonco2eq pe y mamais et al 2015 the cf was finally extended at the regional level including for all plants managed by the water utility as well as the septic tanks resulting in 2396 and 1588 tonco2eq y emitted by the non monitored wwtps and septic tanks respectively yielding a total territorial cf of the wastewater service of 28 137 8497 tonco2eq y biogenic co2 had a 25 impact on total cf the highest contribution to territorial cf was from wwtps with more than 15 000 pe capacity accounting for 68 nevertheless the presence of several minor plants should be considered as their contributions were not found to be negligible with the impacts of 16 from the plants with capacities ranging from 15 000 to 5000 pe and 10 for the smaller wwtps finally septic tank emissions accounted for 6 to the total cf 4 conclusion regional cf of wastewater treatment service was determined by properly applying for the first time the methodology iso14064 1 to identify specific emission categories the proposed new evidence based methodology enables the calculation of the carbon footprint accounting all the emissions categories in clear operational and reporting boundaries within cities and regions the calculations were validated measuring the most impacting categories of direct and dissolved ghgs emissions with specific sampling campaigns the uncertainties related to the efs let to long term on site measurements of relevant ghgs in fact calculations carried out using only the available efs mentioned in the guidelines may significantly differ from the actual site conditions the measurement campaigns mentioned in this study enabled us to define the site specific efs for the main direct sources from the treatment processes degritting units aerobic biological treatments biofilters and aerobic sludge stabilisations in 12 different sized wwtps furthermore dissolved ghgs discharged in the final water bodies were analysed and were found to significantly impact the entire cf quantification the results in terms of the efs average values and standard deviations showed a high variability in the emissions based on the wwtp size and specific operative conditions especially for biological processes the average values were found to be 3 4 10 3 kgn2o kgtnrem 1 7 10 3 kgch4 kgcodin and 1 1 kgco2 kgcodrem for the smallest 15 000 pe wwtps on the other hand the biggest 15 000 pe wwtp efs resulted in 6 6 10 4 kgn2o kgtnrem 2 7 10 4 kgch4 kgcodin and 0 07 kgco2 kgcodrem the analytical campaigns of this study also highlighted that biogenic co2 emitted from the biological processes significantly impacted the global cf of the 12 wwtps accounting for 35 66 of the total directly emitted co2eq the overall territorial cf of the wastewater service was 28 137 8497 tonco2eq y including of the non monitored wwtps and septic tanks the most impacting categories for most plants were i indirect emissions associated with the dissolved ghgs present in the water body ii indirect emissions due to energy consumption followed by iii direct emissions from treatment processes iv disposal of sewage sludge and v use of chemicals finally this approach can support territorial water utilities not only to assess their carbon footprint with normalized approach but also to develop regional mitigation scenarios and decisions towards low carbon water utilities in fact since the specific carbon footprint coefficients change based on the plants size mitigation actions could consider the population distribution in the territory and both centralized and decentralized systems moreover mitigations for wastewater service decarbonisation according to the shown most impacting emission categories could be prioritised as following 1 acquire renewable energy sources to reduce the indirect emissions from fossil primary energy production 2 optimize efficiency and kinetics of biological removal of organic and nutrients loads and aeration efficiency in order to reduce dissolved ghgs in the final effluent 3 reduce direct emissions mainly avoiding uncontrolled transitory phases or limiting operative conditions in the biological reactors 4 promote less impacting sludge disposal destination especially avoiding landfill and 5 use chemical reagents characterized by lower emission factors for their primary production the proposed methodological approach coupled with accurately planned site specific long term measurement campaigns could further boost and address the decarbonization of the wastewater service in territories

16528,in this paper a new regional methodological approach for determining direct and indirect emissions from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is proposed additionally an entire territorial wastewater treatment service located in the northern italy and serving 411 484 pe was assessed the most accurate emission factor identification is presented using appropriate on site measurements monitoring different aerated operational units and sampling several streams in 12 relevant wwtps of different treatment capacities ranging from 3000 to 73 000 pe dissolved greenhouse gas ghg concentrations from 0 2 to 24 mgn2o l 0 1 to 1 mgch4 l and 1 8 to 52 mgco2 l in effluent flows were detected specific carbon footprints resulted in the emissions of 0 04 0 20 tonco2eq pe y varying as per the size of the plants the most impactful categories were identified for indirect emissions associated with dissolved ghgs discharged in the surface water body and due to energy consumption which accounted for 13 70 and 10 40 respectively the overall territorial carbon footprint of the wastewater treatment service was also quantified to provide evidence based decision support system dss and

westweb water energy sustainability tool wweecarb water and waste environmental engineering carbon footprint wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction several regions are working towards low carbon and circular economy regional policy ec 2014 and actions to decarbonise urban water management can have a relevant impact ballard et al 2018 especially when territorial pathways are developed in recent years environmental legislations such as the urban wastewater treatment directive uwwtd directive 91 271 ec currently under revision introduced more stringent quality standards for the effluents of the wastewater treatment plants wwtps that led to increase in energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg emissions gu et al 2016 in many european countries urban water cycle accounts for 1 3 of the total electric energy consumption longo et al 2016 and 3 10 of the global warming potential gwp by contributing towards ghg emissions into the atmosphere both as direct and indirect footprints samuelsson et al 2018 as per the u s environmental protection agency epa the emissions of co2 ch4 and n2o constitute the largest part of cf of wwtps and global ghg emissions of the wastewater sector are predicted to increase by up to 27 by 2030 caniani et al 2019 huang et al 2020 in this context several national and international initiatives and activities have been started to support the transition to low carbon regions and urban water utility wacclim 2020 crippa et al 2019 in italy the national regulatory authority for energy networks and environment arera 2017 introduced the carbon footprint of the wastewater treatment service as one of the key performance indicators to analyse and assess the technical quality standard of the activities carried out by water utilities on one hand this regulatory driver can make a substantial shift towards the low carbon water utilities on the other hand the authority could only guide the operators by indicating the adoption of the general iso 14 064 1 2019 in fact while for energy audits a standardised european methodology was developed in the h2020 project enerwater to assess the energy footprint of wwtps longo et al 2019 for cf same standard approach is missing today several tools and software have been developed in recent years to quantify cf although they do not follow any specific normalised or standard methodologies mannina et al 2016 moreover one of the most critical aspects is the appropriate identification of representative and validated emission factors efs in fact some referenced databases were developed to collect and update the efs mainly at the international or national level such as emission factor database efdb by intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc nevertheless the wastewater sector is typically characterised by wide local variations in influent characteristics and different process parameters or operative conditions vasilaki et al 2019 therefore site specific efs need to be considered parravicini et al 2016 through long term sampling campaigns especially for evaluating direct emissions from the main processes and indirect dissolved ghgs present in the final effluents this paper goes beyong the current state of the art because a new normalised methodological approach according to the guidelines of iso 14 064 wweecarb is proposed for the determination both of direct and indirect emissions in wwtps and of the overall cf of regional wastewater service carried out by a water utility most of the considered emissions factors were validated by site specific measurements campaigns and emissions categories included both fossil and biogenic origin of the main ghgs this validated approach can contribute to the standardization of the methodology for carbon footprint assessment in wastewater treatment service and to identify mitigation actions and priorities for regional decarbonisation this methodology was applied to territorial wastewater service 52 municipalities and 1376 km2s located in the northern italy 411 484 pe managed by a single public owned water utility the most accurate ef identification is presented by using the real operational data and appropriate measurements of emitted and dissolved ghgs from different operational units of 12 wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 general guideline iso 14 064 1 iso standard iso 14064 1 2019 provides specifications with guidance at the organization level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals several aspects and steps should be followed to apply the iso standard at organisation level 1 reporting boundaries should be defined 2 direct and indirect emissions must be aggregated into inventory categories including direct emissions and removals and indirect emissions from imported energy transportation products used by the organisation associated with the use of products from the organisation and other sources and 3 different ghgs i e co2 ch4 n2o nf3 and sf6 associated with the type of organisation have to be separately quantified and 4 anthropogenic biogenic non anthropogenic biogenic or fossil origin of co2 should be distinguished moreover cf determination should be annually referred and the result should be reported in tonnes of co2eq using appropriate gwps towprayoon et al 2019 finally based on the general principles of consistency and accuracy iso 14 064 1 requires the definition of quantitative and or qualitative uncertainty associated with the method used for the quantification of the emissions 2 2 description of the territorial wastewater service the proposed approach was applied to determine the cf of wastewater services in the region managed by the italian water utility alto trevigiano servizi consisting of 52 municipalities in the province of treviso italy with a total served population of 411 484 pe the regional wastewater treatment service is operated by 5 wwtps with a design treatment capacity of more than 40 000 pe by 3 wwtps with the capacities range of 15 000 40 000 pe 27 wwtps with less than 15 000 pe capacity and 28 septic tanks the representative wwtps to be monitored over the long term were selected by considering both the treatment capacity of the wwtps and the representative characteristics therefore site specific ef measurements were carried out in 12 wwtps 8 wwtps with capacities higher than 15 000 pe and 4 smaller wwtps covering approximately 90 of the total served population the characteristics of these wwtps in terms of process configuration influent loads and removals efficiencies are summarized in table 1 the selected wwtps included both conventional activated sludge in the modified ludzack ettinger mle configuration n 10 and intermittent aeration ia

tonco2eq pe y scfs were used to quantify the ghg impacts of the unselected wwtps septic tank emissions were also calculated according to the methodology mentioned in towprayoon et al 2019 considering proposed efs for both direct and indirect contributions of the dissolved ghgs in the effluent 2 3 direct emissions and dissolved gases measurements campaigns each selected wwtp was monitored for one month during the on site campaign aerated points were considered as direct emission sources aerated de sanding units aerobic biological processes aerobic stabilisations of sludge and biofilters measurements were performed for at least one week in each sampling unit monitoring was continuously carried out for the biggest wwtps wwtp1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and discontinuously for the smaller ones wwtp7 8 9 10 11 and 12 experimental equipment for the analysis of direct ghg mainly consisted of two devices for continuous measurements the gas analyser mir 9000 cld type envea it with a membrane air dryer mgf sky 30 7 m was used under controlled thermal conditions with the online acquisition of emitted ghg concentrations one data every 5 min the measurements of ch4 co2 and n2o were performed using the standard infrared absorption unichim method and istisan 91 41 report the system was also calibrated each week using gas cylinders at the standard concentrations ch4 at 40 6 ppm co2 at 2 33 and n2o at 160 ppm the gaseous samples were conveyed to the analyser through a heated gas line at 120 c a cooling device hiref solution https hiref it was used to reduce the temperature of the gases to 4 c thus minimising the water vapour content every 3 h a compressor was activated for ambient air sampling as a zero reference in addition a floating chamber was used to convey the samples to the analyser for the design and construction of the chamber guideline indications reported for similar measurements were followed spinelli et al 2018 caniani et al 2019 kwok et al 2015 the floating system was made from high density polyethylene with a total volume of 310 l and a bottom area of 1 m2 some specific sampling campaigns were carried out in the discontinuous mode for wwtps with less than 25 000 pe capacity specifically peristaltic pump and gas bags 5 l were used to acquire the gaseous samples three replicates for each point subsequently ghg concentrations were determined using photoacoustic spectroscopy brÃ¼el kjaer multi gas monitor type 1302 moreover composite liquid samples from the influent and effluent of each wwtp were collected twice a week the dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o were measured to calculate the possible indirect emissions of the ghg mass loads discharged in the water bodies in this case it was assumed that the dissolved gases are totally stripped after the discharge in the water body since the fate of dissolved ghgs is not uniquely predictable the hypothesis allows to be conservative for the footprint calculation stripping the pre treatment at 20 c ultrasonic sonication sonorex model followed by photoacoustic spectroscopy determination brÃ¼el kjaer multi gas monitor type 1302 were carried out finally the main conventional physical and chemical characterisations chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp of the wastewaters were analysed apha 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 audit of predictive tool and models technical and scientific literature shows that several tools and software solutions have been developed for different purposes simple stationary i e carbon footprint calculation tool cfct or dynamic calculations mannina et al 2016 have been proposed in recent decades table 2 simulation models models 6 7 8 and 9 were implemented to calculate the emissions generated mainly from biological processes such as activated sludge model asm and benchmark simulation model bsm while specific tools were implemented for determining the cf of a single wwtp tools 1 2 and 3 or for the entire water and wastewater service tools 4 5 and 10 direct emissions in most of these existing tools are mainly considered from the biological processes of the water line and only in some few cases from biogas production other aerated stages such as degritting units aerobic stabilisations of sludge biofilters and anaerobic supernatant treatments are not usually considered notwithstanding their wide impact on the global emissions of the plants demir et al 2019 moreover most of the analysed models and tools focus mainly on direct n2o emissions while ch4 is generally considered only from the sludge line nevertheless depending on the wastewater treatment configurations and influent characteristics methane emissions could also represent a relevant contribution to the mainstream water line even higher than n2o emissions zhan et al 2017 moreover co2 concentrations have typically accounted only for the fossil origin while biogenic part derived from microbial respiration during the biological processes has usually not been quantified finally only a few studies have considered the dissolved fractions in the liquid of the gases even when their contributions seemed relevant in fact the last report of the european commission jrc 2020 also underlined the importance of considering the ghg impacts of an integrated system including sewer network wastewater treatment sludge disposal and final discharge into water bodies additionally even when emissions sources are located outside the physical boundaries of the wwtps they are strictly associated with the water utility management choices thus indirect impacts due to energy consumption chemical dosing transport and waste disposal have to be considered in wastewater cf assessment brown et al 2010 currently in the existing models efs are usually set by using internal libraries without the possibility of editing default values and considering case specific factors which are crucial to achieve real evidence based results in heterogeneous sectors such as the wastewater treatment service a few applications included co2eq mitigations such as carbon sequestration from the soils and substitution of mineral fertiliser when sludge is applied in agriculture fields in contrast normalised approach proposed in this study wweecarb was applied to the entire wastewater service considering 1 all main ghgs both biogenic and of fossil origin 2 direct emissions generated from different operational units of the wwtp 3 indirect emissions due to energy and chemical consumptions and transportation 4 dissolved gases present in the effluent 5 emissions and removals related to sludge disposal and reuse and 6 editable efs derived from both onsite measurement campaigns and technical literature libraries finally the standard deviations of efs were considered to evaluate the uncertainty and accuracy of the cf results 3 2 proposed methodology for carbon footprint estimation in wastewater service the methodology was developed based on iso 14 064 1 2019 standard and adapted to a wastewater service with systemic and territorial approaches in this context the operational control principle defined by uni iso 14 064 1 2019 was applied as a reporting boundary criterion for cf quantification the reporting boundaries were set considering 1 the physical operative limits of the wwtps to define the direct emissions 2 impacts of energy and chemical supplies 3 waste and reagent transportations and 4 emissions caused by the final sludge disposal or recovery valorisation specifically direct emissions included the ghgs from i biogas combustion ii different aerated units aerated degritting unit biological reactor aerobic sludge stabilisation and biofilter of the wwtp and iii fugitive gases of the sludge line in contrast emissions from the dissolved gases on the water body energy and chemical consumptions transportation and sludge disposal were considered as indirect the indirect emissions from sludge reuse and related mitigations such as carbon sequestration and synthetic fertiliser substitution were estimated cf was calculated based on the contribution of three main ghgs methane carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide nguyen et al 2019 each relevant ghg contribution fossil or biogenic co2 was distinguished based on the origin of the emission table 3 emissions were determined based on eq 1 1 e m i s s

assessment report ar5 towprayoon et al 2019 in general activity data ad represents the quantity generated or used of energy mass or volume representing the key parameter for each emission category the types of ad considered in this study are listed in table 4 the efs used were collected from the literature guidelines and databases or measured with specific on site campaigns table 4 and fig 1 the logical flow scheme of the proposed approach according to iso 14 064 1 is reported in fig 2 the overall calculation of cf considering the on site measured emissions was carried out by following several phases 1 elaboration of 1 year plant operation data of 12 wwtps such as temperature wastewater flowrate airflow rate influent and effluent cod and tn mass loads 2 calculation of the mass loads of emitted co2 ch4 and n2o 3 normalisation at 20 c and 4 conversion into co2 equivalent 3 3 measurement campaigns direct emitted ghg concentrations results from the measurement campaigns showed concentration variability in ghgs emitted from the biological processes of different wwtps as reported in previously literature studies tumendelger et al 2019 the average values of n2o concentrations were less than 4 mg m3 of air for the largest wwtps wwtp1 6 while they ranged from 4 to 15 mg m3 for the smallest plants wwtp7 12 fig 2 a similar behaviour was observed for co2 quantification values lower than 5 g co2 m3 were detected for the largest wwtps and in the range of 7 16 g co2 m3 in other cases fig 2 especially for n2o emissions the difference in the contributions of the largest wwtps could be justified by the usually higher efficiencies of the aeration systems and more elevated removals as reported by valkova et al 2020 in contrast for directly emitted ch4 concentrations a strict correlation was not identified with the size of the wwtps fig 3 furthermore an important relationship was observed during the rain events that occurred during the sampling campaigns it was evident example shown for wwtp1 in fig 3 that wet periods affected the direct ghg emissions with higher concentrations mainly for n2o and ch4 both emitting from the aerated degritting units and biological processes it can be noticed that the emitted ch4 and n2o detected during the rain events were more than 3 6 times higher than the those detected during the dry period fig 4 a c b and d these variations were probably dependent on sewage system characteristics and a corresponding increase in the dissolved gases in the influent flow during the rain events urban sewer systems can cause several contaminant degradations which can generate dissolved gaseous sub products as previously reported by jin et al 2019 moreover from the measurement campaigns the directly emitted ghg concentrations were also found to be spatially varying at different points of the same biological reactor as discussed by pan et al 2016 for wwtp5 the average emitted concentrations at the beginning and end of the aerobic reaction volume decreased from 6 17 mgn2o m3 50 41 mgch4 m3 and 5 2 gco2 m3 to 3 5 mgn2o m3 22 28 mg ch4 m3 and 5 2 g co2 m3 respectively it was observed that for n2o and ch4 higher concentrations were observed in the initial section of the reaction volume where the influent macro contaminant mass loads cod and tn were also probably higher on the other hand co2 concentrations mainly generated from biomass respiration remained almost stable throughout the entire biological unit zhan et al 2017 for the calculation of the emitted mass loads average concentrations of ghgs for each unit were considered 3 4 measured direct emissions factors ghg loads were calculated from the measured concentrations and normalised to identify different efs reported in terms of average values and standard deviations in figs 5 6 and 7 for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively biological treatment was typically characterised by the highest emissions with the values ranging from 6 7 10 8 to 0 02 kg n2o kgnrem 2 2 10 8 to 0 003 kg ch4 kgcodin and 1 8 10 5 to 3 1 kg co2 kgcodrem it was also observed that the ef values were inversely proportional to the wwtp size resulting in higher specific values for the smallest wwtps wwtp7 12 in the short cut biological process treating nutrient rich anaerobic rejected liquor via nitrite resulted in significantly high efs in terms of n2o 0 27 kg n2o kgtnrem while ch4 and co2 impacts were consistent with other biological treatments aerated degritting units showed the values of less than 2 6 10 4 kg n2o kgnrem in the range of 1 3 10 4 1 5 10 3 kg ch4 kgcodin and 4 1 10 3 0 1 kgco2 kgcodrem aerated sludge stabilisation measured with a continuous monitoring campaign for wwtp 6 yielded the efs for co2 1 3 10 3 kg co2 kgts higher than those of n2o and ch4 8 9 10 8 kg n2o kgts and 3 8 10 7 kg ch4 kgts respectively finally for biofilters the normalised values per cubic meter of the treated air changed from 1 2 10 6 to 6 10 6 kg n2o m3 2 6 10 5 to 7 5 10 5 kg ch4 m3 and 4 10 4 to 8 3 10 4 kg co2 m3 highlighting the significant impact of methane on the final global emission from these air treatment units 3 5 measured indirect emission factors the dissolved ghg concentrations in the effluents of the wwtps varied in the range of 0 2 24 mg l for n2o 0 1 1 mg l for ch4 and 1 8 52 mg l for co2 specifically for the largest wwtps from 1 to 6 the average values were 4 6 9 4 mg l for n2o 0 4 0 3 mg l for ch4 and 30 19 mg l for co2 meanwhile the values were generally found to be lower and respectively equal to 0 8 0 5 0 3 0 2 and 16 4 2 5 mg l for the smaller wwtps from 7 to 12 scientific literature on the measured values of dissolved ghgs in the effluents of wwtps is scarce in general these values have been found to range from 0 009 to 24 mg l for n2o 0 009 to 4 5 mg l for ch4 and 245 to 1352 mg l for co2 caniani et al 2019 masuda et al 2015 2018 vieira et al 2019 this variability indicates the need for site specific campaigns for properly evaluating the indirect emissions due to dissolved ghg contributions moreover during the sampling campaigns dissolved ghgs in the influent streams of the wwtps from the sewage systems were monitored specifically in the largest wwtps from 1 to 6 the dissolved ghg influent concentrations were found to be 12 5 26 1 1 1 2 and 76 86 mg l for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively while the values were found to be 0 5 0 4 mg n2o l 0 3 0 2 mg ch4 l and 50 16 mg co2 l for the smaller wwtps from 7 to 12 these aspects indicated that a relevant contribution of dissolved ghg comes directly from the sewage networks especially for plants with higher capacities furthermore for smaller wwtps the dissolved ghg concentrations in the effluent were higher than those of the influent stream this confirmed that for smaller wwtps which are usually subjected to more limiting operative conditions such as low carbon nitrogen c n ratio unstable or optimised process parameters and inefficient aeration supply kumar et al 2021 additional contributions of ghgs were generated during the biological processes which remained dissolved in the liquid stream the efs of dissolved ghg emission category varied in the ranges of 33 782 g n2o kgneff 4 132 g ch4 kgcodeff and 553 358 g co2 kgcodeff for n2o ch4 and co2 respectively table 5 the standard deviations of the dissolved ghg efs obtained for the six continuously monitored wwtps were significantly relevant and heterogeneous ranging from 34 to 136 with respect to the average values moreover the ef values were found to be inversely proportional to the wwtp size resulting in the higher specific factors for the smallest wwtps table 5 3 6 specific ghg contributions on measured direct and dissolved emissions the main contributions of different ghgs to the direct and dissolved emission categories were calculated as a percentage of the total emissions fig 8 the reported percentages of different ghg contributions were expressed as the percentage of equivalent co2 the values as the gaseous flows were directly transferred to the atmosphere showed that the main impacts were attributed to co2 for smaller plants 15 000 pe while n2o was the main responsible in largest wwtps 15 000 pe on the other hand ch4 emissions accounted for about 11 12 for all the sizes for indirect emissions into the water body the main contributor was n2o followed by co2 and ch4 3 7 carbon footprint results after the long term sampling periods the entire cf of each selected wwtp was calculated by adding the different contributions of the categories based on the normalised proposed approach table 6 the final values ranged from a minimum 210 tonco2eq y wwtp10 to a maximum 4047 tonco2eq y wwtp 3 in general the most impactful categories fig 9 were the indirect emissions associated with dissolved ghgs present in the water body which influenced 13 70 of the cf of each wwtp indirect emissions due to energy consumption accounted for 10 40 and as expected this category is directly related to the carbon and nitrogen removed loads in the different wwtps table 6 moreover direct emissions from treatment processes contribution approximately 19 on an average the disposal of sewage sludge and use of chemicals affected 6 34 and 1 9 respectively the impacts and their variabilities especially for direct and dissolved ghg contributions further underlined the already discussed importance of the measurement campaigns to obtain more appropriate and proper data for the specific conditions of each plant the scfs of the wwtps were finally calculated and were found to be between 0 04 and 0 20 tonco2eq pe y fig 10 the obtained scfs were indirectly dependent on the size of the plants and were more widely distributed for the wwtps with less than 15 000 pe capacity similarly the average scfs were found to be 0 091 0 038 tonco2eq pe y for the wwtps with more than 15 000 pe capacity and 0 153 0 045 tonco2eq pe y for smaller facilities these scf results were found to be more variable and almost 1 7 times higher than those of the larger size 15 000 pe notwithstanding that the calculation procedure was not perfectly comparable these results were consistent with those mentioned in other published research which reported the values in the range of 0 07 0 108 tonco2eq pe y gustavsson and tumlin 2013 0 023 0 1 tonco2eq pe y maktabifard et al 2020 and 0 062 0 161 tonco2eq pe y mamais et al 2015 the cf was finally extended at the regional level including for all plants managed by the water utility as well as the septic tanks resulting in 2396 and 1588 tonco2eq y emitted by the non monitored wwtps and septic tanks respectively yielding a total territorial cf of the wastewater service of 28 137 8497 tonco2eq y biogenic co2 had a 25 impact on total cf the highest contribution to territorial cf was from wwtps with more than 15 000 pe capacity accounting for 68 nevertheless the presence of several minor plants should be considered as their contributions were not found to be negligible with the impacts of 16 from the plants with capacities ranging from 15 000 to 5000 pe and 10 for the smaller wwtps finally septic tank emissions accounted for 6 to the total cf 4 conclusion regional cf of wastewater treatment service was determined by properly applying for the first time the methodology iso14064 1 to identify specific emission categories the proposed new evidence based methodology enables the calculation of the carbon footprint accounting all the emissions categories in clear operational and reporting boundaries within cities and regions the calculations were validated measuring the most impacting categories of direct and dissolved ghgs emissions with specific sampling campaigns the uncertainties related to the efs let to long term on site measurements of relevant ghgs in fact calculations carried out using only the available efs mentioned in the guidelines may significantly differ from the actual site conditions the measurement campaigns mentioned in this study enabled us to define the site specific efs for the main direct sources from the treatment processes degritting units aerobic biological treatments biofilters and aerobic sludge stabilisations in 12 different sized wwtps furthermore dissolved ghgs discharged in the final water bodies were analysed and were found to significantly impact the entire cf quantification the results in terms of the efs average values and standard deviations showed a high variability in the emissions based on the wwtp size and specific operative conditions especially for biological processes the average values were found to be 3 4 10 3 kgn2o kgtnrem 1 7 10 3 kgch4 kgcodin and 1 1 kgco2 kgcodrem for the smallest 15 000 pe wwtps on the other hand the biggest 15 000 pe wwtp efs resulted in 6 6 10 4 kgn2o kgtnrem 2 7 10 4 kgch4 kgcodin and 0 07 kgco2 kgcodrem the analytical campaigns of this study also highlighted that biogenic co2 emitted from the biological processes significantly impacted the global cf of the 12 wwtps accounting for 35 66 of the total directly emitted co2eq the overall territorial cf of the wastewater service was 28 137 8497 tonco2eq y including of the non monitored wwtps and septic tanks the most impacting categories for most plants were i indirect emissions associated with the dissolved ghgs present in the water body ii indirect emissions due to energy consumption followed by iii direct emissions from treatment processes iv disposal of sewage sludge and v use of chemicals finally this approach can support territorial water utilities not only to assess their carbon footprint with normalized approach but also to develop regional mitigation scenarios and decisions towards low carbon water utilities in fact since the specific carbon footprint coefficients change based on the plants size mitigation actions could consider the population distribution in the territory and both centralized and decentralized systems moreover mitigations for wastewater service decarbonisation according to the shown most impacting emission categories could be prioritised as following 1 acquire renewable energy sources to reduce the indirect emissions from fossil primary energy production 2 optimize efficiency and kinetics of biological removal of organic and nutrients loads and aeration efficiency in order to reduce dissolved ghgs in the final effluent 3 reduce direct emissions mainly avoiding uncontrolled transitory phases or limiting operative conditions in the biological reactors 4 promote less impacting sludge disposal destination especially avoiding landfill and 5 use chemical reagents characterized by lower emission factors for their primary production the proposed methodological approach coupled with accurately planned site specific long term measurement campaigns could further boost and address the decarbonization of the wastewater service in territories

16529,we investigated the seasonal prevalence of seven enteric viruses in groundwater derived public water sources distributed across the dominant aquifers of england sampling targeted four periods in the hydrological cycle with typically varying microbial risks as indicated using a decade of escherichia coli prevalence data viruses were concentrated onsite by filtration of raw groundwater and extracted nucleic acid na was amplified by qpcr or rt qpcr seven out of eight sources all aquifers and 31 of samples were positive for viral na the most frequently detected viral na targets were hepatitis a virus 17 samples 63 sites norovirus gi 14 samples 38 sites and hepatitis e virus 7 samples 25 sites viral na presence was episodic being most prevalent and at its highest concentration during november and january the main groundwater recharge season with 89 of all positive detects occurring during a rising water table seasonal norovirus na detections matched its seasonal incidence within the population viral na is arriving with groundwater recharge as opposed to persisting for long periods within the saturated zone neither total coliforms nor e coli were significant predictors of viral na presence absence and there was limited co occurrence between viruses nevertheless a source with an absence of e coli in regularly collected historical data is unlikely to be at risk of viral contamination to manage potential groundwater viral contamination via risk assessment larger scale studies are required to understand key risk factors with the evidence here suggesting viral na is widespread across a range of typical microbial risk settings keywords virus groundwater risk indicator e coli hepatitis virus 1 introduction groundwater supplies around half of all drinking water globally wwap 2009 including 75 of european union eu inhabitants european commission 2008 furthermore it comprises 43 of the total consumptive irrigation water use siebert et al 2010 groundwater is generally considered to be lower microbial risk than surface water sources due to physical chemical and biological attenuation in the unsaturated zone pedley et al 2006 and supplies are often perceived to be potable jones et al 2005 consequently untreated or undertreated groundwater is commonly consumed across high income countries from private and community supplies hynds et al 2013 2014 wallender et al 2014 as well as large municipal supplies in places e g christchurch new zealand pang et al 2017 nevertheless outbreaks of disease related to enteric pathogens in groundwater are frequently reported murphy et al 2017 wallender et al 2014 in a 12 year study of waterborne illness relating to drinking water in the usa reynolds et al 2008 attributed 76 of reported outbreaks and 33 of all illness to groundwater consumption enteric viruses are of a particular concern in groundwater a systematic review of north american studies identified that enteric viruses were more frequently identified than either bacterial or protozoan pathogens in groundwater hynds et al 2014 viruses are the smallest enteric pathogens and can penetrate all common aquifer matrices viruses can also survive for extended periods in the subsurface due to favourable conditions pinon and vialette 2018 such as a perennially low water temperature in temperate regions and an absence of sunlight for example charles et al 2009 demonstrated adenovirus and poliovirus remained infectious in groundwater for 364 and 140 days respectively and seitz et al 2011 showed norovirus capsids remained intact in groundwater for at least three years there has been increasing appreciation that the monitoring of bacterial indicator organisms is unsuitable to assure that drinking water sources are free from non bacterial waterborne pathogens such as enteric viruses who 2017 consequently many countries have responded by adopting risk based approaches for individual water sources often based around water safety plans wsp who 2009 2017 these approaches evaluate potential hazards within the catchment of each source assess their risks and determine and validate control measures the effective risk assessment and control of enteric viruses to groundwater sources requires evidence concerning their source transport and persistence however there is limited evidence concerning these properties for viruses compared with other pathogens because viruses have historically been difficult and expensive to analyse for hunt and johnson 2017 and there is a the lack of association between viruses and bacterial indicator organisms fout et al 2017 wu et al 2011 studies investigating the occurrence of viruses in groundwater have traditionally been heavily focussed within north america e g

there is a tendency for these to be local focused investigations of a specific virus associated with a known disease outbreak kauppinen et al 2018 lugoli et al 2011 shin et al 2017 with a lack of spatial temporal studies investigating a range of viral targets in the uk there is minimal understanding of viruses in groundwater gregory et al 2014 historical work demonstrated the effective attenuation of viruses in the chalk unsaturated zone at wastewater recharge sites baxter et al 1981 at a time when 300 ml d of sewage was infiltrated directly into the ground two other projects have investigated viruses in five multi level piezometers and confirmed enterovirus norovirus and coliphage contamination of the sandstone aquifer beneath the cities of birmingham and nottingham powell et al 2003 and doncaster morris et al 2006 as a precursor to our field study we sent questionnaires to all twenty water companies in england and wales in 2018 to assess current virus monitoring in the water industry the seventeen companies that responded confirmed there is no monitoring for viruses instead viral risks are managed by wsps in our study we examined enteric viruses in groundwater derived public water sources across england we selected eight sites within the most important water supply aquifers which are also important water resources in many parts of europe the sites are of varying microbial risk according to historical faecal indicator organism data and in contrasting risk settings rural urban depth below the surface overlying protective geological cover we investigated the seasonal occurrence of seven virus targets in raw groundwater including hepatitis e virus which is an emerging threat in high income countries where the role of transmission through water is unclear fenaux et al 2019 wang et al 2020 we relate viral nucleic acid na occurrence and concentration to the hydrological conditions and evaluate the use of faecal indicator organisms total coliforms and e coli to predict viral na presence absence 2 methods 2 1 study sites 2 1 1 selection and hydrogeology eight sites 1 8 were selected to investigate viral occurrence across the major aquifers of england fig 1 a these sites were distributed across the country with a focus towards aquifers that are most utilised for water supply where multiple sites were chosen within the same aquifer they were located in separate geological basins where aquifer properties are more likely to be contrasting three sites 1 2 5 were selected in the cretaceous chalk the chalk is the principal aquifer providing more than half of total licensed groundwater abstraction in england and wales monkhouse and richards 1982 and is the most important source of freshwater in north western europe downing et al 1993 the chalk is a dual porosity soft white limestone comprising a low permeability matrix intersected by vertical joints and horizontal fractures groundwater recharge is generally considered to occur via piston displacement through the matrix with episodic movement through joints fractures during periods of intense rainfall occurring at times of high soil moisture content ireson and butler 2011 sorensen et al 2015b water movement through the saturated zone is mainly through joints fractures the chalk is more karstified in some locations and groundwater velocities from 0 5 to 6 8 km day have been reported from sinking streams to discharge locations maurice et al 2010 sites 1 and 2 are both located in areas of the chalk where karstic features are mapped abundantly at the surface and tracer tests have demonstrated travel times from these features to the sources in under 24 h there is no evidence that site 5 is connected to surface karst although features are mapped in the vicinity two sites 7 8 were selected in the permo triassic sandstone the second most important aquifer accounting for around a quarter of licensed abstraction in england and wales monkhouse and richards 1982 and the aquifer also covers large parts of west and central europe crampon et al 1996 the permo triassic sandstones are predominantly interlayered sequences of pebbles sands and silts of varying cementation groundwater movement is typically through the matrix although fracture flow can provide preferential flow paths on a local or even regional scale price et al 1982 a further two sites 4 6 were located on jurassic limestones that comprise the third most important source of groundwater in the uk neumann et al 2003 the jurassic limestones are relatively thin beds where groundwater flow is almost entirely through fractures joints sites 4 and 6 are sited on the jurassic inferior oolite group and lincolnshire limestone formation respectively site 4 is 50 m upgradient from a spring known to be hydraulically connected to the borehole and historical records report it is drilled into an underground river site 6 is protected by 10 m of low permeability deposits and receives recharge from the aquifer outcrop at least 1 km to the west that is likely to be through the soil given the lack of proximal sinking streams bottrell et al 2000 site 3 is a carboniferous limestone spring in the yorkshire dales where groundwater flow is almost entirely along solution enhanced fractures including caves worthington and ford 2009 the carboniferous limestone has the largest fractures of any aquifer in the uk and is the endmember in terms of karstic features and behaviour atkinson and smart 1981 the sites include two springs 2 3 and six boreholes 1 4 8 table s1 the rest water levels at the boreholes are shallow 10 m from the surface although the screens start as deep as 61 m below the surface site 7 all sites with the exception of site 8 have overlying protective superficial cover of between around 2 and 15 m which is either sand gravel 1 2 7 or silt clay dominated 3 4 5 6 land use within 500 m of the sites can be classified as either rural 1 3 4 6 7 where enteric viral sources could comprise leaking septic tanks leaking low density sewers and agricultural sources or urban 2 5 8 where the predominant viral source would be a leaking high density sewerage network site 1 comprised two separate boreholes a and b that are similar from a hydrogeological and microbial risk perspective fig 1b and are 8 km apart site 1a was sampled at the beginning of the study before the site was out of operation then site 1b was sampled 2 1 2 historical bacterial indicator organism data the sites are ordered 1 8 according to the likelihood of e coli fig 1b and total coliform fig s1 presence over ten years of collated water company data collected between january 2010 and december 2019 at approximately weekly to monthly intervals n 184 sites 1a and 1b are the highest microbial risk sites with e coli and total coliforms present in 96 and 99 of samples respectively the lowest risk sites 7 8 are those in the permo triassic sandstone three percent of samples have tested positive for total coliforms at site 7 with a single detection of e coli there was no single positive detection at site 8 which is located in the centre of a historic town with no protective superficial deposits to protect the aquifer and a shallow water table table s1 small pore throats and slow flow in the sandstone are likely to impede live bacterial transport over appreciable distances which would explain why no indicator organisms have been detected at site 8 occasional positive indicator organism detects at 61 m depth at site 7 would only be possible if fractures are providing preferential flow horizons within the environs of the site sites with the greatest likelihood of the presence of indicator organisms also tended to have the highest maximum number of the respective organisms maximum e coli numbers were 24 200 9210 5700 1000 77 60 17 6 0 cfu 100 ml at sites 1a 8 respectively maximum total coliform numbers were 241 900 38 700 72 000 1000 100 201 116 41 0 cfu 100 ml at sites 1a 8 respectively 2 1 3 hydrological observations hydrological observations comprising spring discharge and groundwater level data were collated from january 2010 until february 2020 table s1 spring discharge data were collated for sites 2 and 3 from water company records it was not possible to utilise groundwater level observations from the borehole sites due to pump duty cycles pump rotation and longer periods of site shutdown consequently regionally representative groundwater level data were retrieved from observation boreholes within 2 40 km of the sites from a combination of the environment agency environmental regulator in england and water company observation boreholes table s1 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 sample rounds sampling was conducted in four rounds r1 4 targeting typical distinct periods of differing hydrological conditions and microbial risk fig 2 in 2019 r1 3 and 2020 r4 r1 was selected as the period of typically lowest microbial risk which also generally coincides with peak or close to groundwater levels spring discharge r2 targeted mid summer when microbial risks tend to be higher than r1 and groundwater levels spring discharges are typically falling the summer corresponds to a period where extreme rainfall often convective is more common as a result of higher air and sea temperatures dunstone et al 2018 hand et al 2004 jones et al 2013 such intense rainfall events can lead to significant sporadic faecal contamination of public water sources for example the 28th june 2012 supercell and other large storms in june and july 2012 hannaford and parry 2012 marsh and parry 2012 parry et al 2013 align with peak e coli counts at sites 2 6 and 7 r3 was conducted towards the beginning of the hydrological year which starts in october when microbial risks are greatest at this time of year groundwater levels spring discharges are low but soil moisture deficits are typically being overcome and the annual recharge season is commencing r4 was undertaken four months into the hydrological year when groundwater levels spring discharges have been rising rapidly and microbial risks remain elevated these descriptions represent mean conditions across all sites and site to site variability is shown in fig s2 samples were not obtained from site 1a in r3 and r4 site 4 in r2 and site 6 in r3 site 1a was not in operation during r3 and r4 due to elevated turbidity and site 1b was sampled in r4 instead site 6 was shut down in r3 because of elevated levels of bacterial indicator organisms site 4 had been sampled in r2 but the filter cartridge was mistakenly destroyed before extraction 2 2 2 virus sample collection and analysis virus extraction concentration and analysis followed methodology validated by the aquavalens project gunnarsdottir et al 2020 and references therein virus particles were concentrated at each public water supply by filtering through hollow fibre asahi polysulfone filters asahi kasei oita japan in sampling rounds r1 and r2 rexeed 25a filters were used before the global unavailability of the units forced a transition to leoceed 21h filters in rounds r3 and r4 the two filters are identical with the exception of the housing diameters and the membrane surface areas that are 2 5 and 2 1 m2 for the rexeed 25a and leoceed 21h respectively four filter units were used in parallel for each sample to maximise the potential flow rate these units were housed in a bespoke sampling rig that contained analogue pressure gauges and ball valves to monitor and regulate water pressure respectively to ensure the water pressure did not exceed the operational pressure limits of the filters total flow was monitored following filtration on the rig using a flow metre digiflow 6710 m savant electronics inc taiwan the sampling rig was sterilised between uses by re circulating boiling water with a peristaltic pump 410 solinst canada for one hour laboratory trials confirmed no carryover of target viral na prior to deployment furthermore sequential field samples from our study were not positive for identical viral na confirming no cross contamination on arrival at each site the raw water sampling tap was sterilised with 99 5 ethanol and the tap was run to waste for one minute before connecting the sampling rig the aim was always to filter 1000 l of water though this was not always possible where the water pressure was insufficient particularly at gravity fed springs 2 3 or where site operations restricted the available filtration time a median of 886 l of water was filtered with a range of 235 1039 l which took between 2 75 and 6 hours following completion the filters were transported in a cool box to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 c for up to 48 h before elution at the laboratory viral na was eluted from each filter by back flushing with 250 ml of a sterile buffer containing 0 001 antifoam 0 01 tween 80 and 0 01 sodium hexametaphosphate solution approximately 400 500 ml of sample was recovered at this primary concentration stage secondary concentration involved polyethylene glycol bioultra 8000 peg precipitation and centrifugation 280 ml splits of eluted sample were mixed with 100 ml of 50 w v peg precipitation buffer and 10 ml of 37 5 w v solution of beef extract both in sterile deionized water and incubated overnight at 4 c where a sample split was 280 ml then the volume was made up to 280 ml with additional elution buffer the sample split was then centrifuged at 12 000 x g for 40 min at 4 c to produce a pellet the supernatant was aspirated off and the pellets from each sample split and all four filters were combined and suspended in 1 5 4 ml resuspension buffer 0 001 antifoam 0 01 tween 80 solution in phosphate buffered saline pbs the volume of the suspension concentrate was recorded before it was transferred to a 7 ml plastic bijou bottle and stored at 80 c until na extraction the na extraction was performed on 700 Âµl aliquots of concentrates in 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes samples were lysed chemically using 650 Âµl of unex lysis buffer microbiologics usa and 50 Âµl of proteinase k 600mau ml at 56 c for 1 h in a water bath the supernatant was transferred to a clean eppendorf tube containing 0 5 g of 0 1 mm glass beads and 0 5 g of 0 7 mm zirconia beads and vortexed for 15 s the samples were processed for 2 30 s in a fastprep 24 5 g instrument mp biomedical usa at a speed setting of 6 0 m s before centrifuging at 10 000 x g for 30 s the supernatant was transferred to a silica nucleic acid extraction column qiagen germany for purification and the column was washed with 500 Âµl of 100 ethanol then 500 Âµl of 70 ethanol with centrifuging at 10 000 x g for 60 s and the filtrate being discarded between each step finally viral na was eluted by adding 50 Âµl of nuclease free water to the column and centrifuging at 13 000 x g for 60 s this final step was repeated twice and the two volumes were combined and samples stored at 20 c for up to 3 months or at 80 c for later use quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr or reverse transcriptase qpcr rt qpcr was performed on the extracted na using a cfx96 bio rad usa seven viruses that are commonly observed in the environment were targeted using validated commercially available kits hepatitis a hav norovirus nov gi nov gii q standard ceeramtools biomÃ©rieux france hepatitis e hev human adenovirus f hadv f rotavirus a rv a genetic pcr solutions spain and enterovirus ev genesig primerdesign ltd uk further details for the biomÃ©rieux and primerdesign kits are available from international organization for standardization geneva 15216 1 2017 2017 and dierssen et al 2008 respectively all kits are taqman probe based assays that target specific amplicons hence melt curve analysis was not required details of the cycling conditions are provided in table s2 where a reverse transcription was required this was undertaken as part of a one step reaction before the pcr cycle each viral target was quantified on a single 96 well plate each containing all samples positive and negative controls in all instances 5 Âµl of template was used positive controls consisted of the reference standards provided to generate the standard curves fig s3 with biomÃ©rieux providing additional positive controls for their kits and for ev which all amplified table s4 negative controls were performed on each batch of the extraction and pellet re suspension buffers used comprising six in total for each target nuclease free water was also used as a negative control during reverse transcription and amplification with two controls analysed for each target in addition to biomÃ©rieux providing negative controls with their kits none of the negative controls amplified within the respective maximum number of cycles no inhibition tests were performed on these low turbidity groundwater samples with none of the samples being coloured after extraction the biomÃ©rieux genetic pcr solutions and primerdesign kits had maximum amplification cycles of 45 40 and 50 respectively positive amplifications observed 5 cycles from the respective cycle limits were deemed true positives given negative controls did not amplify in line with biomÃ©rieux and primerdesign instructions and bustin and nolan 2004 starting quantities sq were quantified by comparing the quantification cycle cq values table s3 to standard curves fig s3 produced by serial dilution of reference standards provided by the manufacturers in line with their instructions two positive samples had sq values of 1 gene copy per reaction for hav na although the cq values were less than the positive controls tables s3 and s4 sq values were then converted to gene copy number per litre of filtered groundwater assuming 100 efficiency during extraction and treatment therefore the reported concentrations should be considered minimum values as losses would have occurred during extraction and treatment 2 2 3 indicator organism sample collection and analysis a sample for total coliforms and e coli was collected after the virus sample in a 1 l pet sample bottle vwr cat no 331 0269 for the first 12 of the 29 samples all of r1 and four of the seven r2 samples these samples were analysed at the university of surrey by colilert 18 quanti tray method iso 9308 2 2012 before closure of the laboratory by the university subsequently the project was reliant upon the routine raw water sampling and analysis undertaken by the water companies sca 2009 of the 17 water company samples five were taken on the same day five within 18 h and three within 42 h of the virus sample of the remaining samples three were taken 3 5 days apart from the virus sample but these were at sites 7 and 8 where indicator organisms are very rarely or never recorded and were all negative finally two indicator organism samples were positive four days either side of the r3 virus sample at site 3 2 3 statistical analysis all analysis was conducted in r version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 and figures were produced using the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 bacterial indicator organisms were assessed as predictors of viral na presence absence using logistic regression models developed using the core command glm models were evaluated in terms of significance true positive rate sensitivity false positive rate true negative rate specificity and false negative rate to contextualise the hydrological conditions at the point of sampling monthly standardised groundwater indices sgis bloomfield and marchant 2013 were calculated using the hydrological observations table s1 however instead of the inverse normal distribution applied by bloomfield and marchant 2013 we employed an inverse uniform distribution between 0 and 1 so sgis were more easily interpretable before estimating sgis gaps of three and two months in observations near sites 1 and 6 were infilled by linear interpolation sgi was calculated by splitting data from each site into mean observations for each calendar month these were ordered and assigned a rank an inverse uniform cumulative distribution function was applied and the normalised monthly indices were merged to form a continuous sgi time series therefore a value of 1 refers to groundwater levels spring discharge being at a monthly maximum over the ten year period 3 results 3 1 widespread viral nucleic acid prevalence target viral na was detected at seven of the eight sites in 31 of samples and 7 of samples tested positive for multiple types fig 3 hav was the most frequently detected na 17 samples 63 sites followed by nov gi 14 samples 38 sites hev 7 samples 25 sites and a single detection of hadv f there were no positive detections of ev nov gii or rv a na there were no consistent patterns of co occurrence amongst viral na nov gi was the only viral na to be detected multiple times at the same site occurring at forty times the concentration in r4 january than r1 april and was absent in between r2 and r3 the two highest concentrations of viral na relate to nov gi at concentrations up to 9 6 103 copies l 1 fig 3 table s5 seven sites were positive for viral na on at least a single occasion fig 3 therefore viral na was present in all four aquifers beneath both rural and urban land uses and across a range of microbial risk settings figs 3 and 1b the lowest microbial risk location according to historic indicator organism data site 8 was the only location testing negative for viral na throughout the study hav was the only viral na detected in all four aquifers viral na was most prevalent during sampling rounds r3 and r4 fig 3 seven of the nine positive samples for viral na and the only ones testing positive for multiple types of viral na occurred in rounds r3 and r4 furthermore the highest five na concentrations were all during these rounds 3 2 viral nucleic acid prevalence relates to groundwater recharge eighty nine percent of positive samples for viral na were associated with a rising groundwater level spring discharge fig 4 r1 samples were collected around peak groundwater level spring discharge with only a sample at site 7 being positive for viral na fig 4 this positive sample was taken when the site was responding to recharge from several low pressure weather systems bringing persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in local pluvial flooding turner et al 2019 site 2 contained the only positive detect on the falling limb of a hydrograph occurring in r2 the majority of detections were in r3 and r4 after the main 2019 20 recharge season commenced consistently across the sites in late september 3 3 viral nucleic acid relationship to bacterial indicator organisms neither total coliforms p value 0 625 nor e coli p value 0 562 were significant single predictors of the presence absence of viral na sensitivity for total coliforms and e coli were 63 and 50 respectively fig 5 specificity for total coliforms and e coli were 48 and 62 respectively fig 5 all sites 1 7 with previous evidence of total coliforms and e coli fig 1b tested positive for viral na in at least one sampling round these sites all tested positive for total coliforms and all but site 7 tested positive for e coli between february 2019 and january 2020 site 8 with no previous evidence of any coliforms showed no evidence of virus contamination all bacterial indicator organism data are shown in tables s5 and s6 4 discussion 4 1 hepatitis a hepatitis is a major waterborne disease resulting in fever pain malaise diarrhoea vomiting and jaundice hav was associated with 50 of global hepatitis cases in 2008 bosch et al 2008 in high income countries hav infections are considered uncommon and typically considered to be imported from low income countries where the virus is endemic and sanitation and hygiene may be poor although outbreaks in certain at risk groups do occur carrillo santisteve et al 2017 in 2018 public health england confirmed 452 cases and reported that cases have been falling from a peak incidence in 1990 of 7545 cases phe 2019 the limited confirmed cases amongst the population raises the question of why hav was the most commonly detected viral na in our study firstly infections are frequently asymptomatic or subclinical particularly amongst children and are likely to be underreported matin et al 2006 phe 2019 for example a 2008 blood donor study in southwest england demonstrated an incidence of 0 4 in 4503 assays dalton et al 2008 secondly viruses are shed in large numbers from infected individuals and are frequently detected in sewage and surface water samples in high income countries hellmÃ©r et al 2014 pina et al 2001 thirdly hav has been detected in groundwater in other high income countries borchardt et al 2003 shin et al 2017 notably 8 6 of 150 public water supply boreholes spread across 35 states of the usa abbaszadegan et al 1999 the virus s occurrence in groundwater has been attributed to its enhanced mobility through the unsaturated zone and its persistence in the environment compared to other enteric viruses borchardt et al 2003 sobsey et al 1986 indeed hav was the only viral na detected in all four aquifers hav has been responsible for multiple virus related groundwater outbreaks globally murphy et al 2017 and was the most common pathogen 8 5 of those with known aetiology linked to outbreaks in untreated groundwater supplies in the usa between 1971 and 2008 wallender et al 2014 the virus has also been one of the most common causes of infectious disease outbreaks related to drinking water both surface water and groundwater derived in canada between 1971 and 2001 schuster et al 2005 4 2 hepatitis e hev is an emerging threat in high income countries and the main cause of acute hepatitis worldwide with an estimated 20 million people infected annually fenaux et al 2019 hakim et al 2017 in high income countries there is a shift in human infections towards zoonotic genotypes giii and iv that also occur in pigs pavio et al 2015 runoff from pig farms and land treated with pig slurry as well as wastewater from slaughterhouses can introduce hev into the aquatic environment fenaux et al 2019 krog et al 2017 nevertheless the human source is also appreciable and 93 of untreated sewage samples from edinburgh s domestic sewage works receiving no agricultural effluent or runoff tested positive for hev over a period of six months smith et al 2016 infections are often linked to the consumption of pork and shellfish fenaux et al 2019 although drinking water source was associated with seroprevalence in france mansuy et al 2016 and hev has been shown to persist through water treatment into tap water in sweden wang et al 2020 in england hev infections are increasing year on year with numerous indigenously acquired infections ijaz et al 2014 a study of 225 000 blood donations in southeast england demonstrated 3 5 of donors were viraemic hewitt et al 2014 therefore there is a large source within the human population although both detects sites 4 and 7 were from boreholes located in predominantly rural areas hence could either be from an agricultural or human sources there appears a lack of comparable studies that have either investigated or documented hev in groundwater in high income countries despite the consumption of groundwater being suggested as a potential pathway king et al 2018 4 3 norovirus acute gastroenteritis causes the second greatest burden of all infectious diseases globally and novs are estimated to account for 20 of all cases ahmed et al 2014 globally nov is the most frequently responsible enteric pathogen for disease outbreaks relating to groundwater in the academic literature murphy et al 2017 including examples from the usa borchardt et al 2011 france gallay et al 2006 and south korea kim et al 2005 in the uk there are estimated to be around 3 million cases per year of gastroenteritis resulting from nov tam et al 2012 although nov gii is the dominant genotype van beek et al 2018 nov is commonly detected in treated wastewater and rivers in the uk merrett et al 2013 palfrey et al 2011 and has been confirmed in groundwater powell et al 2003 therefore our results are supported by the prevalence of nov within the uk population and aquatic environment as well as its common occurrence in groundwater in high income countries uk infections also show pronounced seasonality year on year typically being highest from november through to april phe 2020 this seasonality matches the occurrence of nov gi na in our data with detections only in january april and november 4 4 viruses related to groundwater recharge viral contamination was transient which is consistent with a study of 50 wells sampled in four different seasons in usa borchardt et al 2003 there is limited evidence to indicate viral na is persisting in the sampled locations for long periods with viral na arriving when groundwater was responding to recharge if this na is transported directly from recent sources at the surface then the associated viruses are more likely to be infectious however the viruses could equally be re mobilised from the unsaturated zone or emanate from older sources which could be treated in the case of certain effluent and may be non infectious research from the usa has also noted that virus occurrence in groundwater relates to groundwater recharge events bradbury et al 2013 gotkowitz et al 2016 4 5 viruses transported by preferential flow the most commonly detected viral na hav hev and nov gi were all detected at site 7 which has the deepest screen demonstrating viral na transport to at least 60 m below the ground surface in a sandstone aquifer this na could potentially have been transported through the pores of the sandstone as viruses are small enough to enter the aquifer matrix however the travel time to 60 m is likely to be excessive for the survival of viral na and combined with previous evidence of culturable bacterial indicator organisms supports microbial transport via fractures from leaking sewers as hypothesised nearby in the aquifer morris et al 2006 viral na at the other six positive sites are also likely to have been transported through fractures given the hydrogeology depth to screen evidence for bacterial indicator organisms and seasonal occurrence during the recharge season there is no evidence for preferential flow at site 8 where viral na was absent with no previous positive detections of coliforms despite the urban and shallow water table setting the different location settings were nearly all susceptible to the transmission of viral na these results indicate that the immediate environs of the location do not relate to virus risk be that urban rural setting or protective overlying geology including 15 m of silt and clay this is likely to reflect the nature of rapid preferential flow paths in both the unsaturated and saturated zone which are capable of delivering viruses from where sources are present and protective cover is lacking or can be bypassed furthermore differences in sorption capacity between aquifers overlying deposits and their associated soils appear unimportant because viral na was omnipresent across aquifer settings although only hav was present in all four aquifers 4 6 temporal representativeness of results rainfall during winter and early spring in 2018 19 was below average across the study area barker et al 2019 turner et al 2019 resulting in subdued groundwater recharge and groundwater levels spring discharges typically being below normal during round r1 fig 6 contrastingly june to october 2019 was the second wettest on record in england and wales over the last 50 years parry et al 2019 with persistent heavy rainfall continuing during november resulting in serious flooding across the centre and north of england muchan et al 2019 groundwater levels spring discharges transitioned from generally below normal in r2 to well above normal by r3 reaching peaks at sites 6 and 7 and their second highest at sites 2 and 4 for the period 2010 2019 rainfall remained above average over much of the study area in december turner et al 2020 before returning to more typical values in january barker et al 2020 as a result groundwater levels springs discharges continued to receive recharge and increased during round r4 typically maintaining exceptionally high levels discharge fig 6 it is possible that the exceptionally wet conditions encountered prior to and during the 2019 20 recharge season r3 and r4 enhanced the transport of viral na to groundwater particularly given the identified association of viral na with recharge here alternatively it is also possible that unusually high precipitation diluted existing sources of viruses arriving at the water table the only available evidence to support either of these two arguments comes from bacterial indicator organism data however total coliforms and e coli were typically close to or below monthly means during the study period fig s4 hence there is no strong evidence for the meteorological conditions enhancing or diminishing faecal contamination of the sites during the study period 4 7 viral indicators the lack of relationship between either total coliforms or e coli and viral na on an individual sample basis in our study is supported by previous meta analyses fout et al 2017 wu et al 2011 fout et al 2017 compiled data from twelve groundwater studies and demonstrated total coliforms and e coli had very low sensitivity 12 and 2 but higher specificity 88 and 97 respectively for the prediction of viruses that were quantified by molecular methods sensitivity was slightly higher for predicting viruses quantified by culture methods perhaps because this is a comparison of viable organisms but still poor total coliforms 29 and e coli 26 fout et al 2017 total coliforms and e coli appear to have merit for evaluating whether a site is at risk or not of virus contamination and all sites in our study could be correctly classified using historical data the presence of these indicators would confirm a potential rapid pathway to the near surface and potential sources of viruses in the environment the availability of long term records 10 years for this purpose is invaluable because viral sources can be transient and rapid pathways more likely to be active during extreme hydrological conditions strong support for the use of virus risk classification using e coli is provided by fout et al 2017 who demonstrated a specificity of 94 for e coli prediction of viruses by molecular methods at the site level we consider this high specificity at the site level to be the main contributor to the high specificity estimated at the individual sample level in their dataset sensitivity remains very low 12 with abundant false positives hence why e coli is not suitable to be used as a viral indicator at the sample level the lack of co occurrence amongst viral na targets here provides no evidence that certain viruses such as previously suggested ev hot et al 2003 or adenoviruses farkas et al 2020 can be used as indicators of a broader range of viruses in groundwater indeed ev was absent and there was only a single detection of hadv f despite adenoviruses being shown to be one of the more stable viruses in water and hence a potentially conservative indicator of other viruses farkas et al 2020 sidhu et al 2015 furthermore the meta analysis of fout et al 2017 demonstrated that somatic coliphages now suggested as an indicator of enteric viruses in the eu who 2017 are no better than e coli as viral indicators in groundwater alternative proposed novel viral indicators often associated with sewage include ibuprofen allen 2013 or in situ fluorescence spectroscopy that can be measured in real time sorensen et al 2015a 2018 5 conclusions the episodic prevalence of viral nucleic acid across the majority of public water sources all major water supply aquifers and a range of typical microbial risk settings in both urban and rural areas indicate potentially widespread seasonal viral risks in groundwater used for drinking the public water sources that were sampled all have suitable treatment measures in place for the provision of safe drinking water before supply however there are likely to be other sites notably private water sources where water treatment is insufficient and public health risks from viruses may be present to manage potential groundwater virus contamination via water safety plan wsp risk assessments larger scale studies are required to further understand key risk factors within catchments for example viral sources and relative loading subsurface transport viral persistence and viral viability sampling for viruses should be focussed during periods of groundwater recharge when they are most likely to occur if investigating viral risks at a source the lack of co occurrence amongst viral targets suggests a widespread suite of viruses would be more suitable than investigating a single indicator target such as adenoviruses in untreated groundwater bacterial indicator organisms do have value to assess whether a viral risk is present a source with an absence of indicators in regularly collected

16529,we investigated the seasonal prevalence of seven enteric viruses in groundwater derived public water sources distributed across the dominant aquifers of england sampling targeted four periods in the hydrological cycle with typically varying microbial risks as indicated using a decade of escherichia coli prevalence data viruses were concentrated onsite by filtration of raw groundwater and extracted nucleic acid na was amplified by qpcr or rt qpcr seven out of eight sources all aquifers and 31 of samples were positive for viral na the most frequently detected viral na targets were hepatitis a virus 17 samples 63 sites norovirus gi 14 samples 38 sites and hepatitis e virus 7 samples 25 sites viral na presence was episodic being most prevalent and at its highest concentration during november and january the main groundwater recharge season with 89 of all positive detects occurring during a rising water table seasonal norovirus na detections matched its seasonal incidence within the population viral na is arriving with groundwater recharge as opposed to persisting for long periods within the saturated zone neither total coliforms nor e coli were significant predictors of viral na presence absence and there was limited co occurrence between viruses nevertheless a source with an absence of e coli in regularly collected historical data is unlikely to be at risk of viral contamination to manage potential groundwater viral contamination via risk assessment larger scale studies are required to understand key risk factors with the evidence here suggesting viral na is widespread across a range of typical microbial risk settings keywords virus groundwater risk indicator e coli hepatitis virus 1 introduction groundwater supplies around half of all drinking water globally wwap 2009 including 75 of european union eu inhabitants european commission 2008 furthermore it comprises 43 of the total consumptive irrigation water use siebert et al 2010 groundwater is generally considered to be lower microbial risk than surface water sources due to physical chemical and biological attenuation in the unsaturated zone pedley et al 2006 and supplies are often perceived to be potable jones et al 2005 consequently untreated or undertreated groundwater is commonly consumed across high income countries from private and community supplies hynds et al 2013 2014 wallender et al 2014 as well as large municipal supplies in places e g christchurch new zealand pang et al 2017 nevertheless outbreaks of disease related to enteric pathogens in groundwater are frequently reported murphy et al 2017 wallender et al 2014 in a 12 year study of waterborne illness relating to drinking water in the usa reynolds et al 2008 attributed 76 of reported outbreaks and 33 of all illness to groundwater consumption enteric viruses are of a particular concern in groundwater a systematic review of north american studies identified that enteric viruses were more frequently identified than either bacterial or protozoan pathogens in groundwater hynds et al 2014 viruses are the smallest enteric pathogens and can penetrate all common aquifer matrices viruses can also survive for extended periods in the subsurface due to favourable conditions pinon and vialette 2018 such as a perennially low water temperature in temperate regions and an absence of sunlight for example charles et al 2009 demonstrated adenovirus and poliovirus remained infectious in groundwater for 364 and 140 days respectively and seitz et al 2011 showed norovirus capsids remained intact in groundwater for at least three years there has been increasing appreciation that the monitoring of bacterial indicator organisms is unsuitable to assure that drinking water sources are free from non bacterial waterborne pathogens such as enteric viruses who 2017 consequently many countries have responded by adopting risk based approaches for individual water sources often based around water safety plans wsp who 2009 2017 these approaches evaluate potential hazards within the catchment of each source assess their risks and determine and validate control measures the effective risk assessment and control of enteric viruses to groundwater sources requires evidence concerning their source transport and persistence however there is limited evidence concerning these properties for viruses compared with other pathogens because viruses have historically been difficult and expensive to analyse for hunt and johnson 2017 and there is a the lack of association between viruses and bacterial indicator organisms fout et al 2017 wu et al 2011 studies investigating the occurrence of viruses in groundwater have traditionally been heavily focussed within north america e g

there is a tendency for these to be local focused investigations of a specific virus associated with a known disease outbreak kauppinen et al 2018 lugoli et al 2011 shin et al 2017 with a lack of spatial temporal studies investigating a range of viral targets in the uk there is minimal understanding of viruses in groundwater gregory et al 2014 historical work demonstrated the effective attenuation of viruses in the chalk unsaturated zone at wastewater recharge sites baxter et al 1981 at a time when 300 ml d of sewage was infiltrated directly into the ground two other projects have investigated viruses in five multi level piezometers and confirmed enterovirus norovirus and coliphage contamination of the sandstone aquifer beneath the cities of birmingham and nottingham powell et al 2003 and doncaster morris et al 2006 as a precursor to our field study we sent questionnaires to all twenty water companies in england and wales in 2018 to assess current virus monitoring in the water industry the seventeen companies that responded confirmed there is no monitoring for viruses instead viral risks are managed by wsps in our study we examined enteric viruses in groundwater derived public water sources across england we selected eight sites within the most important water supply aquifers which are also important water resources in many parts of europe the sites are of varying microbial risk according to historical faecal indicator organism data and in contrasting risk settings rural urban depth below the surface overlying protective geological cover we investigated the seasonal occurrence of seven virus targets in raw groundwater including hepatitis e virus which is an emerging threat in high income countries where the role of transmission through water is unclear fenaux et al 2019 wang et al 2020 we relate viral nucleic acid na occurrence and concentration to the hydrological conditions and evaluate the use of faecal indicator organisms total coliforms and e coli to predict viral na presence absence 2 methods 2 1 study sites 2 1 1 selection and hydrogeology eight sites 1 8 were selected to investigate viral occurrence across the major aquifers of england fig 1 a these sites were distributed across the country with a focus towards aquifers that are most utilised for water supply where multiple sites were chosen within the same aquifer they were located in separate geological basins where aquifer properties are more likely to be contrasting three sites 1 2 5 were selected in the cretaceous chalk the chalk is the principal aquifer providing more than half of total licensed groundwater abstraction in england and wales monkhouse and richards 1982 and is the most important source of freshwater in north western europe downing et al 1993 the chalk is a dual porosity soft white limestone comprising a low permeability matrix intersected by vertical joints and horizontal fractures groundwater recharge is generally considered to occur via piston displacement through the matrix with episodic movement through joints fractures during periods of intense rainfall occurring at times of high soil moisture content ireson and butler 2011 sorensen et al 2015b water movement through the saturated zone is mainly through joints fractures the chalk is more karstified in some locations and groundwater velocities from 0 5 to 6 8 km day have been reported from sinking streams to discharge locations maurice et al 2010 sites 1 and 2 are both located in areas of the chalk where karstic features are mapped abundantly at the surface and tracer tests have demonstrated travel times from these features to the sources in under 24 h there is no evidence that site 5 is connected to surface karst although features are mapped in the vicinity two sites 7 8 were selected in the permo triassic sandstone the second most important aquifer accounting for around a quarter of licensed abstraction in england and wales monkhouse and richards 1982 and the aquifer also covers large parts of west and central europe crampon et al 1996 the permo triassic sandstones are predominantly interlayered sequences of pebbles sands and silts of varying cementation groundwater movement is typically through the matrix although fracture flow can provide preferential flow paths on a local or even regional scale price et al 1982 a further two sites 4 6 were located on jurassic limestones that comprise the third most important source of groundwater in the uk neumann et al 2003 the jurassic limestones are relatively thin beds where groundwater flow is almost entirely through fractures joints sites 4 and 6 are sited on the jurassic inferior oolite group and lincolnshire limestone formation respectively site 4 is 50 m upgradient from a spring known to be hydraulically connected to the borehole and historical records report it is drilled into an underground river site 6 is protected by 10 m of low permeability deposits and receives recharge from the aquifer outcrop at least 1 km to the west that is likely to be through the soil given the lack of proximal sinking streams bottrell et al 2000 site 3 is a carboniferous limestone spring in the yorkshire dales where groundwater flow is almost entirely along solution enhanced fractures including caves worthington and ford 2009 the carboniferous limestone has the largest fractures of any aquifer in the uk and is the endmember in terms of karstic features and behaviour atkinson and smart 1981 the sites include two springs 2 3 and six boreholes 1 4 8 table s1 the rest water levels at the boreholes are shallow 10 m from the surface although the screens start as deep as 61 m below the surface site 7 all sites with the exception of site 8 have overlying protective superficial cover of between around 2 and 15 m which is either sand gravel 1 2 7 or silt clay dominated 3 4 5 6 land use within 500 m of the sites can be classified as either rural 1 3 4 6 7 where enteric viral sources could comprise leaking septic tanks leaking low density sewers and agricultural sources or urban 2 5 8 where the predominant viral source would be a leaking high density sewerage network site 1 comprised two separate boreholes a and b that are similar from a hydrogeological and microbial risk perspective fig 1b and are 8 km apart site 1a was sampled at the beginning of the study before the site was out of operation then site 1b was sampled 2 1 2 historical bacterial indicator organism data the sites are ordered 1 8 according to the likelihood of e coli fig 1b and total coliform fig s1 presence over ten years of collated water company data collected between january 2010 and december 2019 at approximately weekly to monthly intervals n 184 sites 1a and 1b are the highest microbial risk sites with e coli and total coliforms present in 96 and 99 of samples respectively the lowest risk sites 7 8 are those in the permo triassic sandstone three percent of samples have tested positive for total coliforms at site 7 with a single detection of e coli there was no single positive detection at site 8 which is located in the centre of a historic town with no protective superficial deposits to protect the aquifer and a shallow water table table s1 small pore throats and slow flow in the sandstone are likely to impede live bacterial transport over appreciable distances which would explain why no indicator organisms have been detected at site 8 occasional positive indicator organism detects at 61 m depth at site 7 would only be possible if fractures are providing preferential flow horizons within the environs of the site sites with the greatest likelihood of the presence of indicator organisms also tended to have the highest maximum number of the respective organisms maximum e coli numbers were 24 200 9210 5700 1000 77 60 17 6 0 cfu 100 ml at sites 1a 8 respectively maximum total coliform numbers were 241 900 38 700 72 000 1000 100 201 116 41 0 cfu 100 ml at sites 1a 8 respectively 2 1 3 hydrological observations hydrological observations comprising spring discharge and groundwater level data were collated from january 2010 until february 2020 table s1 spring discharge data were collated for sites 2 and 3 from water company records it was not possible to utilise groundwater level observations from the borehole sites due to pump duty cycles pump rotation and longer periods of site shutdown consequently regionally representative groundwater level data were retrieved from observation boreholes within 2 40 km of the sites from a combination of the environment agency environmental regulator in england and water company observation boreholes table s1 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 sample rounds sampling was conducted in four rounds r1 4 targeting typical distinct periods of differing hydrological conditions and microbial risk fig 2 in 2019 r1 3 and 2020 r4 r1 was selected as the period of typically lowest microbial risk which also generally coincides with peak or close to groundwater levels spring discharge r2 targeted mid summer when microbial risks tend to be higher than r1 and groundwater levels spring discharges are typically falling the summer corresponds to a period where extreme rainfall often convective is more common as a result of higher air and sea temperatures dunstone et al 2018 hand et al 2004 jones et al 2013 such intense rainfall events can lead to significant sporadic faecal contamination of public water sources for example the 28th june 2012 supercell and other large storms in june and july 2012 hannaford and parry 2012 marsh and parry 2012 parry et al 2013 align with peak e coli counts at sites 2 6 and 7 r3 was conducted towards the beginning of the hydrological year which starts in october when microbial risks are greatest at this time of year groundwater levels spring discharges are low but soil moisture deficits are typically being overcome and the annual recharge season is commencing r4 was undertaken four months into the hydrological year when groundwater levels spring discharges have been rising rapidly and microbial risks remain elevated these descriptions represent mean conditions across all sites and site to site variability is shown in fig s2 samples were not obtained from site 1a in r3 and r4 site 4 in r2 and site 6 in r3 site 1a was not in operation during r3 and r4 due to elevated turbidity and site 1b was sampled in r4 instead site 6 was shut down in r3 because of elevated levels of bacterial indicator organisms site 4 had been sampled in r2 but the filter cartridge was mistakenly destroyed before extraction 2 2 2 virus sample collection and analysis virus extraction concentration and analysis followed methodology validated by the aquavalens project gunnarsdottir et al 2020 and references therein virus particles were concentrated at each public water supply by filtering through hollow fibre asahi polysulfone filters asahi kasei oita japan in sampling rounds r1 and r2 rexeed 25a filters were used before the global unavailability of the units forced a transition to leoceed 21h filters in rounds r3 and r4 the two filters are identical with the exception of the housing diameters and the membrane surface areas that are 2 5 and 2 1 m2 for the rexeed 25a and leoceed 21h respectively four filter units were used in parallel for each sample to maximise the potential flow rate these units were housed in a bespoke sampling rig that contained analogue pressure gauges and ball valves to monitor and regulate water pressure respectively to ensure the water pressure did not exceed the operational pressure limits of the filters total flow was monitored following filtration on the rig using a flow metre digiflow 6710 m savant electronics inc taiwan the sampling rig was sterilised between uses by re circulating boiling water with a peristaltic pump 410 solinst canada for one hour laboratory trials confirmed no carryover of target viral na prior to deployment furthermore sequential field samples from our study were not positive for identical viral na confirming no cross contamination on arrival at each site the raw water sampling tap was sterilised with 99 5 ethanol and the tap was run to waste for one minute before connecting the sampling rig the aim was always to filter 1000 l of water though this was not always possible where the water pressure was insufficient particularly at gravity fed springs 2 3 or where site operations restricted the available filtration time a median of 886 l of water was filtered with a range of 235 1039 l which took between 2 75 and 6 hours following completion the filters were transported in a cool box to the laboratory where they were stored at 4 c for up to 48 h before elution at the laboratory viral na was eluted from each filter by back flushing with 250 ml of a sterile buffer containing 0 001 antifoam 0 01 tween 80 and 0 01 sodium hexametaphosphate solution approximately 400 500 ml of sample was recovered at this primary concentration stage secondary concentration involved polyethylene glycol bioultra 8000 peg precipitation and centrifugation 280 ml splits of eluted sample were mixed with 100 ml of 50 w v peg precipitation buffer and 10 ml of 37 5 w v solution of beef extract both in sterile deionized water and incubated overnight at 4 c where a sample split was 280 ml then the volume was made up to 280 ml with additional elution buffer the sample split was then centrifuged at 12 000 x g for 40 min at 4 c to produce a pellet the supernatant was aspirated off and the pellets from each sample split and all four filters were combined and suspended in 1 5 4 ml resuspension buffer 0 001 antifoam 0 01 tween 80 solution in phosphate buffered saline pbs the volume of the suspension concentrate was recorded before it was transferred to a 7 ml plastic bijou bottle and stored at 80 c until na extraction the na extraction was performed on 700 Âµl aliquots of concentrates in 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes samples were lysed chemically using 650 Âµl of unex lysis buffer microbiologics usa and 50 Âµl of proteinase k 600mau ml at 56 c for 1 h in a water bath the supernatant was transferred to a clean eppendorf tube containing 0 5 g of 0 1 mm glass beads and 0 5 g of 0 7 mm zirconia beads and vortexed for 15 s the samples were processed for 2 30 s in a fastprep 24 5 g instrument mp biomedical usa at a speed setting of 6 0 m s before centrifuging at 10 000 x g for 30 s the supernatant was transferred to a silica nucleic acid extraction column qiagen germany for purification and the column was washed with 500 Âµl of 100 ethanol then 500 Âµl of 70 ethanol with centrifuging at 10 000 x g for 60 s and the filtrate being discarded between each step finally viral na was eluted by adding 50 Âµl of nuclease free water to the column and centrifuging at 13 000 x g for 60 s this final step was repeated twice and the two volumes were combined and samples stored at 20 c for up to 3 months or at 80 c for later use quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr or reverse transcriptase qpcr rt qpcr was performed on the extracted na using a cfx96 bio rad usa seven viruses that are commonly observed in the environment were targeted using validated commercially available kits hepatitis a hav norovirus nov gi nov gii q standard ceeramtools biomÃ©rieux france hepatitis e hev human adenovirus f hadv f rotavirus a rv a genetic pcr solutions spain and enterovirus ev genesig primerdesign ltd uk further details for the biomÃ©rieux and primerdesign kits are available from international organization for standardization geneva 15216 1 2017 2017 and dierssen et al 2008 respectively all kits are taqman probe based assays that target specific amplicons hence melt curve analysis was not required details of the cycling conditions are provided in table s2 where a reverse transcription was required this was undertaken as part of a one step reaction before the pcr cycle each viral target was quantified on a single 96 well plate each containing all samples positive and negative controls in all instances 5 Âµl of template was used positive controls consisted of the reference standards provided to generate the standard curves fig s3 with biomÃ©rieux providing additional positive controls for their kits and for ev which all amplified table s4 negative controls were performed on each batch of the extraction and pellet re suspension buffers used comprising six in total for each target nuclease free water was also used as a negative control during reverse transcription and amplification with two controls analysed for each target in addition to biomÃ©rieux providing negative controls with their kits none of the negative controls amplified within the respective maximum number of cycles no inhibition tests were performed on these low turbidity groundwater samples with none of the samples being coloured after extraction the biomÃ©rieux genetic pcr solutions and primerdesign kits had maximum amplification cycles of 45 40 and 50 respectively positive amplifications observed 5 cycles from the respective cycle limits were deemed true positives given negative controls did not amplify in line with biomÃ©rieux and primerdesign instructions and bustin and nolan 2004 starting quantities sq were quantified by comparing the quantification cycle cq values table s3 to standard curves fig s3 produced by serial dilution of reference standards provided by the manufacturers in line with their instructions two positive samples had sq values of 1 gene copy per reaction for hav na although the cq values were less than the positive controls tables s3 and s4 sq values were then converted to gene copy number per litre of filtered groundwater assuming 100 efficiency during extraction and treatment therefore the reported concentrations should be considered minimum values as losses would have occurred during extraction and treatment 2 2 3 indicator organism sample collection and analysis a sample for total coliforms and e coli was collected after the virus sample in a 1 l pet sample bottle vwr cat no 331 0269 for the first 12 of the 29 samples all of r1 and four of the seven r2 samples these samples were analysed at the university of surrey by colilert 18 quanti tray method iso 9308 2 2012 before closure of the laboratory by the university subsequently the project was reliant upon the routine raw water sampling and analysis undertaken by the water companies sca 2009 of the 17 water company samples five were taken on the same day five within 18 h and three within 42 h of the virus sample of the remaining samples three were taken 3 5 days apart from the virus sample but these were at sites 7 and 8 where indicator organisms are very rarely or never recorded and were all negative finally two indicator organism samples were positive four days either side of the r3 virus sample at site 3 2 3 statistical analysis all analysis was conducted in r version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 and figures were produced using the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 bacterial indicator organisms were assessed as predictors of viral na presence absence using logistic regression models developed using the core command glm models were evaluated in terms of significance true positive rate sensitivity false positive rate true negative rate specificity and false negative rate to contextualise the hydrological conditions at the point of sampling monthly standardised groundwater indices sgis bloomfield and marchant 2013 were calculated using the hydrological observations table s1 however instead of the inverse normal distribution applied by bloomfield and marchant 2013 we employed an inverse uniform distribution between 0 and 1 so sgis were more easily interpretable before estimating sgis gaps of three and two months in observations near sites 1 and 6 were infilled by linear interpolation sgi was calculated by splitting data from each site into mean observations for each calendar month these were ordered and assigned a rank an inverse uniform cumulative distribution function was applied and the normalised monthly indices were merged to form a continuous sgi time series therefore a value of 1 refers to groundwater levels spring discharge being at a monthly maximum over the ten year period 3 results 3 1 widespread viral nucleic acid prevalence target viral na was detected at seven of the eight sites in 31 of samples and 7 of samples tested positive for multiple types fig 3 hav was the most frequently detected na 17 samples 63 sites followed by nov gi 14 samples 38 sites hev 7 samples 25 sites and a single detection of hadv f there were no positive detections of ev nov gii or rv a na there were no consistent patterns of co occurrence amongst viral na nov gi was the only viral na to be detected multiple times at the same site occurring at forty times the concentration in r4 january than r1 april and was absent in between r2 and r3 the two highest concentrations of viral na relate to nov gi at concentrations up to 9 6 103 copies l 1 fig 3 table s5 seven sites were positive for viral na on at least a single occasion fig 3 therefore viral na was present in all four aquifers beneath both rural and urban land uses and across a range of microbial risk settings figs 3 and 1b the lowest microbial risk location according to historic indicator organism data site 8 was the only location testing negative for viral na throughout the study hav was the only viral na detected in all four aquifers viral na was most prevalent during sampling rounds r3 and r4 fig 3 seven of the nine positive samples for viral na and the only ones testing positive for multiple types of viral na occurred in rounds r3 and r4 furthermore the highest five na concentrations were all during these rounds 3 2 viral nucleic acid prevalence relates to groundwater recharge eighty nine percent of positive samples for viral na were associated with a rising groundwater level spring discharge fig 4 r1 samples were collected around peak groundwater level spring discharge with only a sample at site 7 being positive for viral na fig 4 this positive sample was taken when the site was responding to recharge from several low pressure weather systems bringing persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in local pluvial flooding turner et al 2019 site 2 contained the only positive detect on the falling limb of a hydrograph occurring in r2 the majority of detections were in r3 and r4 after the main 2019 20 recharge season commenced consistently across the sites in late september 3 3 viral nucleic acid relationship to bacterial indicator organisms neither total coliforms p value 0 625 nor e coli p value 0 562 were significant single predictors of the presence absence of viral na sensitivity for total coliforms and e coli were 63 and 50 respectively fig 5 specificity for total coliforms and e coli were 48 and 62 respectively fig 5 all sites 1 7 with previous evidence of total coliforms and e coli fig 1b tested positive for viral na in at least one sampling round these sites all tested positive for total coliforms and all but site 7 tested positive for e coli between february 2019 and january 2020 site 8 with no previous evidence of any coliforms showed no evidence of virus contamination all bacterial indicator organism data are shown in tables s5 and s6 4 discussion 4 1 hepatitis a hepatitis is a major waterborne disease resulting in fever pain malaise diarrhoea vomiting and jaundice hav was associated with 50 of global hepatitis cases in 2008 bosch et al 2008 in high income countries hav infections are considered uncommon and typically considered to be imported from low income countries where the virus is endemic and sanitation and hygiene may be poor although outbreaks in certain at risk groups do occur carrillo santisteve et al 2017 in 2018 public health england confirmed 452 cases and reported that cases have been falling from a peak incidence in 1990 of 7545 cases phe 2019 the limited confirmed cases amongst the population raises the question of why hav was the most commonly detected viral na in our study firstly infections are frequently asymptomatic or subclinical particularly amongst children and are likely to be underreported matin et al 2006 phe 2019 for example a 2008 blood donor study in southwest england demonstrated an incidence of 0 4 in 4503 assays dalton et al 2008 secondly viruses are shed in large numbers from infected individuals and are frequently detected in sewage and surface water samples in high income countries hellmÃ©r et al 2014 pina et al 2001 thirdly hav has been detected in groundwater in other high income countries borchardt et al 2003 shin et al 2017 notably 8 6 of 150 public water supply boreholes spread across 35 states of the usa abbaszadegan et al 1999 the virus s occurrence in groundwater has been attributed to its enhanced mobility through the unsaturated zone and its persistence in the environment compared to other enteric viruses borchardt et al 2003 sobsey et al 1986 indeed hav was the only viral na detected in all four aquifers hav has been responsible for multiple virus related groundwater outbreaks globally murphy et al 2017 and was the most common pathogen 8 5 of those with known aetiology linked to outbreaks in untreated groundwater supplies in the usa between 1971 and 2008 wallender et al 2014 the virus has also been one of the most common causes of infectious disease outbreaks related to drinking water both surface water and groundwater derived in canada between 1971 and 2001 schuster et al 2005 4 2 hepatitis e hev is an emerging threat in high income countries and the main cause of acute hepatitis worldwide with an estimated 20 million people infected annually fenaux et al 2019 hakim et al 2017 in high income countries there is a shift in human infections towards zoonotic genotypes giii and iv that also occur in pigs pavio et al 2015 runoff from pig farms and land treated with pig slurry as well as wastewater from slaughterhouses can introduce hev into the aquatic environment fenaux et al 2019 krog et al 2017 nevertheless the human source is also appreciable and 93 of untreated sewage samples from edinburgh s domestic sewage works receiving no agricultural effluent or runoff tested positive for hev over a period of six months smith et al 2016 infections are often linked to the consumption of pork and shellfish fenaux et al 2019 although drinking water source was associated with seroprevalence in france mansuy et al 2016 and hev has been shown to persist through water treatment into tap water in sweden wang et al 2020 in england hev infections are increasing year on year with numerous indigenously acquired infections ijaz et al 2014 a study of 225 000 blood donations in southeast england demonstrated 3 5 of donors were viraemic hewitt et al 2014 therefore there is a large source within the human population although both detects sites 4 and 7 were from boreholes located in predominantly rural areas hence could either be from an agricultural or human sources there appears a lack of comparable studies that have either investigated or documented hev in groundwater in high income countries despite the consumption of groundwater being suggested as a potential pathway king et al 2018 4 3 norovirus acute gastroenteritis causes the second greatest burden of all infectious diseases globally and novs are estimated to account for 20 of all cases ahmed et al 2014 globally nov is the most frequently responsible enteric pathogen for disease outbreaks relating to groundwater in the academic literature murphy et al 2017 including examples from the usa borchardt et al 2011 france gallay et al 2006 and south korea kim et al 2005 in the uk there are estimated to be around 3 million cases per year of gastroenteritis resulting from nov tam et al 2012 although nov gii is the dominant genotype van beek et al 2018 nov is commonly detected in treated wastewater and rivers in the uk merrett et al 2013 palfrey et al 2011 and has been confirmed in groundwater powell et al 2003 therefore our results are supported by the prevalence of nov within the uk population and aquatic environment as well as its common occurrence in groundwater in high income countries uk infections also show pronounced seasonality year on year typically being highest from november through to april phe 2020 this seasonality matches the occurrence of nov gi na in our data with detections only in january april and november 4 4 viruses related to groundwater recharge viral contamination was transient which is consistent with a study of 50 wells sampled in four different seasons in usa borchardt et al 2003 there is limited evidence to indicate viral na is persisting in the sampled locations for long periods with viral na arriving when groundwater was responding to recharge if this na is transported directly from recent sources at the surface then the associated viruses are more likely to be infectious however the viruses could equally be re mobilised from the unsaturated zone or emanate from older sources which could be treated in the case of certain effluent and may be non infectious research from the usa has also noted that virus occurrence in groundwater relates to groundwater recharge events bradbury et al 2013 gotkowitz et al 2016 4 5 viruses transported by preferential flow the most commonly detected viral na hav hev and nov gi were all detected at site 7 which has the deepest screen demonstrating viral na transport to at least 60 m below the ground surface in a sandstone aquifer this na could potentially have been transported through the pores of the sandstone as viruses are small enough to enter the aquifer matrix however the travel time to 60 m is likely to be excessive for the survival of viral na and combined with previous evidence of culturable bacterial indicator organisms supports microbial transport via fractures from leaking sewers as hypothesised nearby in the aquifer morris et al 2006 viral na at the other six positive sites are also likely to have been transported through fractures given the hydrogeology depth to screen evidence for bacterial indicator organisms and seasonal occurrence during the recharge season there is no evidence for preferential flow at site 8 where viral na was absent with no previous positive detections of coliforms despite the urban and shallow water table setting the different location settings were nearly all susceptible to the transmission of viral na these results indicate that the immediate environs of the location do not relate to virus risk be that urban rural setting or protective overlying geology including 15 m of silt and clay this is likely to reflect the nature of rapid preferential flow paths in both the unsaturated and saturated zone which are capable of delivering viruses from where sources are present and protective cover is lacking or can be bypassed furthermore differences in sorption capacity between aquifers overlying deposits and their associated soils appear unimportant because viral na was omnipresent across aquifer settings although only hav was present in all four aquifers 4 6 temporal representativeness of results rainfall during winter and early spring in 2018 19 was below average across the study area barker et al 2019 turner et al 2019 resulting in subdued groundwater recharge and groundwater levels spring discharges typically being below normal during round r1 fig 6 contrastingly june to october 2019 was the second wettest on record in england and wales over the last 50 years parry et al 2019 with persistent heavy rainfall continuing during november resulting in serious flooding across the centre and north of england muchan et al 2019 groundwater levels spring discharges transitioned from generally below normal in r2 to well above normal by r3 reaching peaks at sites 6 and 7 and their second highest at sites 2 and 4 for the period 2010 2019 rainfall remained above average over much of the study area in december turner et al 2020 before returning to more typical values in january barker et al 2020 as a result groundwater levels springs discharges continued to receive recharge and increased during round r4 typically maintaining exceptionally high levels discharge fig 6 it is possible that the exceptionally wet conditions encountered prior to and during the 2019 20 recharge season r3 and r4 enhanced the transport of viral na to groundwater particularly given the identified association of viral na with recharge here alternatively it is also possible that unusually high precipitation diluted existing sources of viruses arriving at the water table the only available evidence to support either of these two arguments comes from bacterial indicator organism data however total coliforms and e coli were typically close to or below monthly means during the study period fig s4 hence there is no strong evidence for the meteorological conditions enhancing or diminishing faecal contamination of the sites during the study period 4 7 viral indicators the lack of relationship between either total coliforms or e coli and viral na on an individual sample basis in our study is supported by previous meta analyses fout et al 2017 wu et al 2011 fout et al 2017 compiled data from twelve groundwater studies and demonstrated total coliforms and e coli had very low sensitivity 12 and 2 but higher specificity 88 and 97 respectively for the prediction of viruses that were quantified by molecular methods sensitivity was slightly higher for predicting viruses quantified by culture methods perhaps because this is a comparison of viable organisms but still poor total coliforms 29 and e coli 26 fout et al 2017 total coliforms and e coli appear to have merit for evaluating whether a site is at risk or not of virus contamination and all sites in our study could be correctly classified using historical data the presence of these indicators would confirm a potential rapid pathway to the near surface and potential sources of viruses in the environment the availability of long term records 10 years for this purpose is invaluable because viral sources can be transient and rapid pathways more likely to be active during extreme hydrological conditions strong support for the use of virus risk classification using e coli is provided by fout et al 2017 who demonstrated a specificity of 94 for e coli prediction of viruses by molecular methods at the site level we consider this high specificity at the site level to be the main contributor to the high specificity estimated at the individual sample level in their dataset sensitivity remains very low 12 with abundant false positives hence why e coli is not suitable to be used as a viral indicator at the sample level the lack of co occurrence amongst viral na targets here provides no evidence that certain viruses such as previously suggested ev hot et al 2003 or adenoviruses farkas et al 2020 can be used as indicators of a broader range of viruses in groundwater indeed ev was absent and there was only a single detection of hadv f despite adenoviruses being shown to be one of the more stable viruses in water and hence a potentially conservative indicator of other viruses farkas et al 2020 sidhu et al 2015 furthermore the meta analysis of fout et al 2017 demonstrated that somatic coliphages now suggested as an indicator of enteric viruses in the eu who 2017 are no better than e coli as viral indicators in groundwater alternative proposed novel viral indicators often associated with sewage include ibuprofen allen 2013 or in situ fluorescence spectroscopy that can be measured in real time sorensen et al 2015a 2018 5 conclusions the episodic prevalence of viral nucleic acid across the majority of public water sources all major water supply aquifers and a range of typical microbial risk settings in both urban and rural areas indicate potentially widespread seasonal viral risks in groundwater used for drinking the public water sources that were sampled all have suitable treatment measures in place for the provision of safe drinking water before supply however there are likely to be other sites notably private water sources where water treatment is insufficient and public health risks from viruses may be present to manage potential groundwater virus contamination via water safety plan wsp risk assessments larger scale studies are required to further understand key risk factors within catchments for example viral sources and relative loading subsurface transport viral persistence and viral viability sampling for viruses should be focussed during periods of groundwater recharge when they are most likely to occur if investigating viral risks at a source the lack of co occurrence amongst viral targets suggests a widespread suite of viruses would be more suitable than investigating a single indicator target such as adenoviruses in untreated groundwater bacterial indicator organisms do have value to assess whether a viral risk is present a source with an absence of indicators in regularly collected
