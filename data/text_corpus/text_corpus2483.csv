12415,free transparent exopolymer particles tep are an important type of tep researchers have recognized the significant contribution of free tep to irreversible membrane fouling when treating algae laden water constructing a reasonable process to effectively decelerate membrane fouling caused by free tep is necessary for the ultrafiltration of algae laden water our experiments indicate that the integrated process of magnetic anion exchange resin miex ultrafiltration uf can effectively impede the irreversible membrane fouling caused by free tep compared with independent uf after multi cycle filtration the growth rate of hydraulically and chemically irreversible fouling decreased by 40 and 21 respectively during the miex uf process the interfacial forces between free tep and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf miex were determined using atomic force microscopy and the results showed that the interfacial force of miex free tep was 4 3 fold higher than that of pvdf free tep although the adsorption of free tep by miex partly reduced membrane fouling during the miex uf process the miex dynamic layer contributed the most to the alleviation of irreversible membrane fouling during miex uf our experimental results provide a more feasible process design for effectively controlling the tep induced irreversible membrane fouling graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration transparent exopolymer particles miex the integrated process membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf is an important barrier for the biosafety of drinking water because of its efficient interception of algae and their extracellular products especially during algal blooms 1 however algae and their metabolites in water result in serious membrane fouling of uf 2 3 extracellular polymers secreted by algae spontaneously aggregate in water to form transparent exopolymer particles tep with high viscosity and a high carbon nitrogen ratio 4 5 it is difficult to remove tep by backwashing after it settles on the membrane surface or in the membrane pores moreover tep allows other pollutants such as algal cells bacteria and organic or inorganic colloids to attach to the membrane surface exacerbating irreversible fouling 4 moreover tep aggravates the irreversible adhesion of algal cells and bacteria to the membrane surface providing living microorganisms with an ideal attachment platform and a concentrated nutrient substrate to promote the formation and development of membrane biofouling 6 7 tep exists in water in two forms free and bound tep combined with algal cells free tep is easily deformed and its particle size is smaller than that of bound tep free tep can cause more severe irreversible membrane fouling than bound tep can as confirmed in our previous study 8 moreover the content of free tep was significantly higher than that of bound tep in total tep 9 therefore the effective reduction in membrane fouling caused by free tep is important for the uf of algae laden water however previous studies have focused on the alleviation of total tep induced membrane fouling and there are few reports on the alleviation of free tep induced membrane fouling appropriate pretreatment units can not only improve the water quality of uf but also effectively reduce tep induced membrane fouling 10 12 coagulation is the most concerned pretreatment unit however the removal of colloidal tep free tep with particle size between 0 05 and 0 4 μm via coagulation is considerably lower than that of granular tep and 90 of tep in most surface water or wastewater treatment effluent are colloidal tep 9 13 14 the integrated adsorption uf process where the adsorbent is directly added to the membrane reactor is a commonly used membrane combination process that provides good effluent quality without increasing the footprint area 15 17 the dissolved organic carbon doc removal by a magnetic anion exchange resin miex is similar to that of powdered activated carbon pac and miex can be reused after simple regeneration 18 19 furthermore the integrated miex uf process is significantly better than the integrated pac uf process in reducing irreversible membrane fouling caused by organic matter 20 miex can be combined with uf in two ways a separate miex uf process solid liquid separation after miex adsorption followed by uf of the supernatant and an integrated miex uf process miex adsorption and membrane filtration are completed in the same reactor miex uf is the most widely used process in reported studies researchers believe that miex uf can alleviate long term membrane fouling although it may be less effective for short term membrane fouling control 21 22 our previous studies have demonstrated that the miex uf process has better performance than the miex uf process in terms of membrane fouling mitigation including organic and biological fouling while maintaining the effluent quality during short term or long term operation 23 25 however the mitigation performance of the integrated miex uf in terms of membrane fouling caused by tep particularly by free tep has not been reported based on these studies focusing on the irreversible membrane fouling caused by free tep the fouling control performance of the integrated miex uf process during the treatment of algae laden water is discussed and the corresponding mechanism is analyzed these experimental results are valuable for effective mitigation of irreversible uf membrane fouling when treating algae laden water 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials as one of the most widely occurring algae in natural water bloom 26 27 microcystis aeruginosa no hb905 was used in this study it was provided by the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology fachb miex a strong base anion exchange resin was purchased from orica water care australia unlike traditional resins miex is specially designed to remove natural organic matter from water miex had an average size of 180 μm and was stored in a saturated nacl solution before use the uf membrane used in the experiments was a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membrane purchased from motimo membrane inc china the average pore size of the membrane was 0 02 μm and surface zeta potentials of the pvdf membranes are shown in fig s1 the membrane module was self made and the effective filtration area was 10 37 cm2 the filtration direction of the membrane module was outside in the detailed parameters of the membrane module are listed in table 1 2 2 preparation and concentration determination of free tep solution m aeruginosa was cultured in bg 11 medium in triangular flasks at 25 0 5 c during the culture period the light intensity was 2000 lx and the light dark ratio was 12 h 12 h when m aeruginosa reached the stationary phase the supernatant of the algal solution was obtained by high speed centrifugation 10 000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was filtered through a polycarbonate membrane pore size 0 05 μm and the tep trapped on the membrane was re dispersed into deionized water using ultrasound to obtain free tep reserve solution the solution was diluted with deionized water to the concentration required for the experimental influent before use free tep was qualitatively stained with alcian blue solution 28 and quantified using the standard curve method 29 30 the detailed method used in this study for determining the concentration of free tep is described in text s1 2 3 analytical methods the distribution of the tep components proteins and polysaccharides on the surface and cross section of the pvdf membrane was observed using laser confocal microscopy clsm sp8 leica germany polysaccharides are the main components of tep produced by algae comprising the majority while protein account for approximately 27 fig s2 therefore free tep is comprised of a mixture of proteins and polysaccharides the distribution of tep on the membrane surface and cross section cannot be observed directly using clsm however can be inferred by analyzing the distribution of polysaccharides and proteins in addition the membrane cross section was obtained by immersing the membrane filaments in liquid nitrogen and then fracturing them before clsm analysis the membrane surface and cross section samples were stained with 0 1 mg ml concanavalin a cona for 30 45 min and then washed thrice with pbs thereafter the samples were transferred to 20 μm alexa fluor succinimidyl ester stained for 45 60 min and rinsed thrice with pbs 31 the dyeing process requires avoidance of light clsm images were captured using a 40 objective lens images of the membrane surface were obtained in the z stack mode and images of the membrane cross section were obtained in the xy mode the clsm test conditions are listed in table 2 the interfacial forces between the tep and miex or pvdf membranes were measured using atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker germany a colloidal probe was prepared by fixing a 9 μm diameter carboxyl modified polystyrene c ps microsphere aladdin shanghai china on the tipless afm cantilever end np o10 bruker germany with uv glue the probe was immersed in a free tep solution at 4 c for 24 h to cover the surface of the microspheres the roughness before and after adsorption was measured using afm to determine whether the surface of the microspheres was completely covered with free tep the retracting curves between the c ps microspheres and miex or pvdf were measured in a 1 mm nahco3 solution ph 7 8 and the corresponding results reflect the interfacial forces between the free tep and miex or pvdf all measured results were normalized to the cp s microsphere diameter the normalized retracting force distance curves were obtained using nanoscope analysis and the normalized frequency distribution curves were fitted using the gaussian amplifier function the details of the modification of the atomic force probe and its determination are described in our previous report 23 the accumulation of free tep on the membrane surface before and after filtration was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem s4800 hitachi japan first a membrane filament 5 cm in length was cut from the membrane module and gently cut open using a sharp knife the membrane sample was fixed on a glass slide with adhesive tape dried under vacuum and platinum coated using a sputterer for sem observation methods for determining irreversible resistance rir reversible resistance rr and intrinsic membrane resistance rm are described in our previous study 23 2 4 multi cycle filtration experiment the reserve solution of free tep was diluted to a concentration of 0 8 0 02 mg xeq l and was used as an influent in multi cycle filtration experiments independent uf as the control group was performed parallelly with the integrated miex uf a diagram of the filtration device is shown in fig s3 the hydraulic retention time of all membrane reactors was 2 h the miex dosage and stirring speed in miex uf process were 15 ml l and 100 rpm respectively a constant flux filtration mode was used and the filtration hydraulic backwashing cycle lasted for 60 min the backwashing flux was twice as that of the inlet flow and the backwashing time was 1 min the chemical cleaning was performed offline the membrane module was soaked in a 0 3 naclo solution for 24 h soaked in deionized water for 30 min and rinsed with deionized water 3 results and discussion 3 1 mitigation of tep induced irreversible fouling during miex uf process our research focused on irreversible membrane fouling because it has a more serious impact on the performance of uf membranes than reversible fouling and even shortens the service life of an uf membrane 32 first the control effect of the miex uf process on hydraulically irreversible membrane fouling caused by free tep was investigated fig 1a illustrates the normalized transmembrane pressure tmp curves of the uf and miex uf processes during four filtration backwashing cycles in the uf process tmp increased rapidly with filtration time indicating that membrane fouling was serious in contrast the tmp growth rate in the miex uf was much slower than that in the uf suggesting that the miex uf can effectively alleviate the free tep induced membrane fouling all the initial tmp values were gathered after each backwashing step during the four cycle filtration experiment and a linear fitting analysis of these data was conducted fig 1b the slope of the first order linear fitting reflects the growth rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling compared with uf the growth rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling during miex uf decreased by 40 the clsm images of the membrane surface and cross sections of these two processes were compared after backwashing fig 2 fig 2 a1 a2 b1 and b2 show the mixed distribution of proteins and polysaccharides fig 2 a3 a4 b3 and b4 showed the single component distributions of proteins fig 2 a5 a6 b5 and b6 show the single component distributions of polysaccharides the accumulation of polysaccharides and proteins during the uf process covered almost the entire membrane surface and spread throughout the cross section however in the miex uf process the two components were distributed sporadically on the membrane surface and their accumulation was considerably lower than in uf the fluorescence intensity of the polysaccharides and proteins in the miex uf membrane cross section was significantly weaker than that of uf only a small amount of proteins passed through the skin layer and entered the membrane matrix the hydraulically irreversible membrane fouling seen in uf was significantly low in the miex uf process fig 1c shows the normalized tmp curves of the two processes during the four filtration chemical cleaning cycles following each chemical cleaning step the increase in the normalized tmp in miex uf was significantly lower than that in uf a first order linear fitting was performed on the initial tmp values after each chemical cleaning step in the four cycle experiment the corresponding slope reflects the growth rate of chemically irreversible fouling fig 1d at the end of the four cycle experiment the growth rate of chemically irreversible fouling during miex uf was 21 lower than that during uf fig 3 shows the clsm images of the membrane surface and cross sections of the two processes similar to the results after hydraulic backwashing after chemical cleaning the accumulated amounts of proteins and polysaccharides on the surface and cross section of the membrane in the miex uf process were significantly lower than those in the uf process indicating that the miex uf process can effectively decelerate the chemically irreversible fouling of the uf membrane 3 2 mitigation mechanism of tep induced membrane fouling during miex uf process the miex is specially designed for the removal of natural organic matter from water 33 therefore adsorption may be one of the reasons why the miex uf process can effectively control tep induced membrane fouling as shown in fig 6b the removal of free tep by miex adsorption was determined and the average removal was approximately 44 miex dose 15 ml l adsorption time 2 h and stirring speed 100 rpm to explore the effect of the adsorption of free tep by the miex on membrane fouling control the normalized tmp curves of miex uf miex uf and uf during one filtration backwashing cycle were compared in this experiment the miex adsorption time resin dosage and stirring speed were identical for both miex uf and miex uf as shown in fig 4a compared to uf the normalized tmp of miex uf decreased by 6 2 at the end of filtration membrane fouling reduction during miex uf was determined using miex adsorption therefore the minor difference in the normalized tmp values between uf and miex uf at the end of filtration indicated that miex adsorption contributed little to mitigate membrane fouling in contrast the normalized tmp in the miex uf was 18 5 lower than that in the uf at the end of filtration revealing that membrane fouling in the miex uf was significantly lower than that in the miex uf as discussed in our previous study the extent of membrane fouling reduction in the miex uf process directly reflected the effect of miex adsorption on membrane fouling mitigation 23 consequently it can be concluded that miex adsorption contributed to reduction in membrane fouling during miex uf however it was not the main method of membrane fouling abatement during miex uf during miex uf continuous stirring was required to ensure the full exposure of pollutants to miex which led to the scraping of resin beads to the membrane surface to evaluate the influence of miex bead scraping on reduced membrane fouling during miex uf the normalized tmp curves of the three processes uf miex uf with virgin resin referred to as miex uf and miex uf with the addition of saturated resin referred to as saturated miex uf during single cycle filtration experiments were compared fig 4a the resin used in the saturated miex uf process was completely saturated with free tep before being added to the membrane reactor therefore in saturated miex uf the reduction in membrane fouling mainly depended on the scraping of miex onto the membrane surface at the end of the filtration the average tmp value during saturated miex uf was only 2 5 lower than that during uf indicating that the contribution of resin scraping to the alleviation of membrane fouling was almost negligible compared with bound tep free tep can easily enter the membrane pores because of its smaller size and easy deformation 34 which was confirmed by clsm analysis of the membrane cross section figs 2 and 3 resin particle scraping was beneficial for impeding the accumulation of pollutants on the membrane surface however it was difficult to effectively inhibit the entry of pollutants into the membrane pores as a result rubbing between the miex and membrane surface had a very weak effect on membrane fouling mitigation in contrast tmp in the miex uf was significantly lower than that in saturated miex uf at the end of filtration which further confirmed that the rubbing of miex on the membrane contributed little to membrane fouling mitigation during miex uf as filtration and backwashing proceeded the miex beads were deposited on or left the membrane surface forming a dynamic layer 24 theoretically the reduction in membrane fouling in the miex uf process depends on three aspects miex adsorption resin scraping of the membrane surface and the dynamic layer effect of the miex on the membrane surface as shown in fig 4a at the end of filtration tmp value in the miex uf was significantly lower than that in both uf and miex uf combined with the aforementioned analysis the important contribution of the dynamic resin layer to membrane fouling mitigation in the miex uf process was preliminarily confirmed furthermore the difference in flux recovery after backwashing among the four processes roughly reflects the difference in membrane fouling reduction as shown in fig 4b ra reflected the effect of miex adsorption on the alleviation of membrane fouling rs reflected the contribution of resin scraping to the reduction in membrane fouling rt reflected the total contribution of miex adsorption resin scraping and the miex dynamic layer to the alleviation of membrane fouling during miex uf the value of rt was much higher than those of ra and rs indicating that neither miex adsorption nor resin scraping were prominent contributors to the alleviation of membrane fouling during miex uf this result further confirms that the miex dynamic layer contributed the most to the reduction in free tep induced membrane fouling the interfacial forces between the free tep and pvdf membrane or miex were analyzed fig 5 the interfacial force of the miex free tep was 4 3 fold higher than that of the pvdf free tep as a result when free tep in the feed water passed through the miex layer on the membrane surface several pollutants were captured by the resin layer because of the stronger interfacial force between the miex and free tep preventing these pollutants from reaching the membrane surface moreover during backwashing the stronger interfacial force between the miex and free tep was conducive to enhancing the carrying effect of miex on pollutants which led to the pollutants leaving the membrane surface together with the miex beads consequently the irreversible accumulation of pollutants on the membrane surface was decelerated fig 6a shows the particle size distribution of free tep and the particle size of free tep mainly ranged between 0 2 and 0 5 μm theoretically the particle size of free tep is considerably larger than the pore size of uf membrane 0 02 μm hence they should be 100 intercepted by uf membrane however owing to the deformation characteristics of free tep and heterogeneity of the membrane pore size i e the existence of individual macropores the rejection rate of tep by uf was only approximately 78 which was also the reason many tep were found inside the membrane during the uf process fig 2b the combined removal of free tep using the miex uf process was approximately 86 fig 6b although the removal of free tep was not significantly improved by the miex uf process the amount of tep that reached the membrane surface fig 6c and remained on the membrane including the surface and inside after backwashing was successfully reduced fig 2 confirming the important contribution of the resin dynamic layer to the mitigation of membrane fouling during the integrated miex uf process 4 conclusion this study focused on irreversible fouling induced by free tep in algae laden water and the performance of membrane fouling control during miex uf was studied subsequently the corresponding mitigation mechanisms were systematically analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 both hydraulically and chemically irreversible membrane fouling were effectively impeded during miex uf after four cycle filtration backwashing experiments the growth rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling in the miex uf was 40 lower than that in the uf process following the four cycle filtration chemical cleaning experiment the growth rate of chemically irreversible fouling in the miex uf was 21 lower than that in the uf process clsm analysis further showed that the build up of irreversible pollutants on the membrane surface or in the cross section was significantly reduced in the miex uf after backwashing and chemical cleaning which further confirmed that the free tep induced irreversible fouling can be effectively reduced by the miex uf process 2 a comparative analysis of the three fouling mitigation mechanisms suggested that in the miex uf process resin scraping contributed the least to mitigating the membrane fouling induced by free tep compared to miex adsorption the dynamic layer effect of miex was considered the most important mechanism for reducing membrane fouling caused by free tep 3 the interfacial force between the miex and free tep was 4 3 fold higher than that between the pvdf membrane and free tep the large difference between the interfacial forces significantly enhanced the carrying effect of the miex on the pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface during backwashing thereby retarding the progress of irreversible membrane fouling during the miex uf credit authorship contribution statement zhaohui

results and discussion 3 1 mitigation of tep induced irreversible fouling during miex uf process our research focused on irreversible membrane fouling because it has a more serious impact on the performance of uf membranes than reversible fouling and even shortens the service life of an uf membrane 32 first the control effect of the miex uf process on hydraulically irreversible membrane fouling caused by free tep was investigated fig 1a illustrates the normalized transmembrane pressure tmp curves of the uf and miex uf processes during four filtration backwashing cycles in the uf process tmp increased rapidly with filtration time indicating that membrane fouling was serious in contrast the tmp growth rate in the miex uf was much slower than that in the uf suggesting that the miex uf can effectively alleviate the free tep induced membrane fouling all the initial tmp values were gathered after each backwashing step during the four cycle filtration experiment and a linear fitting analysis of these data was conducted fig 1b the slope of the first order linear fitting reflects the growth rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling compared with uf the growth rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling during miex uf decreased by 40 the clsm images of the membrane surface and cross sections of these two processes were compared after backwashing fig 2 fig 2 a1 a2 b1 and b2 show the mixed distribution of proteins and polysaccharides fig 2 a3 a4 b3 and b4 showed the single component distributions of proteins fig 2 a5 a6 b5 and b6 show the single component distributions of polysaccharides the accumulation of polysaccharides and proteins during the uf process covered almost the entire membrane surface and spread throughout the cross section however in the miex uf process the two components were distributed sporadically on the membrane surface and their accumulation was considerably lower than in uf the fluorescence intensity of the polysaccharides and proteins in the miex uf membrane cross section was significantly weaker than that of uf only a small amount of proteins passed through the skin layer and entered the membrane matrix the hydraulically irreversible membrane fouling seen in uf was significantly low in the miex uf process fig 1c shows the normalized tmp curves of the two processes during the four filtration chemical cleaning cycles following each chemical cleaning step the increase in the normalized tmp in miex uf was significantly lower than that in uf a first order linear fitting was performed on the initial tmp values after each chemical cleaning step in the four cycle experiment the corresponding slope reflects the growth rate of chemically irreversible fouling fig 1d at the end of the four cycle experiment the growth rate of chemically irreversible fouling during miex uf was 21 lower than that during uf fig 3 shows the clsm images of the membrane surface and cross sections of the two processes similar to the results after hydraulic backwashing after chemical cleaning the accumulated amounts of proteins and polysaccharides on the surface and cross section of the membrane in the miex uf process were significantly lower than those in the uf process indicating that the miex uf process can effectively decelerate the chemically irreversible fouling of the uf membrane 3 2 mitigation mechanism of tep induced membrane fouling during miex uf process the miex is specially designed for the removal of natural organic matter from water 33 therefore adsorption may be one of the reasons why the miex uf process can effectively control tep induced membrane fouling as shown in fig 6b the removal of free tep by miex adsorption was determined and the average removal was approximately 44 miex dose 15 ml l adsorption time 2 h and stirring speed 100 rpm to explore the effect of the adsorption of free tep by the miex on membrane fouling control the normalized tmp curves of miex uf miex uf and uf during one filtration backwashing cycle were compared in this experiment the miex adsorption time resin dosage and stirring speed were identical for both miex uf and miex uf as shown in fig 4a compared to uf the normalized tmp of miex uf decreased by 6 2 at the end of filtration membrane fouling reduction during miex uf was determined using miex adsorption therefore the minor difference in the normalized tmp values between uf and miex uf at the end of filtration indicated that miex adsorption contributed little to mitigate membrane fouling in contrast the normalized tmp in the miex uf was 18 5 lower than that in the uf at the end of filtration revealing that membrane fouling in the miex uf was significantly lower than that in the miex uf as discussed in our previous study the extent of membrane fouling reduction in the miex uf process directly reflected the effect of miex adsorption on membrane fouling mitigation 23 consequently it can be concluded that miex adsorption contributed to reduction in membrane fouling during miex uf however it was not the main method of membrane fouling abatement during miex uf during miex uf continuous stirring was required to ensure the full exposure of pollutants to miex which led to the scraping of resin beads to the membrane surface to evaluate the influence of miex bead scraping on reduced membrane fouling during miex uf the normalized tmp curves of the three processes uf miex uf with virgin resin referred to as miex uf and miex uf with the addition of saturated resin referred to as saturated miex uf during single cycle filtration experiments were compared fig 4a the resin used in the saturated miex uf process was completely saturated with free tep before being added to the membrane reactor therefore in saturated miex uf the reduction in membrane fouling mainly depended on the scraping of miex onto the membrane surface at the end of the filtration the average tmp value during saturated miex uf was only 2 5 lower than that during uf indicating that the contribution of resin scraping to the alleviation of membrane fouling was almost negligible compared with bound tep free tep can easily enter the membrane pores because of its smaller size and easy deformation 34 which was confirmed by clsm analysis of the membrane cross section figs 2 and 3 resin particle scraping was beneficial for impeding the accumulation of pollutants on the membrane surface however it was difficult to effectively inhibit the entry of pollutants into the membrane pores as a result rubbing between the miex and membrane surface had a very weak effect on membrane fouling mitigation in contrast tmp in the miex uf was significantly lower than that in saturated miex uf at the end of filtration which further confirmed that the rubbing of miex on the membrane contributed little to membrane fouling mitigation during miex uf as filtration and backwashing proceeded the miex beads were deposited on or left the membrane surface forming a dynamic layer 24 theoretically the reduction in membrane fouling in the miex uf process depends on three aspects miex adsorption resin scraping of the membrane surface and the dynamic layer effect of the miex on the membrane surface as shown in fig 4a at the end of filtration tmp value in the miex uf was significantly lower than that in both uf and miex uf combined with the aforementioned analysis the important contribution of the dynamic resin layer to membrane fouling mitigation in the miex uf process was preliminarily confirmed furthermore the difference in flux recovery after backwashing among the four processes roughly reflects the difference in membrane fouling reduction as shown in fig 4b ra reflected the effect of miex adsorption on the alleviation of membrane fouling rs reflected the contribution of resin scraping to the reduction in membrane fouling rt reflected the total contribution of miex adsorption resin scraping and the miex dynamic layer to the alleviation of membrane fouling during miex uf the value of rt was much higher than those of ra and rs indicating that neither miex adsorption nor resin scraping were prominent contributors to the alleviation of membrane fouling during miex uf this result further confirms that the miex dynamic layer contributed the most to the reduction in free tep induced membrane fouling the interfacial forces between the free tep and pvdf membrane or miex were analyzed fig 5 the interfacial force of the miex free tep was 4 3 fold higher than that of the pvdf free tep as a result when free tep in the feed water passed through the miex layer on the membrane surface several pollutants were captured by the resin layer because of the stronger interfacial force between the miex and free tep preventing these pollutants from reaching the membrane surface moreover during backwashing the stronger interfacial force between the miex and free tep was conducive to enhancing the carrying effect of miex on pollutants which led to the pollutants leaving the membrane surface together with the miex beads consequently the irreversible accumulation of pollutants on the membrane surface was decelerated fig 6a shows the particle size distribution of free tep and the particle size of free tep mainly ranged between 0 2 and 0 5 μm theoretically the particle size of free tep is considerably larger than the pore size of uf membrane 0 02 μm hence they should be 100 intercepted by uf membrane however owing to the deformation characteristics of free tep and heterogeneity of the membrane pore size i e the existence of individual macropores the rejection rate of tep by uf was only approximately 78 which was also the reason many tep were found inside the membrane during the uf process fig 2b the combined removal of free tep using the miex uf process was approximately 86 fig 6b although the removal of free tep was not significantly improved by the miex uf process the amount of tep that reached the membrane surface fig 6c and remained on the membrane including the surface and inside after backwashing was successfully reduced fig 2 confirming the important contribution of the resin dynamic layer to the mitigation of membrane fouling during the integrated miex uf process 4 conclusion this study focused on irreversible fouling induced by free tep in algae laden water and the performance of membrane fouling control during miex uf was studied subsequently the corresponding mitigation mechanisms were systematically analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 both hydraulically and chemically irreversible membrane fouling were effectively impeded during miex uf after four cycle filtration backwashing experiments the growth rate of hydraulically irreversible fouling in the miex uf was 40 lower than that in the uf process following the four cycle filtration chemical cleaning experiment the growth rate of chemically irreversible fouling in the miex uf was 21 lower than that in the uf process clsm analysis further showed that the build up of irreversible pollutants on the membrane surface or in the cross section was significantly reduced in the miex uf after backwashing and chemical cleaning which further confirmed that the free tep induced irreversible fouling can be effectively reduced by the miex uf process 2 a comparative analysis of the three fouling mitigation mechanisms suggested that in the miex uf process resin scraping contributed the least to mitigating the membrane fouling induced by free tep compared to miex adsorption the dynamic layer effect of miex was considered the most important mechanism for reducing membrane fouling caused by free tep 3 the interfacial force between the miex and free tep was 4 3 fold higher than that between the pvdf membrane and free tep the large difference between the interfacial forces significantly enhanced the carrying effect of the miex on the pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface during backwashing thereby retarding the progress of irreversible membrane fouling during the miex uf credit authorship contribution statement zhaohui

12416,measuring water quality parameters is a significant step in many hydrological assessments dissolved oxygen do is one of these parameters that is an indicator of water quality hence this study offers two novel intelligent models i e the integration of biogeography based optimization bbo and atom search optimization aso with artificial neural network ann to predict the daily do these methods are comparatively assessed and validated against several benchmark techniques five year 2014 2019 water quality data of a usgs station called rock creek station number 01648010 is used for implementing the proposed model in this sense the models first learn the do behavior using 80 of the data and they then predict the do for the fifth year as per the performed sensitivity analysis the water temperature was selected as the most effective parameter in the do prediction trying different population sizes determined an optimal configuration of the employed models and assessing the accuracy of the results revealed that the proposed models can nicely perceive the do pattern with around 4 mean absolute percentage error mape and 97 5 correlation in the testing phase the bbo ann and aso ann models predicted the do of the fifth year with mapes 2 3848 and 2 5170 and correlations of 0 99186 and 0 99135 respectively moreover the suggested bbo ann and aso ann outperformed some similar hybrids from the existing literature lastly an explicit formula is derived from the bbo ann for convenient prediction of the do graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water quality assessment dissolved oxygen biogeography based optimization artificial neural network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as is known water quality wq is a complex function of different environmental and anthropogenic factors within any catchment 1 3 proper wq management is a very significant task for engineers and decision makers dissolved oxygen do is a crucial wq parameter for investigating the health of water and aquatic life 4 while earlier efforts have mostly focused on direct measurement methods i e in situ measurements recent studies have shown that indirect techniques like artificial intelligence ai can provide cheaper and computationally robust alternatives for predicting environmental parameters wq included 5 8 so far various intelligent models e g k mean and gaussian mixture models 9 and time series data mining 10 11 have been promisingly employed in this way machine learning and particularly artificial neural network ann has attracted the attention of many environmental experts as an authoritative predictor 12 15 zhang et al 16 suggested using a combination of kernel principal component analysis kpca and recurrent ann to predict the hourly do trend the role of the kpca lies in reconstructing the water quality factors as well as removing noise from data it was shown that the model gives reliable predictions for the upcoming 1 and 2 h 90 8 and 82 3 accuracy respectively another improvement of the recurrent ann was carried out by li et al 17 who used dempster shafer evidence theory for this purpose they validated the proposed model by predictors including the svr and typical ann cao et al 18 developed a do predictive model based on gated recurrent unit ann and k means clustering this model attained a reliable analysis with a 3 5 relative error of the do content in aquaculture water and was more flexible than conventional tools keshtegar and heddam 19 used a multi layer perceptron mlp for do modeling the tested model could do the prediction with a coefficient of determination r2 0 72 in most cases however a modified response surface method outperformed the mlp heddam 20 investigated and professed the capability of evolving fuzzy neural networks for the same simulation compared to some benchmarks this model was superior more studies concerning the applicability of anns can be found in 21 24 besides various types of ann other intelligent models have been used for wq simulation 25 26 yaseen et al 27 could successfully apply an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with three strategies of grid partition gp fuzzy c means clustering fcm and subtractive clustering sc to predict wq indices of selangor river malaysia in similar research this model was used by han et al 28 as a controlling tool for the do concentration they lastly concluded that it can efficiently handle this task mehdipour et al 29 reported a suitable performance for gene expression programming used for do modeling at eymir lake turkey in the most accurate prediction the root mean square error rmse and r2 were 0 0937 and 0 8031 respectively which show a high accuracy rate for the proposed model huan et al 30 combined least squares svm lssvm and ensemble empirical mode decomposition for do estimation by using different search strategies many intricate problems have been promisingly modeled 31 for instance asadi nalivan et al 32 combined ann with water cycle algorithm wca electrostatic discharge algorithms esda equilibrium optimization eo and political optimizer po to spatially analyze groundwater potential in urmia iran fadaee et al 33 created a powerful anfis by letting it be trained by particle swarm optimization pso and butterfly optimization algorithm boa according to their results these two algorithms can significantly improve the quality of do prediction from a seasonal point of view 6 25 15 94 yaseen et al 34 employed an integration of lssvm and bat algorithm for approximating the do they found that the proposed predictor is better than the multivariate adaptive regression spline mars and m5 tree as it achieved 20 and 42 larger accuracy respectively ruan et al 35 evolved a fuzzy wavelet ann using a genetic algorithm ga for do management toward proper wastewater treatment they finally achieved a robust and efficient control system that optimizes the cost bayram et al 36 could present a reliable analysis of stream do use teaching learning based optimization tlbo a formula was also derived from the tlbo based model the reviewed literature highlights the tendency of machine learning studies to incorporate metaheuristic algorithms in their development 37 38 on the other hand many studies have sufficiently used traditional algorithms such as pso and ga 39 40 therefore a significant task to bridge the gap between recent algorithms and intended applications is introducing novel methods to keep the solution updated with the most recent developments hereupon in the present study two novel metaheuristic techniques namely biogeography based optimization bbo 41 and atom search optimization aso 42 are used for the first time for approximating the do concentration by optimizing an ann model the bbo and aso explore the dependency of the do on water influencing parameters these algorithms are newly developed strategies that imitate natural phenomena i e bbo the migration method of species and aso molecular dynamics method in the interaction between atoms furthermore several benchmark algorithms namely sunflower optimization sfo slime mould algorithm sma crow search algorithm csa shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla and league championship algorithm lca are hired to comparatively validate the performance of the bbo and aso the pivotal contribution of this study to the related body of knowledge i e water quality analysis using ai methods can be stated as introducing and evaluating seven new methodologies and determining the most potential solutions besides the solution is projected to be transformed into a simple mathematical format to be more conveniently usable this study also performs an important analysis to show which water conditions have higher effects on the do concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 data and studied station the concentration of do is influenced by several environmental factors similar to other wq parameters to be predicted e g suspended sediment dissolved nitrogen etc when it comes to intelligent techniques this influence is taken into consideration by determining one or more input factor s more clearly the network tries to establish specific measures to bridge the inputs and output in the neural networks used in this work the inputs of the do are water temperature tw hydrogen potential ph specific conductance cs and discharge q the data are taken from the daily records of a usgs station namely rock creek station number 01648010 freely available at https waterdata usgs gov nwis fig 1 illustrates the exact location of this station fig 2 a d shows the correlation between the do with the tw ph cs and q as is seen the most meaningful r2 is 0 932 obtained for the adverse proportion between the do and tw moreover fig 2 e says that the do goes through a repetitive pattern each year in this relation the do peaks around january february and experiences its lowest values nearly in july august moreover table 1 describes the input and output factors from a statistical point of view over the whole five year period the tw ph cs q and do range from 0 2 and 28 2 c 6 9 and 8 8 115 0 and 6390 0 μs cm 1 0 1 and 40 2 m 3 s 1 and 5 0 and 14 9 mg l 1 respectively also the average do for both datasets is 9 9 mg l 1 an intelligent network also needs sufficient samples to attain a reliable analysis of the do hence the anns use four year records of the water years 2015 to 2018 to explore the do behavior the details of this process which is called the training phase are presented in the following sections the do of the fifth year the water year 2019 is next predicted without any prior knowledge about it this process is called the testing phase two steps were taken for data preprocessing first the records of q which were in ft3 s 1 are converted to m3 s 1 next we checked for missing data and some daily records were eliminated accordingly in the end 1376 and 343 samples are retained in the training and testing datasets respectively note that no further correction e g removal of outliers was applied to the data because the main idea of the article is to investigate the potential of the proposed machine learning in the original circumstances 2 2 methodology fig 3 shows the general steps fulfilled for achieving the objective of the study three major phases are data provision implementation of the models and accuracy assessment as it was explained earlier this study aims at bridging the gap between recent ai developments and intelligent do prediction the main innovations can be addressed as follows a by using several metaheuristic algorithms novel versions of the ann are developed and compared in terms of accuracy and time to determine the most efficient model for do prediction it is an important task because most previous efforts have focused on traditional metaheuristic algorithms such as pso b the used dataset is more comprehensive than some previous studies that used a few influential factors for the do prediction e g dehghani et al 43 solely considered tw and q c the final solution is translated into a non linear mathematical formula for a more convenient prediction d the outstanding models are compared against some of the similar hybrid models in the literature to highlight the improvements of this study in the following the used algorithms are described 2 2 1 biogeography based optimization simon 41 designed the bbo as an efficient metaheuristic algorithm in this algorithm the migration method of species from one island to another one the appearance of new species and the elimination of the existing species are simulated to attain an optimal solution to the given problem the word island indicates a geographically isolated habitat its suitability for having different populations is determined by the habitat suitability index hsi this parameter is usually influenced by various phenomena like rainfall temperature topographic diversity etc these factors are denoted as suitability index variables sivs 44 in the bbo habitats with large hsis represent good solutions and aim to contain a large number of individuals they are also distinguished by a low migration rate and high emigration rate therefore there is a higher probability that promising solutions i e with large hsis share the sivs with lower quality solutions accordingly low quality solutions i e with small hsis are more likely to receive sivs eqs 1 and 2 calculate the emigration rate μ and immigration rate λ 1 μ i e k n 2 λ i i 1 k n where e and i symbolize the maximum μ values of λ respectively also n stands for the largest number of species supported by the habitat and k denotes the number of species belonging to the i th individual accordingly once k n then λ i i and μ i e meaning that the intended habitat can handle the emigration of further species to a weaker one 45 2 2 2 atom search optimization zhao wang and zhang 42 introduced the aso algorithm based on the atomic motion in a so called method of molecular dynamics md based on newton s second law in eq 3 the atom i with the mass mi is affected by constraint gi and interaction fi forces 46 3 a i f i g i m i regarding lennard jones l j potential formula the below equations give the interaction force between an atom couple from j applied to i in d dimensional space and for the iteration t 4 f ij d t 24 ε t σ t 2 σ t r ij t 13 σ t r ij t 7 r ij t r ij d t 5 f ij t 24 ε t σ t 2 σ t r ij t 13 σ t r ij t 7 where σ signifies the collision diameter and ε stands for the potential well depth also given r i as the ith individual s position r ij r i r j gives the distance between the individuals according to the l j the closer the atoms are the higher the likelihood of interaction is and vice versa at the beginning of the aso repulsion can increase the exploration potential by prohibiting large atom concentrations as the algorithm goes on a more positive attraction is obtained and consequently the exploitation is improved hence assuming η t as the depth function for tuning the repulsion or attraction region eq 6 can be rewritten as 6 f ij t η t 2 h ij t 13 h ij t 7 where h determines the repulsion attraction threshold h ij is calculated by the below equation 7 h ij h min r ij t σ t h min r ij t σ t h max r ij t σ t h min h max r ij t σ t h max 8 σ t x ij t j s best x ij t s t 2 in which s best represents a group of atoms that contains the first s individuals that give the lowest cost function and x addresses the atoms positions the whole forces influencing the ith atom from the side of other ones in dimension d f i d are expressed as follows 9 f i d t j s best rand j f ij d t where rand j is a random value in 0 1 concerning newton s third law 10 f ij f ji by using a constraint measure as presented in eq 11 the best atom exercises control over each individual 11 θ i t x i t x best t 2 b i best 2 in the above relationship θ i is the constraint of atom i x best stands for the position of the elite atom and b i best symbolizes the bond length linking the elite and ith atoms in the aso having m as a function of fitness value the mass of atom i is calculated as follows 12 m i t m i t j 1 n m j t 13 m i t e f i t f best t f w t f best t where f i t gives the fitness of the ith individual f w t and f best t are the lowest and highest fitness values respectively given a the depth weight the optimization is fulfilled by regularly updating the velocity v i d and the position x i d of the atoms based on the below equations 47 14 v i d t 1 rand i d v i d t a i d t 15 x i d t 1 x i d t v i d t 1 2 2 3 benchmark algorithms the behavior of sunflowers in pursuing the sunlight along with the act of pollination is the main inspiration for the sfo algorithm this algorithm was introduced by gomes et al 48 this algorithm is simulated by the inverse square law radiation that indicates there is an inverse proportion between the magnitude of heat and the squared distance between the sun and the flower in other words the radiation is intensified once the sun gets farther in the sfo the flower best directed toward the sun is considered the most promising candidate and others try to update themselves accordingly 49 the dynamic foraging effort of slime mould forms the basis of the sma 50 li et al 51 developed this technique for finding the optimum response the slime mould seeks the best path leading to the most nutritious food block among several existing ones the position of the individuals is accordingly updated to improve the response once a suitable food source is discovered the slime mould wraps and grasps it some measures are also taken for evaluating the remaining sources in the last stage the algorithm is assessed in terms of computation complexity crows are intelligent birds that have a flock based life and are capable of thieving and hiding their food from others askarzadeh 52 used this behavior to develop a capable optimization method called csa in this algorithm it is assumed that the crows chase each other when they thieve food during this process two possibilities exist for updating the positions i e the solutions depending on if the first crow that is hiding the food finds out that is being chased by another one or not because crows are novices in the beginning they select an initial hiding place and try to adjust it by taking into consideration the suitability of possible places 53 eusuff and lansey 54 designed the sfla the strategies of the pso and memetic algorithms are used in the sfla 55 composed of several frogs the population is divided into several identical units called memeplexes the frogs are organized concerning their fitnesses they are completely distributed in the memeplexes the position of the individuals is updated for the betterment of the solutions in the lca which was proposed by kashan 56 several matches are implemented in a scheduled league the population of this algorithm is represented by participating teams that all of them match together once two teams compete the probability of winning is defined for each one according to their playing strength despite knowing the playing strengths the result of a game is not predictable 57 regarding some statistical rules e g equal probability of winning for both teams in each other s mind the winner is recognized the mathematical measures that are taken in the sfo 58 59 sma 60 61 csa 62 63 sfla 64 65 and lca 66 67 algorithms are well explained in the previous literature 2 2 4 model performance evaluation metrics since visual interpretation does not give a precise evaluation of the accuracy the assessment is done using four criteria that are well accepted for this task pearson correlation coefficient pcc is the first criterion that gives the agreement between the predicted and measured dos mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape are two criteria for pure and relative error measurement since the mae and mape use similar formulations root mean square error rmse is also used these criteria are calculated as follows 16 pcc j 1 z do j predicted do predicted do j measured do measured j 1 z do j predicted do predicted 2 i 1 z do j measured do measured 2 17 mae 1 z i 1 z do i measured do i predicted 18 mape 1 z j 1 z do j measured do j predicted do j measured 100 19 rmse 1 z j 1 z do j measured do j predicted 2 where each equation is applied to z values of the predicted and measured dos i e signified by dopredicted and domeasured 3 results and discussion to implement the training process a total of 1376 available records are used as explained this data belongs to the first four years of the considered period considering the neural structure of the models fig 4 each input factor tw ph cs and q occupies a neuron in the input layer and they are all connected with the hidden neurons whose number is determined to be seven after a trial and error practice tested values ranged from 1 to 10 they give their response to the output neuron for calculating the do in combination with such a network the bbo and aso are responsible for optimizing the interaction between the neurons in these three layers accordingly this algorithm has to optimally take care of 35 weights and 8 biases 3 1 optimal training using metaheuristic as a result of coupling the ann with the bbo and aso two hybrid tools called bbo ann and aso ann are created in population based algorithms it is important to hire the appropriate number of agents who seek the optimal response to this end nine different population sizes sps of 10 25 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 are tried to investigate the sensitivity to this factor and the best one is selected the same steps were executed for the five benchmark algorithms it was deduced that the bbo ann aso ann sfo ann sma ann csa ann sfla ann and lca ann perform the best with the sps of 50 500 200 300 500 25 and 500 respectively fig 5 shows the convergence curves obtained by the selected sps in each iteration an ann is constructed using the response found in that iteration it is then evaluated using the rmse as the objective function y axis the results of this process for one thousand times form a convergence curve fig 6 compares the predicted and measured dos in the training phase the corresponding error values are also calculated and denoted in the following according to these charts the do pattern has been well predicted by all models even on a small scale the fluctuations are correctly predicted the rmses calculated for the trained models were 0 5056 0 5020 0 5149 0 5081 0 5126 0 5299 and 0 5136 respectively moreover the maes of 0 3799 0 3760 0 3871 0 3840 0 3841 0 4073 and 0 3853 demonstrate an acceptable quality of training provided by all used algorithms from a relative point of view the obtained mapes of 4 0413 4 0073 4 0917 4 0759 4 0694 4 2999 and 4 1019 support the claim of accurate do analysis fig 7 shows the regression charts of the training performance of the used models as is known in these charts each point is distinguished by one x value which represents the measured do and one y value which represents the predicted do therefore an ideal prediction is obtained once the point is located on the y x line for the present results the dominant aggregation of the point around this line indicates a suitable accuracy for all models the calculated pccs i e rs in the charts were 0 97545 0 97580 0 97453 0 97520 0 97476 0 97466 and 0 97300 from all the above evaluations it can be derived that the bbo aso sfo sma csa sfla and lca are capable trainers for the ann more profoundly the relationship between the do and considered inputs is well mapped by these algorithms but further assessments are requested for evaluating their overall capability for this reason the next section is dedicated to the accurate measurement of the models in dealing with the data of the testing period 3 2 predictive model performance the testing dataset comprises 343 samples they represent available records from october 01 2018 to september 30 2019 the trained models predicted the daily do by taking the tw ph cs and q fig 8 compares the predicted and measured dos in the testing phase according to these charts the do pattern has been well predicted by all models even on a small scale the fluctuations are correctly predicted the rmses for these results were 0 2878 0 2998 0 3119 0 3215 0 3003 0 3090 and 0 3058 in comparison with training errors they represent a considerably lower level of error however it should be noted that according to table 1 the testing dos lie in a different range i e 6 3 14 5 mg l 1 vs 5 0 14 9 mg l 1 but still referring to the computed relative errors which are below 2 7 the testing performance of the models is more accurate in detail the mapes were 2 3848 2 5170 2 5993 2 6918 2 4603 2 6173 and 2 4791 also a reliable estimation can be professed for all used models based on the maes of 0 2227 0 2371 0 2450 0 2581 0 2309 0 2433 and 0 2309 similar to fig 7 the regression charts corresponding to the testing performances are shown in fig 9 as is seen the testing points are well positioned around the fit line and are in a better situation compared to the training ones besides the pccs of 0 99186 0 99135 0 99084 0 99059 0 99205 0 99131 and 0 99130 demonstrate a very good agreement between the real world observations and simulation products 3 3 efficiency comparison famously the goodness of the results of the training and testing procedures reveals the capability of the intended model in capturing and generalizing the do pattern regarding the assessments presented in two previous sections all seven anns supervised by the bbo aso sfo sma csa sfla and lca are competent in learning the do behavior using four year data and successfully approximating it for the fifth year this section is concerned with a comprehensive comparison between the efficiency of the used hybrids to introduce the most suitable one for do data processing table 2 addresses all accuracy criteria and their corresponding ranks scores are given such that the higher the accuracy the higher the score first in terms of accuracy comparing the training results points out the proposed models i e bbo ann and aso ann as the most powerful learners it is derived from the lowest error indicators mae rmse and mape as well as the largest pcc obtained for these models due to the same reasons the csa ann came up as the third accurate hybrid followed by the lca ann sma ann sfo ann and sfla ann also among the two outstanding models the bbo ann outperformed the aso ann as for the optimization time it was earlier shown in fig 5 that the largest and smallest computation times were 42 259 9 and 186 6 s recorded for the lca and sfla respectively the bbo was the second quickest algorithm with 564 9 s considering both accuracy and time it can be said that the bbo is the most efficient algorithm of this study 3 4 importance assessment in this work the do was considered as a function of four input factors i e tw ph cs and q although the contribution of all these factors has been validated in previous studies an importance assessment based on the random forest technique 68 is carried out to address the relative importance of the input parameters in the do estimation for this purpose a bagged ensemble of 200 regression trees is trained using the existing dataset 69 the results are shown in fig 10 the importance values obtained for tw ph cs and q are 18 91 4 92 3 93 and 3 60 respectively it points out that the water temperature is the most critical factor for the do 3 5 comparison with previous literature in this section the accuracy of the suggested models is compared to some hybrid models that were used in the previous studies adnan et al 70 optimized a machine learning model called support vector machine svm by firefly algorithm ffa pso and combined ffapso in research by dehghani torabi poudeh and izadi 43 support vector regression svr was optimized by chicken swarm optimization cso social ski driver ssd optimization black widow optimization bwo and the algorithm of the innovative gunner aig likewise yang et al 71 optimized an mlp model using multi verse optimizer mvo black hole algorithm bha and shuffled complex evolution sce table 3 presents the comparison between the testing rmse mae and correlation indices pcc and r2 that are commonly used in the present study and the cited works from this table it can be derived that the bbo ann and aso ann models have predicted the do with a consifrably higher accuracy 3 6 further discussion as a limitation of the present work the used data was bounded up to the 2019 time series for further verifications and data enrichment it is suggested to apply the considered models to the most recent records in addition there could have been more input factors for predicting do hereupon an idea that can be regarded for future works is to gather all viable influential parameters and then conduct an importance assessment as per fig 10 to select the inputs which have the greatest contribution the reduction in the number of inputs has two merits first the prediction accuracy can improve due to discarding less influential parameters besides the computational cost is reduced because a lower number of inputs are analyzed apart from the data aspect another viable suggestion for following this study is to conduct comparative efforts to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed models versus conventional versions of the ann such as those trained by levenberg marquardt stochastic gradient descent etc most recent metaheuristic algorithms can also be regarded for this comparative purpose and updating the solutions another appreciable aspect is that despite having reliable accuracy assessment this research lacks uncertainty quantification of the ai based prediction 72 73 as is known uncertainty quantification adds to the validity of results and it is suggested for future works 3 7 proposed do predictive formula the bbo optimized neural interaction that led to the most efficient estimation of the do is numerically presented in this section based on fig 4 eq 20 expresses the do

coding in programming environments besides this formula is the outcome of a complicated optimization process and therefore utilizing it provides a time efficient solution however there are some limitations too first this formula uses only tw ph cs and q as the inputs therefore there could be some other inputs that considering which would increase the applicability of the calculation second out of the matlab programming language proper use of this formula needs normalization of inputs and denormalization of outputs to be in the real range 74 4 conclusion the main focus of this study was on approximating the daily dissolved oxygen from the flowing water condition due to the complexity of the issue sophisticated hybrid models have been preferred over regular approaches hence two novel neuro metaheuristic techniques were proposed as a combination of biogeography based optimization and atom search optimization with an artificial neural network utilizing a valid dataset provided by usgs the models were successfully trained and tested first high training accuracy pcc above 97 revealed that the bbo and aso are capable of analyzing the do properly within a neural framework regarding the pccs above 99 in the testing phase these models could authoritatively predict the daily do for the future the bbo and aso outperformed five benchmark optimizers considering both accuracy and time efficiency the bbo ann was introduced as the most efficient processor for the given problem by comparison with previous literature it was found that the proposed models could noticeably improve the do prediction however this study encountered some limitations too that may give potential ideas for future projects for instance it is recommended to update the solutions using more recent datasets and other regions also performing uncertainty quantification as well as evaluating the models against similar hybrid models and standalone anns could be of interest declaration of competing

12416,measuring water quality parameters is a significant step in many hydrological assessments dissolved oxygen do is one of these parameters that is an indicator of water quality hence this study offers two novel intelligent models i e the integration of biogeography based optimization bbo and atom search optimization aso with artificial neural network ann to predict the daily do these methods are comparatively assessed and validated against several benchmark techniques five year 2014 2019 water quality data of a usgs station called rock creek station number 01648010 is used for implementing the proposed model in this sense the models first learn the do behavior using 80 of the data and they then predict the do for the fifth year as per the performed sensitivity analysis the water temperature was selected as the most effective parameter in the do prediction trying different population sizes determined an optimal configuration of the employed models and assessing the accuracy of the results revealed that the proposed models can nicely perceive the do pattern with around 4 mean absolute percentage error mape and 97 5 correlation in the testing phase the bbo ann and aso ann models predicted the do of the fifth year with mapes 2 3848 and 2 5170 and correlations of 0 99186 and 0 99135 respectively moreover the suggested bbo ann and aso ann outperformed some similar hybrids from the existing literature lastly an explicit formula is derived from the bbo ann for convenient prediction of the do graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water quality assessment dissolved oxygen biogeography based optimization artificial neural network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as is known water quality wq is a complex function of different environmental and anthropogenic factors within any catchment 1 3 proper wq management is a very significant task for engineers and decision makers dissolved oxygen do is a crucial wq parameter for investigating the health of water and aquatic life 4 while earlier efforts have mostly focused on direct measurement methods i e in situ measurements recent studies have shown that indirect techniques like artificial intelligence ai can provide cheaper and computationally robust alternatives for predicting environmental parameters wq included 5 8 so far various intelligent models e g k mean and gaussian mixture models 9 and time series data mining 10 11 have been promisingly employed in this way machine learning and particularly artificial neural network ann has attracted the attention of many environmental experts as an authoritative predictor 12 15 zhang et al 16 suggested using a combination of kernel principal component analysis kpca and recurrent ann to predict the hourly do trend the role of the kpca lies in reconstructing the water quality factors as well as removing noise from data it was shown that the model gives reliable predictions for the upcoming 1 and 2 h 90 8 and 82 3 accuracy respectively another improvement of the recurrent ann was carried out by li et al 17 who used dempster shafer evidence theory for this purpose they validated the proposed model by predictors including the svr and typical ann cao et al 18 developed a do predictive model based on gated recurrent unit ann and k means clustering this model attained a reliable analysis with a 3 5 relative error of the do content in aquaculture water and was more flexible than conventional tools keshtegar and heddam 19 used a multi layer perceptron mlp for do modeling the tested model could do the prediction with a coefficient of determination r2 0 72 in most cases however a modified response surface method outperformed the mlp heddam 20 investigated and professed the capability of evolving fuzzy neural networks for the same simulation compared to some benchmarks this model was superior more studies concerning the applicability of anns can be found in 21 24 besides various types of ann other intelligent models have been used for wq simulation 25 26 yaseen et al 27 could successfully apply an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with three strategies of grid partition gp fuzzy c means clustering fcm and subtractive clustering sc to predict wq indices of selangor river malaysia in similar research this model was used by han et al 28 as a controlling tool for the do concentration they lastly concluded that it can efficiently handle this task mehdipour et al 29 reported a suitable performance for gene expression programming used for do modeling at eymir lake turkey in the most accurate prediction the root mean square error rmse and r2 were 0 0937 and 0 8031 respectively which show a high accuracy rate for the proposed model huan et al 30 combined least squares svm lssvm and ensemble empirical mode decomposition for do estimation by using different search strategies many intricate problems have been promisingly modeled 31 for instance asadi nalivan et al 32 combined ann with water cycle algorithm wca electrostatic discharge algorithms esda equilibrium optimization eo and political optimizer po to spatially analyze groundwater potential in urmia iran fadaee et al 33 created a powerful anfis by letting it be trained by particle swarm optimization pso and butterfly optimization algorithm boa according to their results these two algorithms can significantly improve the quality of do prediction from a seasonal point of view 6 25 15 94 yaseen et al 34 employed an integration of lssvm and bat algorithm for approximating the do they found that the proposed predictor is better than the multivariate adaptive regression spline mars and m5 tree as it achieved 20 and 42 larger accuracy respectively ruan et al 35 evolved a fuzzy wavelet ann using a genetic algorithm ga for do management toward proper wastewater treatment they finally achieved a robust and efficient control system that optimizes the cost bayram et al 36 could present a reliable analysis of stream do use teaching learning based optimization tlbo a formula was also derived from the tlbo based model the reviewed literature highlights the tendency of machine learning studies to incorporate metaheuristic algorithms in their development 37 38 on the other hand many studies have sufficiently used traditional algorithms such as pso and ga 39 40 therefore a significant task to bridge the gap between recent algorithms and intended applications is introducing novel methods to keep the solution updated with the most recent developments hereupon in the present study two novel metaheuristic techniques namely biogeography based optimization bbo 41 and atom search optimization aso 42 are used for the first time for approximating the do concentration by optimizing an ann model the bbo and aso explore the dependency of the do on water influencing parameters these algorithms are newly developed strategies that imitate natural phenomena i e bbo the migration method of species and aso molecular dynamics method in the interaction between atoms furthermore several benchmark algorithms namely sunflower optimization sfo slime mould algorithm sma crow search algorithm csa shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla and league championship algorithm lca are hired to comparatively validate the performance of the bbo and aso the pivotal contribution of this study to the related body of knowledge i e water quality analysis using ai methods can be stated as introducing and evaluating seven new methodologies and determining the most potential solutions besides the solution is projected to be transformed into a simple mathematical format to be more conveniently usable this study also performs an important analysis to show which water conditions have higher effects on the do concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 data and studied station the concentration of do is influenced by several environmental factors similar to other wq parameters to be predicted e g suspended sediment dissolved nitrogen etc when it comes to intelligent techniques this influence is taken into consideration by determining one or more input factor s more clearly the network tries to establish specific measures to bridge the inputs and output in the neural networks used in this work the inputs of the do are water temperature tw hydrogen potential ph specific conductance cs and discharge q the data are taken from the daily records of a usgs station namely rock creek station number 01648010 freely available at https waterdata usgs gov nwis fig 1 illustrates the exact location of this station fig 2 a d shows the correlation between the do with the tw ph cs and q as is seen the most meaningful r2 is 0 932 obtained for the adverse proportion between the do and tw moreover fig 2 e says that the do goes through a repetitive pattern each year in this relation the do peaks around january february and experiences its lowest values nearly in july august moreover table 1 describes the input and output factors from a statistical point of view over the whole five year period the tw ph cs q and do range from 0 2 and 28 2 c 6 9 and 8 8 115 0 and 6390 0 μs cm 1 0 1 and 40 2 m 3 s 1 and 5 0 and 14 9 mg l 1 respectively also the average do for both datasets is 9 9 mg l 1 an intelligent network also needs sufficient samples to attain a reliable analysis of the do hence the anns use four year records of the water years 2015 to 2018 to explore the do behavior the details of this process which is called the training phase are presented in the following sections the do of the fifth year the water year 2019 is next predicted without any prior knowledge about it this process is called the testing phase two steps were taken for data preprocessing first the records of q which were in ft3 s 1 are converted to m3 s 1 next we checked for missing data and some daily records were eliminated accordingly in the end 1376 and 343 samples are retained in the training and testing datasets respectively note that no further correction e g removal of outliers was applied to the data because the main idea of the article is to investigate the potential of the proposed machine learning in the original circumstances 2 2 methodology fig 3 shows the general steps fulfilled for achieving the objective of the study three major phases are data provision implementation of the models and accuracy assessment as it was explained earlier this study aims at bridging the gap between recent ai developments and intelligent do prediction the main innovations can be addressed as follows a by using several metaheuristic algorithms novel versions of the ann are developed and compared in terms of accuracy and time to determine the most efficient model for do prediction it is an important task because most previous efforts have focused on traditional metaheuristic algorithms such as pso b the used dataset is more comprehensive than some previous studies that used a few influential factors for the do prediction e g dehghani et al 43 solely considered tw and q c the final solution is translated into a non linear mathematical formula for a more convenient prediction d the outstanding models are compared against some of the similar hybrid models in the literature to highlight the improvements of this study in the following the used algorithms are described 2 2 1 biogeography based optimization simon 41 designed the bbo as an efficient metaheuristic algorithm in this algorithm the migration method of species from one island to another one the appearance of new species and the elimination of the existing species are simulated to attain an optimal solution to the given problem the word island indicates a geographically isolated habitat its suitability for having different populations is determined by the habitat suitability index hsi this parameter is usually influenced by various phenomena like rainfall temperature topographic diversity etc these factors are denoted as suitability index variables sivs 44 in the bbo habitats with large hsis represent good solutions and aim to contain a large number of individuals they are also distinguished by a low migration rate and high emigration rate therefore there is a higher probability that promising solutions i e with large hsis share the sivs with lower quality solutions accordingly low quality solutions i e with small hsis are more likely to receive sivs eqs 1 and 2 calculate the emigration rate μ and immigration rate λ 1 μ i e k n 2 λ i i 1 k n where e and i symbolize the maximum μ values of λ respectively also n stands for the largest number of species supported by the habitat and k denotes the number of species belonging to the i th individual accordingly once k n then λ i i and μ i e meaning that the intended habitat can handle the emigration of further species to a weaker one 45 2 2 2 atom search optimization zhao wang and zhang 42 introduced the aso algorithm based on the atomic motion in a so called method of molecular dynamics md based on newton s second law in eq 3 the atom i with the mass mi is affected by constraint gi and interaction fi forces 46 3 a i f i g i m i regarding lennard jones l j potential formula the below equations give the interaction force between an atom couple from j applied to i in d dimensional space and for the iteration t 4 f ij d t 24 ε t σ t 2 σ t r ij t 13 σ t r ij t 7 r ij t r ij d t 5 f ij t 24 ε t σ t 2 σ t r ij t 13 σ t r ij t 7 where σ signifies the collision diameter and ε stands for the potential well depth also given r i as the ith individual s position r ij r i r j gives the distance between the individuals according to the l j the closer the atoms are the higher the likelihood of interaction is and vice versa at the beginning of the aso repulsion can increase the exploration potential by prohibiting large atom concentrations as the algorithm goes on a more positive attraction is obtained and consequently the exploitation is improved hence assuming η t as the depth function for tuning the repulsion or attraction region eq 6 can be rewritten as 6 f ij t η t 2 h ij t 13 h ij t 7 where h determines the repulsion attraction threshold h ij is calculated by the below equation 7 h ij h min r ij t σ t h min r ij t σ t h max r ij t σ t h min h max r ij t σ t h max 8 σ t x ij t j s best x ij t s t 2 in which s best represents a group of atoms that contains the first s individuals that give the lowest cost function and x addresses the atoms positions the whole forces influencing the ith atom from the side of other ones in dimension d f i d are expressed as follows 9 f i d t j s best rand j f ij d t where rand j is a random value in 0 1 concerning newton s third law 10 f ij f ji by using a constraint measure as presented in eq 11 the best atom exercises control over each individual 11 θ i t x i t x best t 2 b i best 2 in the above relationship θ i is the constraint of atom i x best stands for the position of the elite atom and b i best symbolizes the bond length linking the elite and ith atoms in the aso having m as a function of fitness value the mass of atom i is calculated as follows 12 m i t m i t j 1 n m j t 13 m i t e f i t f best t f w t f best t where f i t gives the fitness of the ith individual f w t and f best t are the lowest and highest fitness values respectively given a the depth weight the optimization is fulfilled by regularly updating the velocity v i d and the position x i d of the atoms based on the below equations 47 14 v i d t 1 rand i d v i d t a i d t 15 x i d t 1 x i d t v i d t 1 2 2 3 benchmark algorithms the behavior of sunflowers in pursuing the sunlight along with the act of pollination is the main inspiration for the sfo algorithm this algorithm was introduced by gomes et al 48 this algorithm is simulated by the inverse square law radiation that indicates there is an inverse proportion between the magnitude of heat and the squared distance between the sun and the flower in other words the radiation is intensified once the sun gets farther in the sfo the flower best directed toward the sun is considered the most promising candidate and others try to update themselves accordingly 49 the dynamic foraging effort of slime mould forms the basis of the sma 50 li et al 51 developed this technique for finding the optimum response the slime mould seeks the best path leading to the most nutritious food block among several existing ones the position of the individuals is accordingly updated to improve the response once a suitable food source is discovered the slime mould wraps and grasps it some measures are also taken for evaluating the remaining sources in the last stage the algorithm is assessed in terms of computation complexity crows are intelligent birds that have a flock based life and are capable of thieving and hiding their food from others askarzadeh 52 used this behavior to develop a capable optimization method called csa in this algorithm it is assumed that the crows chase each other when they thieve food during this process two possibilities exist for updating the positions i e the solutions depending on if the first crow that is hiding the food finds out that is being chased by another one or not because crows are novices in the beginning they select an initial hiding place and try to adjust it by taking into consideration the suitability of possible places 53 eusuff and lansey 54 designed the sfla the strategies of the pso and memetic algorithms are used in the sfla 55 composed of several frogs the population is divided into several identical units called memeplexes the frogs are organized concerning their fitnesses they are completely distributed in the memeplexes the position of the individuals is updated for the betterment of the solutions in the lca which was proposed by kashan 56 several matches are implemented in a scheduled league the population of this algorithm is represented by participating teams that all of them match together once two teams compete the probability of winning is defined for each one according to their playing strength despite knowing the playing strengths the result of a game is not predictable 57 regarding some statistical rules e g equal probability of winning for both teams in each other s mind the winner is recognized the mathematical measures that are taken in the sfo 58 59 sma 60 61 csa 62 63 sfla 64 65 and lca 66 67 algorithms are well explained in the previous literature 2 2 4 model performance evaluation metrics since visual interpretation does not give a precise evaluation of the accuracy the assessment is done using four criteria that are well accepted for this task pearson correlation coefficient pcc is the first criterion that gives the agreement between the predicted and measured dos mean absolute error mae and mean absolute percentage error mape are two criteria for pure and relative error measurement since the mae and mape use similar formulations root mean square error rmse is also used these criteria are calculated as follows 16 pcc j 1 z do j predicted do predicted do j measured do measured j 1 z do j predicted do predicted 2 i 1 z do j measured do measured 2 17 mae 1 z i 1 z do i measured do i predicted 18 mape 1 z j 1 z do j measured do j predicted do j measured 100 19 rmse 1 z j 1 z do j measured do j predicted 2 where each equation is applied to z values of the predicted and measured dos i e signified by dopredicted and domeasured 3 results and discussion to implement the training process a total of 1376 available records are used as explained this data belongs to the first four years of the considered period considering the neural structure of the models fig 4 each input factor tw ph cs and q occupies a neuron in the input layer and they are all connected with the hidden neurons whose number is determined to be seven after a trial and error practice tested values ranged from 1 to 10 they give their response to the output neuron for calculating the do in combination with such a network the bbo and aso are responsible for optimizing the interaction between the neurons in these three layers accordingly this algorithm has to optimally take care of 35 weights and 8 biases 3 1 optimal training using metaheuristic as a result of coupling the ann with the bbo and aso two hybrid tools called bbo ann and aso ann are created in population based algorithms it is important to hire the appropriate number of agents who seek the optimal response to this end nine different population sizes sps of 10 25 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 are tried to investigate the sensitivity to this factor and the best one is selected the same steps were executed for the five benchmark algorithms it was deduced that the bbo ann aso ann sfo ann sma ann csa ann sfla ann and lca ann perform the best with the sps of 50 500 200 300 500 25 and 500 respectively fig 5 shows the convergence curves obtained by the selected sps in each iteration an ann is constructed using the response found in that iteration it is then evaluated using the rmse as the objective function y axis the results of this process for one thousand times form a convergence curve fig 6 compares the predicted and measured dos in the training phase the corresponding error values are also calculated and denoted in the following according to these charts the do pattern has been well predicted by all models even on a small scale the fluctuations are correctly predicted the rmses calculated for the trained models were 0 5056 0 5020 0 5149 0 5081 0 5126 0 5299 and 0 5136 respectively moreover the maes of 0 3799 0 3760 0 3871 0 3840 0 3841 0 4073 and 0 3853 demonstrate an acceptable quality of training provided by all used algorithms from a relative point of view the obtained mapes of 4 0413 4 0073 4 0917 4 0759 4 0694 4 2999 and 4 1019 support the claim of accurate do analysis fig 7 shows the regression charts of the training performance of the used models as is known in these charts each point is distinguished by one x value which represents the measured do and one y value which represents the predicted do therefore an ideal prediction is obtained once the point is located on the y x line for the present results the dominant aggregation of the point around this line indicates a suitable accuracy for all models the calculated pccs i e rs in the charts were 0 97545 0 97580 0 97453 0 97520 0 97476 0 97466 and 0 97300 from all the above evaluations it can be derived that the bbo aso sfo sma csa sfla and lca are capable trainers for the ann more profoundly the relationship between the do and considered inputs is well mapped by these algorithms but further assessments are requested for evaluating their overall capability for this reason the next section is dedicated to the accurate measurement of the models in dealing with the data of the testing period 3 2 predictive model performance the testing dataset comprises 343 samples they represent available records from october 01 2018 to september 30 2019 the trained models predicted the daily do by taking the tw ph cs and q fig 8 compares the predicted and measured dos in the testing phase according to these charts the do pattern has been well predicted by all models even on a small scale the fluctuations are correctly predicted the rmses for these results were 0 2878 0 2998 0 3119 0 3215 0 3003 0 3090 and 0 3058 in comparison with training errors they represent a considerably lower level of error however it should be noted that according to table 1 the testing dos lie in a different range i e 6 3 14 5 mg l 1 vs 5 0 14 9 mg l 1 but still referring to the computed relative errors which are below 2 7 the testing performance of the models is more accurate in detail the mapes were 2 3848 2 5170 2 5993 2 6918 2 4603 2 6173 and 2 4791 also a reliable estimation can be professed for all used models based on the maes of 0 2227 0 2371 0 2450 0 2581 0 2309 0 2433 and 0 2309 similar to fig 7 the regression charts corresponding to the testing performances are shown in fig 9 as is seen the testing points are well positioned around the fit line and are in a better situation compared to the training ones besides the pccs of 0 99186 0 99135 0 99084 0 99059 0 99205 0 99131 and 0 99130 demonstrate a very good agreement between the real world observations and simulation products 3 3 efficiency comparison famously the goodness of the results of the training and testing procedures reveals the capability of the intended model in capturing and generalizing the do pattern regarding the assessments presented in two previous sections all seven anns supervised by the bbo aso sfo sma csa sfla and lca are competent in learning the do behavior using four year data and successfully approximating it for the fifth year this section is concerned with a comprehensive comparison between the efficiency of the used hybrids to introduce the most suitable one for do data processing table 2 addresses all accuracy criteria and their corresponding ranks scores are given such that the higher the accuracy the higher the score first in terms of accuracy comparing the training results points out the proposed models i e bbo ann and aso ann as the most powerful learners it is derived from the lowest error indicators mae rmse and mape as well as the largest pcc obtained for these models due to the same reasons the csa ann came up as the third accurate hybrid followed by the lca ann sma ann sfo ann and sfla ann also among the two outstanding models the bbo ann outperformed the aso ann as for the optimization time it was earlier shown in fig 5 that the largest and smallest computation times were 42 259 9 and 186 6 s recorded for the lca and sfla respectively the bbo was the second quickest algorithm with 564 9 s considering both accuracy and time it can be said that the bbo is the most efficient algorithm of this study 3 4 importance assessment in this work the do was considered as a function of four input factors i e tw ph cs and q although the contribution of all these factors has been validated in previous studies an importance assessment based on the random forest technique 68 is carried out to address the relative importance of the input parameters in the do estimation for this purpose a bagged ensemble of 200 regression trees is trained using the existing dataset 69 the results are shown in fig 10 the importance values obtained for tw ph cs and q are 18 91 4 92 3 93 and 3 60 respectively it points out that the water temperature is the most critical factor for the do 3 5 comparison with previous literature in this section the accuracy of the suggested models is compared to some hybrid models that were used in the previous studies adnan et al 70 optimized a machine learning model called support vector machine svm by firefly algorithm ffa pso and combined ffapso in research by dehghani torabi poudeh and izadi 43 support vector regression svr was optimized by chicken swarm optimization cso social ski driver ssd optimization black widow optimization bwo and the algorithm of the innovative gunner aig likewise yang et al 71 optimized an mlp model using multi verse optimizer mvo black hole algorithm bha and shuffled complex evolution sce table 3 presents the comparison between the testing rmse mae and correlation indices pcc and r2 that are commonly used in the present study and the cited works from this table it can be derived that the bbo ann and aso ann models have predicted the do with a consifrably higher accuracy 3 6 further discussion as a limitation of the present work the used data was bounded up to the 2019 time series for further verifications and data enrichment it is suggested to apply the considered models to the most recent records in addition there could have been more input factors for predicting do hereupon an idea that can be regarded for future works is to gather all viable influential parameters and then conduct an importance assessment as per fig 10 to select the inputs which have the greatest contribution the reduction in the number of inputs has two merits first the prediction accuracy can improve due to discarding less influential parameters besides the computational cost is reduced because a lower number of inputs are analyzed apart from the data aspect another viable suggestion for following this study is to conduct comparative efforts to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed models versus conventional versions of the ann such as those trained by levenberg marquardt stochastic gradient descent etc most recent metaheuristic algorithms can also be regarded for this comparative purpose and updating the solutions another appreciable aspect is that despite having reliable accuracy assessment this research lacks uncertainty quantification of the ai based prediction 72 73 as is known uncertainty quantification adds to the validity of results and it is suggested for future works 3 7 proposed do predictive formula the bbo optimized neural interaction that led to the most efficient estimation of the do is numerically presented in this section based on fig 4 eq 20 expresses the do predictive formula 20 do 0 6892 g 0 5535 t 1 3470 ph 1 1258 sc 1 3406 q 2 2772 0 5111 g 1 9348 t 0 4870 ph 0 0127 sc 1 0977 q 1 5181 0 1345 g 1 9260 t 0 9952 ph 0 0308 sc 0 6964 q 0 7591 0 9755 g 1

2772 0 4408 where g x is the activation function expressed as follows 21 g x 2 1 e 2 x 1 a significant advantage of this formula is eliminating the need for computer based implementations such as coding in programming environments besides this formula is the outcome of a complicated optimization process and therefore utilizing it provides a time efficient solution however there are some limitations too first this formula uses only tw ph cs and q as the inputs therefore there could be some other inputs that considering which would increase the applicability of the calculation second out of the matlab programming language proper use of this formula needs normalization of inputs and denormalization of outputs to be in the real range 74 4 conclusion the main focus of this study was on approximating the daily dissolved oxygen from the flowing water condition due to the complexity of the issue sophisticated hybrid models have been preferred over regular approaches hence two novel neuro metaheuristic techniques were proposed as a combination of biogeography based optimization and atom search optimization with an artificial neural network utilizing a valid dataset provided by usgs the models were successfully trained and tested first high training accuracy pcc above 97 revealed that the bbo and aso are capable of analyzing the do properly within a neural framework regarding the pccs above 99 in the testing phase these models could authoritatively predict the daily do for the future the bbo and aso outperformed five benchmark optimizers considering both accuracy and time efficiency the bbo ann was introduced as the most efficient processor for the given problem by comparison with previous literature it was found that the proposed models could noticeably

12417,in this study we addressed the removal of hexavalent chromium cr vi a highly toxic and soluble anionic heavy metal using enhanced ultrafiltration uf the objective was to eliminate cr vi species with molecular weights beyond the retention capability of standard uf membranes and achieve their retention through the incorporation of polymers and polymer surfactant complexes within the uf membrane chitosan a cationic polymer and sodium lauryl sulfate sds an anionic surfactant were used in this context the cr vi solution was subjected to ultrafiltration in a laboratory scale membrane cell and its removal was assessed spectrophotometrically polymer and surfactant structures were characterized using turbidity electrical conductivity sem edx and ftir analyses experimental studies were conducted using the face centered central composite design ccd of the response surface methodology rsm to determine optimal removal and permeate flux values as well as to unveil the relationships between the studied factors and the resulting responses the results revealed that 100 of the cr vi species were removed from wastewater in the chitosan based polymer enhanced ultrafiltration peuf study with the chitosan sds complex a removal efficiency of 98 33 was achieved in synthetic wastewater the peuf study employing chitosan and the chitosan sds complex yielded permeate flux values of 30 73 l h m2 and 53 89 l h m2 respectively the optimized conditions obtained from the models were then applied to real wastewater obtained from a leather industry tanning process in the case of chitosan and the chitosan sds complex the cr vi removal efficiencies in the real wastewater were 4 40 and 98 33 respectively keywords hexavalent chromium leather polymer surfactant ultrafiltration data availability all data are produced by us and are clearly given in the manuscript 1 introduction one of the main challenges of today is the elimination of waste resulting from industrial activities the most significant impact of this waste is the contamination of water which is a vital part of the life cycle rendering it unusable heavy metals hold a crucial place among the many pollutants found in water although heavy metals are typically found in trace amounts they can cause severe health issues for living organisms the entry of heavy metals into the living metabolism can occur through drinking water contamination airborne intake in areas near emission sources or through food consumption thus these toxic non biodegradable and persistent heavy metals of industrial origin must be removed or recovered before release into the natural environment traditional methods used for heavy metal removal include chemical precipitation 1 adsorption 2 5 electrochemical treatment techniques 6 8 and ion exchangers 9 however these relatively more economical methods have many shortcomings such as the need for additional treatment of the large amount of sludge that occurs high energy requirements and insufficient removal in some cases pressure operated membrane filtration systems have been known to be effective in heavy metal removal for years however heavy metal removal is only possible with nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes 10 11 nevertheless these membranes have high operating pressures and are easily fouled and clogged production and operating costs are also high additionally they are limited in the recovery of heavy metals that may be valuable 12 14 ultrafiltration uf membranes which have much more permeability than nf and ro membranes have been used by modifying the process two of these modifications are polymer enhanced ultrafiltration peuf and micelle enhanced ultrafiltration meuf unlike conventional uf both methods can retain lower molecular weight components such as heavy metals and dissolved organic compounds water soluble and molecular polymers are used in peuf and these polymers interact with small sized soluble species increasing their total molecular weight to a size that cannot pass through uf membranes this study will investigate the removal of hexavalent chromium compounds with modified ultrafiltration systems the cr vi source is the chrome tanning process of the leather industry although cr iii salts are used in chrome tanning cr iii can be naturally and specifically oxidized to cr vi the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi occurs when oxygen forms reactive and unstable hydrogen peroxide molecules by forming double bonds with auxiliary substances used in post tanning processes these radicals interact with other double bonds triggering a free radical formation reaction the resulting free radicals oxidize cr iii to cr vi the reaction is catalyzed by heat and uv radiation unsaturated organic compounds oils wetting aids and other oxidizing agents can also cause oxidation of cr iii the ph value applied in the neutralization stage significantly affects the formation of cr vi 15 17 hauber 18 reports that no completely safe method exists in which hexavalent chromium is not formed therefore many countries have established cr vi limits for leather production ranging from 0 5 to 50 mg l 19 21 besides all of these cr iii species are poorly soluble and less mobile in nature it is an essential trace element in the metabolism of living things including glucose lipid and amino acid metabolism however cr vi is hundreds of times more toxic water soluble and has high mobility cr vi has the same tetrahedral geometry as sulfates and can easily cross cell membranes upon contact with the skin it causes ulcers wounds and eczema while ingestion causes gastrointestinal disorders and destruction of red blood cells therefore it is a much more significant environmental problem than cr iii 22 24 cr vi can be found in different forms in natural or effluent waters in the ph range of 6 14 cr vi is usually in the form of the dissolved chromate cro4 2 anion above ph 8 there is only cro4 2 when the ph drops slightly below 5 it is found in the form of hydrogen chromate hcro4 and dichromate cro7 2 cro7 2 is the dimer of hcro4 and exists when the concentration rises above 1 g l when ph goes below 2 h2cro4 is the dominant species the ph dependent variation of certain cr vi species in the aquatic environment is given in fig 1 16 the concept of polymer enhanced ultrafiltration peuf involves the use of water soluble polymers with relatively large molecular weights that interact with dissolved small molecules thus retaining them in the uf membrane the primary application of this concept was for the separation of metal ions from aqueous solutions using polychaetas and uf membranes although there are many names for this process such as liquid phase polymer assisted separation polyelectrolyte enhanced ultrafiltration and polymer assisted ultrafiltration they all have the same basic separation mechanism 12 13 in most cases there are two main interactions between polymers and metal ions electrostatic forces and coordination bonds other effects such as hydrogen bonds van der waals forces and entrapment during aggregation or encapsulation by the polymer can also occur the coordination bonds are similar to the interaction of metal ions with ligands in aqueous solutions in the formation of the complex vacant orbital metal ions function as electron acceptors and free electron pair ligands act as electron donors forming a coordination covalent bond in polymer metal coordination macromolecular ligands are usually multidentate or have more than one metal ion attached to a single macromolecule however the mechanism is much more complex as different functional groups on the polymer can interact differently 13 25 in the first part of this study chitosan was used as the polymer chitosan is a cationic amino polysaccharide copolymer with various potential applications in multiple industries it is obtained by deacetylation of chitin which is extracted from the exoskeleton of crustaceans and the cell walls of fungi and yeasts it has been reported in the literature that chitosan has a high potential for use in the sorption of heavy metals particularly due to the presence of amino groups 26 27 chitosan is soluble in most diluted mineral acids and when amino groups are protonated they form linear cationic chains 27 28 chitosan has two different types of reactive groups namely the deacetylated c 2 amine group and the hydroxyl groups on the acetylated or deacetylated c 3 and c 6 carbons fig 2 the reaction occurs on amine groups in an acidic environment where amine groups serve as adsorption sites for metals such as cd ii as iii and cr vi 29 31 amine groups can bind cr vi species through electrostatic hydrogen bond or reduction chelation interactions at low ph levels the protonated amine groups are in the form of nh3 or nh2 groups through strong electrostatic attraction negatively charged cr vi anions bind to positively charged amine groups the adsorption of negatively charged cr vi compounds to protonated amine groups also results in the reduction of cr vi to cr iii due to high redox potentials in this case both amine groups and hydroxyl groups are effective 5 in recent years polymer surfactant complexes have started to be applied in addition to peuf and meuf applications in this process it is possible to use membranes with much larger pore sizes because the size of the molecules formed is larger moreover the concentration required for the formation of aggregates is greatly reduced resulting in a decrease in operating costs and an increase in removal efficiency and operating stability in this process oppositely charged polymers and surfactants are used and they are typically held together by electrostatic interactions different interactions take place at concentrations below the critical micelle concentration cmc depending on the strength of the interaction between the oppositely charged surfactants and polymers the process proceeds as follows at low surfactant concentration surfactant molecules are dissolved as monomers and the surface tension decreases with increasing concentration at moderate surfactant concentrations surfactants begin to accumulate locally around the polymers and the first micelle like aggregations begin to bind to the polymer chains the surfactant concentration at which polymer assisted micellization begins is called the critical aggregation concentration cac surfactant added after the cac point affects the surface tension less and allows the formation of supramolecular complexes at this point it should be noted that there is a break in the conductivity and surface tension slope and turbidity starts to increase due to the presence of hydrophobic regions measuring the electrical conductivity of solutions containing polymer and surfactant is a frequently used method to investigate the interaction between them 32 35 in the second part of this study the removal of cr vi will be studied using the complex formed by chitosan a polymer and sds an anionic surfactant chitosan has a high self aggregation tendency due to the hydrophobicity of the polymer backbone and it also has a low surface area since it has a non porous structure these properties can be eliminated by modification with sds sds molecules form water insoluble complexes by making electrostatic bonds with positively charged chitosan chains thus by increasing the hydrophobicity aggregation properties lengths and ionic strength of the chitosan are increased 28 31 33 36 38 2 material and methods 2 1 materials chitosan was purchased from bldpharm china its molecular formula is c6h11no4 n acetic acid 100 purity was obtained from riedel de haen germany to prepare chitosan a 0 1 m acetic acid solution was prepared and chitosan was dissolved in this solution sds sodium dodecyl sulfate powder was supplied from cdh india and its molecular formula is ch3 ch2 11oso3na sds was prepared at a concentration of 50 mm by dissolving it in distilled water a cr vi solution was prepared with pure potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in solid state a total of 1 2393 g of k2cr2o7 was dissolved in distilled water and made up to 1 l the cr vi concentration of the stock solution was 438 084 mg l hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from merck germany and were used for ph adjustment the membrane used is a pes membrane commercially named microdyn nadir up005 which has a mwco of 5 kda 2 2 analytical methods cr vi measurements were carried out according to the methods described in apha 3500 cr d and din 38405 24 briefly the principle of the method is based on the reaction of cr vi ions with diphenyl carbazide resulting in the formation of a violet complex with cr iii in the presence of diphenyl carbazone the merck spectropuant pharo 300 uv vis spectrophotometer was used for cr vi measurements ph measurements were conducted using an adwa ph ms ec tds meter electrical conductivity measurements were taken with the deltaohm hd 2106 2 conductivity meter turbidity measurements were obtained using the wtw turb 355 turbidity meter following the din en 7027 standard the critical aggregation concentration cac was determined by observing the trend of change in conductivity and turbidity values after adding sds to the solution containing 278 mg l chitosan at a concentration range of 0 625 20 mm all measurements were performed at a temperature of 25 c ftir analyses were carried out using the bruker optics tensor ii ftir routine spectrometer the ftir spectra of the samples were determined with 16 scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 in the band range of 4000 400 cm 1 and the graphs were drawn using the trial version of spectragryph v1 2 16 1 scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx analysis was performed using the tescan mira3 xmu scanning electron microscope with an edx detector 2 3 experimental process in the study input volume of sample was 150 cm3 cr vi solution was added to distilled water according to the concentration specified in the experimental conditions then the polymer and or surfactant were added as dropwise to the sample at concentrations based on the experimental design matrix the ph was adjusted with addition of naoh and hcl the sample was stirred for 1 h in a magnetic stirrer with hotplate wisestir msh a at 300 rpm and then transferred to the membrane cell sterlitech hp4750 the inlet pressure of the membrane system was adjusted and the pressure was continuously monitored during operation a pressure of 400 kpa 4 bar was applied and the sample was mixed at 600 rpm with a magnetic stirrer located under the membrane cell the first 10 cm3 of the filtrate was discarded and the next 30 cm3 was reserved for analysis the change in flux was determined by measuring the time taken to obtain each 10 cm3 of permeate volume a schematic representation of the experimental process is given in fig 3 the fluxes were calculated by the eq 1 39 1 flux f j δ v a δ t where δv represent the permeate volume a was the effective membrane area and δt was operation time the result was found in l h m2 removal efficiencies were calculated by the eq 2 39 2 removal efficiency r 1 cp c ƒ where cp and cƒ represent pollutant concentration in the filtrate and pollutant concentration in the feed respectively in order to check whether the membrane was still usable relative permeate flux were calculated by the eq 3 40 3 relative permeate flux jr j j h 2 o where jh2o was flux of ultrapure water passed through the membrane at the beginning of the study 2 4 design of experiments design of experiment doe tools and response surface methodology rsm provide more accurate results than the traditional experimental process in which one parameter is studied at a time and greatly reducing the number of experiments and providing data with more information it also increases the process performance by optimizing different test conditions by revealing the interaction between the factors in the study 41 face centered central composite design ccd was employed using design expert 13 trial version for the modeling and optimizing peuf process ccd usually evaluates the independent variables at 5 levels α 1 0 1 α 0 is the central point 1 and 1 are factorial points α and α are called axial points or star points and represent extreme points outside the area where the model is constructed star points may not always conform to logical or physical work limits these points do not have to be outside the design cube as applied in this study the area of interest may be close to the study area therefore the star points are 1 and 1 and on the walls of the cube it is called a face centered ccd in face centered design each factor must be 3 levels it is not rotatable although it does not have as large a operating area as a rotatable ccd it adequately represents the area in which the model takes place 42 the mathematical formula of the process and the relationship between the factors and the responses are described by the quadratic eq 4 43 4 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 1 i j k β ij x i x j ε here y is the dependent variable β 0 is the constant term βi is the coefficient of linear parameters x i and x j is the independent variables βii is the coefficients of the quadratic parameters βij is the coefficients of the interaction parameters and ε is the random error term 3 results and discussion 3 1 cr vi removal with chitosan enhanced uf in the first part of the study chitosan solution prepared by dissolving 1 g of chitosan in 0 1 m acetic acid was used this solution was stirred at 60 c for 24 h and stored at 4 c in the experimental design ph was coded as a initial cr vi concentration coded as b and chitosan concentration mg l coded as c the responses were cr vi removal efficiency r1 and permeate flux l h m2 r2 coded and actual values were given in table 1 the experimental design matrix suggested for the face centered cdd model and the data obtained were given in table 1 coded and actual experimental ranges of independent variables used in modeling cr vi removal by peuf table 2 3 1 1 cr vi removal efficiency the anova results for cr vi removal efficiency with peuf were given in table 3 the model s f value of 35 68 indicates that the model is significant the p value of the presented model is 0 0001 indicating that it is highly significant and cr vi removal can be explained by the independent variables the box cox graph was examined first and it was found that lambda λ was 0 5 the software suggested arranging the model according to the inverse square root power law the factors that had a limited effect on the model with p value above 0 1 were excluded a2 c c2 are significant model terms the lack of fit f value is 1 54 the correlation coefficient r2 adjusted r2 and predicted r2 of the model are 0 9049 0 8795 and 0 8076 respectively it was observed that most of the variation in the experimental data can be explained by the model and there was compatibility between the adjusted r2 and predicted r2 according to table 3 quadratic equation of cr vi removal efficiency with chitosan enhanced uf was obtained at the coded levels and given in eq 5 5 1 sqrt cr vi removal 0 11 5 45 8e 003 a 0 025 c 0 066 a 2 0 038 c 2 the response surface plots on the removal efficiency of cr vi removal with peuf were given in fig 4 a as ph versus chitosan concentration a removal efficiency exceeding 95 was attained for hexavalent chromium cr vi within the ph range of 4 6 to 7 utilizing a chitosan concentration ranging from approximately 270 to 450 mg l it was determined that the initial cr vi concentration had almost no effect fig 4 b shows that at a ph of 6 and chitosan concentrations between 250 and 450 mg l a 95 removal efficiency for cr vi was achieved and no significant effect was observed from the initial cr vi concentration fig 4 c removal efficiency was over 95 in the ph range of 4 8 6 8 as the pk a value of chitosan is 6 5 some of the amino groups are protonated even at a ph of 6 9 25 44 the solubility of chitosan in water may also play a role as the ph decreases protonated chitosan becomes more soluble in water even if it binds cr vi anions by reducing its molecular weight it may still pass through the membrane pores in this case high cr vi removal efficiency can be achieved in the ph range of 4 6 7 where chitosan is protonated enough to bind large molecular weight and anionic cr vi compounds that will not pass through the membrane pores the removal of chromium is related to the presence of o and n containing groups chromate anions are bound to protonated amino groups through electrostatic attraction and ion exchange mechanisms at this point a redox reaction occurs between the cr vi forms and amino groups leading to the reduction of cr vi to cr iii in addition due to the formation of a coordination complex immobilization occurs at the same time the amino groups are oxidized to no2 4 45 pandey and mishra 46 suggest that the reaction may have been chelated as shown in the following reaction eq 6 46 6 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e 2cr 3 7h 2 o li et al 3 in their study on the production of membranes containing chitosan determined that the highest cr vi removal was achieved at ph 3 at ph 3 and below there is competition between protons and hcro4 as ph increases the protonation of anionic metal species will decrease if ph increases to 10 there will be competition between oh and cro4 2 in this study the highest removal efficiency is performed at ph 6 zhang et al 47 have determined that the removal efficiency decreases as the ph drops to 2 this is due to competition between protonated amino groups and anionic metal species hcro4 as a result the adsorption of hcro4 decreases in addition under strong acidic conditions the chelation sites on chitosan decrease due to the increased protonation of nh2 this significantly reduces the adsorption capacity of cr vi which is observed when ph is 4 mishima et al 48 reported that maximum retention occurred at ph 4 and also high retention of cr vi also continued between ph 1 3 in their study 3 1 2 flux the avona analysis of the reduced model created for flux optimization in cr vi removal with chitosan enhanced uf is presented in table 4 as can be observed the model is statistically significant and there is a significant correlation within the experimental space that allows us to predict the response according to table 4 quadratic equation of flux optimization in cr vi removal with chitosan enhanced uf was obtained at the coded levels and given in eq 7 7 flux 31 23 0 61 a 0 36 b 12 07 c 4 27 ac 6 13 bc 14 44 c 2 it is evident from the mathematical formula that chitosan concentration has a significant impact on flux whereas the effect of ph and initial cr vi concentration on flux is limited however the interaction between ph and chitosan as well as initial cr vi concentration and chitosan also affect the flux fig 5 a and b demonstrate that flux decreases with an increase in chitosan concentration this decrease is more pronounced at ph 10 than at ph 2 however flux increases with decreasing chitosan concentration it was observed that the solubility of chitosan decreased at ph 10 levels leading to the formation of large aggregates it is postulated that the decrease in flux is due to the formation of a layer on the membrane at a chitosan concentration of 0 and ph of 10 the flux increased above 60 l h m2 3 1 3 optimization the response variables namely cr vi removal efficiency and flux were selected to be maximized as cr vi removal efficiency is the primary objective it was assigned a weight of 5 while the weight of flux was 1 accordingly the optimum solution is obtained as follows the inlet cr vi concentration is 1 mg l the chitosan concentration is 278 mg l and the ph is 5 9 under these conditions the removal efficiency is 100 and the flux is 31 l h m2 3 1 4 characterization the chemical structure of chitosan and cr vi loaded chitosan was analyzed using ftir and sem edx and the findings are illustrated in fig 6 the band around 3453 3310 cm 1 is associated with nh and oh stretching vibrations the decrease in the intensity of the broad band at 3453 cm 1 indicates that the oh groups are not free this shows that the hydroxyl groups in chitosan are one of the functional groups that form a bond with cr vi the weak band at 2864 cm 1 is attributed to ch stretching the intensity of the nh bending vibration of the free amine nh2 group in the characteristic strong band at 1572 cm 1 is seen to decrease in the cr vi containing solution this indicates that cr vi is bound to the nh3 group in the polymer chain the band at 1408 cm 1 is attributed to con deformation while the band at 1070 cm 1 is attributed to co stretching vibration the band in the range of 1070 1014 cm 1 is assigned to specific absorption peaks of the β 1 4 glucoside bond which is a characteristic of chitosan s polysaccharide structure the band between 900 and 670 cm 1 in the spectrum of the cr vi solution shows strong intermolecular interactions between the polymer and cr vi anions due to the shared electron cloud between them 49 56 3 2 cr vi removal with polymer surfactant complex in this section the aim was to determine whether the complexes formed when chitosan and sds are mixed in certain ratios in a liquid environment have an effect on the removal of cr vi in a previous study it was found that the input cr vi concentration had little effect on the removal efficiency therefore a fixed input cr vi concentration of 3 mg l was used in this part of the study the factors in the experimental design were ph coded as a chitosan concentration in mg l coded as b and sds concentration in mm coded as c the responses were given as cr vi removal efficiency r1 and permeate flux l h m2 r2 coded and actual values are presented in table 5 the sds concentration used in the study was determined based on the critical aggregation concentration cac and critical micelle concentration cmc the changes in electrical conductivity ec and turbidity with respect to different sds concentrations in the presence of polymer 278 mg l chitosan are presented graphically in fig 7 the cac of 2 mm at which sds starts to aggregate by binding to the polymer is clearly observed in fig 8 at this concentration large and dense aggregates are formed in a core shell structure while less dense aggregates are formed with increasing sds concentration 57 as the ph increases the number of sds molecules that bind to chitosan decreases a similar formation was obtained by rasmussen et al 57 at ph 4 and low sds concentration the experimental program suggested for the face centered cdd model and the obtained data are given in table 6 3 2 1 cr vi removal efficiency the anova analysis results for the cr vi removal efficiency with the chitosan sds complex are presented in table 7 the f value of the quadratic model with inverse square root transformation is 10 40 and the p value associated with the f value is 0 0003 the independent variables accurately predict the dependent variables model reduction was performed by eliminating the factors with limited effect on the model with a p value above 0 1 a c and c2 are meaningful model terms although their p values were above 0 1 the b term and the bc term which show the chitosan sds interaction were retained in the model as the effect of chitosan on the model was desired to be observed the lack of fit had an f value of 3 21 and a p value of 0 1058 there is a logical relationship between the variables in the current state of the model the model r2 adjusted r2 and predicted r2 values are 0 7879 0 7121 and 0 5888 respectively the model has sufficient sensitivity to indicate whether it is usable within the design area which is 11 589 quadratic equation of cr vi removal efficiency with chitosan sds complex was obtained at the coded levels and given in eq 8 8 1 sqrt cr vi removal efficiency 0 22 0 027 a 4 07 8e 003 b 0 016 c 0 013 bc 0 053 c 2 fig 9 a illustrates the response surface plot when the sds concentration is at the midpoint 4 05 mm at this concentration ph and chitosan concentration have little effect on the removal however by reducing the sds concentration to the lowest value and increasing the ph closer to 10 fig 9 b the removal rate increases dramatically reaching the highest value of 98 a local maximum appears in fig 9 c at this point ph 10 and sds concentration 0 1 mm the removal reaches the highest value an increase in removal is also observed by increasing the sds concentration to the highest amount with a decrease in ph the removal efficiency decreases to around 30 40 in fig 9 d removal efficiency is observed at a moderate chitosan concentration 278 mg l at acidic phs the removal efficiency decreases and the effect of sds concentration on the removal efficiency is limited at higher phs the removal slightly increases as the sds concentration rises above the cmc concentration the removal reached the highest level at 0 01 mm sds concentration 3 2 2 flux the results obtained from the investigation of the effect of flux on cr vi removal with chitosan sds complex enhanced uf show that the amount of flux can be explained by quadratic and cubic models when the model is cubic an event called overfitting can occur where the model tries to predict each point instead of relating more simply and accurately to predict further data for these reasons the quadratic model was used as suggested by the software as shown in table 8 the model is significant the model r2 adjusted r2 and predicted r2 values are 0 7833 0 7255 and 0 7822 respectively model terms a c ac and c2 are significant within the experimental space there is statistical relevance in predicting the response equation of flux optimization in cr vi removal with chitosan sds complex enhanced uf was obtained at the coded levels and given in eq 9 9 flux 47 35 3 58 a 6 47 c 5 45 ac 8 97 c 2 in the equation that displays the effects of independent variables in the model an increase in ph can be interpreted as an increase in flux whereas an increase in sds concentration can be interpreted as a decrease in flux the amount of flux increases as the sds concentration decreases the response surface plot in fig 10 a shows a flat response to the variable where the chitosan concentration has no effect this trend continues as the ph decreases the interaction between ph and sds concentration is more apparent in fig 10 b where the highest flux values were obtained at high ph and low sds concentrations 3 2 3 optimization the response variables cr vi removal efficiency and flux were chosen to be maximized as cr vi removal efficiency is the main objective its weight was given as 5 and the weight of flux as 1 under these conditions the optimal solution was determined as follows ph of 10 chitosan concentration of 530 98 mg l and sds concentration of 0 103 mm it was observed that a high chitosan concentration and low sds concentration will yield the highest removal efficiency and flux in almost all solutions produced by the model in all other points of the experimental region it is assumed that the amine groups on chitosan that form bonds with cr vi compounds are filled by surfactant therefore low cr vi removal efficiency was obtained hassani najafabadi et al 58 conducted a study in which sds was used to protect the amine groups in c2 during chitosan modification and to modify the oh groups chitosan is well soluble when amine groups are protonated at low ph however it has low solubility at natural and high ph values chitosan forms aggregates and behaves like an amphiphile sds on the other hand forms strong bonds with chitosan through electrostatic attraction at low ph values in this study it is believed that there is no removal with the binding of sds to protonated amine groups at low ph before cr vi compounds the mixture samples given at the beginning of the section at ph 2 and 10 also support this das 59 mentions the formation of strong electrostatic bonds between chitosan at high ph and low concentrations of sds it is thought that the negative head of sds is turned towards the chitosan backbone low concentration surfactant molecules may also prevent chitosan molecular chains from clumping 3 2 4 characterization the ftir spectrum of chitosan sds complex is presented in fig 11 a the broad and intense peak at 3362 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of the oh and rnh2 groups of chitosan sds it is observed that there is a significant increase in the amount of functional groups the peak shifts from 3362 cm 1 to 3293 cm 1 indicating a decrease in the hydrophilic character of chitosan the peak at 2917 cm 1 is attributed to the aliphatic methylene group the peak at 1556 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibration of the nh group and the increase in its intensity indicates an increase in the adsorption of ir radiation on the functional groups the peak at 1220 cm 1 is the characteristic vibration of the asymmetric cos group indicating the formation of a complex between chitosan and sds the peak between 950 and 800 cm 1 is related to the cro stretching and the decrease in the intensity of the peak at 831 cm 1 indicates the binding of sulfate groups the morphology and elemental composition of the chitosan sds complex and chitosan sds loaded with cr vi are given in the sem edx image and spectrum in fig 11 b peaks are observed for c n na s and cr 2 28 31 37 49 55 58 60 63 3 3 treatment of chrome tanning wastewater the optimum conditions obtained in the previous sections for synthetic wastewater treatment were used to treat the tanning process wastewater obtained from the central anatolian region mixed and leather industry specialized organized industrial zone in turkey the sample was taken from the wastewater discharged from chromium tanning and was not mixed with other process wastewaters the wastewater was first treated as a pre treatment by passing it through a 0 2 μm pore size mf membrane in a cross flow membrane system the analytical values of the obtained filtrate are given in table 9 due to the breakdown of aggregates in wastewater and the inadequacy of the 0 2 μm pore size mf membrane to retain cr vi compounds it is observed that the membrane filtrate becomes more concentrated in terms of cr vi concentration the results obtained in the previous stages and the treatment of real wastewater are given in table 10 in the study that was used only chitosan 100 removal of cr vi of synthetic water was carried out in a wide ph range and chitosan concentration however only 4 4 cr vi removal efficiency was obtained for real wastewater it is believed that substances such as proteins fats and wetting agents as well as competing ions present in real tannery wastewater fill the amine and oh groups of chitosan which form bonds with cr vi 64 by using the chitosan sds complex 98 33 cr vi removal was obtained in both synthetic and real wastewater in other words the structure formed by chitosan and sds can almost completely retain cr vi in both synthetic wastewater and real wastewater in the peuf stage with chitosan 100 treatment of synthetic water was achieved at a wide ph range and chitosan concentration however only 4 4 removal efficiency of cr vi was obtained for real wastewater it is known that chitosan has a high chelation capacity and can form compounds with many cationic metals in addition to anions only alkali metals do not tend to form compounds with chitosan 12 as an example of this situation kaminski et al 65 reported that chitosan beads attracted cu2 and zn2 more than cr vi another probable reason for polymers not being able to retain cr vi compounds in real wastewater may be dissolved organic compounds present in the wastewater at the specified chitosan concentration under the experimental conditions it is thought that the components in real wastewater fill the amine and oh functional groups of chitosan real wastewater could not be treated only by the peuf with chitosan in the section where the cationic polymer chitosan is used in combination with the anionic surfactant sds 99 removal of cr vi is achieved at high ph levels for synthetic wastewater interestingly very low removal efficiencies were obtained in the supported uf studies using sds and chitosan separately in the real wastewater obtained from the tanning process whereas 98 33 removal efficiency was achieved here the complex formed by chitosan and sds can almost completely adsorb both synthetic wastewater and cr vi in real wastewater the cr vi concentration of the treated wastewater is below 0 05 mg l 4 conclusion the applied treatment methods in the study have provided almost complete removal of cr vi compounds from both synthetic wastewater and wastewater generated from the leather industry s tanning process in this context cr vi compounds were removed from synthetic water using the peuf study where chitosan was used as a polymer and the uf system supported by the chitosan sds complex in terms of cr vi removal from real wastewater peuf with chitosan was not sufficient but a remarkably high cr vi removal efficiency was achieved with the uf system supported by the chitosan sds complex thus cr vi compounds that cannot be captured by uf membranes with high permeate flux were successfully captured with high efficiency in both synthetic and real wastewater and high permeability was ensured funding this work was supported by sivas cumhuriyet university

12417,in this study we addressed the removal of hexavalent chromium cr vi a highly toxic and soluble anionic heavy metal using enhanced ultrafiltration uf the objective was to eliminate cr vi species with molecular weights beyond the retention capability of standard uf membranes and achieve their retention through the incorporation of polymers and polymer surfactant complexes within the uf membrane chitosan a cationic polymer and sodium lauryl sulfate sds an anionic surfactant were used in this context the cr vi solution was subjected to ultrafiltration in a laboratory scale membrane cell and its removal was assessed spectrophotometrically polymer and surfactant structures were characterized using turbidity electrical conductivity sem edx and ftir analyses experimental studies were conducted using the face centered central composite design ccd of the response surface methodology rsm to determine optimal removal and permeate flux values as well as to unveil the relationships between the studied factors and the resulting responses the results revealed that 100 of the cr vi species were removed from wastewater in the chitosan based polymer enhanced ultrafiltration peuf study with the chitosan sds complex a removal efficiency of 98 33 was achieved in synthetic wastewater the peuf study employing chitosan and the chitosan sds complex yielded permeate flux values of 30 73 l h m2 and 53 89 l h m2 respectively the optimized conditions obtained from the models were then applied to real wastewater obtained from a leather industry tanning process in the case of chitosan and the chitosan sds complex the cr vi removal efficiencies in the real wastewater were 4 40 and 98 33 respectively keywords hexavalent chromium leather polymer surfactant ultrafiltration data availability all data are produced by us and are clearly given in the manuscript 1 introduction one of the main challenges of today is the elimination of waste resulting from industrial activities the most significant impact of this waste is the contamination of water which is a vital part of the life cycle rendering it unusable heavy metals hold a crucial place among the many pollutants found in water although heavy metals are typically found in trace amounts they can cause severe health issues for living organisms the entry of heavy metals into the living metabolism can occur through drinking water contamination airborne intake in areas near emission sources or through food consumption thus these toxic non biodegradable and persistent heavy metals of industrial origin must be removed or recovered before release into the natural environment traditional methods used for heavy metal removal include chemical precipitation 1 adsorption 2 5 electrochemical treatment techniques 6 8 and ion exchangers 9 however these relatively more economical methods have many shortcomings such as the need for additional treatment of the large amount of sludge that occurs high energy requirements and insufficient removal in some cases pressure operated membrane filtration systems have been known to be effective in heavy metal removal for years however heavy metal removal is only possible with nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes 10 11 nevertheless these membranes have high operating pressures and are easily fouled and clogged production and operating costs are also high additionally they are limited in the recovery of heavy metals that may be valuable 12 14 ultrafiltration uf membranes which have much more permeability than nf and ro membranes have been used by modifying the process two of these modifications are polymer enhanced ultrafiltration peuf and micelle enhanced ultrafiltration meuf unlike conventional uf both methods can retain lower molecular weight components such as heavy metals and dissolved organic compounds water soluble and molecular polymers are used in peuf and these polymers interact with small sized soluble species increasing their total molecular weight to a size that cannot pass through uf membranes this study will investigate the removal of hexavalent chromium compounds with modified ultrafiltration systems the cr vi source is the chrome tanning process of the leather industry although cr iii salts are used in chrome tanning cr iii can be naturally and specifically oxidized to cr vi the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi occurs when oxygen forms reactive and unstable hydrogen peroxide molecules by forming double bonds with auxiliary substances used in post tanning processes these radicals interact with other double bonds triggering a free radical formation reaction the resulting free radicals oxidize cr iii to cr vi the reaction is catalyzed by heat and uv radiation unsaturated organic compounds oils wetting aids and other oxidizing agents can also cause oxidation of cr iii the ph value applied in the neutralization stage significantly affects the formation of cr vi 15 17 hauber 18 reports that no completely safe method exists in which hexavalent chromium is not formed therefore many countries have established cr vi limits for leather production ranging from 0 5 to 50 mg l 19 21 besides all of these cr iii species are poorly soluble and less mobile in nature it is an essential trace element in the metabolism of living things including glucose lipid and amino acid metabolism however cr vi is hundreds of times more toxic water soluble and has high mobility cr vi has the same tetrahedral geometry as sulfates and can easily cross cell membranes upon contact with the skin it causes ulcers wounds and eczema while ingestion causes gastrointestinal disorders and destruction of red blood cells therefore it is a much more significant environmental problem than cr iii 22 24 cr vi can be found in different forms in natural or effluent waters in the ph range of 6 14 cr vi is usually in the form of the dissolved chromate cro4 2 anion above ph 8 there is only cro4 2 when the ph drops slightly below 5 it is found in the form of hydrogen chromate hcro4 and dichromate cro7 2 cro7 2 is the dimer of hcro4 and exists when the concentration rises above 1 g l when ph goes below 2 h2cro4 is the dominant species the ph dependent variation of certain cr vi species in the aquatic environment is given in fig 1 16 the concept of polymer enhanced ultrafiltration peuf involves the use of water soluble polymers with relatively large molecular weights that interact with dissolved small molecules thus retaining them in the uf membrane the primary application of this concept was for the separation of metal ions from aqueous solutions using polychaetas and uf membranes although there are many names for this process such as liquid phase polymer assisted separation polyelectrolyte enhanced ultrafiltration and polymer assisted ultrafiltration they all have the same basic separation mechanism 12 13 in most cases there are two main interactions between polymers and metal ions electrostatic forces and coordination bonds other effects such as hydrogen bonds van der waals forces and entrapment during aggregation or encapsulation by the polymer can also occur the coordination bonds are similar to the interaction of metal ions with ligands in aqueous solutions in the formation of the complex vacant orbital metal ions function as electron acceptors and free electron pair ligands act as electron donors forming a coordination covalent bond in polymer metal coordination macromolecular ligands are usually multidentate or have more than one metal ion attached to a single macromolecule however the mechanism is much more complex as different functional groups on the polymer can interact differently 13 25 in the first part of this study chitosan was used as the polymer chitosan is a cationic amino polysaccharide copolymer with various potential applications in multiple industries it is obtained by deacetylation of chitin which is extracted from the exoskeleton of crustaceans and the cell walls of fungi and yeasts it has been reported in the literature that chitosan has a high potential for use in the sorption of heavy metals particularly due to the presence of amino groups 26 27 chitosan is soluble in most diluted mineral acids and when amino groups are protonated they form linear cationic chains 27 28 chitosan has two different types of reactive groups namely the deacetylated c 2 amine group and the hydroxyl groups on the acetylated or deacetylated c 3 and c 6 carbons fig 2 the reaction occurs on amine groups in an acidic environment where amine groups serve as adsorption sites for metals such as cd ii as iii and cr vi 29 31 amine groups can bind cr vi species through electrostatic hydrogen bond or reduction chelation interactions at low ph levels the protonated amine groups are in the form of nh3 or nh2 groups through strong electrostatic attraction negatively charged cr vi anions bind to positively charged amine groups the adsorption of negatively charged cr vi compounds to protonated amine groups also results in the reduction of cr vi to cr iii due to high redox potentials in this case both amine groups and hydroxyl groups are effective 5 in recent years polymer surfactant complexes have started to be applied in addition to peuf and meuf applications in this process it is possible to use membranes with much larger pore sizes because the size of the molecules formed is larger moreover the concentration required for the formation of aggregates is greatly reduced resulting in a decrease in operating costs and an increase in removal efficiency and operating stability in this process oppositely charged polymers and surfactants are used and they are typically held together by electrostatic interactions different interactions take place at concentrations below the critical micelle concentration cmc depending on the strength of the interaction between the oppositely charged surfactants and polymers the process proceeds as follows at low surfactant concentration surfactant molecules are dissolved as monomers and the surface tension decreases with increasing concentration at moderate surfactant concentrations surfactants begin to accumulate locally around the polymers and the first micelle like aggregations begin to bind to the polymer chains the surfactant concentration at which polymer assisted micellization begins is called the critical aggregation concentration cac surfactant added after the cac point affects the surface tension less and allows the formation of supramolecular complexes at this point it should be noted that there is a break in the conductivity and surface tension slope and turbidity starts to increase due to the presence of hydrophobic regions measuring the electrical conductivity of solutions containing polymer and surfactant is a frequently used method to investigate the interaction between them 32 35 in the second part of this study the removal of cr vi will be studied using the complex formed by chitosan a polymer and sds an anionic surfactant chitosan has a high self aggregation tendency due to the hydrophobicity of the polymer backbone and it also has a low surface area since it has a non porous structure these properties can be eliminated by modification with sds sds molecules form water insoluble complexes by making electrostatic bonds with positively charged chitosan chains thus by increasing the hydrophobicity aggregation properties lengths and ionic strength of the chitosan are increased 28 31 33 36 38 2 material and methods 2 1 materials chitosan was purchased from bldpharm china its molecular formula is c6h11no4 n acetic acid 100 purity was obtained from riedel de haen germany to prepare chitosan a 0 1 m acetic acid solution was prepared and chitosan was dissolved in this solution sds sodium dodecyl sulfate powder was supplied from cdh india and its molecular formula is ch3 ch2 11oso3na sds was prepared at a concentration of 50 mm by dissolving it in distilled water a cr vi solution was prepared with pure potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 in solid state a total of 1 2393 g of k2cr2o7 was dissolved in distilled water and made up to 1 l the cr vi concentration of the stock solution was 438 084 mg l hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from merck germany and were used for ph adjustment the membrane used is a pes membrane commercially named microdyn nadir up005 which has a mwco of 5 kda 2 2 analytical methods cr vi measurements were carried out according to the methods described in apha 3500 cr d and din 38405 24 briefly the principle of the method is based on the reaction of cr vi ions with diphenyl carbazide resulting in the formation of a violet complex with cr iii in the presence of diphenyl carbazone the merck spectropuant pharo 300 uv vis spectrophotometer was used for cr vi measurements ph measurements were conducted using an adwa ph ms ec tds meter electrical conductivity measurements were taken with the deltaohm hd 2106 2 conductivity meter turbidity measurements were obtained using the wtw turb 355 turbidity meter following the din en 7027 standard the critical aggregation concentration cac was determined by observing the trend of change in conductivity and turbidity values after adding sds to the solution containing 278 mg l chitosan at a concentration range of 0 625 20 mm all measurements were performed at a temperature of 25 c ftir analyses were carried out using the bruker optics tensor ii ftir routine spectrometer the ftir spectra of the samples were determined with 16 scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 in the band range of 4000 400 cm 1 and the graphs were drawn using the trial version of spectragryph v1 2 16 1 scanning electron microscope energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx analysis was performed using the tescan mira3 xmu scanning electron microscope with an edx detector 2 3 experimental process in the study input volume of sample was 150 cm3 cr vi solution was added to distilled water according to the concentration specified in the experimental conditions then the polymer and or surfactant were added as dropwise to the sample at concentrations based on the experimental design matrix the ph was adjusted with addition of naoh and hcl the sample was stirred for 1 h in a magnetic stirrer with hotplate wisestir msh a at 300 rpm and then transferred to the membrane cell sterlitech hp4750 the inlet pressure of the membrane system was adjusted and the pressure was continuously monitored during operation a pressure of 400 kpa 4 bar was applied and the sample was mixed at 600 rpm with a magnetic stirrer located under the membrane cell the first 10 cm3 of the filtrate was discarded and the next 30 cm3 was reserved for analysis the change in flux was determined by measuring the time taken to obtain each 10 cm3 of permeate volume a schematic representation of the experimental process is given in fig 3 the fluxes were calculated by the eq 1 39 1 flux f j δ v a δ t where δv represent the permeate volume a was the effective membrane area and δt was operation time the result was found in l h m2 removal efficiencies were calculated by the eq 2 39 2 removal efficiency r 1 cp c ƒ where cp and cƒ represent pollutant concentration in the filtrate and pollutant concentration in the feed respectively in order to check whether the membrane was still usable relative permeate flux were calculated by the eq 3 40 3 relative permeate flux jr j j h 2 o where jh2o was flux of ultrapure water passed through the membrane at the beginning of the study 2 4 design of experiments design of experiment doe tools and response surface methodology rsm provide more accurate results than the traditional experimental process in which one parameter is studied at a time and greatly reducing the number of experiments and providing data with more information it also increases the process performance by optimizing different test conditions by revealing the interaction between the factors in the study 41 face centered central composite design ccd was employed using design expert 13 trial version for the modeling and optimizing peuf process ccd usually evaluates the independent variables at 5 levels α 1 0 1 α 0 is the central point 1 and 1 are factorial points α and α are called axial points or star points and represent extreme points outside the area where the model is constructed star points may not always conform to logical or physical work limits these points do not have to be outside the design cube as applied in this study the area of interest may be close to the study area therefore the star points are 1 and 1 and on the walls of the cube it is called a face centered ccd in face centered design each factor must be 3 levels it is not rotatable although it does not have as large a operating area as a rotatable ccd it adequately represents the area in which the model takes place 42 the mathematical formula of the process and the relationship between the factors and the responses are described by the quadratic eq 4 43 4 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β ii x i 2 1 i j k β ij x i x j ε here y is the dependent variable β 0 is the constant term βi is the coefficient of linear parameters x i and x j is the independent variables βii is the coefficients of the quadratic parameters βij is the coefficients of the interaction parameters and ε is the random error term 3 results and discussion 3 1 cr vi removal with chitosan enhanced uf in the first part of the study chitosan solution prepared by dissolving 1 g of chitosan in 0 1 m acetic acid was used this solution was stirred at 60 c for 24 h and stored at 4 c in the experimental design ph was coded as a initial cr vi concentration coded as b and chitosan concentration mg l coded as c the responses were cr vi removal efficiency r1 and permeate flux l h m2 r2 coded and actual values were given in table 1 the experimental design matrix suggested for the face centered cdd model and the data obtained were given in table 1 coded and actual experimental ranges of independent variables used in modeling cr vi removal by peuf table 2 3 1 1 cr vi removal efficiency the anova results for cr vi removal efficiency with peuf were given in table 3 the model s f value of 35 68 indicates that the model is significant the p value of the presented model is 0 0001 indicating that it is highly significant and cr vi removal can be explained by the independent variables the box cox graph was examined first and it was found that lambda λ was 0 5 the software suggested arranging the model according to the inverse square root power law the factors that had a limited effect on the model with p value above 0 1 were excluded a2 c c2 are significant model terms the lack of fit f value is 1 54 the correlation coefficient r2 adjusted r2 and predicted r2 of the model are 0 9049 0 8795 and 0 8076 respectively it was observed that most of the variation in the experimental data can be explained by the model and there was compatibility between the adjusted r2 and predicted r2 according to table 3 quadratic equation of cr vi removal efficiency with chitosan enhanced uf was obtained at the coded levels and given in eq 5 5 1 sqrt cr vi removal 0 11 5 45 8e 003 a 0 025 c 0 066 a 2 0 038 c 2 the response surface plots on the removal efficiency of cr vi removal with peuf were given in fig 4 a as ph versus chitosan concentration a removal efficiency exceeding 95 was attained for hexavalent chromium cr vi within the ph range of 4 6 to 7 utilizing a chitosan concentration ranging from approximately 270 to 450 mg l it was determined that the initial cr vi concentration had almost no effect fig 4 b shows that at a ph of 6 and chitosan concentrations between 250 and 450 mg l a 95 removal efficiency for cr vi was achieved and no significant effect was observed from the initial cr vi concentration fig 4 c removal efficiency was over 95 in the ph range of 4 8 6 8 as the pk a value of chitosan is 6 5 some of the amino groups are protonated even at a ph of 6 9 25 44 the solubility of chitosan in water may also play a role as the ph decreases protonated chitosan becomes more soluble in water even if it binds cr vi anions by reducing its molecular weight it may still pass through the membrane pores in this case high cr vi removal efficiency can be achieved in the ph range of 4 6 7 where chitosan is protonated enough to bind large molecular weight and anionic cr vi compounds that will not pass through the membrane pores the removal of chromium is related to the presence of o and n containing groups chromate anions are bound to protonated amino groups through electrostatic attraction and ion exchange mechanisms at this point a redox reaction occurs between the cr vi forms and amino groups leading to the reduction of cr vi to cr iii in addition due to the formation of a coordination complex immobilization occurs at the same time the amino groups are oxidized to no2 4 45 pandey and mishra 46 suggest that the reaction may have been chelated as shown in the following reaction eq 6 46 6 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e 2cr 3 7h 2 o li et al 3 in their study on the production of membranes containing chitosan determined that the highest cr vi removal was achieved at ph 3 at ph 3 and below there is competition between protons and hcro4 as ph increases the protonation of anionic metal species will decrease if ph increases to 10 there will be competition between oh and cro4 2 in this study the highest removal efficiency is performed at ph 6 zhang et al 47 have determined that the removal efficiency decreases as the ph drops to 2 this is due to competition between protonated amino groups and anionic metal species hcro4 as a result the adsorption of hcro4 decreases in addition under strong acidic conditions the chelation sites on chitosan decrease due to the increased protonation of nh2 this significantly reduces the adsorption capacity of cr vi which is observed when ph is 4 mishima et al 48 reported that maximum retention occurred at ph 4 and also high retention of cr vi also continued between ph 1 3 in their study 3 1 2 flux the avona analysis of the reduced model created for flux optimization in cr vi removal with chitosan enhanced uf is presented in table 4 as can be observed the model is statistically significant and there is a significant correlation within the experimental space that allows us to predict the response according to table 4 quadratic equation of flux optimization in cr vi removal with chitosan enhanced uf was obtained at the coded levels and given in eq 7 7 flux 31 23 0 61 a 0 36 b 12 07 c 4 27 ac 6 13 bc 14 44 c 2 it is evident from the mathematical formula that chitosan concentration has a significant impact on flux whereas the effect of ph and initial cr vi concentration on flux is limited however the interaction between ph and chitosan as well as initial cr vi concentration and chitosan also affect the flux fig 5 a and b demonstrate that flux decreases with an increase in chitosan concentration this decrease is more pronounced at ph 10 than at ph 2 however flux increases with decreasing chitosan concentration it was observed that the solubility of chitosan decreased at ph 10 levels leading to the formation of large aggregates it is postulated that the decrease in flux is due to the formation of a layer on the membrane at a chitosan concentration of 0 and ph of 10 the flux increased above 60 l h m2 3 1 3 optimization the response variables namely cr vi removal efficiency and flux were selected to be maximized as cr vi removal efficiency is the primary objective it was assigned a weight of 5 while the weight of flux was 1 accordingly the optimum solution is obtained as follows the inlet cr vi concentration is 1 mg l the chitosan concentration is 278 mg l and the ph is 5 9 under these conditions the removal efficiency is 100 and the flux is 31 l h m2 3 1 4 characterization the chemical structure of chitosan and cr vi loaded chitosan was analyzed using ftir and sem edx and the findings are illustrated in fig 6 the band around 3453 3310 cm 1 is associated with nh and oh stretching vibrations the decrease in the intensity of the broad band at 3453 cm 1 indicates that the oh groups are not free this shows that the hydroxyl groups in chitosan are one of the functional groups that form a bond with cr vi the weak band at 2864 cm 1 is attributed to ch stretching the intensity of the nh bending vibration of the free amine nh2 group in the characteristic strong band at 1572 cm 1 is seen to decrease in the cr vi containing solution this indicates that cr vi is bound to the nh3 group in the polymer chain the band at 1408 cm 1 is attributed to con deformation while the band at 1070 cm 1 is attributed to co stretching vibration the band in the range of 1070 1014 cm 1 is assigned to specific absorption peaks of the β 1 4 glucoside bond which is a characteristic of chitosan s polysaccharide structure the band between 900 and 670 cm 1 in the spectrum of the cr vi solution shows strong intermolecular interactions between the polymer and cr vi anions due to the shared electron cloud between them 49 56 3 2 cr vi removal with polymer surfactant complex in this section the aim was to determine whether the complexes formed when chitosan and sds are mixed in certain ratios in a liquid environment have an effect on the removal of cr vi in a previous study it was found that the input cr vi concentration had little effect on the removal efficiency therefore a fixed input cr vi concentration of 3 mg l was used in this part of the study the factors in the experimental design were ph coded as a chitosan concentration in mg l coded as b and sds concentration in mm coded as c the responses were given as cr vi removal efficiency r1 and permeate flux l h m2 r2 coded and actual values are presented in table 5 the sds concentration used in the study was determined based on the critical aggregation concentration cac and critical micelle concentration cmc the changes in electrical conductivity ec and turbidity with respect to different sds concentrations in the presence of polymer 278 mg l chitosan are presented graphically in fig 7 the cac of 2 mm at which sds starts to aggregate by binding to the polymer is clearly observed in fig 8 at this concentration large and dense aggregates are formed in a core shell structure while less dense aggregates are formed with increasing sds concentration 57 as the ph increases the number of sds molecules that bind to chitosan decreases a similar formation was obtained by rasmussen et al 57 at ph 4 and low sds concentration the experimental program suggested for the face centered cdd model and the obtained data are given in table 6 3 2 1 cr vi removal efficiency the anova analysis results for the cr vi removal efficiency with the chitosan sds complex are presented in table 7 the f value of the quadratic model with inverse square root transformation is 10 40 and the p value associated with the f value is 0 0003 the independent variables accurately predict the dependent variables model reduction was performed by eliminating the factors with limited effect on the model with a p value above 0 1 a c and c2 are meaningful model terms although their p values were above 0 1 the b term and the bc term which show the chitosan sds interaction were retained in the model as the effect of chitosan on the model was desired to be observed the lack of fit had an f value of 3 21 and a p value of 0 1058 there is a logical relationship between the variables in the current state of the model the model r2 adjusted r2 and predicted r2 values are 0 7879 0 7121 and 0 5888 respectively the model has sufficient sensitivity to indicate whether it is usable within the design area which is 11 589 quadratic equation of cr vi removal efficiency with chitosan sds complex was obtained at the coded levels and given in eq 8 8 1 sqrt cr vi removal efficiency 0 22 0 027 a 4 07 8e 003 b 0 016 c 0 013 bc 0 053 c 2 fig 9 a illustrates the response surface plot when the sds concentration is at the midpoint 4 05 mm at this concentration ph and chitosan concentration have little effect on the removal however by reducing the sds concentration to the lowest value and increasing the ph closer to 10 fig 9 b the removal rate increases dramatically reaching the highest value of 98 a local maximum appears in fig 9 c at this point ph 10 and sds concentration 0 1 mm the removal reaches the highest value an increase in removal is also observed by increasing the sds concentration to the highest amount with a decrease in ph the removal efficiency decreases to around 30 40 in fig 9 d removal efficiency is observed at a moderate chitosan concentration 278 mg l at acidic phs the removal efficiency decreases and the effect of sds concentration on the removal efficiency is limited at higher phs the removal slightly increases as the sds concentration rises above the cmc concentration the removal reached the highest level at 0 01 mm sds concentration 3 2 2 flux the results obtained from the investigation of the effect of flux on cr vi removal with chitosan sds complex enhanced uf show that the amount of flux can be explained by quadratic and cubic models when the model is cubic an event called overfitting can occur where the model tries to predict each point instead of relating more simply and accurately to predict further data for these reasons the quadratic model was used as suggested by the software as shown in table 8 the model is significant the model r2 adjusted r2 and predicted r2 values are 0 7833 0 7255 and 0 7822 respectively model terms a c ac and c2 are significant within the experimental space there is statistical relevance in predicting the response equation of flux optimization in cr vi removal with chitosan sds complex enhanced uf was obtained at the coded levels and given in eq 9 9 flux 47 35 3 58 a 6 47 c 5 45 ac 8 97 c 2 in the equation that displays the effects of independent variables in the model an increase in ph can be interpreted as an increase in flux whereas an increase in sds concentration can be interpreted as a decrease in flux the amount of flux increases as the sds concentration decreases the response surface plot in fig 10 a shows a flat response to the variable where the chitosan concentration has no effect this trend continues as the ph decreases the interaction between ph and sds concentration is more apparent in fig 10 b where the highest flux values were obtained at high ph and low sds concentrations 3 2 3 optimization the response variables cr vi removal efficiency and flux were chosen to be maximized as cr vi removal efficiency is the main objective its weight was given as 5 and the weight of flux as 1 under these conditions the optimal solution was determined as follows ph of 10 chitosan concentration of 530 98 mg l and sds concentration of 0 103 mm it was observed that a high chitosan concentration and low sds concentration will yield the highest removal efficiency and flux in almost all solutions produced by the model in all other points of the experimental region it is assumed that the amine groups on chitosan that form bonds with cr vi compounds are filled by surfactant therefore low cr vi removal efficiency was obtained hassani najafabadi et al 58 conducted a study in which sds was used to protect the amine groups in c2 during chitosan modification and to modify the oh groups chitosan is well soluble when amine groups are protonated at low ph however it has low solubility at natural and high ph values chitosan forms aggregates and behaves like an amphiphile sds on the other hand forms strong bonds with chitosan through electrostatic attraction at low ph values in this study it is believed that there is no removal with the binding of sds to protonated amine groups at low ph before cr vi compounds the mixture samples given at the beginning of the section at ph 2 and 10 also support this das 59 mentions the formation of strong electrostatic bonds between chitosan at high ph and low concentrations of sds it is thought that the negative head of sds is turned towards the chitosan backbone low concentration surfactant molecules may also prevent chitosan molecular chains from clumping 3 2 4 characterization the ftir spectrum of chitosan sds complex is presented in fig 11 a the broad and intense peak at 3362 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of the oh and rnh2 groups of chitosan sds it is observed that there is a significant increase in the amount of functional groups the peak shifts from 3362 cm 1 to 3293 cm 1 indicating a decrease in the hydrophilic character of chitosan the peak at 2917 cm 1 is attributed to the aliphatic methylene group the peak at 1556 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibration of the nh group and the increase in its intensity indicates an increase in the adsorption of ir radiation on the functional groups the peak at 1220 cm 1 is the characteristic vibration of the asymmetric cos group indicating the formation of a complex between chitosan and sds the peak between 950 and 800 cm 1 is related to the cro stretching and the decrease in the intensity of the peak at 831 cm 1 indicates the binding of sulfate groups the morphology and elemental composition of the chitosan sds complex and chitosan sds loaded with cr vi are given in the sem edx image and spectrum in fig 11 b peaks are observed for c n na s and cr 2 28 31 37 49 55 58 60 63 3 3 treatment of chrome tanning wastewater the optimum conditions obtained in the previous sections for synthetic wastewater treatment were used to treat the tanning process wastewater obtained from the central anatolian region mixed and leather industry specialized organized industrial zone in turkey the sample was taken from the wastewater discharged from chromium tanning and was not mixed with other process wastewaters the wastewater was first treated as a pre treatment by passing it through a 0 2 μm pore size mf membrane in a cross flow membrane system the analytical values of the obtained filtrate are given in table 9 due to the breakdown of aggregates in wastewater and the inadequacy of the 0 2 μm pore size mf membrane to retain cr vi compounds it is observed that the membrane filtrate becomes more concentrated in terms of cr vi concentration the results obtained in the previous stages and the treatment of real wastewater are given in table 10 in the study that was used only chitosan 100 removal of cr vi of synthetic water was carried out in a wide ph range and chitosan concentration however only 4 4 cr vi removal efficiency was obtained for real wastewater it is believed that substances such as proteins fats and wetting agents as well as competing ions present in real tannery wastewater fill the amine and oh groups of chitosan which form bonds with cr vi 64 by using the chitosan sds complex 98 33 cr vi removal was obtained in both synthetic and real wastewater in other words the structure formed by chitosan and sds can almost completely retain cr vi in both synthetic wastewater and real wastewater in the peuf stage with chitosan 100 treatment of synthetic water was achieved at a wide ph range and chitosan concentration however only 4 4 removal efficiency of cr vi was obtained for real wastewater it is known that chitosan has a high chelation capacity and can form compounds with many cationic metals in addition to anions only alkali metals do not tend to form compounds with chitosan 12 as an example of this situation kaminski et al 65 reported that chitosan beads attracted cu2 and zn2 more than cr vi another probable reason for polymers not being able to retain cr vi compounds in real wastewater may be dissolved organic compounds present in the wastewater at the specified chitosan concentration under the experimental conditions it is thought that the components in real wastewater fill the amine and oh functional groups of chitosan real wastewater could not be treated only by the peuf with chitosan in the section where the cationic polymer chitosan is used in combination with the anionic surfactant sds 99 removal of cr vi is achieved at high ph levels for synthetic wastewater interestingly very low removal efficiencies were obtained in the supported uf studies using sds and chitosan separately in the real wastewater obtained from the tanning process whereas 98 33 removal efficiency was achieved here the complex formed by chitosan and sds can almost completely adsorb both synthetic wastewater and cr vi in real wastewater the cr vi concentration of the treated wastewater is below 0 05 mg l 4 conclusion the applied treatment methods in the study have provided almost complete removal of cr vi compounds from both synthetic wastewater and wastewater generated from the leather industry s tanning process in this context cr vi compounds were removed from synthetic water using the peuf study where chitosan was used as a polymer and the uf system supported by the chitosan sds complex in terms of cr vi removal from real wastewater peuf with chitosan was not sufficient but a remarkably high cr vi removal efficiency was achieved with the uf system supported by the chitosan sds complex thus cr vi compounds that cannot be captured by uf membranes with high permeate flux were successfully captured with high efficiency in both synthetic and real wastewater and high permeability was ensured funding this work was supported by sivas cumhuriyet university

12418,the need for new water resources in water scarcity regions has driven the exploration of water reclamation through a variety of treatment technologies the present study aims at reclaiming impacted urban groundwater through two different treatment routes one based on adsorption and ion exchange processes on consecutive pyrolusite granular activated carbon zeolite and fe oxy hydroxide filters route l1 and a second one relying on sorption on pyrolusite and ro membrane filtration route l2 both routes were operated without and with prechlorination to ascertain whether naclo beyond inactivating undesired pathogens affected the removal of target parameters mn as nh4 doc and the formation of trihalomethanes thms results showed that route l1 was successful at removing mn as pathogens and thms at levels below those stipulated by the legislation on reuse and drinking water only nh4 failed to decrease below its threshold limits for drinking water but only in the absence of prechlorination however concentration of cl and na increased during treatment due to the chemicals used compromising reuse of the produced water in specific industrial sectors requiring low contents of these ions route l2 showed a consistent high removal of all targeted parameters also nh4 without and with prechlorination conditions producing a finished water with high potential for reuse and production of drinking water doc and its fluorescent fulvic and humic like fractions were moderately removed by route l1 but highly removed by route l2 the outperformance of route l2 in terms of produced water quality must be balanced by the associated treatment cost as it was 8 10 higher for route l2 than for route l1 this made evident that a trade off between quality and cost must be faced this study demonstrates that reclamation of urban groundwater through the proposed treatment routes has a huge potential for reuse for a wide diversity of final purposes urban agricultural industrial environmental and recreational uses and although it may need further exploration likely for drinking water purposes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water reclamation advanced treatments chlorination sorption reverse osmosis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reclamation of low quality water wastewater impacted urban groundwater stormwater for further reuse has been acknowledged as an effective way to alleviate the shortage of fresh water and increase water self sufficiency especially for regions where freshwater is limited 1 2 however low quality waters commonly contain chemicals and pathogens that often compromise their reuse without proper treatment when the quality of water to be treated is poor e g with high turbidity and elevated load of organic matter and pathogens typical of municipal wastewater and end uses do not require very high quality water e g non food crop irrigation street or vehicle washing conventional treatment including coagulation sedimentation rapid sand filtration biological degradation and disinfection usually suffice 3 4 however and although there exist abundant literature for water reclamation for these reclamation scenarios when end uses do not require a high quality treated water much less is available when high quality is required e g irrigation of food crops eaten raw usage in electronics industry conditioning of boiler feed water in these cases more advanced treatments may be needed commonly including adsorption ion exchange and membrane filtration processes 5 6 selecting the appropriate advanced technologies to guarantee safety of reclaimed water is currently a matter of intensive research urban groundwater ugw in the aquifer of sant adrià del besòs barcelona ne spain represents an example of a waterbody with an enormous potential for reclamation moreover the high water table of the aquifer results in flooding of municipal subterranean structures causing serious deterioration of these structures making necessary a continuous pumping of large volumes of ugw approximately 5 hm3 per year to avoid seepage problems 7 this huge amount of ugw is currently discharged into the sewage system and directed to a nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp this practice implies a loss of hydric resources a deterioration of the sewer systems and the subsequent increase of their maintenance costs a continuous pumping to the wwtp and a decrease of the efficiency of the wwtp due to dilution of water to be treated 7 8 treating and rendering this ugw suitable for reuse would undoubtedly improve the management of the hydric resources in the area of sant adrià de besòs 9 this ugw nowadays presents a relatively good chemical quality with ammonium nh4 1 15 mg l manganese mn 2 825 μg l ferrous iron fe 12 3600 μg l and arsenic as 2 32 μg l as the identified chemical parameters of concern of this ugw 7 these contaminants which often coexist in groundwater are associated not only to organoleptic nuisance but also to adverse health impacts and operational problems 10 13 obviously other parameters apart from nh4 mn fe and as must be monitored to guarantee that treated water fulfils the regulations on the specific reuse of reclaimed water spanish rd 1620 2007 and eventually on drinking water eu directive 2020 2184 examples of these parameters are pathogens hazardous transition metals and thms several approaches have been applied for the removal of mn fe as and nh4 including coagulation precipitation biological processes and filtration through reverse osmosis ro membranes however these approaches present significant hindrances such as chemicals consumption need of high levels of targeted solutes treatment inefficiency at low temperature and under shock loading of contaminants difficulties to operate and high energy consumption among others 12 14 16 more cost efficient alternatives must be considered before selecting a definitive treatment method sorption has also largely been explored for the removal of mn fe as and nh4 besides other hazardous pollutants 17 18 among the outperforming sorbents are manganic dioxide mno2 for mn and fe 10 13 19 fe oxyhydroxides for as 11 20 and zeolite and carbon based materials for nh4 21 and references therein although a notable hindrance of sorption is that the process may suffer from competition between ions treatments relying on sorption i e adsorption ion exchange surface complexation emerge as alternatives to more expensive ro based treatments for the production of treated water at lower costs regardless of the type of technology applied for the removal of dissolved species current regulations imply the application of a disinfection process commonly chlorination to ensure that reclaimed water is safe from a microbiological point of view however the effect of chlorination in a water treatment goes beyond the inactivation of microorganisms chlorination can oxidise dissolved fe2 mn2 and as iii favouring their removal through precipitation and or sorption processes 13 19 22 in addition chlorine based reagents cl2 naclo or clo2 can react with natural organic matter nom and form undesired disinfection by products dbps 23 which have been linked to public health concerns one measure to reduce dbps is removing nom prior chlorination usually through adsorption onto gac 24 chlorination can also result in the breaking down of nom into smaller fragments which can exhibit different reactivity e g in forming dbps in adsorbing onto gac 25 27 finally chlorination can alter the adsorption capacity of filtering media by modifying the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent and or adsorbate 28 together through these reactions the fate of chlorine is also largely determined by the concentration of some species such as br and nh4 nh3 compromising the performance of a disinfection process 29 30 all these effects are not always fully addressed or explicitly discussed in treatments involving chlorination most studies on this topic have been often performed at bench scale sometimes using synthetic solutions and therefore their results cannot always be extrapolated to polluted waters furthermore the effects of chlorination are usually focused on one single process but rarely along treatment trains comprising different units 22 24 25 studies at full scale plants are scarcer and sparser moreover these studies commonly comprise conventional treatment with limited presence of advanced treatment and or the effect of chlorination on the removal of specific species is not always discussed 31 33 the main objective of this study was 1 to evaluate and compare two different treatment trains at a pilot scale for reclaiming ugw from sant adrià de besòs one of the treatment lines comprised a sequence of different filters to undergo sorption and ion exchange processes l1 while the second relied on sorption and ro filtration l2 chemical and microbiological parameters of concern mn nh4 as doc pathogens were exhaustively monitored through each line to discern whether treated water met the current legislation for reclaimed water before reuse both lines were operated under two scenarios without and with prechlorination for getting insight in what was a second objective 2 to elucidate the effect if any of naclo on the behaviour of the targeted contaminants along each treatment line the study finally aimed to 3 identify potential end uses of the produced water by l1 and l2 by comparing their quality against current legislation for reuse purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 urban groundwater composition the ugw treated in this study was pumped from below the parking lot located under the plaça de la vila in sant adrià de besòs the drainage and water level control system consisted of four extraction wells installed in the aquifer the purpose of this system was to keep groundwater levels low enough to not affect or avoid seep into nearby underground infrastructure such as building foundations and basements or other underground parking lots a summary of the chemical composition of the pumped ugw is presented in table 1 for comparative purposes table 1 also lists the required quality of water for human consumption set by eu directive 2020 2184 as can be seen water was generally of good quality except for nh4 and mn which clearly exceeded the thresholds of the eu directive 2020 2184 this composition generally agreed with previous campaigns carried out by jurado et al 7 who found however exceedances also for fe and as with regards to fe the apparent discrepancy was likely due to the fact that ugw in this study was taken from the parking lot where oxidation of fe2 and subsequent precipitation of fe oh 3 took place while jurado et al 7 analysed ugw from monitoring wells between the besòs river and the parking lot where more anoxic conditions prevailed with regard to as the small difference was probably due to the unavoidable variations in water level and or occasional anthropogenic recharges despite the concentrations of as and doc were moderate but because of their potential hazardous effect they were also considered together with mn and nh4 as targeted species of concern in this study in bold in table 1 it is worth noting that suspended solids were found at low levels 1 mg l because as found in a previous study 7 the riverbed is highly effective in removing particulate materials from groundwater this allowed to deem coagulation not necessary when designing the pilot scale plant for the treatment of the ugw from sant adrià de besòs 2 2 pilot description the pilot scale plant housed inside a 40 ft shipping container comprised two parallel treatment lines namely line 1 l1 and line 2 l2 each containing different treatment units as displayed in fig 1 and explained below before being diverted to each line feed groundwater coming from the parking lot was optionally subjected to prechlorination when applied prechlorination was performed by injecting naclo at a dose of 5 mg l after pre chlorination feed water was split into two streams one undergoing l1 and the other l2 2 2 1 treatment line 1 l1 treatment line l1 included an initial acidification optional sequential filtration through sleeve pyrolusite granular activated carbon gac zeolite clinoptinolite and fe oxy hydroxide feooh filters and final disinfection with naclo the purpose of the initial acidification was to lower ph around 7 0 7 5 and shift the equilibrium between hclo clo towards hclo which is more effective for disinfection than clo the function of the sleeve filter cintropur with a cut off of 25 μm was to remove any particulate material and therefore avoid clogging of the downstream filters of the pyrolusite β mno2 s filter to remove mn through sorption and or oxidation followed by precipitation of the gac filter to adsorb doc of the zeolite filter to exchange nh4 and of the feooh filter to adsorb as finally water was subjected to final disinfection 5 mg l naclo to protect produced water from recontamination from harmful microorganisms all filter media pyrolusite gac zeolite and feooh were packed in cylindrical columns where filtration took place in a down flow mode because the cycle of the zeolite filter before saturation was short at the scale of operation of the study the zeolite stage consisted of two filters working in parallel in such a way that when one of them was switched on for regeneration the other remained in operation ensuring continuous operation of the pilot all filters were periodically backwashed on average every 8 0 days and for 10 min with filtered water in counter current mode to remove particles trapped in the filter media the arrangement and design of the filters were so to allow each of them be backwashed independently regeneration of the zeolite filters was practiced after backwashing and was accomplished with nacl solution to restore the zeolite in its initial na form regeneration lasted ca 100 min after which filtration resumed again details on media columns dimensions and operating conditions for each filter are shown in table 2 2 2 2 treatment line 2 l2 treatment line l2 comprised the following units a sleeve filter a dual media filter a pyrolusite filter a ro membrane unit a calcite filter and final disinfection with naclo as in l1 the sleeve filter served for the removal of particulate material the dual media filter for the removal of remaining residual solids to better protect the downstream ro unit and prolong its life and the pyrolusite filter for the removal of mn the ro membrane unit acted as a major and ultimate barrier against solutes and microorganisms while calcite filter had the purpose of increasing ph and remineralizing the ro permeate post disinfection 5 mg l naclo was applied also as in l1 details on filters in l2 are shown in table 2 the ro unit was arranged as a three stage configuration with 5 pressure vessels in a 2 2 1 arrangement each pressure vessel contained one spiral wound element lewabrane ro b085 ulp 4040 4 in in diameter and 40 in in length with a membrane area of 7 9 m2 which is an aromatic polyamide based membrane designed for low salinity water to operate at ultralow pressure ulp the pressure of the inlet water to the ro unit was raised to 12 bar using a booster pump alfa 540 for scaling control acid hcl antiscalant commercial name hidroglobal vitec 3000 and a dechlorination agent to remove chlorine sodium metabisulphite were dosed prior to the entrance into the ro unit operating the ro membranes with a recovery of 60 in combination with the above mentioned reagents for scaling control appeared to result in stable operation over the whole experimental period during which cleaning of the membrane elements was not necessary 2 3 pilot operation the operation of the plant was fully automated including chemical dosing of reagents naclo hcl antiscalant and sodium metabisulphite backwashing of the media filters and regeneration of the zeolite filters which could all be controlled with a control panel the backwashing and regeneration streams were discharged to a municipal sewer in coordination with the consorci del besòs which also assisted with on site logistics and provided water electricity and site security the pilot plant was run for 8 months between september 2021 and april 2022 and was operated under two different scenarios without prechlorination and from january 2022 onwards with prechlorination with the purpose of evaluating the effect of naclo on the behaviour of each targeted species chlorine was applied as naclo at a dose of 5 mg l to ensure that the comparison between l1 and l2 was fair and unbiased they were run in parallel under the same conditions the work time was limited to 5 h per day for constraints from the consorci del besòs except for occasional brief periods when the pilot was shut down for repairs water flow rates at the entrance of the pilot were 55 8 and 70 8 l min for l1 and l2 respectively for l2 conversion of 60 for ro resulted in a produced water flow rate of approx 42 5 l min 2 4 pilot monitoring and analysis 2 4 1 automatic in situ monitoring and analysis the pilot was equipped with in line systems for ph temperature conductivity orp pressure and flow rate determinations at different locations of the pilot it also included a datalogger which recorded the totalized water treated by the pilot plant 2 4 2 off site water quality analysis water samples were taken at least twice per week from all sampling locations see fig 1 and transferred directly to the laboratory where they were stored refrigerated

catalytic oxidation htco the non purgeable organic carbon method was selected iso number method 8245 analytical precision and accuracy were tested against reference material provided by the doc crm program university of miami d a hansell in order to get insight into the doc nature doc was characterized by feem recorded by a fluorescence spectrophotometer cary eclipse the excitation wavelengths were determined from 200 to 500 nm and the emission spectra were scanned in the range of 250 to 600 nm both with an increment of 5 nm the spectrofluorometer was auto zeroed before each analysis free chlorine residual fcr concentration was determined using n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method based test kits hanna hi3875 the concentration of the four regulated thms chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl chbr3 was done using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms system equipped with headspace injection trace gc and dsqii model ms equipped with a triplus autosampler from thermo fisher scientific limited 2 4 3 microbiological analysis according to the spanish rd 1620 2007 for wastewater reclamation e coli legionella spp and intestinal nematodes were analysed in order to assess water quality prior to any reuse water samples from the entrance and exit of both l1 and l2 of the pilot and occasionally from each unit along l1 were taken for microbiological analysis a total of 12 l of sample were collected in 10 l and 2 l sterile bottles containing sodium thiosulphate to quench residual naclo immediately transported to the laboratory and analysed within 4 h according to the mentioned legislation briefly e coli enumeration was carried out on 100 ml filtered though 0 45 μm filters or 200 ml centrifuged at 15000 g for 10 min samples for both cases volumes of 2 ml were platted onto chromogenic coliform agar from oxoid and e coli strains β glucuronidase positive were enumerated e coli were detected as blue green colonies and total coliforms as pink colonies for legionella spp analysis each sample was divided into three aliquots according to iso 11731 2017 one was heat treated another was acid treated and the third one was untreated then each aliquot was cultured on cycloheximide gvpc legionella agar media oxoid and on buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye agar media with and without l cysteine for confirmation intestinal nematodes eggs were analysed using the bailenger process modified and updated according to the rd 1620 2007 briefly 10 l sample were concentrated to 1 ml which was moved to a mcmaster counting slide the quantity of eggs was then recognized and counted though not mandatory for the rd 1620 2007 total heterotrophs were also determined as a disinfectant indicator and for assessing the cleanliness of distribution systems briefly direct samples concentrated samples from 200 ml to 2 ml by centrifugation at 15000 g for 10 min and tenfold diluted samples were cultured in water plate count agar oxoid and incubated at 20 c for 72 h before counting the resultant colonies on the plates 3 results 3 1 performance of the membrane free line l1 the figures that follow plot the average ph value and concentration of free chlorine residual fcr target species mn as and nh4 other ions of interest and doc and organic fractions as analysed by feem along treatment line l1 under non prechlorination and prechlorination conditions 3 1 1 profile of fcr and ph in l1 when added in water for disinfection the stabilized form of chlorine cl2 g in neutral to basic ph hclo clo reacts first with water constituents that exert chlorine demand including metals such as fe ii and mn ii nom hydrogen sulphide and ammonium e g dominant form at the typical ph values of groundwater the chlorine that is left over referred to as free chlorine residual fcr consists primarily of hclo and clo their relative prevalence depending on ph pka of hclo at 298 k is 6 8 fig 2 shows the profile of ph and fcr along l1 the initial acidification decreased ph of entering ugw to values around 7 0 for both operation conditions fig 2a making possible the prevalence of hclo 87 over clo 17 it must be pointed that hclo has a disinfection power almost 100 times higher that clo thanks to its enhanced penetration through the microbial cell membrane under non prechlorination conditions fcr obviously remained under detection limit until the exit of the pilot where post chlorination increased fcr to values around 0 8 mg l as cl2 which is within the recommended range for treated waters under prechlorination conditions in which naclo was applied at a dose of 5 mg l fcr was found at 1 4 mg l at the exit of the pyrolusite filter due to the chlorine demand of ugw and then dropped down to 0 1 mg l after the passage through the gac filter the capacity of gac to remove chlorine has long been recognized 34 rather than through an adsorption process of chlorine on gac as long perceived dechlorination involves a chemical reaction between the gac surface carbon and chlorine which is reduced to chloride 35 the fcr maintained undetectable through the subsequent zeolite and feooh filters and only increased again to around 0 9 mg l after post chlorination 3 1 2 removal of inorganic ions in l1 prechlorination showed distinct effects on the removal of targeted components mn as and nh4 were all removed by l1 both without and with prechlorination although at different stages of the line fig 3 under non prechlorination conditions mn was mainly removed in the pyrolusite filter by 88 from average 87 μg l to average 10 μg l at the exit of this filter fig 3a which was already well below the threshold set by the eu directive 2020 2184 table 1 under these conditions mn was retained by sorption through a combination of ion exchange chemisorption and adsorption processes 19 and or in the presence of dissolved oxygen by mno2 mediated catalytic oxidation followed by precipitation as mnooh or other oxides of intermediate oxidation states of mn 10 36 from this filter onwards the concentration of mn slightly decreased downwards to an average of 2 3 μg l at the exit of l1 under prechlorination conditions mn was removed in a similar high percentage indicating that prechlorination had little effect on the overall mn removal percentage the retention mechanism was likely the same as in under non prechlorination conditions in fact although it is known that naclo may oxidise adsorbed mn2 and enhance its removal in the form of insoluble oxide forms mnox s it is also known that for chlorine to effectively oxidise mn2 water ph needs to be raised to 8 8 5 13 as water ph at the entrance of l1 was around 7 0 7 5 oxidation of mn2 was not expected to be significant from the pyrolusite filter onwards mn remained below 50 μg l and was not deemed of concern arsenic as was removed basically in the pyrolusite filter 28 37 and especially in the feooh filter 64 92 regardless the application of prechlorination fig 3b in both cases the final average concentration of as was 2 0 μg l well below the threshold of 10 μg l set by the eu directive 2020 2184 pyrolusite has been reported to remove both as iii through oxidation followed by precipitation as mn3 aso4 2 s and as v through electrostatic processes 37 the removal of as iii and as v by feooh has been described to occur by binding of as iii and as v oxyanions on iron oxides via surface complexation and or ligand exchange process 11 the application of naclo results in a rapid oxidation of as iii to as v 22 and therefore the effect of naclo on as removal would depend on the relative adsorption of as iii and as v on feooh according to the manufacturer the feooh used in this study commercialized under the name of bayoxide e33 exhibits a high similar sorption capacity for both as species comparable sorption extents of as iii and as v on different forms of iron oxides magnetite goethite have also been reported 38 this explained why as removal was similar under both non prechlorination and prechlorination scenarios unlike mn and as nh4 removal appeared to be affected by the addition of naclo under the non prechlorination scenario nh4 concentration was seen to remain unaltered through the pyrolusite and gac filters fig 3c the removal of nh4 in l1 took place in the zeolite filter where nh4 concentration was lowered from 1 1 mg l to 0 6 mg l removal of almost 50 the removal was due to ion exchange with the na of the na form zeolite and as expected was accompanied by an increase in na concentration fig 3d the unbalance between retained nh4 ions and released na ions clearly pointed out that other cations were exchanged by the zeolite in fact profiles of ca2 and mg2 fig 3d and e respectively made evident that they were also exchanged and at higher extents than nh4 a balance between charges of retained ions nh4 ca2 and mg2 and of released ions na showed a difference 5 highlighting that these were the major ions involved in the exchange published studies report adsorption of nh4 onto zeolite but at higher nh4 concentrations up to 300 mg l much higher than 1 mg l of this study and with no or lower concentrations of competiting ions e g 90 mg l na 39 40 or after chemical or physical modifications of zeolite to enhance nh4 sorption 41 even being far away from these favourable conditions in this study nh4 sorption onto zeolite was quite remarkable under chlorination conditions a moderate decrease in nh4 concentration 21 from 1 8 mg l to 1 5 mg l was observed over the first pyrolusite and second gac filters this decrease was due to the reaction between nh4 and clo to form chloramines nh2cl nhcl3 and ncl3 minor adsorption of nh4 onto gac has also been reported 42 nevertheless the major removal of nh4 under prechlorination conditions was again in the zeolite filter with a nh4 removal of 91 from 1 5 mg l to 0 1 mg l it is worth noting that for occasional sampling events nh4 concentrations were observed to surprisingly increase after the zeolite unit a careful examination of the monitoring plan detected that these occasional increases coincided with samplings conducted just after regeneration the zeolite filters suggesting that nh4 was present in pore water in the filters when filtration resumed after a regeneration event these samplings were pooled apart in fig 2 to better visualize these increases in nh4 concentration the undesired washing out of nh4 was corrected by discarding the pore water collected just after each regeneration step values of anions so4 2 hco3 concentrations and conductivity remained fairly constant along l1 not shown with the exception of cl which will be discussed later 3 1 3 removal of organic matter and its fluorescent components in l1 fig 4 shows the profile of doc a and of the fluorescent doc protein like compounds b and fulvic like compounds c along l1 the content of each fluorescent component was tracked using its maximum fluorescence intensity fmax which gives an estimation of the relative concentration of the component doc was moderately removed by 33 and 29 without and with prechlorination basically in the gac filter undoubtedly through adsorption 26 43 the extent of doc removal by gac strongly depends on gac properties and dom nature 24 25 making comparison between studies difficult the doc removal observed in this study with gac chemivall cg900 compared well to that of reported by ponce robles et al 44 also using the same gac 25 prechlorination did not seem to enhance doc removal it is known that chlorination as any other oxidation process can break large molecular weight dom into smaller and less aromatic organic fragments which may exhibit different sorptive behaviour 26 27 however this difference was not observed in this study concerning the fdoc fractions average fmax for both protein and fulvic like substances also decreased basically in the gac filter fig 3b and c under non prechlorination conditions the decrease of fmax was around 35 for protein like compounds and 57 for fulvic like compounds while under prechlorination conditions fmax maintained around 35 for protein like compounds and decreased to 48 for fulvic like compounds removal percentages seemed to indicate a slight preference of gac towards fulvic like compounds over protein like compounds similar findings are reported by maqbool et al 32 who concluded that pre oxidation of natural water with naclo but also kmno4 and o3 preferentially decreased humic like fluorescence over that of protein like and justified it on the basis that humic like aromatic structures were more prone to chemical oxidation than the large molecular weight biopolymers including protein like components similar patterns are reported by lavonen et al 31 3 1 4 removal of microorganisms in l1 microbiological analysis showed that microbiological quality of raw and l1 treated water was not to be of concern as contents of coliforms e coli legionella and nematodes were very low or undetectable in raw water and mostly undetectable in the l1 treated water with occasional detections of very low counts even without prechlorination table 3 in all cases quality of treated water met with regard to microbiological parameters the quality stated by the legislation for reuse water spanish rd 1620 2007 and drinking water eu directive 2020 2184 as expected only heterotrophs were detected in all sampling events as heterotrophs are usually more abundant but they were also detected at low to very low contents and were not of concern either under non prechlorination conditions it was observed that counts of heterotrophs in the treated water were occasionally higher than that in raw water table 3 this was attributed to malfunction of the backwashing system in the feooh filter during the first weeks of operation which likely resulted in regrowth in the filter and occasional high counts in the effluent once the problem was fixed the backwash could be applied as planned despite this two additional campaigns during non prechlorination and prechlorination periods were carried out to get insight into changes in heterotrophs counts along the treatment lines the profiles obtained in these sampling events fig 5 showed that regrowth apparently took indeed place in the gac filter under non prechlorination conditions and in the gac and zeolite filters under prechlorination conditions but also that the regrowth was localised to these filters and that heterotrophs counts decreased towards the exit of l1 colonization of gac filters with controlled releases of microorganisms by backwashing has been reported in drinking water treatment 45 3 2 performance of the ro membrane based line l2 3 2 1 profile of fcr and ph in l2 fig 6 shows the changes in ph and fcr along l2 unlike in l1 no preacidification was applied in l2 as ro was expected to act as a complete barrier for any remaining microorganism ph maintained around 7 2 8 0 across the first two filters dual media and pyrolusite and decreased to 6 5 after the acidification applied ahead the ro unit to prevent scaling ph of the osmotized water rose to around 7 0 7 5 by the passage through the calcite filter where water was remineralized with calcite under non prechlorination conditions fcr remained as expected under detection limit until the exit of the pilot when fcr increased to 0 6 mg l by post chlorination under prechlorination conditions cfr averaged 1 4 mg l at the exit of dual media filter and 0 7 mg l at the exit of the pyrolusite filter as in l1 the consumption of fcr in these two filters was due to the chlorine demand by metals organic matter ammonia the level of fcr dropped to virtually 0 by the application of metabisulphite ahead the ro unit to protect the membranes depletion of chlorine is essential because polymeric membranes may be severely damaged by chlorine even in low concentrations 46 orp measured just ahead of ro was always in the range of 150 250 mv which is below the maximum value of ca 300 mv recommended by ro membrane manufacturers to ensure integrity of polyamide membranes 47 again the fcr finally increased to around 0 6 mg l at the exit of l2 due to postchlorination 3 2 2 removal of inorganic ions in l2 profiles of concentrations along l2 resembled for almost all species values hardly changed across the first filters but totally dropped after the ro unit this was expected as ro membranes act as a total barrier for most solutes 14 mn was the solute that most differed from this general behaviour it was mostly removed in the dual media filter up to 35 and in the pyrolusite filter up to 96 showing that these filters preceding the ro unit were already able to remove mn to levels around 10 μg l below the maximum admissible concentration the application of naclo seemed to hinder the removal in the dual media filter but pyrolusite was able to lower the mn concentrations at the same level as it did without prechlorination the removal mechanism was the same as discussed for l1 remaining mn2 after the passage of the pyrolusite filter was totally removed 99 by the ro membrane the low concentration of mn maintained until the exit of l1 arsenic as was not removed at all by the dual filter but partially removed by the pyrolusite filter 15 45 to concentrations 4 μg l the removal mechanism was the same as discussed for l1 the remaining as was then completely removed by ro providing a concentration at the exit of 0 1 μg l far below the limit established by the eu directive 2020 2184 the total removal of as by the polyamide active layer of the ro membrane was an indication that as iii was totally oxidized to as v in the form of h2aso4 as it is only when as is present as as iii mainly in the form of the non charged species h3aso3 that it is only partially rejected by ro membranes 48 concentration of nh4 hardly changed across dual media and pyrolusite filters a slight decrease was observed when naclo was injected due to the formation of chloramines but completely 99 by the ro unit concentration at the exit was 0 1 mg l again well below the threshold set by the eu directive 2020 2184 ions other than the target ones na mg2 k si ni2 cu2 cl so4 2 behaved as expected they crossed unaltered the first two filters but were highly removed 95 99 by the ro unit not shown worth mentioning are the profiles of ions ca2 and hco3 which increased their concentration after the passage through the last filter due to calcite dissolution fig 7d and e and b which was only partially removed 48 by ro fig 7f difficulties in removing b by ro membranes have been largely reported the reason of this difficulty is that at neutral ph b is found mainly as h3bo3 which is a small non polar molecule and as such not well retained by polyamide based ro membranes 49 3 2 3 removal of organic matter in l2 doc and its fluorescent components showed similar profiles along l1 without and with prechlorination they were hardly removed by the dual media and pyrolusite filters 5 and highly or totally removed by the ro unit 75 90 for doc and 99 for both the protein like and humic like components fig 8 as solute size is an important factor governing its removal by ro it can be inferred that fdoc contained a higher content of larger organic molecules than doc this would be in agreement with the statement that oxidation and consequent splitting of large molecular weight nom results into less fluorescent smaller fragments 50 published studies have also reported high removals of doc 92 with low molecular weight acid compounds partially permeating through the ro membrane 51 and protein like and humic like compounds 33 by ro membranes 3 2 4 removal of microorganisms in l2 microbiological analysis of l2 treated water showed that contents of coliforms e coli legionella and nematodes were undetectable under both non prechlorination and prechlorination conditions only coliforms were occasionally detected at very low counts table 3 in all cases quality of treated water met the quality stated by the european legislation for drinking water directive 2020 2184 3 3 formation of disinfection by products dbps in l1 and l2 it is well acknowledged that water chlorination poses the additional risk of promoting the formation of dbps the eu directive 2020 2184 sets a threshold for the sum of trihalomethanes chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl chbr3 of 100 μg l for a water to be drinkable in our study l1 treated and l2 treated water both without and with prechlorination showed thms contents always 5 0 μg l and therefore the formation of dbps was not considered of concern these low values even under pre chlorination conditions were likely favoured by 1 the fairly low content of doc in ugw and therefore the low potential formation of dbps 2 the low content of br in ugw 0 5 mg l see table 1 and therefore the low formation of brominated thms which are reported to be less rejected by ro than chlorinated thms 52 3 the removal of formed dbps along l1 particularly in the gac filter by adsorption 24 and l2 in the ro unit 53 and or 4 the lower propensity of chloromines to form dbps in comparison to chlorine 30 3 4 quality of produced water and potential for reuse table 4 compares the quality of treated water by lines l1 and l2 without and with prechlorination with the quality of water for reuse and drinking water purposes specified by the spanish rd 1620 2007 and the eu directive 2020 2184 respectively for water reuse maximum allowed contents are given as ranges because the rd 1620 2007 differentiates up to 14 uses under five main areas urban agricultural irrigation industrial recreational and environmental each with its own threshold s as can be seen in table 4 treated water by both l1 and l2 accomplished the quality required regarding microbiological and chemical parameters for all reuse purposes tabulated in the rd 1620 2007 even for the most stringent one i e irrigation of crops using a system whereby reclaimed water comes into direct contact with edible parts of crops to be eaten raw therefore treated water can be considered suitable for urban agricultural industrial recreational and environmental purposes treated water also fulfils the spanish rd 817 2015 on the status of surface waters and environmental quality standards actually 1 of the ugw pumped from the parking lot is already used for urban and environmental uses street washing and gardening and streamflow augmentation in the besòs river it should be taken in mind that specific industrial sectors may require more stringent thresholds that those stipulated in the rd 1620 2007 and therefore quality of reclaimed water should be determined on a case by case basis for instance an important parameter in textile industry is the content of fe which must be kept at low levels comparable to those for drinking water 54 other industrial sectors that may require high quality waters with low concentration of dissolved species e g dissolved solids doc are the micro electronics pharmaceuticals and food and beverage also boiler feed water for steam turbines usually requires quality comparable to that of drinking water 55 cl has recently received attention as a species of concern in reclaimed water after removal of mandatory components pathogens micropollutants dissolved solids 56 cl has multiple harmful effects on water reuse including crop yield loss at concentrations above 180 mg l in irrigation water soil salinization at contents above 200 mg kg in soil equipment corrosion and incrustations problems and limitations of the final product quality making necessary concentrations below 250 mg l in recirculating cooling water for boilers wash water and process water or even below 2 mg l in water for electrolysis and electronics industries 56 and references therein if that was not enough cl is difficult to remove and it can even increase along a treatment train through processes that involve chlorine acidification with hcl oxidation with naclo in our pilot an increase of cl occurred in l1 caused by the preacidification with hcl and prechlorination with naclo fig 9a but not in l2 where ro removed cl almost totally fig 9b this resulted in concentrations in l1 treated water around 310 mg l for cl and 280 mg l for na with and without prechlorination in bold in table 4 that might make it unsuitable for very high quality water requiring purposes although drinking water production was not targeted at this stage of the project it can be added that treated water by l2 with and without prechlorination and l1 only with prechlorination accomplished the eu directive 2020 2184 on drinking water with regards to targeted species of this study mn as nh4 doc and pathogens with values far below the thresholds of 50 μg l for mn 10 μg l for as 0 5 mg l for nh4 with the exception of nh4 in line l1 when operated without prechlorination for which the concentration in the produced water was 1 0 mg l therefore and with the exception of the latter scenario the possibility of producing drinking water could be considered if needed 3 5 cost estimation of produced water through lines l1 and l2 costs of treated water production were calculated considering the following items capital cost site preparation design construction mobilization and installation of the pilot piping and electricity distribution system etc treatment materials filtering media and ro membranes reagents dosage energy consumption and maintenance 3 of total cost personnel salary and legal fees were not included all capital cost components were amortized over the design life of the pilot plant which was assumed to be 12 years the lifetime of filtering media and ro membranes was considered to be 2 and 5 years respectively costs were calculated differentiating the two operation conditions tested i e without and with prechlorination the reagents applied were hcl nacl and naclo for postchlorination and optionally for prechlorination for l1 and antiscalant metabisulphite hcl and naclo for postchlorination and optionally for prechlorination for l2 with regard to energy cost the power consumption of each electric device pumps to move water through the lines dosing pumps backwashing pumps sensors and its operation time were used an electricity tariff of 0 2876 kwh average between september 2021 and april 2022 was considered a cost breakdown expressing costs per cubic metre of water produced is presented in table 5 as shown in table 5 the total cost of produced water without prechlorination was 0 896 m3 for l1 and 0 968 m3 for l2 these costs increased to 0 928 m3 for l1 and 1 027 m3 for l2 under prechlorination conditions due to the continuous addition of naclo differences in cost of produced water between l1 and l2 were thus of 8 10 the cost values for produced water through l1 and l2 compared well with those reported by other studies applying advanced treatments microfiltration ultrafiltration gac reverse osmosis at pilot scale 1 16 m3 by 57 0 85 m3 by 58 these values however should be viewed as an estimation when extrapolating the results observed in this study to long term operation periods first because the quality of raw ugw may change and so the lifetime of filtering media and ro membrane second the electricity tariff can largely change between countries and also along the year furthermore it can be added that applying the same treatment trains at higher scale can modify costs since plant capacity affects capital costs through economies of scale and related to this larger plants offer the possibility of introducing energy recovery units allowing to decrease energy consumption by up to 50 however the analysis allowed to identify the items that most contributed to the final cost of treated water in this study the major contributors to the total cost for l1 were the filtering media replacement 33 and the reagents dosed 28 while for l2 it was the energy consumption 41 mostly coming from the booster pump for the ro filtration another aspect that helps explain the higher cost for l2 is that amount of produced water is lower than in l1 as ro in l2 converts only a fraction in this study 60 of the incoming water into produced water 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that reclamation of ugw from sant adrià del besòs has a huge potential for reuse for a wide diversity of final purposes urban agricultural industrial environmental and recreational uses and although it may need further exploration likely for drinking water purposes the ugw was treated through two treatment lines both based on advanced treatments line l1 included different sorption and ion exchange filters while line l2 relied on a sorption filter and a ro filtration step both lines were operated without and with prechlorination to ascertain whether naclo favoured or hindered and to what extent the removal of target parameters mn as nh4 doc pathogens thms l1 was successful at removing mn as pathogens and thms at levels below those stipulated by the rd 1620 2007 for reuse and even those by the eu directive 2020 2184 for drinking water without and with prechlorination only nh4 failed to decrease below its threshold limits but only in the absence of prechlorination when naclo was applied also nh4 met the limit for reuse and drinking water it must be bear in mind that for specific industrial uses requiring high quality reclaimed water additional specific ones beyond the mandatory parameters set by the legislation on reuse and drinking water may need to be removed in that regard cl and na may appear as problematic species l2 showed a consistent high removal of all targeted parameters also nh4 without and with prechlorination conditions producing a finished water with excellent quality with high potential for reuse and also for production of drinking water the outperformance of l2 in terms of produced water quality must be balanced by the cost 0 896 m3 without prechlorination and 0 928 m3 with prechlorination for l1 and 0 968 m3 without prechlorination and 1 027 m3 with prechlorination for l2 meaning that a trade off between quality and cost must be faced if solutes concentrations in the produced water do not need to be reduced to an excessively low level then less costly l1 may suffice intermediate solution could be achieved by blending l1 and l2 treated waters if the resulting quality already matches the one required according to its final intended purpose declaration of

12418,the need for new water resources in water scarcity regions has driven the exploration of water reclamation through a variety of treatment technologies the present study aims at reclaiming impacted urban groundwater through two different treatment routes one based on adsorption and ion exchange processes on consecutive pyrolusite granular activated carbon zeolite and fe oxy hydroxide filters route l1 and a second one relying on sorption on pyrolusite and ro membrane filtration route l2 both routes were operated without and with prechlorination to ascertain whether naclo beyond inactivating undesired pathogens affected the removal of target parameters mn as nh4 doc and the formation of trihalomethanes thms results showed that route l1 was successful at removing mn as pathogens and thms at levels below those stipulated by the legislation on reuse and drinking water only nh4 failed to decrease below its threshold limits for drinking water but only in the absence of prechlorination however concentration of cl and na increased during treatment due to the chemicals used compromising reuse of the produced water in specific industrial sectors requiring low contents of these ions route l2 showed a consistent high removal of all targeted parameters also nh4 without and with prechlorination conditions producing a finished water with high potential for reuse and production of drinking water doc and its fluorescent fulvic and humic like fractions were moderately removed by route l1 but highly removed by route l2 the outperformance of route l2 in terms of produced water quality must be balanced by the associated treatment cost as it was 8 10 higher for route l2 than for route l1 this made evident that a trade off between quality and cost must be faced this study demonstrates that reclamation of urban groundwater through the proposed treatment routes has a huge potential for reuse for a wide diversity of final purposes urban agricultural industrial environmental and recreational uses and although it may need further exploration likely for drinking water purposes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water reclamation advanced treatments chlorination sorption reverse osmosis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reclamation of low quality water wastewater impacted urban groundwater stormwater for further reuse has been acknowledged as an effective way to alleviate the shortage of fresh water and increase water self sufficiency especially for regions where freshwater is limited 1 2 however low quality waters commonly contain chemicals and pathogens that often compromise their reuse without proper treatment when the quality of water to be treated is poor e g with high turbidity and elevated load of organic matter and pathogens typical of municipal wastewater and end uses do not require very high quality water e g non food crop irrigation street or vehicle washing conventional treatment including coagulation sedimentation rapid sand filtration biological degradation and disinfection usually suffice 3 4 however and although there exist abundant literature for water reclamation for these reclamation scenarios when end uses do not require a high quality treated water much less is available when high quality is required e g irrigation of food crops eaten raw usage in electronics industry conditioning of boiler feed water in these cases more advanced treatments may be needed commonly including adsorption ion exchange and membrane filtration processes 5 6 selecting the appropriate advanced technologies to guarantee safety of reclaimed water is currently a matter of intensive research urban groundwater ugw in the aquifer of sant adrià del besòs barcelona ne spain represents an example of a waterbody with an enormous potential for reclamation moreover the high water table of the aquifer results in flooding of municipal subterranean structures causing serious deterioration of these structures making necessary a continuous pumping of large volumes of ugw approximately 5 hm3 per year to avoid seepage problems 7 this huge amount of ugw is currently discharged into the sewage system and directed to a nearby wastewater treatment plant wwtp this practice implies a loss of hydric resources a deterioration of the sewer systems and the subsequent increase of their maintenance costs a continuous pumping to the wwtp and a decrease of the efficiency of the wwtp due to dilution of water to be treated 7 8 treating and rendering this ugw suitable for reuse would undoubtedly improve the management of the hydric resources in the area of sant adrià de besòs 9 this ugw nowadays presents a relatively good chemical quality with ammonium nh4 1 15 mg l manganese mn 2 825 μg l ferrous iron fe 12 3600 μg l and arsenic as 2 32 μg l as the identified chemical parameters of concern of this ugw 7 these contaminants which often coexist in groundwater are associated not only to organoleptic nuisance but also to adverse health impacts and operational problems 10 13 obviously other parameters apart from nh4 mn fe and as must be monitored to guarantee that treated water fulfils the regulations on the specific reuse of reclaimed water spanish rd 1620 2007 and eventually on drinking water eu directive 2020 2184 examples of these parameters are pathogens hazardous transition metals and thms several approaches have been applied for the removal of mn fe as and nh4 including coagulation precipitation biological processes and filtration through reverse osmosis ro membranes however these approaches present significant hindrances such as chemicals consumption need of high levels of targeted solutes treatment inefficiency at low temperature and under shock loading of contaminants difficulties to operate and high energy consumption among others 12 14 16 more cost efficient alternatives must be considered before selecting a definitive treatment method sorption has also largely been explored for the removal of mn fe as and nh4 besides other hazardous pollutants 17 18 among the outperforming sorbents are manganic dioxide mno2 for mn and fe 10 13 19 fe oxyhydroxides for as 11 20 and zeolite and carbon based materials for nh4 21 and references therein although a notable hindrance of sorption is that the process may suffer from competition between ions treatments relying on sorption i e adsorption ion exchange surface complexation emerge as alternatives to more expensive ro based treatments for the production of treated water at lower costs regardless of the type of technology applied for the removal of dissolved species current regulations imply the application of a disinfection process commonly chlorination to ensure that reclaimed water is safe from a microbiological point of view however the effect of chlorination in a water treatment goes beyond the inactivation of microorganisms chlorination can oxidise dissolved fe2 mn2 and as iii favouring their removal through precipitation and or sorption processes 13 19 22 in addition chlorine based reagents cl2 naclo or clo2 can react with natural organic matter nom and form undesired disinfection by products dbps 23 which have been linked to public health concerns one measure to reduce dbps is removing nom prior chlorination usually through adsorption onto gac 24 chlorination can also result in the breaking down of nom into smaller fragments which can exhibit different reactivity e g in forming dbps in adsorbing onto gac 25 27 finally chlorination can alter the adsorption capacity of filtering media by modifying the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent and or adsorbate 28 together through these reactions the fate of chlorine is also largely determined by the concentration of some species such as br and nh4 nh3 compromising the performance of a disinfection process 29 30 all these effects are not always fully addressed or explicitly discussed in treatments involving chlorination most studies on this topic have been often performed at bench scale sometimes using synthetic solutions and therefore their results cannot always be extrapolated to polluted waters furthermore the effects of chlorination are usually focused on one single process but rarely along treatment trains comprising different units 22 24 25 studies at full scale plants are scarcer and sparser moreover these studies commonly comprise conventional treatment with limited presence of advanced treatment and or the effect of chlorination on the removal of specific species is not always discussed 31 33 the main objective of this study was 1 to evaluate and compare two different treatment trains at a pilot scale for reclaiming ugw from sant adrià de besòs one of the treatment lines comprised a sequence of different filters to undergo sorption and ion exchange processes l1 while the second relied on sorption and ro filtration l2 chemical and microbiological parameters of concern mn nh4 as doc pathogens were exhaustively monitored through each line to discern whether treated water met the current legislation for reclaimed water before reuse both lines were operated under two scenarios without and with prechlorination for getting insight in what was a second objective 2 to elucidate the effect if any of naclo on the behaviour of the targeted contaminants along each treatment line the study finally aimed to 3 identify potential end uses of the produced water by l1 and l2 by comparing their quality against current legislation for reuse purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 urban groundwater composition the ugw treated in this study was pumped from below the parking lot located under the plaça de la vila in sant adrià de besòs the drainage and water level control system consisted of four extraction wells installed in the aquifer the purpose of this system was to keep groundwater levels low enough to not affect or avoid seep into nearby underground infrastructure such as building foundations and basements or other underground parking lots a summary of the chemical composition of the pumped ugw is presented in table 1 for comparative purposes table 1 also lists the required quality of water for human consumption set by eu directive 2020 2184 as can be seen water was generally of good quality except for nh4 and mn which clearly exceeded the thresholds of the eu directive 2020 2184 this composition generally agreed with previous campaigns carried out by jurado et al 7 who found however exceedances also for fe and as with regards to fe the apparent discrepancy was likely due to the fact that ugw in this study was taken from the parking lot where oxidation of fe2 and subsequent precipitation of fe oh 3 took place while jurado et al 7 analysed ugw from monitoring wells between the besòs river and the parking lot where more anoxic conditions prevailed with regard to as the small difference was probably due to the unavoidable variations in water level and or occasional anthropogenic recharges despite the concentrations of as and doc were moderate but because of their potential hazardous effect they were also considered together with mn and nh4 as targeted species of concern in this study in bold in table 1 it is worth noting that suspended solids were found at low levels 1 mg l because as found in a previous study 7 the riverbed is highly effective in removing particulate materials from groundwater this allowed to deem coagulation not necessary when designing the pilot scale plant for the treatment of the ugw from sant adrià de besòs 2 2 pilot description the pilot scale plant housed inside a 40 ft shipping container comprised two parallel treatment lines namely line 1 l1 and line 2 l2 each containing different treatment units as displayed in fig 1 and explained below before being diverted to each line feed groundwater coming from the parking lot was optionally subjected to prechlorination when applied prechlorination was performed by injecting naclo at a dose of 5 mg l after pre chlorination feed water was split into two streams one undergoing l1 and the other l2 2 2 1 treatment line 1 l1 treatment line l1 included an initial acidification optional sequential filtration through sleeve pyrolusite granular activated carbon gac zeolite clinoptinolite and fe oxy hydroxide feooh filters and final disinfection with naclo the purpose of the initial acidification was to lower ph around 7 0 7 5 and shift the equilibrium between hclo clo towards hclo which is more effective for disinfection than clo the function of the sleeve filter cintropur with a cut off of 25 μm was to remove any particulate material and therefore avoid clogging of the downstream filters of the pyrolusite β mno2 s filter to remove mn through sorption and or oxidation followed by precipitation of the gac filter to adsorb doc of the zeolite filter to exchange nh4 and of the feooh filter to adsorb as finally water was subjected to final disinfection 5 mg l naclo to protect produced water from recontamination from harmful microorganisms all filter media pyrolusite gac zeolite and feooh were packed in cylindrical columns where filtration took place in a down flow mode because the cycle of the zeolite filter before saturation was short at the scale of operation of the study the zeolite stage consisted of two filters working in parallel in such a way that when one of them was switched on for regeneration the other remained in operation ensuring continuous operation of the pilot all filters were periodically backwashed on average every 8 0 days and for 10 min with filtered water in counter current mode to remove particles trapped in the filter media the arrangement and design of the filters were so to allow each of them be backwashed independently regeneration of the zeolite filters was practiced after backwashing and was accomplished with nacl solution to restore the zeolite in its initial na form regeneration lasted ca 100 min after which filtration resumed again details on media columns dimensions and operating conditions for each filter are shown in table 2 2 2 2 treatment line 2 l2 treatment line l2 comprised the following units a sleeve filter a dual media filter a pyrolusite filter a ro membrane unit a calcite filter and final disinfection with naclo as in l1 the sleeve filter served for the removal of particulate material the dual media filter for the removal of remaining residual solids to better protect the downstream ro unit and prolong its life and the pyrolusite filter for the removal of mn the ro membrane unit acted as a major and ultimate barrier against solutes and microorganisms while calcite filter had the purpose of increasing ph and remineralizing the ro permeate post disinfection 5 mg l naclo was applied also as in l1 details on filters in l2 are shown in table 2 the ro unit was arranged as a three stage configuration with 5 pressure vessels in a 2 2 1 arrangement each pressure vessel contained one spiral wound element lewabrane ro b085 ulp 4040 4 in in diameter and 40 in in length with a membrane area of 7 9 m2 which is an aromatic polyamide based membrane designed for low salinity water to operate at ultralow pressure ulp the pressure of the inlet water to the ro unit was raised to 12 bar using a booster pump alfa 540 for scaling control acid hcl antiscalant commercial name hidroglobal vitec 3000 and a dechlorination agent to remove chlorine sodium metabisulphite were dosed prior to the entrance into the ro unit operating the ro membranes with a recovery of 60 in combination with the above mentioned reagents for scaling control appeared to result in stable operation over the whole experimental period during which cleaning of the membrane elements was not necessary 2 3 pilot operation the operation of the plant was fully automated including chemical dosing of reagents naclo hcl antiscalant and sodium metabisulphite backwashing of the media filters and regeneration of the zeolite filters which could all be controlled with a control panel the backwashing and regeneration streams were discharged to a municipal sewer in coordination with the consorci del besòs which also assisted with on site logistics and provided water electricity and site security the pilot plant was run for 8 months between september 2021 and april 2022 and was operated under two different scenarios without prechlorination and from january 2022 onwards with prechlorination with the purpose of evaluating the effect of naclo on the behaviour of each targeted species chlorine was applied as naclo at a dose of 5 mg l to ensure that the comparison between l1 and l2 was fair and unbiased they were run in parallel under the same conditions the work time was limited to 5 h per day for constraints from the consorci del besòs except for occasional brief periods when the pilot was shut down for repairs water flow rates at the entrance of the pilot were 55 8 and 70 8 l min for l1 and l2 respectively for l2 conversion of 60 for ro resulted in a produced water flow rate of approx 42 5 l min 2 4 pilot monitoring and analysis 2 4 1 automatic in situ monitoring and analysis the pilot was equipped with in line systems for ph temperature conductivity orp pressure and flow rate determinations at different locations of the pilot it also included a datalogger which recorded the totalized water treated by the pilot plant 2 4 2

limited 2 4 3 microbiological analysis according to the spanish rd 1620 2007 for wastewater reclamation e coli legionella spp and intestinal nematodes were analysed in order to assess water quality prior to any reuse water samples from the entrance and exit of both l1 and l2 of the pilot and occasionally from each unit along l1 were taken for microbiological analysis a total of 12 l of sample were collected in 10 l and 2 l sterile bottles containing sodium thiosulphate to quench residual naclo immediately transported to the laboratory and analysed within 4 h according to the mentioned legislation briefly e coli enumeration was carried out on 100 ml filtered though 0 45 μm filters or 200 ml centrifuged at 15000 g for 10 min samples for both cases volumes of 2 ml were platted onto chromogenic coliform agar from oxoid and e coli strains β glucuronidase positive were enumerated e coli were detected as blue green colonies and total coliforms as pink colonies for legionella spp analysis each sample was divided into three aliquots according to iso 11731 2017 one was heat treated another was acid treated and the third one was untreated then each aliquot was cultured on cycloheximide gvpc legionella agar media oxoid and on buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye agar media with and without l cysteine for confirmation intestinal nematodes eggs were analysed using the bailenger process modified and updated according to the rd 1620 2007 briefly 10 l sample were concentrated to 1 ml which was moved to a mcmaster counting slide the quantity of eggs was then recognized and counted though not mandatory for the rd 1620 2007 total heterotrophs were also determined as a disinfectant indicator and for assessing the cleanliness of distribution systems briefly direct samples concentrated samples from 200 ml to 2 ml by centrifugation at 15000 g for 10 min and tenfold diluted samples were cultured in water plate count agar oxoid and incubated at 20 c for 72 h before counting the resultant colonies on the plates 3 results 3 1 performance of the membrane free line l1 the figures that follow plot the average ph value and concentration of free chlorine residual fcr

fcr and ph in l1 when added in water for disinfection the stabilized form of chlorine cl2 g in neutral to basic ph hclo clo reacts first with water constituents that exert chlorine demand including metals such as fe ii and mn ii nom hydrogen sulphide and ammonium e g dominant form at the typical ph values of groundwater the chlorine that is left over referred to as free chlorine residual fcr consists primarily of hclo and clo their relative prevalence depending on ph pka of hclo at 298 k is 6 8 fig 2 shows the profile of ph and fcr along l1 the initial acidification decreased ph of entering ugw to values around 7 0 for both operation conditions fig 2a making possible the prevalence of hclo 87 over clo 17 it must be pointed that hclo has a disinfection power almost 100 times higher that clo thanks to its enhanced penetration through the microbial cell membrane under non prechlorination conditions fcr obviously remained under detection limit until the exit of the pilot where post chlorination increased fcr to values around 0 8 mg l as cl2 which is within the recommended range for treated waters under prechlorination conditions in which naclo was applied at a dose of 5 mg l fcr was found at 1 4 mg l at the exit of the pyrolusite filter due to the chlorine demand of ugw and then dropped down to 0 1 mg l after the passage through the gac filter the capacity of gac to remove chlorine has long been recognized 34 rather than through an adsorption process of chlorine on gac as long perceived dechlorination involves a chemical reaction between the gac surface carbon and chlorine which is reduced to chloride 35 the fcr maintained undetectable through the subsequent zeolite and feooh filters and only increased again to around 0 9 mg l after post chlorination 3 1 2 removal of inorganic ions in l1 prechlorination showed distinct effects on the removal of targeted components mn as and nh4 were all removed by l1 both without and with prechlorination although at different stages of the line fig 3 under non prechlorination conditions mn was mainly removed in the pyrolusite filter by 88 from average 87 μg l to average 10 μg l at the exit of this filter fig 3a which was already well below the threshold set by the eu directive 2020 2184 table 1 under these conditions mn was retained by sorption through a combination of ion exchange chemisorption and adsorption processes 19 and or in the presence of dissolved oxygen by mno2 mediated catalytic oxidation followed by precipitation as mnooh or other oxides of intermediate oxidation states of mn 10 36 from this filter onwards the concentration of mn slightly decreased downwards to an average of 2 3 μg l at the exit of l1 under prechlorination conditions mn was removed in a similar high percentage indicating that prechlorination had little effect on the overall mn removal percentage the retention mechanism was likely the same as in under non prechlorination conditions in fact although it is known that naclo may oxidise adsorbed mn2 and enhance its removal in the form of insoluble oxide forms mnox s it is also known that for chlorine to effectively oxidise mn2 water ph needs to be raised to 8 8 5 13 as water ph at the entrance of l1 was around 7 0 7 5 oxidation of mn2 was not expected to be significant from the pyrolusite filter onwards mn remained below 50 μg l and was not deemed of concern arsenic as was removed basically in the pyrolusite filter 28 37 and especially in the feooh filter 64 92 regardless the application of prechlorination fig 3b in both cases the final average concentration of as was 2 0 μg l well below the threshold of 10 μg l set by the eu directive 2020 2184 pyrolusite has been reported to remove both as iii through oxidation followed by precipitation as mn3 aso4 2 s and as v through electrostatic processes 37 the removal of as iii and as v by feooh has been described to occur by binding of as iii and as v oxyanions on iron oxides via surface complexation and or ligand exchange process 11 the application of naclo results in a rapid oxidation of as iii to as v 22 and therefore the effect of naclo on as removal would depend on the relative adsorption of as iii and as v on feooh according to the manufacturer the feooh used in this study commercialized under the name of bayoxide e33 exhibits a high similar sorption capacity for both as species comparable sorption extents of as iii and as v on different forms of iron oxides magnetite goethite have also been reported 38 this explained why as removal was similar under both non prechlorination and prechlorination scenarios unlike mn and as nh4 removal appeared to be affected by the addition of naclo under the non prechlorination scenario nh4 concentration was seen to remain unaltered through the pyrolusite and gac filters fig 3c the removal of nh4 in l1 took place in the zeolite filter where nh4 concentration was lowered from 1 1 mg l to 0 6 mg l removal of almost 50 the removal was due to ion exchange with the na of the na form zeolite and as expected was accompanied by an increase in na concentration fig 3d the unbalance between retained nh4 ions and released na ions clearly pointed out that other cations were exchanged by the zeolite in fact profiles of ca2 and mg2 fig 3d and e respectively made evident that they were also exchanged and at higher extents than nh4 a balance between charges of retained ions nh4 ca2 and mg2 and of released ions na showed a difference 5 highlighting that these were the major ions involved in the exchange published studies report adsorption of nh4 onto zeolite but at higher nh4 concentrations up to 300 mg l much higher than 1 mg l of this study and with no or lower concentrations of competiting ions e g 90 mg l na 39 40 or after chemical or physical modifications of zeolite to enhance nh4 sorption 41 even being far away from these favourable conditions in this study nh4 sorption onto zeolite was quite remarkable under chlorination conditions a moderate decrease in nh4 concentration 21 from 1 8 mg l to 1 5 mg l was observed over the first pyrolusite and second gac filters this decrease was due to the reaction between nh4 and clo to form chloramines nh2cl nhcl3 and ncl3 minor adsorption of nh4 onto gac has also been reported 42 nevertheless the major removal of nh4 under prechlorination conditions was again in the zeolite filter with a nh4 removal of 91 from 1 5 mg l to 0 1 mg l it is worth noting that for occasional sampling events nh4 concentrations were observed to surprisingly increase after the zeolite unit a careful examination of the monitoring plan detected that these occasional increases coincided with samplings conducted just after regeneration the zeolite filters suggesting that nh4 was present in pore water in the filters when filtration resumed after a regeneration event these samplings were pooled apart in fig 2 to better visualize these increases in nh4 concentration the undesired washing out of nh4 was corrected by discarding the pore water collected just after each regeneration step values of anions so4 2 hco3 concentrations and conductivity remained fairly constant along l1 not shown with the exception of cl which will be discussed later 3 1 3 removal of organic matter and its fluorescent components in l1 fig 4 shows the profile of doc a and of the fluorescent doc protein like compounds b and fulvic like compounds c along l1 the content of each fluorescent component was tracked using its maximum fluorescence intensity fmax which gives an estimation of the relative concentration of the component doc was moderately removed by 33 and 29 without and with prechlorination basically in the gac filter undoubtedly through adsorption 26 43 the extent of doc removal by gac strongly depends on gac properties and dom nature 24 25 making comparison between studies difficult the doc removal observed in this study with gac chemivall cg900 compared well to that of reported by ponce robles et al 44 also using the same gac 25 prechlorination did not seem to enhance doc removal it is known that chlorination as any other oxidation process can break large molecular weight dom into smaller and less aromatic organic fragments which may exhibit different sorptive behaviour 26 27 however this difference was not observed in this study concerning the fdoc fractions average fmax for both protein and fulvic like substances also decreased basically in the gac filter fig 3b and c under non prechlorination conditions the decrease of fmax was around 35 for protein like compounds and 57 for fulvic like compounds while under prechlorination conditions fmax maintained around 35 for protein like compounds and decreased to 48 for fulvic like compounds removal percentages seemed to indicate a slight preference of gac towards fulvic like compounds over protein like compounds similar findings are reported by maqbool et al 32 who concluded that pre oxidation of natural water with naclo but also kmno4 and o3 preferentially decreased humic like fluorescence over that of protein like and justified it on the basis that humic like aromatic structures were more prone to chemical oxidation than the large molecular weight biopolymers including protein like components similar patterns are reported by lavonen et al 31 3 1 4 removal of microorganisms in l1 microbiological analysis showed that microbiological quality of raw and l1 treated water was not to be of concern as contents of coliforms e coli legionella and nematodes were very low or undetectable in raw water and mostly undetectable in the l1 treated water with occasional detections of very low counts even without prechlorination table 3 in all cases quality of treated water met with regard to microbiological parameters the quality stated by the legislation for reuse water spanish rd 1620 2007 and drinking water eu directive 2020 2184 as expected only heterotrophs were detected in all sampling events as heterotrophs are usually more abundant but they were also detected at low to very low contents and were not of concern either under non prechlorination conditions it was observed that counts of heterotrophs in the treated water were occasionally higher than that in raw water table 3 this was attributed to malfunction of the backwashing system in the feooh filter during the first weeks of operation which likely resulted in regrowth in the filter and occasional high counts in the effluent once the problem was fixed the backwash could be applied as planned despite this two additional campaigns during non prechlorination and prechlorination periods were carried out to get insight into changes in heterotrophs counts along the treatment lines the profiles obtained in these sampling events fig 5 showed that regrowth apparently took indeed place in the gac filter under non prechlorination conditions and in the gac and zeolite filters under prechlorination conditions but also that the regrowth was localised to these filters and that heterotrophs counts decreased towards the exit of l1 colonization of gac filters with controlled releases of microorganisms by backwashing has been reported in drinking water treatment 45 3 2 performance of the ro membrane based line l2 3 2 1 profile of fcr and ph in l2 fig 6 shows the changes in ph and fcr along l2 unlike in l1 no preacidification was applied in l2 as ro was expected to act as a complete barrier for any remaining microorganism ph maintained around 7 2 8 0 across the first two filters dual media and pyrolusite and decreased to 6 5 after the acidification applied ahead the ro unit to prevent scaling ph of the osmotized water rose to around 7 0 7 5 by the passage through the calcite filter where water was remineralized with calcite under non prechlorination conditions fcr remained as expected under detection limit until the exit of the pilot when fcr increased to 0 6 mg l by post chlorination under prechlorination conditions cfr averaged 1 4 mg l at the exit of dual media filter and 0 7 mg l at the exit of the pyrolusite filter as in l1 the consumption of fcr in these two filters was due to the chlorine demand by metals organic matter ammonia the level of fcr dropped to virtually 0 by the application of metabisulphite ahead the ro unit to protect the membranes depletion of chlorine is essential because polymeric membranes may be severely damaged by chlorine even in low concentrations 46 orp measured just ahead of ro was always in the range of 150 250 mv which is below the maximum value of ca 300 mv recommended by ro membrane manufacturers to ensure integrity of polyamide membranes 47 again the fcr finally increased to around 0 6 mg l at the exit of l2 due to postchlorination 3 2 2 removal of inorganic ions in l2 profiles of concentrations along l2 resembled for almost all species values hardly changed across the first filters but totally dropped after the ro unit this was expected as ro membranes act as a total barrier for most solutes 14 mn was the solute that most differed from this general behaviour it was mostly removed in the dual media filter up to 35 and in the pyrolusite filter up to 96 showing that these filters preceding the ro unit were already able to remove mn to levels around 10 μg l below the maximum admissible concentration the application of naclo seemed to hinder the removal in the dual media filter but pyrolusite was able to lower the mn concentrations at the same level as it did without prechlorination the removal mechanism was the same as discussed for l1 remaining mn2 after the passage of the pyrolusite filter was totally removed 99 by the ro membrane the low concentration of mn maintained until the exit of l1 arsenic as was not removed at all by the dual filter but partially removed by the pyrolusite filter 15 45 to concentrations 4 μg l the removal mechanism was the same as discussed for l1 the remaining as was then completely removed by ro providing a concentration at the exit of 0 1 μg l far below the limit established by the eu directive 2020 2184 the total removal of as by the polyamide active layer of the ro membrane was an indication that as iii was totally oxidized to as v in the form of h2aso4 as it is only when as is present as as iii mainly in the form of the non charged species h3aso3 that it is only partially rejected by ro membranes 48 concentration of nh4 hardly changed across dual media and pyrolusite filters a slight decrease was observed when naclo was injected due to the formation of chloramines but completely 99 by the ro unit concentration at the exit was 0 1 mg l again well below the threshold set by the eu directive 2020 2184 ions other than the target ones na mg2 k si ni2 cu2 cl so4 2 behaved as expected they crossed unaltered the first two filters but were highly removed 95 99 by the ro unit not shown worth mentioning are the profiles of ions ca2 and hco3 which increased their concentration after the passage through the last filter due to calcite dissolution fig 7d and e and b which was only partially removed 48 by ro fig 7f difficulties in removing b by ro membranes have been largely reported the reason of this difficulty is that at neutral ph b is found mainly as h3bo3 which is a small non polar molecule and as such not well retained by polyamide based ro membranes 49 3 2 3 removal of organic matter in l2 doc and its fluorescent components showed similar profiles along l1 without and with prechlorination they were hardly removed by the dual media and pyrolusite filters 5 and highly or totally removed by the ro unit 75 90 for doc and 99 for both the protein like and humic like components fig 8 as solute size is an important factor governing its removal by ro it can be inferred that fdoc contained a higher content of larger organic molecules than doc this would be in agreement with the statement that oxidation and consequent splitting of large molecular weight nom results into less fluorescent smaller fragments 50 published studies have also reported high removals of doc 92 with low molecular weight acid compounds partially permeating through the ro membrane 51 and protein like and humic like compounds 33 by ro membranes 3 2 4 removal of microorganisms in l2 microbiological analysis of l2 treated water showed that contents of coliforms e coli legionella and nematodes were undetectable under both non prechlorination and prechlorination conditions only coliforms were occasionally detected at very low counts table 3 in all cases quality of treated water met the quality stated by the european legislation for drinking water directive 2020 2184 3 3 formation of disinfection by products dbps in l1 and l2 it is well acknowledged that water chlorination poses the additional risk of promoting the formation of dbps the eu directive 2020 2184 sets a threshold for the sum of trihalomethanes chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl chbr3 of 100 μg l for a water to be drinkable in our study l1 treated and l2 treated water both without and with prechlorination showed thms contents always 5 0 μg l and therefore the formation of dbps was not considered of concern these low values even under pre chlorination conditions were likely favoured by 1 the fairly low content of doc in ugw and therefore the low potential formation of dbps 2 the low content of br in ugw 0 5 mg l see table 1 and therefore the low formation of brominated thms which are reported to be less rejected by ro than chlorinated thms 52 3 the removal of formed dbps along l1 particularly in the gac filter by adsorption 24 and l2 in the ro unit 53 and or 4 the lower propensity of chloromines to form dbps in comparison to chlorine 30 3 4 quality of produced water and potential for reuse table 4 compares the quality of treated water by lines l1 and l2 without and with prechlorination with the quality of water for reuse and drinking water purposes specified by the spanish rd 1620 2007 and the eu directive 2020 2184 respectively for water reuse maximum allowed contents are given as ranges because the rd 1620 2007 differentiates up to 14 uses under five main areas urban agricultural irrigation industrial recreational and environmental each with its own threshold s as can be seen in table 4 treated water by both l1 and l2 accomplished the quality required regarding microbiological and chemical parameters for all reuse purposes tabulated in the rd 1620 2007 even for the most stringent one i e irrigation of crops using a system whereby reclaimed water comes into direct contact with edible parts of crops to be eaten raw therefore treated water can be considered suitable for urban agricultural industrial recreational and environmental purposes treated water also fulfils the spanish rd 817 2015 on the status of surface waters and environmental quality standards actually 1 of the ugw pumped from the parking lot is already used for urban and environmental uses street washing and gardening and streamflow augmentation in the besòs river it should be taken in mind that specific industrial sectors may require more stringent thresholds that those stipulated in the rd 1620 2007 and therefore quality of reclaimed water should be determined on a case by case basis for instance an important parameter in textile industry is the content of fe which must be kept at low levels comparable to those for drinking water 54 other industrial sectors that may require high quality waters with low concentration of dissolved species e g dissolved solids doc are the micro electronics pharmaceuticals and food and beverage also boiler feed water for steam turbines usually requires quality comparable to that of drinking water 55 cl has recently received attention as a species of concern in reclaimed water after removal of mandatory components pathogens micropollutants dissolved solids 56 cl has multiple harmful effects on water reuse including crop yield loss at concentrations above 180 mg l in irrigation water soil salinization at contents above 200 mg kg in soil equipment corrosion and incrustations problems and limitations of the final product quality making necessary concentrations below 250 mg l in recirculating cooling water for boilers wash water and process water or even below 2 mg l in water for electrolysis and electronics industries 56 and references therein if that was not enough cl is difficult to remove and it can even increase along a treatment train through processes that involve chlorine acidification with hcl oxidation with naclo in our pilot an increase of cl occurred in l1 caused by the preacidification with hcl and prechlorination with naclo fig 9a but not in l2 where ro removed cl almost totally fig 9b this resulted in concentrations in l1 treated water around 310 mg l for cl and 280 mg l for na with and without prechlorination in bold in table 4 that might make it unsuitable for very high quality water requiring purposes although drinking water production was not targeted at this stage of the project it can be added that treated water by l2 with and without prechlorination and l1 only with prechlorination accomplished the eu directive 2020 2184 on drinking water with regards to targeted species of this study mn as nh4 doc and pathogens with values far below the thresholds of 50 μg l for mn 10 μg l for as 0 5 mg l for nh4 with the exception of nh4 in line l1 when operated without prechlorination for which the concentration in the produced water was 1 0 mg l therefore and with the exception of the latter scenario the possibility of producing drinking water could be considered if needed 3 5 cost estimation of produced water through lines l1 and l2 costs of treated water production were calculated considering the following items capital cost site preparation design construction mobilization and installation of the pilot piping and electricity distribution system etc treatment materials filtering media and ro membranes reagents dosage energy consumption and maintenance 3 of total cost personnel salary and legal fees were not included all capital cost components were amortized over the design life of the pilot plant which was assumed to be 12 years the lifetime of filtering media and ro membranes was considered to be 2 and 5 years respectively costs were calculated differentiating the two operation conditions tested i e without and with prechlorination the reagents applied were hcl nacl and naclo for postchlorination and optionally for prechlorination for l1 and antiscalant metabisulphite hcl and naclo for postchlorination and optionally for prechlorination for l2 with regard to energy cost the power consumption of each electric device pumps to move water through the lines dosing pumps backwashing pumps sensors and its operation time were used an electricity tariff of 0 2876 kwh average between september 2021 and april 2022 was considered a cost breakdown expressing costs per cubic metre of water produced is presented in table 5 as shown in table 5 the total cost of produced water without prechlorination was 0 896 m3 for l1 and 0 968 m3 for l2 these costs increased to 0 928 m3 for l1 and 1 027 m3 for l2 under prechlorination conditions due to the continuous addition of naclo differences in cost of produced water between l1 and l2 were thus of 8 10 the cost values for produced water through l1 and l2 compared well with those reported by other studies applying advanced treatments microfiltration ultrafiltration gac reverse osmosis at pilot scale 1 16 m3 by 57 0 85 m3 by 58 these values however should be viewed as an estimation when extrapolating the results observed in this study to long term operation periods first because the quality of raw ugw may change and so the lifetime of filtering media and ro membrane second the electricity tariff can largely change between countries and also along the year furthermore it can be added that applying the same treatment trains at higher scale can modify costs since plant capacity affects capital costs through economies of scale and related to this larger plants offer the possibility of introducing energy recovery units allowing to decrease energy consumption by up to 50 however the analysis allowed to identify the items that most contributed to the final cost of treated water in this study the major contributors to the total cost for l1 were the filtering media replacement 33 and the reagents dosed 28 while for l2 it was the energy consumption 41 mostly coming from the booster pump for the ro filtration another aspect that helps explain the higher cost for l2 is that amount of produced water is lower than in l1 as ro in l2 converts only a fraction in this study 60 of the incoming water into produced water 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated that reclamation of ugw from sant adrià del besòs has a huge potential for reuse for a wide diversity of final purposes urban agricultural industrial environmental and recreational uses and although it may need further exploration likely for drinking water purposes the ugw was treated through two treatment lines both based on advanced treatments line l1 included different sorption and ion exchange filters while line l2 relied on a sorption filter and a ro filtration step both lines were operated without and with prechlorination to ascertain whether naclo favoured or hindered and to what extent the removal of target parameters mn as nh4 doc pathogens thms l1 was successful at removing mn as pathogens and thms at levels below those stipulated by the rd 1620 2007 for reuse and even those by the eu directive 2020 2184 for drinking water without and with prechlorination only nh4 failed to decrease below its threshold limits but only in the absence of prechlorination when naclo was applied also nh4 met the limit for reuse and drinking water it must be bear in mind that for specific industrial uses requiring high quality reclaimed water additional specific ones beyond the mandatory parameters set by the legislation on reuse and drinking water may need to be removed in that regard cl and na may appear as problematic species l2 showed a consistent high removal of all targeted parameters also nh4 without and with prechlorination conditions producing a finished water with excellent quality with high potential for reuse and also for production of drinking water the outperformance of l2 in terms of produced water quality must be balanced by the cost 0 896 m3 without prechlorination and 0 928 m3 with prechlorination for l1 and 0 968 m3 without prechlorination and 1 027 m3 with prechlorination for l2 meaning that a trade off between quality and cost must be faced if solutes concentrations in the produced water do not need to be reduced to an excessively low level then less costly l1 may suffice intermediate solution could be achieved by blending l1 and l2 treated waters if the resulting quality already matches the one required according to its final intended purpose declaration of

keywords pdo zno nanocomposite photocatalysis antibacterial optical memory cytotoxicity test data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the problem of water pollution is becoming increasingly prominent due to the widespread destruction of the ecological environment 1 according to world health organization statistics 2 3 200 million cases of diarrhea are caused by water pollution worldwide every year and 200 000 people annually lose their lives due to diarrheal disease caused by e coli 4 pathogenic microorganisms in the water are an important source of pollution and cause devastating diseases among humans 5 this has led to the employment of various disinfection technologies over the past few decades including ultraviolet disinfection technology 6 chlorine disinfection technology 7 ozone disinfection technology 8 pulsed laser irradiation technique 9 and antibiotic 10 treatments however traditional disinfection methods have certain disadvantages such as the emission of secondary pollution and by products 11 13 the novel disinfection method of photocatalysis has recently received extensive attention in the field of sewage treatment due to its clean efficient and non toxic characteristics 14 18 zno nanomaterial stands out from the many photocatalysts due to its chemical stability excellent photosensitivity and economically competitive photocatalytic activity 19 21 because of its unique biocompatibility it has become one of the most promising semiconductors for numerous applications such as wastewater treatment and biological research however the application of zno as a photocatalyst in wastewater treatment is greatly limited by its shortcomings of fast photo induced carrier recombination poor stability and low light utilization 22 24 the modification of zno nanomaterials has become an important means of improving their photocatalytic activity modification methods include metal and nonmetal doping or modification 25 27 noble metal deposition 28 and semiconductor coupling 29 among these methods metal modification is popular because of its low cost and simple synthesis method 30 in a previous report pradeev et al 31 synthesized mg zno using co precipitation and verified the antibacterial activity via disk diffusion which resulted in a significant improvement in photocatalytic activity panchal et al 32 used green synthesis to synthesize ag zno finding that the material was able to kill bacteria with a density of 108 cfu ml within 15 min and could also degrade 94 27 of 10 ppm methylene blue dye within 120 min as a noble metal with an spr effect and excellent electron absorption ability pd is also widely used in the modification of metal oxides for example du et al 33 synthesized pd tio2 using the sol gel hydrothermal method and found that it can greatly improve the photocatalytic activity of tio2 then intaphong et al 34 successfully synthesized pd zno via sonochemical deposition and found that the modified zno had a greatly enhanced ability to degrade methyl blue and methyl orange as a new development trend in the field of photocatalysis the photocatalytic memory effect was first proposed by li 35 in 2008 referring to the enhancement of the bactericidal effect of nanomaterials under light and darkness through the storage and release of electrons 36 subsequently a series of photocatalytic memory systems were established including wo3 g c3n4 37 g c3n4 v2o5 38 and ag tion 39 et al among these materials pdo is considered to have a good optoelectronic memory in a subsequent report li 40 used an atomic force microscope afm and in situ x ray photoelectron spectroscopy in situ xps to observe the surface charge distribution of tion pdo and study changes in its chemical state under visible light illumination obtaining clear evidence of charge flow to from pdo nanoparticles on visible light photocatalytic substrates meanwhile a certain bacterial inhibition effect was confirmed for tion pdo after the cessation of light exposure thus far the optical memory effect of pdo has been fully confirmed by material characterization and bacterial inhibition experiments in summary the compounding of pdo with zno contributes to the photocatalytic performance of zno and may also have optical memory properties in this paper pd zno nanomaterials were successfully synthesized using a solvothermal method subsequently pdo zno was synthesized by continuing calcination of pd zno the two materials synthesized were characterized and probed for photocatalytic antibacterial properties the photocatalytic bactericidal mechanism biocompatibility and optical memory effect of pdo zno were investigated the prepared pdo zno not only has superior photocatalytic properties compared to pd zno but also has good biocompatibility and optical memory effect our work provides a potentially non toxic photocatalyst for the inactivation of bacteria under light on and light off conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of the pd zno nanomaterials pd zno was synthesized via the solvothermal method 41 0 15 m of zncl2 was thoroughly dissolved in 15 ml of absolute ethanol with magnetic stirring subsequently pdcl2 with different molar ratios was added to 15 ml of absolute ethanol and subjected to ultrasound for 30 min 0 8 g of naoh was thoroughly dissolved in 30 ml of absolute ethanol with magnetic stirring then the pdcl2 solution was added dropwise to the zncl2 solution to obtain a mixed solution after the mixture was fully stirred the pre ultrasonic naoh solution was added dropwise to the mixed solution after fully stirring the mixture the final mixed solution was transferred to a 100 ml reaction kettle the hydrothermal reaction was carried out at a temperature of 80 c for 2 h finally after the reaction kettle had cooled down the precipitate was extracted washed three times with distilled water and ethanol each time and dried at 60 c for 12 h taking 3 pd as an example this experiment was an attempt to optimize the synthesis conditions of the material and compare its photocatalytic bactericidal performance with that of pure zno the optimization conditions of the material synthesis were as follows after the pd zno synthesized according to the procedure described above was dried it was carefully ground to a powder in a mortar four 3 pd zno samples of the same mass were then weighed and calcined at 150 c 250 c 350 c and 450 c respectively for 2 h after calcination the mass was ground in a mortar after cooling to room temperature and stored in 5 ml centrifuge tubes to prepare for the experiments 2 2 photocatalyst characterization the crystal structure and crystallinity of the materials were measured by xrd d8 advance germany their crystal structure and nanoscale morphology were characterized by tem jem 2100 japan and sem jsm 7001f japan and their elemental composition and chemical valence was characterized by xps escalab 250 us ultra violet and visible spectrophotometer uv vis u3900h japan was used to judge their light absorption intensity and steady state spectrofluorometer pl 930 n shanghai was used to evaluate the recombination efficiency of the electrons and holes esr jeol japan was used to detect the type and intensity of the free radicals produced during the disinfection process at room temperature 2 3 photocatalytic antibacterial properties test in this experiment e coli k12 was used as the target strain to explore the antibacterial effect of the pd zno nanocomposites before and after calcination in visible light the experimental light source produced visible light at wavelengths of 420 780 nm and the illumination intensity was 30 mw cm2 the initial bacterial concentration on the small plate was 2 107 cfu ml and the concentration of the material used in the experiment was 1 mg ml bacterial suspension 2 4 optical memory antibacterial test of 3 pd zno 350 c to study the light memory effect of the photocatalytic nanomaterials 3 pd zno 350 c powder samples were evenly dispersed on small plates and then exposed to light for 2 h at an intensity of 30 mw cm2 after the light exposure ceased an antibacterial test was carried out in the dark with a concentration of 1 mg ml of the nanomaterial system e coli k12 was used as the target strain in the antibacterial experiment 2 5 in vitro cytotoxicity ht22 was cultured in the logarithmic phase 100 μl 104 cells ml at 37 c with 5 co2 after inoculation in 96 well plates pdo zno nanomaterials with different concentrations namely 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mg ml were added to the experimental group and the control group received the same amount of pbs buffer 10 μl cck 8 reagent was added and fresh medium was used to replace the original medium after the above experimental and control groups had been cultured for 24 or 48 h the above mixture was re cultured for 4 h at 37 c finally the absorbance of the mixed solution was measured using a microplate reader imark microplate reader bio rad usa to judge cell activity the experiment was repeated three times for each group and the results were analyzed statistically results were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization fig 1a shows the xrd patterns of pd zno nanocomposites with various ratios synthesized at 80 c for 2 h the 2θ peaks at 31 7 34 4 36 2 47 5 56 6 62 8 and 66 3 respectively correspond to the crystal planes 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 3 and 2 0 0 in the characteristic diffraction peak of zno jcpds no 05 0681 which indicates the formation of a hexagonal wurtzite structure 42 43 in the sample the 2θ peak at 40 1 corresponds to the 1 1 1 crystal plane in the characteristic diffraction peak of pd jcpds no 46 1043 we found that with an increasing amount of pd the diffraction peak of pd changed from weak to strong however there was no elemental peak in 0 3 pd zno which may be due to low pd content compared with pure zno the position of the main peak of the zno in all the samples did not change significantly thus the presence of pd did not change the crystal structure of zno and pd decorated zno nanocomposites were synthesized the pl spectra of pd zno with different ratios are shown in fig s1 through the spectra it can be found that the pl intensity of 3 pd zno is the lowest which indicates the highest separation of electrons and holes among all ratios 44 next the calcination experiment will continue on 3 pd zno xrd patterns of the 3 pd zno at different calcination temperatures are shown in fig 1b the diffraction peak at 40 1 corresponds to palladium which is found at a calcination temperature of 150 c the zno diffraction peaks did not change significantly when the calcination temperature rose however the intensity of the diffraction peaks was obviously enhanced 45 it is clearly observed that the diffraction peak of pd weakened and then disappeared the disappeared pd may have transformed into palladium oxide fig s2a and fig s2c show the full xps spectra of the 3 pd zno and 3 pd zno 350 c nanocomposites respectively both nanocomposites contain three elements zn 2p pd 3d and o 1s fig s2b shows the high resolution pd 3d xps spectrum in fig s2b the pd has two fitted peaks at 334 9 ev and 340 1 ev corresponding to pd 3d5 2 and pd 3d3 2 of the pd element respectively indicating that the pd in the composite material existed as pd0 without the presence of pdo 46 in fig s2d the two fitted peaks at 336 6 ev and 342 2 ev correspond to pd 3d5 2 and pd 3d3 2 of pdo 47 and no characteristic peak of palladium can be seen proving that the pd zno calcined and probably transformed its existing pd0 to pdo fig 2 shows the high resolution pd 3d spectra of pd zno at different calcination temperatures the diffraction peak of pd shifts to the left with an increase in calcination temperature this means that the calcination of pd in the material is a process of electron loss which is important evidence of the transition from pd to pdo the high resolution o 1s spectra of pd zno at various calcination temperatures can be observed in fig s3 the position of the xps peak of o does not vary considerably as the calcination temperature fig 3a and b respectively show tem and high resolution tem images of 3 pd zno before calcination by measuring the lattice spacing from the high resolution spectrum it is not difficult to see that zno crystals and pd existed in the materials synthesized without calcination whereby the lattice spacings of 0 28 nm and 0 22 nm correspond to the 1 0 0 crystal plane of the characteristic diffraction peaks of zno and the 1 1 1 crystal plane of the characteristic diffraction peaks of pd respectively this result is consistent with previous findings from xrd 48 49 the tem and high resolution tem spectra of 3 pd zno after calcination are mapped in fig 3c and d respectively as shown in fig 3d we can also confirm the existence of the zno crystal and the pdo by measuring the lattice distance the lattice spacings are 0 19 nm and 0 26 nm which correspond to the 1 0 2 crystal plane of the characteristic diffraction peaks of zno and the 1 0 1 crystal plane of the characteristic diffraction peaks of pdo respectively in general the original pd in the material will be eliminated after the calcination of pd zno the visible light absorption spectra of the pd zno before and after calcination was observed by uv vis and are shown in fig 4a and b it can be seen from fig 4a that the optical absorption intensity of pd zno in the visible light region of 300 780 nm is much higher than that of pure zno in this wavelength range indicating that the modification of pd successfully broadened the photoresponse range of zno 50 51 meanwhile the light absorption range of pd zno composites also gradually increased with a continuous increase in pd content as shown in fig 4b the uv vis spectra of pd zno samples calcined at different temperatures reveal that the material exhibited the best light absorption performance when the calcination temperature was 150 c 52 3 2 photocatalytic antibacterial properties for pd zno zhang et al investigated its bactericidal performance as shown in table s1 results showed that pd zno had excellent photocatalytic performance under uv light and could kill all e coli with a bacterial concentration of 1 5 109 cfu l within 0 5 h like this khalil et al demonstrated that pd zno could kill all bacteria with an initial concentration of 4 1010 cfu l under uv light irradiation with a light intensity of 1500 mw our study extends the bactericidal performance of pd zno under visible light conditions fig 5a shows the bactericidal curve of the non calcified pd zno samples with different proportions 3 pd zno had the strongest bactericidal effect against e coli compared with the pd zno nanomaterials with other proportions almost all the 2 107 cfu ml bacteria were inactivated by 3 pd zno after 3 h the bactericidal curve of the 3 pd zno sample at different calcination temperatures is shown in fig 5b pd zno calcinated at 350 c exhibited the best bactericidal performance killing all the bacteria after 1 5 h other calcination temperatures do not guarantee this high level of antibacterial performance we found that the calcination of the pd zno nanomaterials significantly improved their bactericidal performance veziroglu s research 53 has shown that pdo has a good electron trapping effect which can improve the photocatalytic efficiency of photocatalysts by reducing the efficiency of electron hole complexation in photocatalysts the pl profiles of the 3 pd zno before and after calcination were analyzed as shown in fig s4 the degree of electron hole separation in pd zno both before and after calcination was significantly higher than that of pure zno 54 55 and was highest after calcination which indicated that the separation ability of electrons and holes gradually increases by calcination 56 58 and the lower the height of the peaks in the pl profiles the better the bactericidal effect 59 the results of xrd xps and tem testing prove that the forms of pd existing in the composite before and after calcination were pd0 and pdo respectively therefore it can be concluded that the photocatalytic efficiency of the composite is enhanced because of the conversion of pd0 to pdo by calcination 60 61 the xrd measurements of the different ratios of pd zno calcined at 350 c are shown in fig s5 the position of the zno diffraction peak did not change with the addition of pd although it gradually became wider as the addition increased the strongest uv absorption was obtained when the addition of pd was 3 the uv vis data shown in fig s6 indicate that the best sterilization performance of 3 pd zno 350 c can be demonstrated by the sterilization experiment shown in fig s7 as shown in fig 6 3 pd zno 350 c exhibited remarkable photocatalytic memory properties manifesting within 1 h after light exposure ended whereby e coli with an initial concentration of 1 105 cfu ml were completely killed as shown in fig 7 3 pd zno 350 c generates a significant amount of oh and o2 when exposed to a light source which is the main cause of cell damage and apoptosis in the work of li et al 62 the types of free radicals in au zno pd nanocomposite catalysts under visible light conditions were investigated and it was also found that the free radicals generated by the samples were mainly oh and o2 after light exposure ended the material still produced a certain amount of free radicals for 20 min although the intensity was reduced compared to when the material was exposed to the light source in combination with the results of the bactericidal tests in fig 7 this indicates that the material was still capable of harming e coli cells through oh and o2 production 63 and demonstrated a certain optical memory effect this had a positive impact on improving the overall effectiveness of the photocatalytic bactericidal activity the cell morphology of e coli before and after the photocatalytic treatment was observed by scanning electron microscopy as shown in fig 8 it is worth noting that before the non photocatalytic treatment the morphology of the cells is full their surface is smooth and the cells are in a good active state in contrast after the photocatalytic treatment the cells appear sunken folded and even broken with deeper pores on their outer surfaces moreover the cells are disorganized and internal material can be seen flowing out of the cells the mechanism of cell death by photocatalytic materials has also been investigated in the study by aponiene et al 64 who found that cell death is closely linked to the disruption of bacterial membrane structure and maruthupandy et al 65 also investigated the mechanism of cell death and found that cell death is accompanied by membrane contraction and loss of viability both of which are consistent with our study the magnitude of the effect of a material on the activity of mammalian cells is an important factor in testing its level of toxicity 66 in this experiment the effect of 3 pdo zno on ht22 cells was investigated as shown in fig 9 when various concentrations of pdo zno 0 2 mg ml 0 4 mg ml 0 6 mg ml 0 8 mg ml were applied to the cells the cell to cell survival rate did not change significantly and remained high around 100 this indicates that the material has a non toxic effect on ht22 cells in ali s research 67 on the cytotoxicity of zno cells it was pointed out that zno has extremely high biocompatibility through the cytotoxicity experiments of pdo zno it was demonstrated that zno s biocompatibility persisted even after doping thus pdo zno is expected to be an environmentally friendly catalyst with non toxicity and high catalytic activity 4 conclusion in summary pd zno and pdo zno nanocomposites were synthesized the xrd and xps results show that the composite of pd changes to pdo after calcination the antibacterial experiment demonstrates that pdo zno has double the bactericidal efficiency of pd zno reducing the time necessary for bacterial inactivation from 3 h to 1 5 h pdo zno has a good light memory effect as proven by esr testing and an optical memory sterilization test the oh and o2 signal was still detected 20 min after the light exposure ended and bacteria can be killed furthermore sem tests show that the disinfection effect involved the disruption of the bacteria s cellular structure in addition the non toxicity of pdo zno was further demonstrated through an investigation of the magnitude of its effect on ht22 cells declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest

transmission electron microscope tem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps tests showed that pd was converted to pdo in the process of calcination the photocatalytic sterilization experiment showed that in the 3 pd zno system 2 107 cfu ml of e coli was completely killed within 3 h while 3 pdo zno took 1 5 h in electron spin resonance esr tests on pdo zno the oh and o2 signals can be detected

keywords pdo zno nanocomposite photocatalysis antibacterial optical memory cytotoxicity test data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the problem of water pollution is becoming increasingly prominent due to the widespread destruction of the ecological environment 1 according to world health organization statistics 2 3 200 million cases of diarrhea are caused by water pollution worldwide every year and 200 000 people annually lose their lives due to diarrheal disease caused by e coli 4 pathogenic microorganisms in the water are an important source of pollution and cause devastating diseases among humans 5 this has led to the employment of various disinfection technologies over the past few decades including ultraviolet disinfection technology 6 chlorine disinfection technology 7 ozone disinfection technology 8 pulsed laser irradiation technique 9 and antibiotic 10 treatments however traditional disinfection methods have certain disadvantages such as the emission of secondary pollution and by products 11 13 the novel disinfection method of photocatalysis has recently received extensive attention in the field of sewage treatment due to its clean efficient and non toxic characteristics 14 18 zno nanomaterial stands out from the many photocatalysts due to its chemical stability excellent photosensitivity and economically competitive photocatalytic activity 19 21 because of its unique biocompatibility it has become one of the most promising semiconductors for numerous applications such as wastewater treatment and biological research however the application of zno as a photocatalyst in wastewater treatment is greatly limited by its shortcomings of fast photo induced carrier recombination poor stability and low light utilization 22 24 the modification of zno nanomaterials has become an important means of improving their photocatalytic activity modification methods include metal and nonmetal doping or modification 25 27 noble metal deposition 28 and semiconductor coupling 29 among these methods metal modification is popular because of its low cost and simple synthesis method 30 in a previous report pradeev et al 31 synthesized mg zno using co precipitation and verified the antibacterial activity via disk diffusion which resulted in a significant improvement in photocatalytic activity panchal et al 32 used green synthesis to synthesize ag zno finding that the material was able to kill bacteria with a density of 108 cfu ml within 15 min and could also degrade 94 27 of 10 ppm methylene blue dye within 120 min as a noble metal with an spr effect and excellent electron absorption ability pd is also widely used in the modification of metal oxides for example du et al 33 synthesized pd tio2 using the sol gel hydrothermal method and found that it can greatly improve the photocatalytic activity of tio2 then intaphong et al 34 successfully synthesized pd zno via sonochemical deposition and found that the modified zno had a greatly enhanced ability to degrade methyl blue and methyl orange as a new development trend in the field of photocatalysis the photocatalytic memory effect was first proposed by li 35 in 2008 referring to the enhancement of the bactericidal effect of nanomaterials under light and darkness through the storage and release of electrons 36 subsequently a series of photocatalytic memory systems were established including wo3 g c3n4 37 g c3n4 v2o5 38 and ag tion 39 et al among these materials pdo is considered to have a good optoelectronic memory in a subsequent report li 40 used an atomic force microscope afm and in situ x ray photoelectron spectroscopy in situ xps to observe the surface charge distribution of tion pdo and study changes in its chemical state under visible light illumination obtaining clear evidence of charge flow to from pdo nanoparticles on visible light photocatalytic substrates meanwhile a certain bacterial inhibition effect was confirmed for tion pdo after the cessation of light exposure thus far the optical memory effect of pdo has been fully confirmed by material characterization and bacterial inhibition experiments in summary the compounding of pdo with zno contributes to the photocatalytic performance of zno and may also have optical memory properties in this paper pd zno nanomaterials were successfully synthesized using a solvothermal method subsequently pdo zno was synthesized by continuing calcination of pd zno the two materials synthesized were characterized and probed for photocatalytic antibacterial properties the photocatalytic bactericidal mechanism biocompatibility and optical memory effect of pdo zno were investigated the prepared pdo zno not only has superior photocatalytic properties compared to pd zno but also has good biocompatibility and optical memory effect our work provides a potentially non toxic photocatalyst for the inactivation of bacteria under light on and light off conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of the pd zno nanomaterials pd zno was synthesized via the solvothermal method 41 0 15 m of zncl2 was thoroughly dissolved in 15 ml of absolute ethanol with magnetic stirring subsequently pdcl2 with different molar ratios was added to 15 ml of absolute ethanol and subjected to ultrasound for 30 min 0 8 g of naoh was thoroughly dissolved in 30 ml of absolute ethanol with magnetic stirring then the pdcl2 solution was added dropwise to the zncl2 solution to obtain a mixed solution after the mixture was fully stirred the pre ultrasonic naoh solution was added dropwise to the mixed solution after fully stirring the mixture the final mixed solution was transferred to a 100 ml reaction kettle the hydrothermal reaction was carried out at a temperature of 80 c for 2 h finally after the reaction kettle had cooled down the precipitate was extracted washed three times with distilled water and ethanol each time and dried at 60 c for 12 h taking 3 pd as an example this experiment was an attempt to optimize the synthesis conditions of the material and compare its photocatalytic bactericidal performance with that of pure zno the optimization conditions of the material synthesis were as follows after the pd zno synthesized according to the procedure described above was dried it was carefully ground to a powder in a mortar four 3 pd zno samples of the same mass were then weighed and calcined at 150 c 250 c 350 c and 450 c respectively for 2 h after calcination the mass was ground in a mortar after cooling to room temperature and stored in 5 ml centrifuge tubes to prepare for the experiments 2 2 photocatalyst characterization the crystal structure and crystallinity of the materials were measured by xrd d8 advance germany their crystal structure and nanoscale morphology were characterized by tem jem 2100 japan and sem jsm 7001f japan and their elemental composition and chemical valence was characterized by xps escalab 250 us ultra violet and visible spectrophotometer uv vis u3900h japan was used to judge their light absorption intensity and steady state spectrofluorometer pl 930 n shanghai was used to evaluate the recombination efficiency of the electrons and holes esr jeol japan was used to detect the type and intensity of the free radicals produced during the disinfection process at room temperature 2 3 photocatalytic antibacterial properties test in this experiment e coli k12 was used as the target strain to explore the antibacterial effect of the pd zno nanocomposites before and after calcination in visible light the experimental light source produced visible light at wavelengths of 420 780 nm and the illumination intensity was 30 mw cm2 the initial bacterial concentration on the small plate was 2 107 cfu ml and the concentration of the material used in the experiment was 1 mg ml bacterial suspension 2 4 optical memory antibacterial test of 3 pd zno 350 c to study the light memory effect of the photocatalytic nanomaterials 3 pd zno 350 c powder samples were evenly dispersed on small plates and then exposed to light for 2 h at an intensity of 30 mw cm2 after the light exposure ceased an antibacterial test was carried out in the dark with a concentration of 1 mg ml of the nanomaterial system e coli k12 was used as the target strain in the antibacterial experiment 2 5 in vitro cytotoxicity ht22 was cultured in the logarithmic phase 100 μl 104 cells ml at 37 c with 5 co2 after inoculation in 96 well plates pdo zno nanomaterials with different concentrations namely 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mg ml were added to the experimental group and the control group received the same amount of pbs buffer 10 μl cck 8 reagent was added and fresh medium was used to replace the original medium after the above experimental and control groups had been cultured for 24 or 48 h the above mixture was re cultured for 4 h at 37 c finally the absorbance of the mixed solution was measured using a microplate reader imark microplate reader bio rad usa to judge cell activity the experiment was repeated three times for each group and the results were analyzed statistically results were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization fig 1a shows the xrd patterns of pd zno nanocomposites with various ratios synthesized at 80 c for 2 h the 2θ peaks at 31 7 34 4 36 2 47 5 56 6 62 8 and 66 3 respectively correspond to the crystal planes 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 1 1 0 2 1 1 0 1 0 3 and 2 0 0 in the characteristic diffraction peak of zno jcpds no 05 0681 which indicates the formation of a hexagonal wurtzite structure 42 43 in the sample the 2θ peak at 40 1 corresponds to the 1 1 1 crystal plane in the characteristic diffraction peak of pd jcpds no 46 1043 we found that with an increasing amount of pd the diffraction peak of pd changed from weak to strong however there was no elemental peak in 0 3 pd zno which may be due to low pd content compared with pure zno the position of the main peak of the zno in all the samples did not change significantly thus the presence of pd did not change the crystal structure of zno and pd decorated zno nanocomposites were synthesized the pl spectra of pd zno with different ratios are shown in fig s1 through the spectra it can be found that the pl intensity of 3 pd zno is the lowest which indicates the highest separation of electrons and holes among all ratios 44 next the calcination experiment will continue on 3 pd zno xrd patterns of the 3 pd zno at different calcination temperatures are shown in fig 1b the diffraction peak at 40 1 corresponds to palladium which is found at a calcination temperature of 150 c the zno diffraction peaks did not change significantly when the calcination temperature rose however the intensity of the diffraction peaks was obviously enhanced 45 it is clearly observed that the diffraction peak of pd weakened and then disappeared the disappeared pd may have transformed into palladium oxide fig s2a and fig s2c show the full xps spectra of the 3 pd zno and 3 pd zno 350 c nanocomposites respectively both nanocomposites contain three elements zn 2p pd 3d and o 1s fig s2b shows the high resolution pd 3d xps spectrum in fig s2b the pd has two fitted peaks at 334 9 ev and 340 1 ev corresponding to pd 3d5 2 and pd 3d3 2 of the pd element respectively indicating that the pd in the composite material existed as pd0 without the presence of pdo 46 in fig s2d the two fitted peaks at 336 6 ev and 342 2 ev correspond to pd 3d5 2 and pd 3d3 2 of pdo 47 and no characteristic peak of palladium can be seen proving that the pd zno calcined and probably transformed its existing pd0 to pdo fig 2 shows the high resolution pd 3d spectra of pd zno at different calcination temperatures the diffraction peak of pd shifts to the left with an increase in calcination temperature this means that the calcination of pd in the material is a process of electron loss which is important evidence of the transition from pd to pdo the high resolution o 1s spectra of pd zno at various calcination temperatures can be observed in fig s3 the position of the xps peak of o does not vary considerably as the calcination temperature fig 3a and b respectively show tem and high resolution tem images of 3 pd zno before calcination by measuring the lattice spacing from the high resolution spectrum it is not difficult to see that zno crystals and pd existed in the materials synthesized without calcination whereby the lattice spacings of 0 28 nm and 0 22 nm correspond to the 1 0 0 crystal plane of the characteristic diffraction peaks of zno and the 1 1 1 crystal plane of the characteristic diffraction peaks of pd respectively this result is consistent with previous findings from xrd 48 49 the tem and high resolution tem spectra of 3 pd zno after calcination are mapped in fig 3c and d respectively as shown in fig 3d we can also confirm the existence of the zno crystal and the pdo by measuring the lattice distance the lattice spacings are 0 19 nm and 0 26 nm which correspond to the 1 0 2 crystal plane of the characteristic diffraction peaks of zno and the 1 0 1 crystal plane of the characteristic diffraction peaks of pdo respectively in general the original pd in the material will be eliminated after the calcination of pd zno the visible light absorption spectra of the pd zno before and after calcination was observed by uv vis and are shown in fig 4a and b it can be seen from fig 4a that the optical absorption intensity of pd zno in the visible light region of 300 780 nm is much higher than that of pure zno in this wavelength range indicating that the modification of pd successfully broadened the photoresponse range of zno 50 51 meanwhile the light absorption range of pd zno composites also gradually increased with a continuous increase in pd content as shown in fig 4b the uv vis spectra of pd zno samples calcined at different temperatures reveal that the material exhibited the best light absorption performance when the calcination temperature was 150 c 52 3 2 photocatalytic antibacterial properties for pd zno zhang et al investigated its bactericidal performance as shown in table s1 results showed that pd zno had excellent photocatalytic performance under uv light and could kill all e coli with a bacterial concentration of 1 5 109 cfu l within 0 5 h like this khalil et al demonstrated that pd zno could kill all bacteria with an initial concentration of 4 1010 cfu l under uv light irradiation with a light intensity of 1500 mw our study extends the bactericidal performance of pd zno under visible light conditions fig 5a shows the bactericidal curve of the non calcified pd zno samples with different proportions 3 pd zno had the strongest bactericidal effect against e coli compared with the pd zno nanomaterials with other proportions almost all the 2 107 cfu ml bacteria were inactivated by 3 pd zno after 3 h the bactericidal curve of the 3 pd zno sample at different calcination temperatures is shown in fig 5b pd zno calcinated at 350 c exhibited the best bactericidal performance killing all the bacteria after 1 5 h other calcination temperatures do not guarantee this high level of antibacterial performance we found that the calcination of the pd zno nanomaterials significantly improved their bactericidal performance veziroglu s research 53 has shown that pdo has a good electron trapping effect which can improve the photocatalytic efficiency of photocatalysts by reducing the efficiency of electron hole complexation in photocatalysts the pl profiles of the 3 pd zno before and after calcination were analyzed as shown in fig s4 the degree of electron hole separation in pd zno both before and after calcination was significantly higher than that of pure zno 54 55 and was highest after calcination which indicated that the separation ability of electrons and holes gradually increases by calcination 56 58 and the lower the height of the peaks in the pl profiles the better the bactericidal effect 59 the results of xrd xps and tem testing prove that the forms of pd existing in the composite before and after calcination were pd0 and pdo respectively therefore it can be concluded that the photocatalytic efficiency of the composite is enhanced because of the conversion of pd0 to pdo by calcination 60 61 the xrd measurements of the different ratios of pd zno calcined at 350 c are shown in fig s5 the position of the zno diffraction peak did not change with the addition of pd although it gradually became wider as the addition increased the strongest uv absorption was obtained when the addition of pd was 3 the uv vis data shown in fig s6 indicate that the best sterilization performance of 3 pd zno 350 c can be demonstrated by the sterilization experiment shown in fig s7 as shown in fig 6 3 pd zno 350 c exhibited remarkable photocatalytic memory properties manifesting within 1 h after light exposure ended whereby e coli with an initial concentration of 1 105 cfu ml were completely killed as shown in fig 7 3 pd zno 350 c generates a significant amount of oh and o2 when exposed to a light source which is the main cause of cell damage and apoptosis in the work of li et al 62 the types of free radicals in au zno pd nanocomposite catalysts under visible light conditions were investigated and it was also found that the free radicals generated by the samples were mainly oh and o2 after light exposure ended the material still produced a certain amount of free radicals for 20 min although the intensity was reduced compared to when the material was exposed to the light source in combination with the results of the bactericidal tests in fig 7 this indicates that the material was still capable of harming e coli cells through oh and o2 production 63 and demonstrated a certain optical memory effect this had a positive impact on improving the overall effectiveness of the photocatalytic bactericidal activity the cell morphology of e coli before and after the photocatalytic treatment was observed by scanning electron microscopy as shown in fig 8 it is worth noting that before the non photocatalytic treatment the morphology of the cells is full their surface is smooth and the cells are in a good active state in contrast after the photocatalytic treatment the cells appear sunken folded and even broken with deeper pores on their outer surfaces moreover the cells are disorganized and internal material can be seen flowing out of the cells the mechanism of cell death by photocatalytic materials has also been investigated in the study by aponiene et al 64 who found that cell death is closely linked to the disruption of bacterial membrane structure and maruthupandy et al 65 also investigated the mechanism of cell death and found that cell death is accompanied by membrane contraction and loss of viability both of which are consistent with our study the magnitude of the effect of a material on the activity of mammalian cells is an important factor in testing its level of toxicity 66 in this experiment the effect of 3 pdo zno on ht22 cells was investigated as shown in fig 9 when various concentrations of pdo zno 0 2 mg ml 0 4 mg ml 0 6 mg ml 0 8 mg ml were applied to the cells the cell to cell survival rate did not change significantly and remained high around 100 this indicates that the material has a non toxic effect on ht22 cells in ali s research 67 on the cytotoxicity of zno cells it was pointed out that zno has extremely high biocompatibility through the cytotoxicity experiments of pdo zno it was demonstrated that zno s biocompatibility persisted even after doping thus pdo zno is expected to be an environmentally friendly catalyst with non toxicity and high catalytic activity 4 conclusion in summary pd zno and pdo zno nanocomposites were synthesized the xrd and xps results show that the composite of pd changes to pdo after calcination the antibacterial experiment demonstrates that pdo zno has double the bactericidal efficiency of pd zno reducing the time necessary for bacterial inactivation from 3 h to 1 5 h pdo zno has a good light memory effect as proven by esr testing and an optical memory sterilization test the oh and o2 signal was still detected 20 min after the light exposure ended and bacteria can be killed furthermore sem tests show that the disinfection effect involved the disruption of the bacteria s cellular structure in addition the non toxicity of pdo zno was further demonstrated through an investigation of the magnitude of its effect on ht22 cells declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest
