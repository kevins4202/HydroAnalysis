13710,the operational flexibility of sequencing batch reactors sbr makes this technology especially resilient to changes in functional requirements a main feature of sbrs is that plant upgrading from nitrogen to phosphorus removal specifications becomes straightforward by simple adaptation of the manipulated variables in contrast the optimum design and operation of these processes is an intricate problem whose formulation involves multiple considerations such as mathematical descriptions for both biological transformations and solids separation phenomena design procedures for air diffusers etc moreover the dynamic nature of sbrs adds extra complexity when it comes to solving optimization problems for this technology in this paper a model based optimization framework is proposed to solve the optimum design and operation of sbr systems this framework splits the whole problem into two single objective optimization sub problems the dimensions of the sbr are first calculated then the operational costs in the long term are optimized a case study for a population of 100000 inhabitant equivalent demonstrates the potential of the framework keywords asm1 modelling nitrogen removal optimization wastewater 1 introduction if before the computer revolution continuous flow wastewater treatment processes were clearly prevalent the arrival of industrial automation technologies gave rise to new plant designs characterized by non continuous and cyclic operational patterns four well known treatment technologies that exhibit this feature in their manipulated variables are atad auto thermal thermophilic digestion layden et al 1 biodenitro biodenipho isaacs 2 and sbr sequencing batch reactor artan and orhon 3 advances in computer technology have also drastically changed the way of facing engineering problems in general model based simulation has become a valuable technology to undertake the design and operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtp hvala el at 4 additionally the adoption of resource recovery and energy efficiency criteria in wwtps is leading to more complex designs combining emerging treatment technologies solon et al 5 a direct implication of the above is that for the design of such plants sophisticated frameworks relying on an effective exploitation of simulation tools will be necessary as reliable mathematical formulations of the most relevant wastewater treatment technologies are available in the literature all these models have been integrated into wwtp specific simulation software packages that provide user friendly environments to facilitate solving design and operation problems gernaey et al 6 usually the design of wwtps is formulated as a sequence of two sub problems in a first stage steady state conditions are considered to obtain a preliminary solution then this solution is refined by running dynamic simulations in which the short term variability of the influent wastewater is considered the problem of finding the preliminary solution under steady state conditions has been traditionally addressed by using reduced models implemented in spreadsheets bengtson 7 the main advantage of this approach is that from a mathematical point of view the solution can be easily calculated on the other hand a simplistic formulation of the problem implies that the obtained solution must be scaled up with too conservative safety margins which results in cost ineffective designs when optimum solutions need to be found a consequence of formulating the design and operation of wwtps in terms of more accurate and complex models is that it is not possible to solve the problem by simple calculations in that case simulation tools are of great help to run steady state studies in which any combination of the decision variables dv can be simulated to see whether it fulfils the problem requirements or not however since this approach relies on trial and error techniques both the time to completion and the quality of the solution are strongly dependent on the user skills in addition as the treatment process increases in complexity so it does the number of dvs and trial and error methods become cumbersome even for experienced designers thus in the last years the development of automatic problem solving procedures and tools that try to exploit the potential of mathematical programming techniques in the wastewater field becomes a relevant subject hreiz et al 8 it is in general accepted that the solution to the design of wwtps requires considering trade offs between several conflicting criteria namely maximizing treatment efficiency minimizing capital costs capex and minimizing operational costs opex this means that in a strict sense a multi objective approach is the correct formulation to specify and solve this kind of problems multi objective optimization problems moop lead to multiple solutions under the notion of optimality expressed by the concept of the so called pareto dominance when solved moops provide a finite set of solutions known as the pareto front pf all of them being equally optimal from a mathematical perspective therefore it is the responsibility of the decision maker dm to decide which specific solution of the pf is preferred over the others in the wastewater treatment domain hakanen et al 9 present an interactive moo tool for design of wastewater treatment plants unlike other moo techniques interactive moo allows dms to participate at every iteration of the resolution process by classifying the current pareto optimal solution in order to reflect their preferences in espírito santo et al 10 a multi objective elitist genetic algorithm is proposed to minimize the total costs and the effluent quality of an activated sludge process asp use of genetic algorithms to solve similar problems is also reported by doby et al 11 egea et al 12 and hreiz et al 13 to solve similar moo problems the design and operation of wwtps has been also formulated as a single objective optimization problem soop some works define the problem first as a moop and then convert this problem into a soop where the single objective function is defined as a weighted sum of each individual objective moles et al 14 behera et al 15 a different approach consists in dividing the whole moop into a set of soops that are solved in sequence rivas et al 16 this procedure relies on the fact that though effluent quality and operating costs are conflicting objectives they can be optimized separately the flow rate and composition of the wastewater in dry weather conditions dwc and winter temperature determine the minimum volume necessary to accomplish with the effluent quality requirements therefore these conditions are usually considered first to calculate the optimum size of the plant then with this result a second phase is carried out to explore optimum operational strategies for scenarios that are biologically more favorable low influent load summer temperatures etc ad hoc formulations of the above problem as soops can be found in guerrero et al 17 and ostace et al 18 though mathematical optimization has been applied to a large variety of wastewater plant designs most of the reported studies have concentrated however on continuous processes in contrast similar works for either semi batch or alternating processes are much less frequent and all of them have dealt with the optimization of those variables operated according to a cyclic strategy baeza et al 19 chachuat et al 20 bournazou et al 21 piotrowski et al 22 there is no evidence of mathematical optimization approaches using complex models that simultaneously address the design and operation of these processes the only known reference in this respect is velmurugan et al 23 where a model based optimization method to design sbr processes is presented however simplified expressions are specified to formulate the whole problem in addition no details are given on how the steady state regime is computed by this method while the mathematical formulation of steady state conditions in continuous processes is straightforward by setting to zero the time derivative of all the state variables the above does not hold for systems operated according to cyclic patterns this explains in part why mathematical formulations on optimum design of these systems try to skip this issue by using algebraic descriptions of the treatment process this paper presents a moo framework for design and operation of sbr processes compared to other previous works a substantial contribution of this methodology is its mathematical foundation which is based on the utilization of a comprehensive dynamic model for the sbr process such as it will be explained in detail later the approach of posing the moop as a sequence of soops has been adopted in this framework before introducing the mathematical framework the design specifications including the sbr configuration the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated the effluent requirements the range of operating temperatures etc are defined first then the mathematical formulation of the moo problem and the resolution methodology is posed finally the most remarkable results obtained after applying the design methodology are described 2 design specifications 2 1 sbr configuration sbr technology is a generic term that covers multiple design configurations all of them sharing some kind of cyclic operation in order for biological transformations and solid liquid separation to take place in the same tank wilderer et al 24 sbr designs can be classified in two broad categories based on whether they include a holding tank or not in this paper the specifications relative to the wastewater characteristics correspond to a population size of about 100000 inhabitant equivalent ie existing full scale sbr plants with treatment capacities in the order of the above specification reveal a preference for designs without holding tank it is for this reason that the sbr configuration without holding tank has been adopted in this work moreover the number of sbrs n r working in parallel varies depending on the size of the plant while typical designs for small plants are made up of two sbr tanks as the size of the plant increases the number of sbrs also increases up to six tanks in our specific problem since the treatment capacity corresponds to a medium size plant the number of sbr tanks has been set to four reactors n r 4 2 2 wastewater characteristics when optimum designs need to be found the importance of gathering accurate and sufficient information on the wastewater characteristics should not be underestimated any result with the most powerful optimization tool turns out meaningless if previously the characteristics of the wastewater have not been well ascertained consequently the next step in the problem definition is to specify the wastewater to be treated to this end instead of creating a new influent from scratch on grounds of efficiency the influent profile reported in the bsm1 lt simulation protocol has been chosen rosen et al 25 this protocol contains detailed information on the short and long term characteristics of a fictitious settled wastewater representative of a medium size urban area more concretely the wastewater fluctuations in flow rate composition expressed in terms of the asm1 model state variables henze et al 26 and temperature are given at regular intervals of 15 minutes for a whole period of 609 days though the main patterns contained in this information were kept slight adaptations were carried out in this work for the wastewater composition to be more consistent with typical ratios in settled wastewaters henze et al 27 thus with respect to their original values the total suspended solids t s s and the easily biodegradable organic substrate s s were reduced by 23 and 13 respectively while ammonia n h 4 n was increased by 22 in addition the fraction of nitrogen in s s i n s s the ratio between filtered c o d f c o d and n h 4 n and the ratio between particulate c o d p c o d and volatile suspended solids v s s were respectively set to i n s s 0 03 m g n m g c o d f c o d n h 4 n 5 m g c o d m g n and p c o d v s s 2 07 m g c o d m g v s s nonetheless for the problem considered in this paper it would be completely unacceptable to assume that the wastewater characteristics are known a priori with such a granularity many state variables in the asm1 can be neither measured nor identified moreover in real world applications wastewater information is collected from 24 hour composite samples exceptionally some grab samples are analyzed to quantify the hourly variations that the wastewater exhibits during dry and wet weather periods thus the available input information for our problem has to be consistent with the above considerations accordingly the size of the original dataset was reduced and converted into a new dataset based on daily observations and aggregated features the first column in table 1 shows the features that were selected for the new dataset this dataset consisted of 52 daily observations each one taken at random from each week of a whole year descriptive statistics of these observations are summarized in table 1 and fig 1 the wastewater characteristics for dwc were obtained from the above dataset by considering the three following percentiles 1 90 for n h 4 n l o a d 2 99 for t o t a l c o d and n h 4 n then these percentiles were combined with the above mentioned values for the wastewater ratios to calculate the values shown in table 2 furthermore fig 2 illustrates the hourly characteristics of the wastewater for dwc similarly the wastewater characteristics for wet weather conditions wwc were determined by assuming the same pollution load as in dwc but considering the maximum instantaneous wastewater flow rate of the year table 2 2 3 effluent quality requirements the specification for the quality of the effluent has been taken from the eu directive concerning urban wastewater treatment 91 271 ec this eu directive imposes daily average upper limits of 10 m g n l and 1 m g p l for the concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp at the effluent of wwtps larger than 100000 ie in this paper it has been assumed that the secondary treatment i e the sbr will focus only on nitrogen removal though no requirements for the effluent ammonia concentrations n h 4 e f f are explicitly included in the eu directive some local water regulations also impose an upper limit to this compound moreover since at low concentrations of n h 4 e f f nitrification is more stable it is a general rule of designers to specify their own requirement for this compound with all these things considered the effluent quality specifications daily average values that the design of the sbr must satisfy are formulated by eq 1 wherein the first constraint reflects a safety specification 1 n h 4 e f f 2 m g n l t n e f f 10 m g n l 2 4 decision variables dvs the cyclic operation of sbrs is determined by the action of four manipulated variables namely the feeding valve the drawn valve mixing and the aeration system each of these manipulated variables follows a specific cyclic pattern being the length of the cycle t c h the same for all these patterns moreover some of these patterns cannot be freely chosen but they must meet certain constraints for instance in sbrs without holding tank the feeding valve has to be open at the beginning of the cycle and the time t f h that this valve must be kept open is determined by t f t c n r similarly if biological reactions must be active while the feeding valve is open then the mixing equipment must be switched on at the beginning of the cycle moreover prior to opening the drawn valve mixing and aeration must be switched off for a sufficient length of time t s h being this interval usually known as the settling phase the interval t d h in which the drawn valve is open is named the drawn phase finally the reaction phase corresponds to that interval of time t m h in which mixing is on the activation and deactivation of the aeration system during the reaction phase will result in specific sub phases with the sbr tank operating at aerobic anoxic or anaerobic conditions based on the above considerations fig 3 illustrates the cyclic operation of the above four variables for a sbr without holding tank n r 4 and the phases that result from such an operation in that cycle the reaction phase has been divided into two sub phases the first one non aerated and the second one aerated in what follows the length of these sub phases will be respectively denoted by t a x h and t a e h after introducing the sequential phases that result from a cyclic operation of the manipulated variables in the sbr the dvs corresponding to these phases are t a x t a e t s and t d the sum of all them being the total cycle length t c and the feeding time t f t c n r besides the length of the different phases the design of sbr systems involves additional dvs one is the working volume v m i n m 3 of each sbr at the beginning of the cycle for a given v m i n and steady state conditions the maximum volume v m a x m 3 is expressed by eq 2 2 v m a x v m i n 1 24 0 t c n r q i n f t d t s s c v m a x v m i n q i n f t c 24 n r other dvs are the volume of sludge surplus withdrawn from each sbr tank every day q w m 3 d and the dissolved oxygen set point in the aerated phase d o s p m g l every cycle the sludge surplus is withdrawn during a short interval t w before the beginning of the settling phase fig 3 the volume of sludge withdrawn per cycle v w c y c l e m 3 c y c l e can be expressed as 3 v w c y c l e q w t c 24 q w t w since the d o concentration in the sbr at the beginning of the aerated phase is near zero some rise time will be necessary for this process variable to reach the d o s p set point if it is assumed that the injection of air is continuously regulated then the rise time t r is another dv since its value will affect the sbr performance finally aeration systems in sbr processes are usually designed with fine bubble diffusers fbd therefore the number of diffusers n d i f to be installed in each sbr tank is another dv n d i f mainly depends on the available footprint and the peak oxygen demand in conclusion all the dvs that will take part in the optimum design of the sbr configuration without holding tank are summarized here t a x t a e t s t d v m i n q w d o s p t r and n d i f in what follows all these variables will be grouped in the vector p 2 5 additional design considerations the first consideration refers to the shape of the sbr calculating the geometry of the sbr is also part of the design problem in this case for the physical construction of the sbr tank a rectangular geometry has been adopted based on typical design criteria relative to the length l width w and depth d of rectangular aeration tanks the two following ratios have been imposed g 1 l w 5 and g 2 w d 3 if v m a x is the maximum effective volume of each sbr tank its water depth and footprint area are calculated by eq 4 4 d m a x m v m a x g 1 g 2 2 3 a c m 2 f d m a x d m a x 2 g 1 g 2 2 in the next section it will be shown that d m a x puts respectively lower and upper bounds on the settling time t s and the number of diffusers n d i f the second consideration is that it will be assumed that the wwtp includes anaerobic digestion units to treat the sludge stream this issue will be brought back when dealing with the problem of optimizing the operational costs of the sbr the third and last consideration is related to the fact that steady state operating conditions never occur in real world wwtps however as mentioned above for the design of these systems it is in practice more convenient to find first a preliminary solution assuming steady state regime and then refine this solution by running simulations under dynamic operating conditions nonetheless for non continuous processes since even the steady state regime is dynamic the search of this preliminary solution also requires running simulations let x be the state vector of the sbr process x t the value of this vector at a given instant t and t c the length of the cycle it can be stated with generality that steady state conditions are reached if and only if the following expression is satisfied x t x t t c t such a definition of the steady state regime for non continuous processes allows its calculation by combining dynamic simulation with optimization methods in terms of optimization the steady state problem can be posed as follows 5 min x ini i x f i x i n i i 2 s t x f x ini x i n i i 0 i 1 2 n where x f x f 1 x f 2 x f n contains the final state that results after simulating the process for just one cycle i e t s i m t c and starting from an initial state x i n i x i n i 1 x i n i 2 x i n i n therefore for any given sbr process specified by p p 0 and an initial state x i n i the final state x f can be seen as a function x f f x i n i p 0 eq 5 is proposed by dionisi et al 28 to find the steady state regime of sbr processes the same approach has been followed in this paper with small adaptations to increase the efficiency of the method more specifically with the objective of reducing the time to compute f x i n i p one cycle simulations were implemented in a dynamic link library d l l moreover while in 28 the euler method is used to compute the above function here a slight variation of this method has been implemented that consists in assigning a different time step for each phase in the sbr cycle preceding the computation of f x i n i p the value of each time step is calculated based on a predefined baseline time step δ t s t e p and the length of the corresponding phase t p h i 0 as follows 6 n s t e p s i m a x i n t t p h i δ t s t e p 1 δ t s t e p i t p h i n s t e p s i 3 problem formulation instead of defining the problem as a single moop the approach adopted here has been based on dividing the whole problem into a sequence of two soops while the objective function to be minimized in the first problem is the volume of the sbr in the second one the focus will be put on the optimization of the operating costs 3 1 sbr model equations in this section the mathematical model of the sbr process is introduced in this model biochemical transformations have been formulated using the standard asm1 model in addition to this since sbrs are variable volume systems for the sake of simplicity the state vector m of the model has been expressed in mass units thus the state vector m m g and its counterpart x m v m g l in concentration units are 7 m m s t m p t t m s m s o m s s m s n d m s n h m s n o m s i m s a l k t m p m x i m x s m x n d m x b h m x b a m x p m x i n t x x s t x p t t s o s s s n d s n h s n o s i s a l k x i x s x n d x b h x b a x p x i n t let e v i n f e v e f f e v m i x e v w and e v a be five binary variables e v 0 1 each one representing respectively the state either o n or o f f of the feeding valve the drawn valve the mixing equipment the sludge surplus valve and the aeration system along the cycle see fig 3 by this notation a compact formulation for the sbr model can be derived 8 d v d t q i n f e v i n f t q e f f e v e f f t q w

q e f f e v e f f t f n s s x p where q e f f m 3 d is the effluent flow rate when the drawn valve is o n x i n f x i n f s t x i n f p t t is a vector that contains the wastewater characteristics e e s e p and ρ m g l d are respectively the stoichiometric matrix and the kinetic vector of the asm1 model q w m 3 d is the sludge surplus flow rate when its corresponding valve e v w in o n and f n s s is the fraction of non settleable solids during the settling phase in eq 8 no explicit terms associated with the external aeration are present since external aeration only affects the dissolved oxygen m s o the equations of this phenomena have been taken out of the compact form in this regard let d m s o d t c m denote the time derivative obtained from the compact model for the state m s o the sbr model assumes that during the aerated sub phases the dissolved oxygen concentration is controlled and ideally follows a ramp trajectory until it reaches d o s p irizar et al 29 the main advantage of this assumption is that since it is not necessary to implement explicit equations for a real d o controller the convergence of optimization problems based on the proposed model becomes faster and more robust moreover by formulating a ramp trajectory where the slope is a parameter the effect of this parameter on the oxygen peak requirements can be easily estimated thus the final equations for the time derivative of the dissolved oxygen are these 9 d m s o d t d m s o d t c m k l a m i x s o s a t s o v 0 t t a x v d o s p s o i n i t r s o d v d t t a x t t a x m i n t a e t r 0 t t a x m i n t a e t r where k l a m i x d 1 is the value of the oxygen transfer coefficient for mixing and non aerated conditions s o i n i is the value of s o at the beginning of the aerated phase d o s p and t r d are the dissolved oxygen set point and the rise time for the aerated sub phase and t is the time elapsed since the start of the aeration sub phase regarding the equation of the sbr model during the settling phase e v i n f t 0 e v m i x t 0 e v a t 0 and e v e f f t 0 the settling model considered in this paper makes two assumptions 1 no biological reactions take place in the settler and 2 sludge thickening is instantaneous in addition the sbr model includes a parameter f n s s to take into account the concentration of solids in the sludge blanket during the drawn phase nonetheless instantaneous settling is far from what happens in real sbrs which immediately raises the question if this sbr model is valid or not since biological reactions and solids separation share the same tank for the optimum design of sbr processes same consideration must be given to one phenomenon as to the other for this reason it was necessary to adapt the instantaneous settling model with empirical knowledge on the performance of full scale sbr processes specifically the model equation proposed by teichgräber et al 30 for the settling velocity of the sludge blanket v s m h has been adopted eq 10 this variable exhibits an inverse dependence on both the initial concentration of suspended solids at the beginning of the settling phase x r m g l and the sludge volume index of the mixed liquor s v i m l g 10 v s 650 x r 1000 s v i similarly a practical recommendation to prevent the discharge of suspended solids during the drawn phase is that the sludge blanket must be kept at least 10 and 0 25 m below the water depth d t v t a c this imposes two constraints on the length of the settling and drawn phases eq 11 whose expressions have been obtained under the assumption that during the drawn phase i e e v i n f t 0 e v m i x t 0 e v a t 0 and e v e f f t 1 the effluent flow rate is constant and calculated by this expression q e f f m 3 d 24 a c d m a x d m i n t d 11 t s t d t s d m i n m a x d m a x 0 9 d m i n 0 25 d m a x d m i n v s t s t s m i n m a x 0 1 d m a x 0 25 v s where d m i n is the water depth at the end of the drawn phase i e the water depth at the beginning of the cycle finally mathematical expressions used by fbd manufacturers to calculate the number of diffusers n d i f have been integrated into the sbr model data sheets of commercial diffusers include valuable information for design such as for instance 1 effective area per diffuser 2 tolerable distances between diffusers 3 range of values for the air flow rate per diffuser q d i f n m 3 h and 4 curves of the standard oxygen transfer efficiency s o t e at different air flow rates and water depths moreover some algebraic expressions found in baird and bridgewater 31 and mccutcheon et al 32 have been adopted here to estimate the saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen under process conditions with all these things considered the following equations were included

footprint of each sbr tank a c the range of acceptable distances between diffusers provided by fbd manufactures impose a lower and an upper bound on n d i f since a c is a function of d m a x the depth of the mixed liquor at the end of the feeding phase then d m a x constraints the range of potential solutions for n d i f 3 2 soop 1 finding the optimum sbr volume the variable volume nature of sbr designs without holding tank makes the optimization of this dv an intricate problem that requires multiple operating scenarios to be analyzed together eq 2 shows that the maximum working volume v m a x depends on two decision variables providing n r is known v m i n and t c since these two variables are manipulated variables at least in theory their values can change during the operation of the sbr however short term changes of v m i n and t c are difficult to deal with in real world scenarios for instance a special requirement for designs without holding tank is that all the sbrs must operate in a synchronized manner specifically the end of the filling phase in the i t h sbr tank must coincide with the termination of the cycle in the i 1 t h tank since the length of the filling phase t f is a function of t c changes in t c affect both the end of the filling phase and the end of the cycle it is for this reason that in practice the value of t c is not adjusted from cycle to cycle it is preferable to limit any change in t c to the long term operation whereas keeping it constant in the short term s imilarly if v m i n was changed from cycle to cycle the filling and the drawn volumes in every cycle would not be equal this adds an extra complexity to the operation of the whole system whose real benefits however are not clear therefore for the sake of simplicity changes of v m i n in full scale sbrs are also limited to the long term operation it must be noticed that v m i n has a lower limit that depends on the s v i eq 9 in this regards long term adjustment of v m i n could be even necessary in periods characterized by large s v i values 13 0 9 v m i n s v i x r v m a x s v i m t s s 3 2 1 steady state optimum design at dry weather conditions opt dwc the main objective of the first optimization problem soop 1 is to find an optimum value of v m a x which involves formulating and solving several optimization sub problems this is because the design of sbrs is a compromise between biological effluent quality requirements and hydraulic specifications influent flow rate the most demanding scenario from a biological perspective corresponds to dwc and minimum temperature the lowest temperature is shown in table 1 t m i n 10 the wastewater characteristics for dwc are defined in table 2 with their corresponding values in terms of the state variables of the sbr model given in table 3 for the latter the following ratios have been specified s s f c o d 0 35 s i f c o d 0 20 x i p c o d 0 24 and x b h p c o d 0 13 i n s s 0 03 m g n m g c o d i n s i i n x i 0 04 m g n m g c o d and i n x b h 0 08 m g n m g c o d eventually the optimization sub problem to determine the optimum v m a x under biological considerations is formulated by eq 14 notice that the constraint for the effluent quality is t n e f f 9 when in fact the design specification is less stringent t n e f f 10 this is however necessary to compensate the fact of assuming steady state conditions and average wastewater characteristics opt dwc 14 min p x ini v m a x d w c s t x f f x ini p x ini t n e f f 9 s n h e f f 2 t a x t a e t f t s t d t s d m i n t s t s m i n d o s p

x i n i d w c be the optimum solution found by sub problem opt dwc similarly let the sub array m p d w c v m i n d w c x p i n i d w c contain the mass value of each particulate state at the beginning of the cycle now moving on to the scenario of wwc it must be noted that in this scenario hydraulic considerations become more demanding than any other issue in the sbr reactor in this regard a second optimization sub problem needs to be defined and solved to calculate the optimum v m a x w w c for this scenario the influent wastewater that corresponds to this sub problem is shown in table 3 before going into this problem it is worth analyzing whether it can be formulated independently of opt dwc or not the worst hydraulic scenario happens when wwc occur after a long period of dwc this is because in such a situation the sbr process must deal during wwc with a total mass of suspended solids in the tank whose value is determined by dwc therefore this connection between the mass of suspended solids that results from dwc and the influent wastewater for wwc must be somehow specified in the optimization problem let m p w w c represent the mass of each particulate state in the sbr under wwc a simple way of establishing such a connection is to pose the following constraint m p w w c m p d w c at the same time the above condition also requires the function x f f x i n i p to be slightly modified in this modified version denoted by x f f m x i n i p the time derivative of the particulate states are all internally forced to zero which means that their values remain constant along the cycle note to be precise the above condition applies to all particulate states except to m x s and m x n d after this explanation the optimum volume v m a x under wwc can be obtained from the following optimization problem opt wwc 15 min p x ini v max w w c s t x f f m x ini p x ini m p ini m p d w c t n e f f 10 t a x t a e t f t s t d t s d m i n t s t s m i n d o s p 1 75 t r 10 60

constraint was included only to ensuring the stability of nitrifying bacteria for their transient nature wwc are not a major concern as to cause the loss of nitrification as long as the settling phase takes the time necessary to prevent the escape of biomass from the effluent eventually given the connection between sub problems opt dwc and opt wwc the following sequence of optimizations need to be run 1 both sub problems are solved and the values of the footprint area a c d w c and a c w w c are compared to each other the greatest of these two values will be adopted as the design value for the footprint area of each sbr tank a c m a x a c d w c a c w w c 2 in a second run the following equality constraint a c a c is added to both sub problems before being solved again in this case the values of v m i n d w c and v m i n w w c are compared to each other again the greatest of these two values will be adopted as the design value for v m i n v m i n m a x v m i n d w c v m i n w w c 3 finally the constraint v m i n v m i n is imposed in both sub problems that are solved a third time to get p d w c and p w w c 3 2 3 design considerations related to the hourly variability of the wastewater once completed the above sequence the solution found in opt dwc must be analyzed when considering the hourly variability of the influent wastewater see fig 2 to this end a third optimization sub problem must be defined opt 24dwc which besides must be repeated 24 times once for each hour of the day as in opt wwc the same constraint needs to be formulated for the particulate states m p 24 d w c m p d w c in addition both the minimum volume and the length of the cycle in this problem must be set equal to the optimum values obtained when solving opt dwc v m i n d w c and t c d w c the complete definition of this sub problem is shown below opt 24dwc 16 min p x ini t n e f f s t x f f m x ini p x ini m p ini m p d w c v m i n v m i n t c t c d w c q w q w d w c t a x t a

optimize t n e f f it has been assumed that the sbr design implements real time controllers to automatically optimize in each cycle the length of the reaction phases and d o s p let t n e f f i be the optimum value for the i t h hour of the day i 0 1 2 23 for the sbr design solutions calculated in opt dwc and opt wwc to be accepted as final solutions the following condition must be satisfied 17 1 24 i 0 23 t n e f f i 10 otherwise it means that the constraint t n e f f 9 defined in opt dwc was not enough tough in such a case it would be necessary to make this constraint more stringent for instance t n e f f 8 5 and then start over the whole procedure of optimizations until eq 17 is fulfilled with all these things considered eventually the final solution for the optimum volume v m a x would result from computing the following expression 18 v m a x m a x v m a x w w c m a x v m a x i i 0 1 23 similarly the optimum number of diffusers n d i f is obtained from the opt 24dwc problem and specifically from that optimization where the peak value of q a i r during the aerobic sub phase is maximum the influent wastewater used in this optimization problem is shown in table 3 and corresponds to those points in fig 2 represented by white circles 3 3 soop 2 long term optimization of the sbr operation the optimum size of the sbr tanks is calculated by solving the sequence of optimization problems defined in the previous section now this design is used to formulate further problems but in this case with the focus put on optimizing the operational costs of the process here it will be assumed that the dv with the greatest impact on the operational costs is the external aeration q a i r tchobanoglous et al 33 power consumption in blowers p b k w can be formulated by eq 19 as a function of q a i r u s epa 34 19 p b t q a i r p 1 16 96 η b p 1 d t 9 806 p 1 0 283 1 where p b k w is the wire power consumption of the blower q a i r n m 3 m i n is the air flow rate p 1 k p a is the blower inlet pressure d t is the water depth and η b 0 6 is the combined blower motor efficiency on the other hand q w determines the sludge production and therefore the amount of methane gas that can be obtained from the anaerobic digesters this amount can be expressed in energy units through the net calorific value of methane 13 89 k w h k g c h 4 all in all the net energy costs m w h y e a r in each sbr tank can be evaluated by the following expression 20 n e c o s t 1 t c 0 t c p b t d t η a d 13 89 24 4 1000 q w x r b i o n r 365 24 1000 where x r b i o m g c o d l is the total biodegradable c o d concentration of the sludge surplus withdrawn from the sbr and η a d 0 7 is the efficiency of the anaerobic digestion and chp units in terms of energy recovery from the feeding sludge the long term operation of urban wwtps is mainly affected by the seasonal variability of both the influent wastewater and the temperature optimizing the long term operation means minimizing eq 20 in response to this kind of seasonal disturbances however it is important to bear in mind that energy costs and process stability are conflicting goals the price of optimizing the energy costs is that the risk of process failures increases for instance minimization of the energy costs would result in operational regions characterized by low aerated fractions combined with low sludge retention times that is regions where nitrification is more sensitive to overloads temperature drops etc in this respect any sbr plant designed according to the above criteria should be equipped with advanced real time controllers in charge of guaranteeing the stability of the process otherwise the optimum solution must be a trade off between operating costs and process stability which somehow should be present in the problem formulation a simple way followed in this paper has been to force an upper constraint on the effluent ammonia for any given wastewater characteristics and temperature conditions the optimum solution will provide those values of the operational variables i e t a x t a e t s t d d o s p t r and q w that minimize n e c o s t for operational simplicity the length of the cycle t c and v m i n has been forced to take respectively the values t c d w c and v m i n found in soop 1 similarly the value of d o s p has been fixed to 1 75 m g l with all these considerations this optimization problem has been defined in the following way opt opex 21 min p x ini n e c o s t s t x f f x ini p x ini x i n i i 0 i 1 2 14 t n e f f 9 s n h e f f 2 t c t c d w c t ph 0 t ph t a x t

52 daily observations of the initial dataset table 1 were grouped into periods of 2 consecutive months 6 periods in total for each period the wastewater characteristics were calculated by averaging only those samples that corresponded to dry weather conditions table 4 the calculation of the optimum long term pattern for the manipulated variables involves solving opt opex for each wastewater specified in table 4 3 4 problem solving implementation in this paper the default values for the coefficients of the asm1 model were applied to solve the problem defined in the previous sections though considering uncertainty issues in our problem would have been more rigorous they have been taken out on purpose two reasons have supported the above decision 1 the assumption that the sbr design includes feedback controllers and 2 the optimum volume is calculated for a value of d o s p equal to 1 75 m g l in order to provide the real design with an extra operational margin that might be used if necessary the whole mathematical framework described in the previous section has been programmed in an excel workbook worksheet based user interfaces have been implemented to configure each optimization problem opt dwc opt wwc opt 24dwc and opt opex the function that simulates one cycle x f f x i n i p 0 has been implemented in a dynamic link library dll customized functions and macros have been programmed in the excel workbook that allow f x i n i p 0 to be called from specific cells finally the excel solver add in fronlinesolvers has been used to run the optimization problems specifically the nonlinear generalized reduced gradient grg solver has been adopted in this work lasdon at al 35 4 results and discussion 4 1 soop 1 optimum volume table 5 illustrates the optimum values of p and v m a x found in opt dwc and opt wwc after completing the optimization sequence described in section 3 2 2 it can be seen how biological and hydraulic considerations led to different values for the optimum length of the cycle t c 3 52 and 2 42 h respectively in dwc it is the time required for biological reactions t a x and t a e that has a major impact on t c on the other hand in wwc the settling and drawn phases t s and t d are more influential on the value of t c the design values of each sbr tank for both the footprint area a c and the working volume at the beginning of the cycle v m i n were respectively a c 1163 m 2 and v m i n 4039 m 3 when designing sbr systems a subtle difference with the design of continuous processes is that the concentration of suspended solids in the mixed liquor m l s s is not formulated as a problem constraint in continuous treatment systems biological reactions and solids separation take place in specific units the total volume depends on the m l s s concentration in the biological unit high values of m l s s result in large volumes because large settling tanks are required but low values of m l s s also lead to large volumes in this case because the biological volume has to be large it is generally accepted that there is an intermediate range for this variable between 3000 m g l and 4000 m g l where the total volume of both units is minimum based on the above optimization problems for design of biological units in continuous processes usually include an equality constraint for the value of m l s s e g m l s s 3500 m g l in contrast since sbr systems perform biological reactions and solids separation in the same tank their optimum design requires both operations and their dependencies to be part of the problem formulation for this reason if a given value is specified for m l s s as a constraint then the design is not optimum in a strict sense it is only when the optimization algorithm has no constraints on m l s s that an optimum solution can be found in our particular problem the optimum concentration of solids in opt dwc was m l s s 5157 m g l this value was calculated at the beginning of the settling phase and the sludge retention time s r t was 24 1 d all the design results were obtained by considering for the s v i parameter a value of 150 m l g in fig 4 the hourly variation of v m a x and t n e f f obtained after solving opt 24dwc are graphically visualized these results reproduce the dynamic performance of the sbr design solution for dwc and at the minimum temperature of the year t 10 the first observation is that the peak value of v m a x 5179 m 3 was lower than that found in opt wwc 5507 m 3 therefore each sbr tank will have to be designed with an effective capacity of at least 5507 m 3 furthermore the daily average of value of t n e f f eq 17 was 10 0 m g n l that is compliant with the effluent quality specification t n e f f 10 m g n l therefore no iterations were required to recalculate the design solution the shape of t n e f f in fig 4 evidences a weak capacity of the sbr process to absorb peak loads conversely the above drawback is compensated by the strong potential of the sbr to achieve effluents of very high quality when the nitrogen load is below its treatment capacity as for the daily average concentration of ammonia at the effluent the result was s n h e f f 4 4 m g n l which means that in the most demanding operating conditions the tough requirement for t n e f f will be met but to the detriment of a relatively high concentration of ammonia a solid argument for the installation of feedback controllers in sbr systems is that their faculty to reject disturbances will be crucial to keep nitrification stable in these operating conditions the amount of diffusers n d i f to be installed in each sbr tank was calculated based on the peak demand of oxygen whose value 313 2 k g o 2 h can be seen in fig 5 this figure plots the peak oxygen requirements in 24 sbr cycles with the first cycle starting at 00 00 the second one at 01 00 and so on according to this plot the maximum value occurs in the sbr cycle that starts at 10 00 which is consistent with the fact that the nitrogen load at that hour of the day was also maximum 2377 k g n d the optimization of this specific cycle concluded that each sbr needs to be equipped with at least 1395 diffusers the above value combined with the effective area per diffuser 0 06 m 2 and the footprint area per sbr 1163 m 2 lead to a density of diffusers of 7 2 and a distance between diffusers of 0 91 m fig 6 shows the optimum values of t a x t a e and t s d expressed as percentage of the total cycle length t c that were obtained for each of the 24 cycles solved in opt 24dwc moreover the concentration of s n o at the end of the non aerated phase is represented an interesting pattern observed in the non aerated phases is that the values of s n o at the end of all these phases were near zero this pattern is consistent with the fundamentals of phase length control of non aerated phases in sbr systems akin and ugurlu 36 therefore the implementation of this control strategy is compulsory for the length of the non aerated phase to be optimized in every single cycle moreover if online sensors of water level and t s s were installed in the sbr tank a lower bound for the value of t s d in every cycle could be derived from t s d m a x d m a x 0 9 d m i n 0 25 d m a x d m i n v s note for v s calculations it would be necessary to enter somehow the value of the s v i then the value of t a e would come out by subtracting from t c the real lengths of t a x and t s d however similarly to the non aerated phase real time strategies aimed at controlling the length of the aerated phase would also be necessary to optimize the performance of the process regarding the hourly profile of d o s p in dwc its value is very easy to automate since three d o levels are observed 1 d o s p 0 5 m g l for cycles that start between 22 00 and 07 00 2 d o s p 3 0 m g l for cycles that start between 08 00 and 13 00 and 3 d o s p values that range between 0 5 and 2 0 m g l for cycles that start between 14 00 and 21 00 eventually the sequence of optimizations carried out in this section has allowed to find an optimum design solution for the problem formulated in section 2 a summary of the main design and operational decisions adopted at the conclusion of this study are summarized in table 6 a simple procedure to assess the sbr design solution is to compare its volume with the optimum design of a conventional pre denitrification nitrification process dn accordingly opt dwc was reformulated and solved for a dn configuration made up of four parallel trains using the same specifications defined in section 2 wastewater effluent quality model coefficients etc in doing so the optimum reactor volume for the dn problem was 4098 m 3 moreover the volume of the secondary settler 2500 m 3 was calculated by assuming a value of 2 h for the h r t van haandel and van der lube 37 this leads to a total volume per train of 6598 m 3 which is 19 8 higher than the optimum volume found with the sbr optimization framework 4 2 soop 2 optimum operation in the long term fig 7 illustrates the optimization results of the opt opex problem for the six operational periods listed in table 4 the length of the anoxic phase t a x increases with temperature having a maximum value in s e p o c t 19 4 as seasonal temperatures become warmer the effluent nitrogen requirements will be met at lower concentrations of m l s s and consequently the length of the settling and drawn phases t s t d will decrease as for the aerated phase its length t a e takes similar values in the six operational periods which can be attributed to the opposite effect that temperature and m l s s have on nitrification therefore the decrement of t d s with temperature will cause similar increments in t a x the optimum values of q w are mainly correlated with the temperature positive the nitrogen load negative and to a lesser extent also with the organic load positive while results for the period between may and october show the positive effect of temperature on q w the effect of the nitrogen and organic loads is easier to analyze in j a n f e b 10 and n o v d e c 15 3 by comparison with m a r a p r 10 and j u l a u g 15 4 respectively while the values of q w are quite similar in j a n f e b and m a r a p r the values of the nitrogen and organic loads are lower in m a r a p r the reduction being of 20 and 27 respectively since these two values are in the same order the opposite effect of both variables on q w cancel each other the optimum result of q w being the same in both periods on the other hand though the temperature in both periods is the same it turns out that q w is quite different in j u l a u g 220 m 3 d and n o v d e c 348 m 3 d the analysis of the nitrogen and organic loads shows higher values in n o v d e c but in this case the first one increases by 7 and the second one by 28 in consequence the positive effect of the organic load prevails thus explaining why q w is higher in this period opt opex also gives interesting guidelines on the long term operation of m l s s in each sbr a clear pattern is recognized in fig 7 that correlates the optimum value of m l s s and seasonal temperatures fluctuations between periods are attributed to changes in the organic load that has a positive effect on l s s for example while temperature is 10 in j a n f e b and m a r a p r the organic load is 27 higher in the first period thus leading to a higher value of m l s s 4085 m g l finally the long term operational costs are shown in fig 8 the first observation id that the aeration costs a e c o s t seem to be uncorrelated with temperature except for the period m a r a p r which has the lowest value of the nitrogen load the values of a e c o s t range between 600 m w h y e a r and 700 m w h y e a r after considering the six operational periods the annual costs in aeration amount to 609 m w h regarding the energy that can be recovered from the sludge surplus by producing methane m e g a i n this variable mainly depends on the organic load this explains why higher values of m e g a i n are obtained in j a n f e b m a y j u n and n o v d e c where the organic load is higher the effluent nitrogen specifications determine the c o d requirements for denitrification since these specifications are the same in all the periods the c o d in excess that will be available for production of methane will be higher in those operational periods characterized by higher organic loads aggregated data for the six operational periods lead to an estimate of the annual gains in energy via methane production of 985 m w h therefore the net energy costs n e c o s t for the whole year give a negative balance of 375 m w h the above means that providing a power to heat ratio of 0 5 in the chp units 80 of the aeration costs can be fully covered by the energy generated in the wwtp such as it has been formulated the opt opex problem includes an equality constrain for the value of d o s p that is fixed to 1 75 m g l a more effective operational strategy in terms of energy costs is to remove this constraint and allow d o s p to adopt different values in each period in doing so the optimization results reveal that the effluent requirements can be met in the six periods with values of d o s p between 0 9 m g l and 1 2 m g l in addition to this the annual value of a e c o s t decreases to 560 m w h 8 and 86 of this energy can be supplied by the chp units this example tries to emphasize the flexibility of the optimization framework to accommodate and solve different problems depending on the specific requirements and priorities 5 conclusions a mathematical framework for sbr processes has been developed that allows exploratory studies aimed at optimizing the design and operation of this technology though a specific instance of the framework has been implemented for sbr configurations without holding tank its mathematical basis can be replicated to other plant layouts even more many components of this framework can be reused to develop similar frameworks for those technologies characterized by non continuous and cyclic operational patterns e g intermittent aeration processes biodenitro atad etc the optimization study for a population of 100000 ie reveals that the volume of the sbr is determined by wet weather conditions that is by hydraulic considerations similarly the aeration needs are determined by the peak load of nitrogen under dry weather conditions in this regard the sbr process exhibits a weak capacity to absorb peak loads the analysis of the long term operation shows that if the total length of the cycle is kept constant the best strategy to minimize energy costs is to adapt the sludge surplus flow rate depending on the long term variations in temperature nitrogen load and to a lesser extent organic load also as seasonal temperatures become warmer the length of the settling and drawn phases can be decreased as a result the length of the reaction phase increases the effluent requirements can be met at a lower concentration of m l s s and the aeration costs can be optimized declaration of competing interest the

13710,the operational flexibility of sequencing batch reactors sbr makes this technology especially resilient to changes in functional requirements a main feature of sbrs is that plant upgrading from nitrogen to phosphorus removal specifications becomes straightforward by simple adaptation of the manipulated variables in contrast the optimum design and operation of these processes is an intricate problem whose formulation involves multiple considerations such as mathematical descriptions for both biological transformations and solids separation phenomena design procedures for air diffusers etc moreover the dynamic nature of sbrs adds extra complexity when it comes to solving optimization problems for this technology in this paper a model based optimization framework is proposed to solve the optimum design and operation of sbr systems this framework splits the whole problem into two single objective optimization sub problems the dimensions of the sbr are first calculated then the operational costs in the long term are optimized a case study for a population of 100000 inhabitant equivalent demonstrates the potential of the framework keywords asm1 modelling nitrogen removal optimization wastewater 1 introduction if before the computer revolution continuous flow wastewater treatment processes were clearly prevalent the arrival of industrial automation technologies gave rise to new plant designs characterized by non continuous and cyclic operational patterns four well known treatment technologies that exhibit this feature in their manipulated variables are atad auto thermal thermophilic digestion layden et al 1 biodenitro biodenipho isaacs 2 and sbr sequencing batch reactor artan and orhon 3 advances in computer technology have also drastically changed the way of facing engineering problems in general model based simulation has become a valuable technology to undertake the design and operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtp hvala el at 4 additionally the adoption of resource recovery and energy efficiency criteria in wwtps is leading to more complex designs combining emerging treatment technologies solon et al 5 a direct implication of the above is that for the design of such plants sophisticated frameworks relying on an effective exploitation of simulation tools will be necessary as reliable mathematical formulations of the most relevant wastewater treatment technologies are available in the literature all these models have been integrated into wwtp specific simulation software packages that provide user friendly environments to facilitate solving design and operation problems gernaey et al 6 usually the design of wwtps is formulated as a sequence of two sub problems in a first stage steady state conditions are considered to obtain a preliminary solution then this solution is refined by running dynamic simulations in which the short term variability of the influent wastewater is considered the problem of finding the preliminary solution under steady state conditions has been traditionally addressed by using reduced models implemented in spreadsheets bengtson 7 the main advantage of this approach is that from a mathematical point of view the solution can be easily calculated on the other hand a simplistic formulation of the problem implies that the obtained solution must be scaled up with too conservative safety margins which results in cost ineffective designs when optimum solutions need to be found a consequence of formulating the design and operation of wwtps in terms of more accurate and complex models is that it is not possible to solve the problem by simple calculations in that case simulation tools are of great help to run steady state studies in which any combination of the decision variables dv can be simulated to see whether it fulfils the problem requirements or not however since this approach relies on trial and error techniques both the time to completion and the quality of the solution are strongly dependent on the user skills in addition as the treatment process increases in complexity so it does the number of dvs and trial and error methods become cumbersome even for experienced designers thus in the last years the development of automatic problem solving procedures and tools that try to exploit the potential of mathematical programming techniques in the wastewater field becomes a relevant subject hreiz et al 8 it is in general accepted that the solution to the design of wwtps requires considering trade offs between several conflicting criteria namely maximizing treatment efficiency minimizing capital costs capex and minimizing operational costs opex this means that in a strict sense a multi objective approach is the correct formulation to specify and solve this kind of problems multi objective optimization problems moop lead to multiple solutions under the notion of optimality expressed by the concept of the so called pareto dominance when solved moops provide a finite set of solutions known as the pareto front pf all of them being equally optimal from a mathematical perspective therefore it is the responsibility of the decision maker dm to decide which specific solution of the pf is preferred over the others in the wastewater treatment domain hakanen et al 9 present an interactive moo tool for design of wastewater treatment plants unlike other moo techniques interactive moo allows dms to participate at every iteration of the resolution process by classifying the current pareto optimal solution in order to reflect their preferences in espírito santo et al 10 a multi objective elitist genetic algorithm is proposed to minimize the total costs and the effluent quality of an activated sludge process asp use of genetic algorithms to solve similar problems is also reported by doby et al 11 egea et al 12 and hreiz et al 13 to solve similar moo problems the design and operation of wwtps has been also formulated as a single objective optimization problem soop some works define the problem first as a moop and then convert this problem into a soop where the single objective function is defined as a weighted sum of each individual objective moles et al 14 behera et al 15 a different approach consists in dividing the whole moop into a set of soops that are solved in sequence rivas et al 16 this procedure relies on the fact that though effluent quality and operating costs are conflicting objectives they can be optimized separately the flow rate and composition of the wastewater in dry weather conditions dwc and winter temperature determine the minimum volume necessary to accomplish with the effluent quality requirements therefore these conditions are usually considered first to calculate the optimum size of the plant then with this result a second phase is carried out to explore optimum operational strategies for scenarios that are biologically more favorable low influent load summer temperatures etc ad hoc formulations of the above problem as soops can be found in guerrero et al 17 and ostace et al 18 though mathematical optimization has been applied to a large variety of wastewater plant designs most of the reported studies have concentrated however on continuous processes in contrast similar works for either semi batch or alternating processes are much less frequent and all of them have dealt with the optimization of those variables operated according to a cyclic strategy baeza et al 19 chachuat et al 20 bournazou et al 21 piotrowski et al 22 there is no evidence of mathematical optimization approaches using complex models that simultaneously address the design and operation of these processes the only known reference in this respect is velmurugan et al 23 where a model based optimization method to design sbr processes is presented however simplified expressions are specified to formulate the whole problem in addition no details are given on how the steady state regime is computed by this method while the mathematical formulation of steady state conditions in continuous processes is straightforward by setting to zero the time derivative of all the state variables the above does not hold for systems operated according to cyclic patterns this explains in part why mathematical formulations on optimum design of these systems try to skip this issue by using algebraic descriptions of the treatment process this paper presents a moo framework for design and operation of sbr processes compared to other previous works a substantial contribution of this methodology is its mathematical foundation which is based on the utilization of a comprehensive dynamic model for the sbr process such as it will be explained in detail later the approach of posing the moop as a sequence of soops has been adopted in this framework before introducing the mathematical framework the design specifications including the sbr configuration the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated the effluent requirements the range of operating temperatures etc are defined first then the mathematical formulation of the moo problem and the resolution methodology is posed finally the most remarkable results obtained after applying the design methodology are described 2 design specifications 2 1 sbr configuration sbr technology is a generic term that covers multiple design configurations all of them sharing some kind of cyclic operation in order for biological transformations and solid liquid separation to take place in the same tank wilderer et al 24 sbr designs can be classified in two broad categories based on whether they include a holding tank or not in this paper the specifications relative to the wastewater characteristics correspond to a population size of about 100000 inhabitant equivalent ie existing full scale sbr plants with treatment capacities in the order of the above specification reveal a preference for designs without holding tank it is for this reason that the sbr configuration without holding tank has been adopted in this work moreover the number of sbrs n r working in parallel varies depending on the size of the plant while typical designs for small plants are made up of two sbr tanks as the size of the plant increases the number of sbrs also increases up to six tanks in our specific problem since the treatment capacity corresponds to a medium size plant the number of sbr tanks has been set to four reactors n r 4 2 2 wastewater characteristics when optimum designs need to be found the importance of gathering accurate and sufficient information on the wastewater characteristics should not be underestimated any result with the most powerful optimization tool turns out meaningless if previously the characteristics of the wastewater have not been well ascertained consequently the next step in the problem definition is to specify the wastewater to be treated to this end instead of creating a new influent from scratch on grounds of efficiency the influent profile reported in the bsm1 lt simulation protocol has been chosen rosen et al 25 this protocol contains detailed information on the short and long term characteristics of a fictitious settled wastewater representative of a medium size urban area more concretely the wastewater fluctuations in flow rate composition expressed in terms of the asm1 model state variables henze et al 26 and temperature are given at regular intervals of 15 minutes for a whole period of 609 days though the main patterns contained in this information were kept slight adaptations were carried out in this work for the wastewater composition to be more consistent with typical ratios in settled wastewaters henze et al 27 thus with respect to their original values the total suspended solids t s s and the easily biodegradable organic substrate s s were reduced by 23 and 13 respectively while ammonia n h 4 n was increased by 22 in addition the fraction of nitrogen in s s i n s s the ratio between filtered c o d f c o d and n h 4 n and the ratio between particulate c o d p c o d and volatile suspended solids v s s were respectively set to i n s s 0 03 m g n m g c o d f c o d n h 4 n 5 m g c o d m g n and p c o d v s s 2 07 m g c o d m g v s s nonetheless for the problem considered in this paper it would be completely unacceptable to assume that the wastewater characteristics are known a priori with such a granularity many state variables in the asm1 can be neither measured nor identified moreover in real world applications wastewater information is collected from 24 hour composite samples exceptionally some grab samples are analyzed to quantify the hourly variations that the wastewater exhibits during dry and wet weather periods thus the available input information for our problem has to be consistent with the above considerations accordingly the size of the original dataset was reduced and converted into a new dataset based on daily observations and aggregated features the first column in table 1 shows the features that were selected for the new dataset this dataset consisted of 52 daily observations each one taken at random from each week of a whole year descriptive statistics of these observations are summarized in table 1 and fig 1 the wastewater characteristics for dwc were obtained from the above dataset by considering the three following percentiles 1 90 for n h 4 n l o a d 2 99 for t o t a l c o d and n h 4 n then these percentiles were combined with the above mentioned values for the wastewater ratios to calculate the values shown in table 2 furthermore fig 2 illustrates the hourly characteristics of the wastewater for dwc similarly the wastewater characteristics for wet weather conditions wwc were determined by assuming the same pollution load as in dwc but considering the maximum instantaneous wastewater flow rate of the year table 2 2 3 effluent quality requirements the specification for the quality of the effluent has been taken from the eu directive concerning urban wastewater treatment 91 271 ec this eu directive imposes daily average upper limits of 10 m g n l and 1 m g p l for the concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp at the effluent of wwtps larger than 100000 ie in this paper it has been assumed that the secondary treatment i e the sbr will focus only on nitrogen removal though no requirements for the effluent ammonia concentrations n h 4 e f f are explicitly included in the eu directive some local water regulations also impose an upper limit to this compound moreover since at low concentrations of n h 4 e f f nitrification is more stable it is a general rule of designers to specify their own requirement for this compound with all these things considered the effluent quality specifications daily average values that the design of the sbr must satisfy are formulated by eq 1 wherein the first constraint reflects a safety specification 1 n h 4 e f f 2 m g n l t n e f f 10 m g n l 2 4 decision variables dvs the cyclic operation of sbrs is determined by the action of four manipulated variables namely the feeding valve the drawn valve mixing and the aeration system each of these manipulated variables follows a specific cyclic pattern being the length of the cycle t c h the same for all these patterns moreover some of these patterns cannot be freely chosen but they must meet certain constraints for instance in sbrs without holding tank the feeding valve has to be open at the beginning of the cycle and the time t f h that this valve must be kept open is determined by t f t c n r similarly if biological reactions must be active while the feeding valve is open then the mixing equipment must be switched on at the beginning of the cycle moreover prior to opening the drawn valve mixing and aeration must be switched off for a sufficient length of time t s h being this interval usually known as the settling phase the interval t d h in which the drawn valve is open is named the drawn phase finally the reaction phase corresponds to that interval of time t m h in which mixing is on the activation and deactivation of the aeration system during the reaction phase will result in specific sub phases with the sbr tank operating at aerobic anoxic or anaerobic conditions based on the above considerations fig 3 illustrates the cyclic operation of the above four variables for a sbr without holding tank n r 4 and the phases that result from such an operation in that cycle the reaction phase has been divided into two sub phases the first one non aerated and the second one aerated in what follows the length of these sub phases will be respectively denoted by t a x h and t a e h after introducing the sequential phases that result from a cyclic operation of the manipulated variables in the sbr the dvs corresponding to these phases are t a x t a e t s and t d the sum of all them being the total cycle length t c and the feeding time t f t c n r besides the length of the different phases the design of sbr systems involves additional dvs one is the working volume v m i n m 3 of each sbr at the beginning of the cycle for a given v m i n and steady state conditions the maximum volume v m a x m 3 is expressed by eq 2 2 v m a x v m i n 1 24 0 t c n r q i n f t d t s s c v m a x v m i n q i n f t c 24 n r other dvs are the volume of sludge surplus withdrawn from each sbr tank every day q w m 3 d and the dissolved oxygen set point in the aerated phase d o s p m g l every cycle the sludge surplus is withdrawn during a short interval t w before the beginning of the settling phase fig 3 the volume of sludge withdrawn per cycle v w c y c l e m 3 c y c l e can be expressed as 3 v w c y c l e q w t c 24 q w t w since the d o concentration in the sbr at the beginning of the aerated phase is near zero some rise time will be necessary for this process variable to reach the d o s p set point if it is assumed that the injection of air is continuously regulated then the rise time t r is another dv since its value will affect the sbr performance finally aeration systems in sbr processes are usually designed with fine bubble diffusers fbd therefore the number of diffusers n d i f to be installed in each sbr tank is another dv n d i f mainly depends on the available footprint and the peak oxygen demand in conclusion all the dvs that will take part in the optimum design of the sbr configuration without holding tank are summarized here t a x t a e t s t d v m i n q w d o s p t r and n d i f in what follows all these variables will be grouped in the vector p 2 5 additional design considerations the first consideration refers to the shape of the sbr calculating the geometry of the sbr is also part of the design problem in this case for the physical construction of the sbr tank a rectangular geometry has been adopted based on typical design criteria relative to the length l width w and depth d of rectangular aeration tanks the two following ratios have been imposed g 1 l w 5 and g 2 w d 3 if v m a x is the maximum effective volume of each sbr tank its water depth and footprint area are calculated by eq 4 4 d m a x m v m a x g 1 g 2 2 3 a c m 2 f d m a x d m a x 2 g 1 g 2 2 in the next section it will be shown that d m a x puts respectively lower and upper bounds on the settling time t s and the number of diffusers n d i f the second consideration is that it will be assumed that the wwtp includes anaerobic digestion units to treat the sludge stream this issue will be brought back when dealing with the problem of optimizing the operational costs of the sbr the third and last consideration is related to the fact that steady state operating conditions never occur in real world wwtps however as mentioned above for the design of these systems it is in practice more convenient to find first a preliminary solution assuming steady state regime and then refine this solution by running simulations under dynamic operating conditions nonetheless for non continuous processes since even the steady state regime is dynamic the search of this preliminary solution also requires running simulations let x be the state vector of the sbr process x t the value of this vector at a given instant t and t c the length of the cycle it can be stated with generality that steady state conditions are reached if and only if the following expression is satisfied x t x t t c t such a definition of the steady state regime for non continuous processes allows its calculation by combining dynamic simulation with optimization methods in terms of optimization the steady state problem can be posed as follows 5 min x ini i x f i x i n i i 2 s t x f x ini x i n i i 0 i 1 2 n where x f x f 1 x f 2 x f n contains the final state that results after simulating the process for just one cycle i e t s i m t c and starting from an initial state x i n i x i n i 1 x i n i 2 x i n i n therefore for any given sbr process specified by p p 0 and an initial state x i n i the final state x f can be seen as a function x f f x i n i p 0 eq 5 is proposed by dionisi et al 28 to find the steady state regime of sbr processes the same approach has been followed in this paper with small adaptations to increase the efficiency of the method more specifically with the objective of reducing the time to compute f x i n i p one cycle simulations were implemented in a dynamic link library d l l moreover while in 28 the euler method is used to compute the above function here a slight variation of this method has been implemented that consists in assigning a different time step for each phase in the sbr cycle preceding the computation of f x i n i p the value of each time step is calculated based on a predefined baseline time step δ t s t e p and the length of the corresponding phase t p h i 0 as follows 6 n s t e p s i m a x i n t t p h i δ t s t e p 1 δ t s t e p i t p h i n s t e p s i 3 problem formulation instead of defining the problem as a single moop the approach adopted here has been based on dividing the whole problem into a sequence of two soops while the objective function to be minimized in the first problem is the volume of the sbr in the second one the focus will be put on the optimization of the operating costs 3 1 sbr model equations in this section the mathematical model of the sbr process is introduced in this model biochemical transformations have been formulated using the standard asm1 model in addition to this since sbrs are variable volume systems for the sake of simplicity the state vector m of the model has been expressed in mass units thus the state vector m m g and its counterpart x m v m g l in concentration units are 7 m m s t m p t t m s m s o m s s m s n d m s n h m s n o m s i m s a l k t m p m x i m x s m x n d m x b h m x b a m x p m x i n t x x s t x p t t s o s s s n d s n h s n o s i s a l k x i x s x n d x b h x b a x p x i n t let e v i n f e v e f f e v m i x e v w and e v a be five binary variables e v 0 1 each one representing respectively the state either o n or o f f of the feeding valve the drawn valve the mixing equipment the sludge surplus valve and the aeration system along the cycle see fig 3 by this notation a compact formulation for the sbr model can be derived 8 d v d t q i n f e v i n f t q e f f e v e f f t q w

q e f f e v e f f t f n s s x p where q e f f m 3 d is the effluent flow rate when the drawn valve is o n x i n f x i n f s t x i n f p t t is a vector that contains the wastewater characteristics e e s e p and ρ m g l d are respectively the stoichiometric matrix and the kinetic vector of the asm1 model q w m 3 d is the sludge surplus flow rate when its corresponding valve e v w in o n and f n s s is the fraction of non settleable solids during the settling phase in eq 8 no explicit terms associated with the external aeration are present since external aeration only affects the dissolved oxygen m s o the equations of this phenomena have been taken out of the compact form in this regard let d m s o d t c m denote the time derivative obtained from the compact model for the state m s o the sbr model assumes that during the aerated sub phases the dissolved oxygen concentration is controlled and ideally follows a ramp trajectory until it reaches d o s p irizar et al 29 the main advantage of this assumption is that since it is not necessary to implement explicit equations for a real d o controller the convergence of optimization problems based on the proposed model becomes faster and more robust moreover by formulating a ramp trajectory where the slope is a parameter the effect of this parameter on the oxygen peak requirements can be easily estimated thus the final equations for the time derivative of the dissolved oxygen are these 9 d m s o d t d m s o d t c m k l a m i x s o s a t s o v 0 t t a x v d o s p s o i n i t r s o d v d t t a x t t a x m i n t a e t r 0 t t a x m i n t a e t r where k l a m i x d 1 is the value of the oxygen transfer coefficient for mixing and non aerated conditions s o i n i is the value of s o at the beginning of the aerated phase d o s p and t r d are the dissolved oxygen set point and the rise time for the aerated sub phase and t is the time elapsed since the start of the aeration sub phase regarding the equation of the sbr model during the settling phase e v i n f t 0 e v m i x t 0 e v a t 0 and e v e f f t 0 the settling model considered in this paper makes two assumptions 1 no biological reactions take place in the settler and 2 sludge thickening is instantaneous in addition the sbr model includes a parameter f n s s to take into account the concentration of solids in the sludge blanket during the drawn phase nonetheless instantaneous settling is far from what happens in real sbrs which immediately raises the question if this sbr model is valid or not since biological reactions and solids separation share the same tank for the optimum design of sbr processes same consideration must be given to one phenomenon as to the other for this reason it was necessary to adapt the instantaneous settling model with empirical knowledge on the performance of full scale sbr processes specifically the model equation proposed by teichgräber et al 30 for the settling velocity of the sludge blanket v s m h has been adopted eq 10 this variable exhibits an inverse dependence on both the initial concentration of suspended solids at the beginning of the settling phase x r m g l and the sludge volume index of the mixed liquor s v i m l g 10 v s 650 x r 1000 s v i similarly a practical recommendation to prevent the discharge of suspended solids during the drawn phase is that the sludge blanket must be kept at least 10 and 0 25 m below the water depth d t v t a c this imposes two constraints on the length of the settling and drawn phases eq 11 whose expressions have been obtained under the assumption that during the drawn phase i e e v i n f t 0 e v m i x t 0 e v a t 0 and e v e f f t 1 the effluent flow rate is constant and calculated by this expression q e f f m 3 d 24 a c d m a x d m i n t d 11 t s t d t s d m i n m a x d m a x 0 9 d m i n 0 25 d m a x d m i n v s t s t s m i n m a x 0 1 d m a x 0 25 v s where d m i n is the water depth at the end of the drawn phase i e the water depth at the beginning of the cycle finally mathematical expressions used by fbd manufacturers to calculate the number of diffusers n d i f have been integrated into the sbr model data sheets of commercial diffusers include valuable information for design such as for instance 1 effective area per diffuser 2 tolerable distances between diffusers 3 range of values for the air flow rate per diffuser q d i f n m 3 h and 4 curves of the standard oxygen transfer efficiency s o t e at different air flow rates and water depths moreover some algebraic expressions found in baird and bridgewater 31 and mccutcheon et al 32 have been adopted here to estimate the saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen under process conditions with all these things considered the following equations were included in the sbr model to determine n d i f 12 s o s a t t c w e 139 34411 157570 1 273 15 t 66423080 273 15 t 2 12432 10 6 273 15 t 3 8621949 10 5 273 15 t 4 p v t 101325 e 11 8751 3840 7 273 15 t 216961

of dissolved oxygen t is the temperature of the mixed liquor p v p a is the partial pressure of water vapor in saturated air ρ w t k g m 3 is the water density d e m is the effective depth of the tank δ is a correction factor for s o s a t that considers the partial pressure of oxygen in air bubbles under clean water conditions p k o r k g h is the peak demand of oxygen in the sbr tank during the aerated phase d o s p m g l is the oxygen set point during the aerated phase q a i r n m 3 h is the maximum air flow rate during the aerated phase and β α and θ are constants for a given value of the footprint of each sbr tank a c the range of acceptable distances between diffusers provided by fbd manufactures impose a lower and an upper bound on n d i f since a c is a function of d m a x the depth of the mixed liquor at the end of the feeding phase then d m a x constraints the range of potential solutions for n d i f 3 2 soop 1 finding the optimum sbr volume the variable volume nature of sbr designs without holding tank makes the optimization of this dv an intricate problem that requires multiple operating scenarios to be analyzed together eq 2 shows that the maximum working volume v m a x depends on two decision variables providing n r is known v m i n and t c since these two variables are manipulated variables at least in theory their values can change during the operation of the sbr however short term changes of v m i n and t c are difficult to deal with in real world scenarios for instance a special requirement for designs without holding tank is that all the sbrs must operate in a synchronized manner specifically the end of the filling phase in the i t h sbr tank must coincide with the termination of the cycle in the i 1 t h tank since the length of the filling phase t f is a function of t c changes in t c affect both the end of the filling phase and the end of the cycle it is for this reason that in practice the value of t c is not adjusted from cycle to cycle it is preferable to limit any change in t c to the long term operation whereas keeping it constant in the short term s imilarly if v m i n was changed from cycle to cycle the filling and the drawn volumes in every cycle would not be equal this adds an extra complexity to the operation of the whole system whose real benefits however are not clear therefore for the sake of simplicity changes of v m i n in full scale sbrs are also limited to the long term operation it must be noticed that v m i n has a lower limit that depends on the s v i eq 9 in this regards long term adjustment of v m i n could be even necessary in periods characterized by large s v i values 13 0 9 v m i n s v i x r v m a x s v i m t s s 3 2 1 steady state optimum design at dry weather conditions opt dwc the main objective of the first optimization problem soop 1 is to find an optimum value of v m a x which involves formulating and solving several optimization sub problems this is because the design of sbrs is a compromise between biological effluent quality requirements and hydraulic specifications influent flow rate the most demanding scenario from a biological perspective corresponds to dwc and minimum temperature the lowest temperature is shown in table 1 t m i n 10 the wastewater characteristics for dwc are defined in table 2 with their corresponding values in terms of the state variables of the sbr model given in table 3 for the latter the following ratios have been specified s s f c o d 0 35 s i f c o d 0 20 x i p c o d 0 24 and x b h p c o d 0 13 i n s s 0 03 m g n m g c o d i n s i i n x i 0 04 m g n m g c o d and i n x b h 0 08 m g n m g c o d eventually the optimization sub problem to determine the optimum v m a x under biological considerations is formulated by eq 14 notice that the constraint for the effluent quality is t n e f f 9 when in fact the design specification is less stringent t n e f f 10 this is however necessary to compensate the fact of assuming steady state conditions and average wastewater characteristics opt dwc 14 min p x ini v m a x d w c s t x f f x ini p x ini t n e f f 9 s n h e f f 2 t a x t a e t f t s t d t s d m i n t s t s m i n d o s p

x i n i d w c be the optimum solution found by sub problem opt dwc similarly let the sub array m p d w c v m i n d w c x p i n i d w c contain the mass value of each particulate state at the beginning of the cycle now moving on to the scenario of wwc it must be noted that in this scenario hydraulic considerations become more demanding than any other issue in the sbr reactor in this regard a second optimization sub problem needs to be defined and solved to calculate the optimum v m a x w w c for this scenario the influent wastewater that corresponds to this sub problem is shown in table 3 before going into this problem it is worth analyzing whether it can be formulated independently of opt dwc or not the worst hydraulic scenario happens when wwc occur after a long period of dwc this is because in such a situation the sbr process must deal during wwc with a total mass of suspended solids in the tank whose value is determined by dwc therefore this connection between the mass of suspended solids that results from dwc and the influent wastewater for wwc must be somehow specified in the optimization problem let m p w w c represent the mass of each particulate state in the sbr under wwc a simple way of establishing such a connection is to pose the following constraint m p w w c m p d w c at the same time the above condition also requires the function x f f x i n i p to be slightly modified in this modified version denoted by x f f m x i n i p the time derivative of the particulate states are all internally forced to zero which means that their values remain constant along the cycle note to be precise the above condition applies to all particulate states except to m x s and m x n d after this explanation the optimum volume v m a x under wwc can be obtained from the following optimization problem opt wwc 15 min p x ini v max w w c s t x f f m x ini p x ini m p ini m p d w c t n e f f 10 t a x t a e t f t s t d t s d m i n t s t s m i n d o s p 1 75 t r 10 60 q w q w d w c w i t h p t a x t a e t s t d v m i n q w d o s p t r n d i f the constraint s n h e f f 2 has been deliberately left out of this problem as it has been explained in section 2 3 this constraint was included only to ensuring the stability of nitrifying bacteria for their transient nature wwc are not a major concern as to cause the loss of nitrification as long as the settling phase takes the time necessary to prevent the escape of biomass from the effluent eventually given the connection between sub problems opt dwc and opt wwc the following sequence of optimizations need to be run 1 both sub problems are solved and the values of the footprint area a c d w c and a c w w c are compared to each other the greatest of these two values will be adopted as the design value for the footprint area of each sbr tank a c m a x a c d w c a c w w c 2 in a second run the following equality constraint a c a c is added to both sub problems before being solved again in this case the values of v m i n d w c and v m i n w w c are compared to each other again the greatest of these two values will be adopted as the design value for v m i n v m i n m a x v m i n d w c v m i n w w c 3 finally the constraint v m i n v m i n is imposed in both sub problems that are solved a third time to get p d w c and p w w c 3 2 3 design considerations related to the hourly variability of the wastewater once completed the above sequence the solution found in opt dwc must be analyzed when considering the hourly variability of the influent wastewater see fig 2 to this end a third optimization sub problem must be defined opt 24dwc which besides must be repeated 24 times once for each hour of the day as in opt wwc the same constraint needs to be formulated for the particulate states m p 24 d w c m p d w c in addition both the minimum volume and the length of the cycle in this problem must be set equal to the optimum values obtained when solving opt dwc v m i n d w c and t c d w c the complete definition of this sub problem is shown below opt 24dwc 16 min p x ini t n e f f s t x f f m x ini p x ini m p ini m p d w c v m i n v m i n t c t c d w c q w q w d w c t a x t a

optimize t n e f f it has been assumed that the sbr design implements real time controllers to automatically optimize in each cycle the length of the reaction phases and d o s p let t n e f f i be the optimum value for the i t h hour of the day i 0 1 2 23 for the sbr design solutions calculated in opt dwc and opt wwc to be accepted as final solutions the following condition must be satisfied 17 1 24 i 0 23 t n e f f i 10 otherwise it means that the constraint t n e f f 9 defined in opt dwc was not enough tough in such a case it would be necessary to make this constraint more stringent for instance t n e f f 8 5 and then start over the whole procedure of optimizations until eq 17 is fulfilled with all these things considered eventually the final solution for the optimum volume v m a x would result from computing the following expression 18 v m a x m a x v m a x w w c m a x v m a x i i 0 1 23 similarly the optimum number of diffusers n d i f is obtained from the opt 24dwc problem and specifically from that optimization where the peak value of q a i r during the aerobic sub phase is maximum the influent wastewater used in this optimization problem is shown in table 3 and corresponds to those points in fig 2 represented by white circles 3 3 soop 2 long term optimization of the sbr operation the optimum size of the sbr tanks is calculated by solving the sequence of optimization problems defined in the previous section now this design is used to formulate further problems but in this case with the focus put on optimizing the operational costs of the process here it will be assumed that the dv with the greatest impact on the operational costs is the external aeration q a i r tchobanoglous et al 33 power consumption in blowers p b k w can be formulated by eq 19 as a function of q a i r u s epa 34 19 p b t q a i r p 1 16 96 η b p 1 d t 9 806 p 1 0 283 1 where p b k w is the wire power consumption of the blower q a i r n m 3 m i n is the air flow rate p 1 k p a is the blower inlet pressure d t is the water depth and η b 0 6 is the combined blower motor efficiency on the other hand q w determines the sludge production and therefore the amount of methane gas that can be obtained from the anaerobic digesters this amount can be expressed in energy units through the net calorific value of methane 13 89 k w h k g c h 4 all in all the net energy costs m w h y e a r in each sbr tank can be evaluated by the following expression 20 n e c o s t 1 t c 0 t c p b t d t η a d 13 89 24 4 1000 q w x r b i o n r 365 24 1000 where x r b i o m g c o d l is the total biodegradable c o d concentration of the sludge surplus withdrawn from the sbr and η a d 0 7 is the efficiency of the anaerobic digestion and chp units in terms of energy recovery from the feeding sludge the long term operation of urban wwtps is mainly affected by the seasonal variability of both the influent wastewater and the temperature optimizing the long term operation means minimizing eq 20 in response to this kind of seasonal disturbances however it is important to bear in mind that energy costs and process stability are conflicting goals the price of optimizing the energy costs is that the risk of process failures increases for instance minimization of the energy costs would result in operational regions characterized by low aerated fractions combined with low sludge retention times that is regions where nitrification is more sensitive to overloads temperature drops etc in this respect any sbr plant designed according to the above criteria should be equipped with advanced real time controllers in charge of guaranteeing the stability of the process otherwise the optimum solution must be a trade off between operating costs and process stability which somehow should be present in the problem formulation a simple way followed in this paper has been to force an upper constraint on the effluent ammonia for any given wastewater characteristics and temperature conditions the optimum solution will provide those values of the operational variables i e t a x t a e t s t d d o s p t r and q w that minimize n e c o s t for operational simplicity the length of the cycle t c and v m i n has been forced to take respectively the values t c d w c and v m i n found in soop 1 similarly the value of d o s p has been fixed to 1 75 m g l with all these considerations this

52 daily observations of the initial dataset table 1 were grouped into periods of 2 consecutive months 6 periods in total for each period the wastewater characteristics were calculated by averaging only those samples that corresponded to dry weather conditions table 4 the calculation of the optimum long term pattern for the manipulated variables involves solving opt opex for each wastewater specified in table 4 3 4 problem solving implementation in this paper the default values for the coefficients of the asm1 model were applied to solve the problem defined in the previous sections though considering uncertainty issues in our problem would have been more rigorous they have been taken out on purpose two reasons have supported the above decision 1 the assumption that the sbr design includes feedback controllers and 2 the optimum volume is calculated for a value of d o s p equal to 1 75 m g l in order to provide the real design with an extra operational margin that might be used if necessary the whole mathematical framework described in the previous section has been programmed in an excel workbook worksheet based user interfaces have been implemented to configure each optimization problem opt dwc opt wwc opt 24dwc and opt opex the function that simulates one cycle x f f x i n i p 0 has been implemented in a dynamic link library dll customized functions and macros have been programmed in the excel workbook that allow f x i n i p 0 to be called from specific cells finally the excel solver add in fronlinesolvers has been used to run the optimization problems specifically the nonlinear generalized reduced gradient grg solver has been adopted in this work lasdon at al 35 4 results and discussion 4 1 soop 1 optimum volume table 5 illustrates the optimum values of p and v m a x found in opt dwc and opt wwc after completing the optimization sequence described in section 3 2 2 it can be seen how biological and hydraulic considerations led to different values for the optimum length of the cycle t c 3 52 and 2 42 h respectively in dwc it is the time required for biological reactions t a x and t a e that has a major impact on t c on the other hand in wwc the settling and drawn phases t s and t d are more influential on the value of t c the design values of each sbr tank for both the footprint area a c and the working volume at the beginning of the cycle v m i n were respectively a c 1163 m 2 and v m i n 4039 m 3 when designing sbr systems a subtle difference with the design of continuous processes is that the concentration of suspended solids in the mixed liquor m l s s is not formulated as a problem constraint in continuous treatment systems biological reactions and solids separation take place in specific units the total volume depends on the m l s s concentration in the biological unit high values of m l s s result in large volumes because large settling tanks are required but low values of m l s s also lead to large volumes in this case because the biological volume has to be large it is generally accepted that there is an intermediate range for this variable between 3000 m g l and 4000 m g l where the total volume of both units is minimum based on the above optimization problems for design of biological units in continuous processes usually include an equality constraint for the value of m l s s e g m l s s 3500 m g l in contrast since sbr systems perform biological reactions and solids separation in the same tank their optimum design requires both operations and their dependencies to be part of the problem formulation for this reason if a given value is specified for m l s s as a constraint then the design is not optimum in a strict sense it is only when the optimization algorithm has no constraints on m l s s that an optimum solution can be found in our particular problem the optimum concentration of solids in opt dwc was m l s s 5157 m g l this value was calculated at the beginning of the settling phase and the sludge retention time s r t was 24 1 d all the design results were obtained by considering for the s v i parameter a value of 150 m l g in fig 4 the hourly variation of v m a x and t n e f f obtained after solving opt 24dwc are graphically visualized these results reproduce the dynamic performance of the sbr design solution for dwc and at the minimum temperature of the year t 10 the first observation is that the peak value of v m a x 5179 m 3 was lower than that found in opt wwc 5507 m 3 therefore each sbr tank will have to be designed with an effective capacity of at least 5507 m 3 furthermore the daily average of value of t n e f f eq 17 was 10 0 m g n l that is compliant with the effluent quality specification t n e f f 10 m g n l therefore no iterations were required to recalculate the design solution the shape of t n e f f in fig 4 evidences a weak capacity of the sbr process to absorb peak loads conversely the above drawback is compensated by the strong potential of the sbr to achieve effluents of very high quality when the nitrogen load is below its treatment capacity as for the daily average concentration of ammonia at the effluent the result was s n h e f f 4 4 m g n l which means that in the most demanding operating conditions the tough requirement for t n e f f will be met but to the detriment of a relatively high concentration of ammonia a solid argument for the installation of feedback controllers in sbr systems is that their faculty to reject disturbances will be crucial to keep nitrification stable in these operating conditions the amount of diffusers n d i f to be installed in each sbr tank was calculated based on the peak demand of oxygen whose value 313 2 k g o 2 h can be seen in fig 5 this figure plots the peak oxygen requirements in 24 sbr cycles with the first cycle starting at 00 00 the second one at 01 00 and so on according to this plot the maximum value occurs in the sbr cycle that starts at 10 00 which is consistent with the fact that the nitrogen load at that hour of the day was also maximum 2377 k g n d the optimization of this specific cycle concluded that each sbr needs to be equipped with at least 1395 diffusers the above value combined with the effective area per diffuser 0 06 m 2 and the footprint area per sbr 1163 m 2 lead to a density of diffusers of 7 2 and a distance between diffusers of 0 91 m fig 6 shows the optimum values of t a x t a e and t s d expressed as percentage of the total cycle length t c that were obtained for each of the 24 cycles solved in opt 24dwc moreover the concentration of s n o at the end of the non aerated phase is represented an interesting pattern observed in the non aerated phases is that the values of s n o at the end of all these phases were near zero this pattern is consistent with the fundamentals of phase length control of non aerated phases in sbr systems akin and ugurlu 36 therefore the implementation of this control strategy is compulsory for the length of the non aerated phase to be optimized in every single cycle moreover if online sensors of water level and t s s were installed in the sbr tank a lower bound for the value of t s d in every cycle could be derived from t s d m a x d m a x 0 9 d m i n 0 25 d m a x d m i n v s note for v s calculations it would be necessary to enter somehow the value of the s v i then the value of t a e would come out by subtracting from t c the real lengths of t a x and t s d however similarly to the non aerated phase real time strategies aimed at controlling the length of the aerated phase would also be necessary to optimize the performance of the process regarding the hourly profile of d o s p in dwc its value is very easy to automate since three d o levels are observed 1 d o s p 0 5 m g l for cycles that start between 22 00 and 07 00 2 d o s p 3 0 m g l for cycles that start between 08 00 and 13 00 and 3 d o s p values that range between 0 5 and 2 0 m g l for cycles that start between 14 00 and 21 00 eventually the sequence of optimizations carried out in this section has allowed to find an optimum design solution for the problem formulated in section 2 a summary of the main design and operational decisions adopted at the conclusion of this study are summarized in table 6 a simple procedure to assess the sbr design solution is to compare its volume with the optimum design of a conventional pre denitrification nitrification process dn accordingly opt dwc was reformulated and solved for a dn configuration made up of four parallel trains using the same specifications defined in section 2 wastewater effluent quality model coefficients etc in doing so the optimum reactor volume for the dn problem was 4098 m 3 moreover the volume of the secondary settler 2500 m 3 was calculated by assuming a value of 2 h for the h r t van haandel and van der lube 37 this leads to a total volume per train of 6598 m 3 which is 19 8 higher than the optimum volume found with the sbr optimization framework 4 2 soop 2 optimum operation in the long term fig 7 illustrates the optimization results of the opt opex problem for the six operational periods listed in table 4 the length of the anoxic phase t a x increases with temperature having a maximum value in s e p o c t 19 4 as seasonal temperatures become warmer the effluent nitrogen requirements will be met at lower concentrations of m l s s and consequently the length of the settling and drawn phases t s t d will decrease as for the aerated phase its length t a e takes similar values in the six operational periods which can be attributed to the opposite effect that temperature and m l s s have on nitrification therefore the decrement of t d s with temperature will cause similar increments in t a x the optimum values of q w are mainly correlated with the temperature positive the nitrogen load negative and to a lesser extent also with the organic load positive while results for the period between may and october show the positive effect of temperature on q w the effect of the nitrogen and organic loads is easier to analyze in j a n f e b 10 and n o v d e c 15 3 by comparison with m a r a p r 10 and j u l a u g 15 4 respectively while the values of q w are quite similar in j a n f e b and m a r a p r the values of the nitrogen and organic loads are lower in m a r a p r the reduction being of 20 and 27 respectively since these two values are in the same order the opposite effect of both variables on q w cancel each other the optimum result of q w being the same in both periods on the other hand though the temperature in both periods is the same it turns out that q w is quite different in j u l a u g 220 m 3 d and n o v d e c 348 m 3 d the analysis of the nitrogen and organic loads shows higher values in n o v d e c but in this case the first one increases by 7 and the second one by 28 in consequence the positive effect of the organic load prevails thus explaining why q w is higher in this period opt opex also gives interesting guidelines on the long term operation of m l s s in each sbr a clear pattern is recognized in fig 7 that correlates the optimum value of m l s s and seasonal temperatures fluctuations between periods are attributed to changes in the organic load that has a positive effect on l s s for example while temperature is 10 in j a n f e b and m a r a p r the organic load is 27 higher in the first period thus leading to a higher value of m l s s 4085 m g l finally the long term operational costs are shown in fig 8 the first observation id that the aeration costs a e c o s t seem to be uncorrelated with temperature except for the period m a r a p r which has the lowest value of the nitrogen load the values of a e c o s t range between 600 m w h y e a r and 700 m w h y e a r after considering the six operational periods the annual costs in aeration amount to 609 m w h regarding the energy that can be recovered from the sludge surplus by producing methane m e g a i n this variable mainly depends on the organic load this explains why higher values of m e g a i n are obtained in j a n f e b m a y j u n and n o v d e c where the organic load is higher the effluent nitrogen specifications determine the c o d requirements for denitrification since these specifications are the same in all the periods the c o d in excess that will be available for production of methane will be higher in those operational periods characterized by higher organic loads aggregated data for the six operational periods lead to an estimate of the annual gains in energy via methane production of 985 m w h therefore the net energy costs n e c o s t for the whole year give a negative balance of 375 m w h the above means that providing a power to heat ratio of 0 5 in the chp units 80 of the aeration costs can be fully covered by the energy generated in the wwtp such as it has been formulated the opt opex problem includes an equality constrain for the value of d o s p that is fixed to 1 75 m g l a more effective operational strategy in terms of energy costs is to remove this constraint and allow d o s p to adopt different values in each period in doing so the optimization results reveal that the effluent requirements can be met in the six periods with values of d o s p between 0 9 m g l and 1 2 m g l in addition to this the annual value of a e c o s t decreases to 560 m w h 8 and 86 of this energy can be supplied by the chp units this example tries to emphasize the flexibility of the optimization framework to accommodate and solve different problems depending on the specific requirements and priorities 5 conclusions a mathematical framework for sbr processes has been developed that allows exploratory studies aimed at optimizing the design and operation of this technology though a specific instance of the framework has been implemented for sbr configurations without holding tank its mathematical basis can be replicated to other plant layouts even more many components of this framework can be reused to develop similar frameworks for those technologies characterized by non continuous and cyclic operational patterns e g intermittent aeration processes biodenitro atad etc the optimization study for a population of 100000 ie reveals that the volume of the sbr is determined by wet weather conditions that is by hydraulic considerations similarly the aeration needs are determined by the peak load of nitrogen under dry weather conditions in this regard the sbr process exhibits a weak capacity to absorb peak loads the analysis of the long term operation shows that if the total length of the cycle is kept constant the best strategy to minimize energy costs is to adapt the sludge surplus flow rate depending on the long term variations in temperature nitrogen load and to a lesser extent organic load also as seasonal temperatures become warmer the length of the settling and drawn phases can be decreased as a result the length of the reaction phase increases the effluent requirements can be met at a lower concentration of m l s s and the aeration costs can be optimized declaration of competing interest the

13711,nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi was immobilized within porous millimeter sized polyacrylonitrile pan beads by chemical coagulation followed by a heat treatment in air for stabilization of the polymer structure sem eds and porosimetry analysis showed that the nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in micron scale agglomerates within the hierarchically channeled inner structure of the pan spheres xrd measurements demonstrated that α fe phase was the main crystalline component until 230 c preserving in the latest case around 50 of the original nzvi mass according to mössbauer spectroscopy comparative studies undertaken in this work showed that both free nzvi in suspension and pan immobilized nzvi presented a removal capacity of 52 56 mg cr vi g fe 0 the effect of nzvi loading initial ph and heat treatment temperature of the beads in the composition structure and reactivity of the nanocomposites was studied complete cr vi removal was achieved with the beads pre treated at 230 c containing 17 m m of nzvi at ph 3 after parametric optimization of the synthesis process a versatile and simple procedure for production of pan immobilized nzvi was achieved with no significant decrease in reactivity and potential application in fixed bed large scale remediation processes keywords nanoscale zerovalent iron polyacrylonitrile cr vi removal fixed bed reactor immobilization 1 introduction over the last decades nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been demonstrated to be an efficient agent for the removal of a wide variety of water pollutants including nitroaromatics dyes heavy metals and chlorinated compounds 1 3 adeleye et al 4 estimated that the removal cost of several water pollutants by nzvi based materials is competitive with most of the traditional treatment technologies currently applied such as activated carbon adsorption coagulation and ion exchange among others although free zvi nanoparticles in aqueous suspension present elevated reactivity in comparison to other zvi materials such as iron powder iron fillings and microscale zvi 5 the nanoparticles can be highly mobile in aqueous media immobilization of nanoparticles within milli or microscale carriers is a promising strategy to overcome this problem and exploits the nzvi reactivity in fixed bed reactors reducing the potential risk of uncontrolled nanoparticle release into the environment after water treatment 6 7 previous studies have addressed the incorporation of nzvi into several support materials to form a nanocomposite nc including activated carbon 8 9 ostrich bone ash 10 biochar 11 13 clay 14 and resin 15 most recently the use of polymeric matrix supports such as polyvinylidene fluoride nanofibers 16 polyurethane foam 17 chitosan 18 19 and alginate 20 21 has become a novel alternative for the development of nanocomposites for environmental remediation the interest in polymeric supports is primarily due to the versatility of their synthesis that allows for a rational adjustment of relevant physicochemical properties morphology surface area porosity etc by controlled modifications of the polymeric matrix synthesis conditions most notably polyacrylonitrile pan is a good alternative as a polymeric matrix support for nanoparticle immobilization due to the ease of synthesis in forming porous fibres and spheres 22 23 which lends itself to upscaling for industrial production pan produced spheres are particularly promising tailor made structures with hierarchical and radial pore distribution suitable for dynamic or flow through applications 22 however to achieve better chemical and mechanical stability pan based structures must be subjected to a heat treatment at 200 280 c in air 24 and references therein which can lead to partial or total oxidation of the nzvi during the synthesis of the ncs 25 although pan nanofibers and pan membranes containing fe based adsorbents have been used for the removal of water pollutants 26 28 and disinfection 29 there are to the best of our knowledge very few studies of the use of pan immobilized nzvi ncs for treatment of contaminated water 30 33 none of them have included a systematic study of the influence of the thermal stabilization process in the composition structure and reactivity of the obtained ncs chromium is a major water and soil pollutant coming from industrial processes such as electroplating wood treatment leather tanning and steel manufacture among others 34 the most frequent species found in environmental systems is cr vi in the form of chromates hcro4 and cro4 2 and cr iii as a trivalent cation cr3 cr iii is the thermodynamically stable chromium species in water it is insoluble at ph values above 5 5 and is considered an essential nutrient contrarily cr vi exhibits high water mobility can penetrate biological cell walls and is considered causative for several types of cancer 35 the world health organization who established a recommended maximum concentration of total chromium in drinking water of 50 μg l 1 36 however other public health organizations like the california environmental protection agency have focussed their attention on the greater threat imposed by cr vi and it determined a maximum level of this species in 0 02 μg l 1 37 in the presence of nzvi cr vi may be chemically reduced to cr iii which co precipitates with nascent fe3 ions covering the nanoparticles with a passivating cr oh 3 or mixed fe iii cr iii hydr oxide layer 38 in addition to its inherent health thread cr vi is also an excellent target pollutant for nzvi based technologies 39 42 because it allows testing surface reactivity rate of electron transfer and retention capacity altogether in this manner results obtained with cr vi could also be useful as a proxy to estimate the removal performance of nzvi materials with other wastewater pollutants in this work we demonstrate that nzvi can be effectively entrapped in the polymeric matrix of hierarchically porous pan spheres without exhibiting significant loss in their reactivity for removal of cr vi from wastewater here we present an improved method forthe immobilization of nzvi that generates spherical ncs that are both suitable for domestic and industrial applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals nzvi nano star hereafter nstar

standard solutions were purchased from chem lab nv for analysis of total iron and chromium concentrations fetotal and crtotal respectively 2 2 synthesis of nzvi pan nanocomposites pan spheres were prepared following the methodology of scales et al 22 briefly powdered nzvi 0 1 1 0 g was grounded and then suspended in a glass beaker open to the atmosphere containing 40 g of a 6 m v pan in dmso solution the mixture was manually stirred with a glass rod for 1 min and then further ultrasonicated for 5 min to homogenize the suspension this step comprising stirring and ultrasonication was repeated three times to ensure a fine suspension of nzvi the nzvi suspension in pan dmso was added dropwise by means of a syringe pump at 50 μl s 1 into 500 ml of 0 01 m naoh solution the naoh solution was previously purged with n2 to eliminate dissolved o2 and kept under continual agitation by magnetic stirring during the synthesis sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate was added to the naoh solution in order to increase the miscibility between the water and dmso and to favour the formation of homogeneous nzvi pan spheres spherical nanocomposites referred to as nzvi pan x where x is the mass percentage of nzvi in the spheres were obtained the mass percentage of nzvi was calculated by considering the total mass of nzvi used for the synthesis and the corresponding pan concentration in the suspension once obtained the spheres were left in the solution for a further 15 min to ensure their complete polymerization subsequently the spheres were separated from the solution rinsed three times with milliq deoxygenated water and then dried in an oven at 50 c overnight finally the spheres were thermally treated in air to stabilize the polymer at temperatures ranging from 180 to 280 c for 3 h in an indef 332 muffle oven 24 the stabilized spheres were denominated nzvi pan x t where t indicates the thermal treatment temperature in the case of the spheres without stabilization the acronym nht no heating treatment was used 2 3 nzvi pan characterization materials characterization was performed using x ray diffraction xrd n2 adsorption desorption porosimetry scanning electron microscopy sem with coupled energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds mössbauer spectroscopy and fourier transform infra red ftir analysis the mean diameter and mass of each batch of spheres was determined in order to estimate the mean mass of the spheres a known number of dry beads was weighed in a shimadzu auw220d balance and the obtained value was divided by the number of beads the mean size of the ncs was determined by the processing of digital photographic images using the software imagej 43 several dried beads from each ncs batch the sampling size was always higher than 20 were placed on a petri dish lined with millimetre paper and photographed with a standard 5 mega pixel ccd camera the digital images of the ncs were processed using the particle analyzer tool in imagej to determine the size distribution using the lines on the millimetre paper as a size reference the size distribution and density of the spheres as a function of the thermal treatment temperature are displayed in figure s1 of the sm to prepare the ncs for xrd measurements the composites were physically ground to a powder using a mortar and pestle then deposited on a flat analysis plate powder xrd measurements were performed on a panalytical empyrian diffractometer with a cukα radiation and a pixcel3d detector in addition to automatic divergence slit beta filter and 0 04 rad soller slits on the incident and diffracted beam side porosimetry measurements were performed for all the different ncs batches the ncs were treated by a standard procedure under vacuum at 150 c for 600 min by applying a 5 c min 1 ramp and then analysed by a micromeritics asap 2420 system sem analysis was performed only in the case of nzvi pan 17 230 spheres using a fei inspect f50 microscope equipped with se secondary electrons bse backscattered electrons and eds detectors ftir spectrometric measurements were carried out using a nicolet 560 spectrometer in transition mode samples were pulverised in liquid nitrogen and mixed with nabr which was also used as analytical blank total iron contained in the ncs was measured by total x ray reflection fluorescence txrf as it is specified in sub section 2 5 the samples were pre treated by microwave assisted digestion briefly a known mass of grounded ncs between 0 02 and 0 2 g was introduced in a 15 ml falcon tube with 7 5 ml hf 40 and 0 5 ml of hclo4 70 and 2 ml of milliq water then each tube was introduced in an ethos 1 advanced microwave digestion system and heated at 200 c for 20 min milestone s r l room temperature mössbauer spectra were recorded at

of α fe 2 4 cr vi removal experiments cr vi removal experiments were performed in a batch water recycling system 250 ml min 1 flow rate consisting of a glass cylinder 10 mm internal diameter 50 mm length a peristaltic pump and a temperature controlled 25 c 250 ml cylindrical reservoir figure s2 sm in every experiment the glass cylinder was placed horizontally containing 0 18 g of ncs to form a porous bed in all cases 200 ml of a 65 μm cr vi solution were adjusted to ph values between 3 and 9 using dropwise addition of h2so4 0 5 m or naoh 0 5 m into the reservoir a reaction time of 4 h was used for each experiment withdrawing 1 ml samples at regular times to determine the remaining concentration of cr vi the reservoir was magnetically stirred throughout the reaction time one experiment was carried out following the above described experimental protocol but using 200 ml of a 65 μm cr iii solution at ph 3 comparator experiments using free nzvi in suspension were also carried out in a batch reactor as described elsewhere 39 all experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate ensuring repeatability of results 2 5 analytical techniques for the aqueous phase concentrations of cr vi and fetotal in solution were measured spectrophotometrically using a t80 pg instruments ltd spectrophotometer cr vi was measured following the diphenylcarbazide method at 540 nm 45 and fetotal was determined using the o phenanthroline method at 508 nm 46 crtotal was measured by txrf 47 a 10 μl aliquot of a 100 mg l 1 solution of ga was added to 990 μl of each sample to act as internal standard subsequently 10 μl of the resulting solutions were seeded onto a quartz disc and then inserted into a s2 picofox bruker spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem eds fig 1 a b and c show the sem images of a fractured nzvi pan 17 230 bead taken with a backscattered electron detector in order to highlight the z number contrast between the polymer background and the fe nanoparticles the pan sphere depicted is typical of those synthesized with 2 mm diameter and internal porous structure delineated by radially distributed but constricted channels with decreasing diameter towards the surface fig 1d shows the distribution of c n o and fe in the nc confirming that the bright spots in the backscattered images correspond to iron agglomerates by comparison the c n and o do not correlate with the distribution of the iron but instead correspond to the polymer structure the presence of c outside the structure of the sphere is ascribed to the use of adhesive carbon tape to affix the samples to the sample holder it is noteworthy that the oxygen distribution does not strongly correlate with the iron distribution suggesting that only limited partial oxidation of the nzvi aggregates has occurred 3 2 xrd analysis fig 1e displays the xrd patterns for free fresh nzvi nzvi pan 17 nht and nzvi pan 17 t samples after a 3 h thermal treatment at 180 230 and 280 c despite the aqueous chemistry involved in the gelation process there is no evidence of any significant changes in the crystalline structure of the nanoparticles the xrd patterns for nzvi pan 17 nht and raw nzvi powder are similar and indicate the presence of α fe as the unique detected phase the absence of magnetite peaks as one of the component phases of the nzvi table s1 suggests that any iron oxide layer would be limited in extent 20 nm or crystallinity for the samples heated at 180 and 230 c α fe is still the dominant phase indicated by xrd but low intensity peaks corresponding to magnetite were detectable however the dominant iron related phases are observed to change dramatically for the ncs treated at 280 c when only magnetite is detectable by xrd indicating a full oxidative conversion of the α fe driven kinetically faster by the higher treatment temperature a comparison of the xrd patterns of nzvi pan 17 230 and powdered nzvi treated at 230 c shows a directly comparable phase distribution figure s3 sm this result indicates that the presence of the polymer does not interfere with the oxidation of the nanoparticles and that the temperature dependent iron phases distribution in the embedded nzvi is in good agreement with that reported by kašlík et al for free nzvi 25 3 3 mössbauer spectroscopy the mössbauer spectrum from nzvi powder fig 2 a was fitted with two sextets and one doublet the major sextet constituting more than 90 of the fe bearing compounds in the sample has the hyperfine parameters characteristic of fe 0 bhf 33 1 t is 0 mm s 1 and 2εq 0 mm s 1 the other sextet instead has the typical parameters of a non stoichiometric magnetite in accordance with xrd results the doublet distinctive of fe3 cations indicates the presence of a superparamagnetic oxide spm presumably magnetite which corresponds to particle sizes of the order of a few nanometers these results suggest a distribution of particle sizes for the oxide in the case of nzvi pan 17 230 the spectrum was fitted to a sextet and two broad doublets once more the sextet represents fe 0 although this time its content is around 50 even after an aggressive aqueous synthesis and heat treatment it is worth mentioning that this result matches with the 45 of fe 0 obtained by kašlík et al 25 after calcination of free nzvi at 225 c in 2 mol of o2 atmosphere n2 balance the doublets exhibit hyperfine parameters which are consistent to those reported in the literature for paramagnetic akaganeite β feooh 48 akaganeite is formed exclusively in the presence of chloride or fluoride ions 49 which could be introduced to the reaction media as impurities in the naoh used for the coagulation however such doublets are not solely characteristic for akaganeite but also other fe3 bearing minerals considering the xrd results even the presence of spm magnetite and or maghemite seems to be masked by the intensity of these doublets 3 4 porosimetry specific surface area ssa and porosity data for plain pan and nzvi pan 17 t spheres are presented in fig 3 nitrogen adsorption isotherms displayed in fig 3a for pan 230 and nzvi pan 17 230 fit the typical shape of a type ii hysteresis curve according to iupac definitions 50 for a non porous or macro porous material this observation accords with observations made by sem which showed large radially distributed macro channels up to 100 μm in maximum diameter the complete set of hysteresis curves of pan t and nzvi pan 17 t before and after thermal treatement is consistent with a type ii isotherm and can be seen in figure s4 in the sm fig 3b shows the variation in ssa as a function of the thermal treatment temperature for nzvi pan 17 and pan beads the ssa of both types of material decreases with increasing thermal treatment temperature which can be ascribed to a shrinkage of the pan structure causing a loss of pore accessibility as observed by optical microscopy in a previous work 22 the shrinkage of the pan structure results in a decreasing mean size distribution and an increasing density of the ncs as a function of the thermal treatment temperature figure s1 of the sm in addition to the macro porosity confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption isotherms the analysis of pore size distribution as a function of pore width revealed the presence of micro to nano porosity in both curves presented in fig 3c it is possible to identify three different pore size distribution zones 1 2 nm 5 75 nm and 75 110 nm however the intensity of the distribution function is lower in the absence of nanoparticles fig 3c and this gap increases with the heat treatment temperature see inserted graph in fig 3c leading to a complete absence of signal between 10 170 nm for the samples calcined at 280 c figure s5 in the sm the decrease in pore accessibility correlates with the complete loss of smaller micro to nano scale pores but also with the reduced ssa after increasing thermal treatment temperature as shown in fig 3b however it is still not clear why the presence of nzvi moderates the effect of temperature in decreasing the pore size distribution and the specific surface area 3 5 ftir the ftir spectrum of the pan precursor used in this work fig 4 a shows bands typical of its main functional groups 51 52 from the aliphatic section of the polymer the bands at 2940 cm 1 and 1454 cm 1 were identified as the ch asymmetric stretching and bending of methylene groups respectively whereas the peaks at 1360 cm 1 and 1240 cm 1 were assigned to the ch bending and wagging of methine a broad absorption band is also observed at 2240 cm 1 and corresponds to the stretching band of the nitrile group the presence of a narrow and intense absorption band at 1736 cm 1 was assigned to bending of carbonyl groups from methyl methacrylate and or itaconic acid comonomers usually present in pan precursors 53 the additional spectra displayed in fig 4 correspond to the ncs before nzvi pan 17 nht b and after nzvi pan 17 180 230 and 280 c d and e respectively heat treatment while the incorporation of nzvi did not significantly alter the pan spectrum the effect of the heat treatment clearly affected the structure of the base polymer as reported by usami et al 53 as the temperature of the heat treatment increases the intensity of the absorption bands involving ch ch2 and c n decreases with a commensurate intensity increase of several peaks in the zone between 1200 and 1700 cm 1 corresponding to the formation of c c c n n h and cyclic c o 51 53 54 the process behind the change in the composition of pan after thermal treatment is the cyclization of the polymer leading to a ladder structure 55 identical thermal treatment was applied to pan pure spheres figure s6 sm the same general ftir behaviour described for the ncs beads was observed for the plain pan beads except for the absorption peak of the nitrile group after 3 h at 230 c and 280 c the peak at 2240 cm 1 was observed to persist and broadens towards lower wavenumbers in the presence of the nzvi the reason of this finding is not clear but similarly to the case of cu or al it could be attributable to stabilization through coordination with fe iii or fe ii on the surface of the iron nanoparticles 54 3 6 removal of cr vi 3 6 1 influence of the thermal treatment temperature the considered removal reaction is that surface fe ii is oxidized to form fe iii with a coupled reduction of cr vi to cr iii eq 1 in the zvi nanoparticles the fe 0 in the particle core can re reduce surface fe iii species thereby recovering the surface to partake in additional cr vi reduction eq 2 1 hcro4 3 fe ii 7 h cr3 3 fe iii 4 h2o 2 fe0 2 fe iii 3 fe ii the aqueous removal performance of the nzvi pan 27 t was studied in the batch recycling system described in the experimental section fig 5 shows the percentage of cr vi removed rcr vi using nzvi pan 17 spheres prepared without heat treatment and after 3 h at 180 230 and 280 c respectively cr vi removal performance was observed to increase with an increasing thermal pre treatment temperature of the ncs reaching maximum efficiency for nzvi pan 17 230 and falling at 280 c the peak performance was attributable to a combination of three factors 1 the rate of electron transfer through the external iron oxide layer 2 the remaining amount of fe 0 in the ncs and 3 the accessibility of the nanoparticles surface for cr vi reactions to take place regarding the first two factors surface passivation of nzvi has been demonstrated to be a successful strategy to decrease the reactivity of the nanoparticles allowing handling and storage in air 56 in the case of nstar they present a compact magnetite layer generated by leaving the pristine particles progressively in contact with the atmosphere 57 as stated in section 3 3 increasing the thermal pre treatment temperature in air led to an increasing outer magnetite layer by partial oxidation of the fe 0 in the core kašlík et al 25 demonstrated that this process is accompanied by an elevated prevalence of structural defects that favours the electron transfer from the fe 0 in the core to the adsorbed cr vi increasing the amount of cr vi reduced at the same reaction time however after treatment for 3 h at 280 c α fe is almost completely transformed into magnetite which has a lower removal efficiency for aqueous cr vi than fe 0 and magnetite coated nzvi 58 59 considering the third factor lee et al 60 found that the wetting angle of water droplets on pan fibre mats decreases as a function of increasing pre treatment time at 230 c probably as a consequence of the disappearance of non polar ch and ch2 groups and the formation of nh and cyclic c o in the same manner as produced by increasing thermal treatment temperature fig 4 an increased pan matrix wettability would explain the higher cr vi removal efficiency with increasing thermal treatment by raising cr vi mass transfer rate and favouring the contact between the occluded nzvi in the internal walls of the beads and the cr vi solution in the pores this effect would accompany the improved electron transfer of the thickening iron oxide layer and as in that case it would be counterbalanced by the complete disappearance of fe 0 after the ncs are treated at 280 c 3 6 2 influence of initial ph the removal percentage r of cr vi and crtotal monotonously decrease with increasing initial ph fig 6 in a similar fashion to free nzvi in aqueous suspension 61 the higher removal efficiency for acidic ph responses to a proton consuming overall reaction eq 1 but also to opposite charges set between aqueous cr vi and surface iron species nzvi surface is positively charged at ph 8 considering the point of zero charge 8 phpzc 8 5 62 and in the micro molar concentration range hcro4 and cro4 2 are the main cr vi species in aqueous phase from ph 2 6 and from 6 to 14 respectively 63 see figure s7 thus at initial ph between 3 and 8 cr vi adsorption onto the embedded nzvi is favoured however once cr vi reaches the nzvi surfaces it can be chemically reduced and immobilized to form a passivating layer consistent of cr oh 3 crxfe1 x oh 3 and or crxfe1 xooh 38 that poisons the surface of nzvi preventing further reaction eqs 3 5 3 cr3 3 h2o cr oh 3 s 3 h 4 x cr3 1 x fe3 3 h2o crxfe1 x oh 3 s 3 h 5 x cr3 1 x fe3 2 h2o crxfe1 xooh s 3 h 6 fe s 2 h ½ o2 fe2 aq h2o 7 hcro4 7 h 3 fe2 aq cr3 aq 3 fe3 aq 4 h2o at ph lower than 4 the passivation of the nzvi competes with its corrosion eq 6 giving place to a minor removal pathway through the direct reaction between dissolved cr vi and fe ii eq 7 39 therefore the dissolution of the external iron oxide layer which delivers fe ii into the aqueous solution inserted graph fig 6 prevents the surface poisoning physically incorporating only a small fraction of the cr iii produced at ph higher than 4 the iron corrosion loses efficiency and most of the cr iii is fixed onto the nzvi surface in addition for initial ph higher than 8 the main cr vi species are still negatively charged hcro4 and cro4 2 but the surface of the nzvi turns electro negative delaying cr vi removal due to mutual electrostatic repulsion it is notable that in a previous work from our group 39 the amount of fe dissolved at low ph was 36 of the total mass of iron in the nanoparticles by comparison when nzvi is incorporated into the ncs only 6 of the total iron was released into the solution calculated using the data from fig 6 3 6 3 influence of nzvi loading fig 7 a and b show the r of aqueous cr vi and crtotal fetotal and ph after 240 min in contact with nzvi pan x 230 for different initial nzvi loadings in the ncs the bare pan spheres thermally treated at 230 c nzvi pan 0 230 adsorbed only 11 5 of the initial cr vi at ph 3 through adsorption of hcro4 onto the positively charged surface of the polymer 3 1 phpzc 5 64 66 from that point rcr vi linearly increases with higher nzvi loading leading to complete cr vi removal by the ncs with 17 and 27 of nanoparticles in a similar manner rcrtotal also increases with nzvi loading but finding its maximum value at 50 for the ncs loaded with 27 of nzvi these results show that the polymer matrix acts as a robust physical host for the nanoparticles supporting a broad range of nzvi mass but also that it intervenes to reach higher rcrtotal in comparison with free nzvi where 95 of the initial crtotal remained in solution after 120 min at ph 3 39 the proportion of immobilized nzvi also affected the cr vi removal rate the time dependent cr vi removal curves for each nc with different nzvi loading figure s8 were successfully fitted to a pseudo first order kinetic model 31 and as shown in table s2 higher nzvi loading led to higher removal rate this effect could be explained by an increasing nzvi coating of the inner walls of the pan channels and the external layer of the beads with greater number of embedded nanoparticles the similar kinetic behaviour for ncs with 17 and 27 nzvi load may be indicating saturation of the inner and external surface of the polymer matrix beads in the case of fetotal a higher concentration of aqueous fe was found in the residual solutions treated with nc of higher nzvi loadings similar fetotal was observed for nzvi pan 17 230 and with nzvi pan 27 230 fig 7b this result was expected as the main source of fetotal in solution is the nzvi reaction with cr vi eq 1 and similar rcr vi were obtained with both materials moreover the minor ph increase observed after the removal reactions was ascribed to the involved proton consuming processes described in eqs 1 6 and 7 3 6 4 cr vi removal performance and mechanism of nzvi pan beads the removal capacities of nzvi pan 9 230 and free nzvi as a function of removal time were compared using two different scales 1 the mass of cr vi removed per mass of fe 0 fig 8 a and 2 the mass of cr vi removed per mass of nzvi inserted in fig 8a the total iron contained in the ncs was determined by txrf after the digestion of each ncs sample table s3 and the content of fe 0 with respect to fetotal was estimated from mössbauer spectroscopy on the one hand free nzvi has shown a higher reaction rate than pan immobilized nzvi for both cr vi removal capacity scales for example after 60 min of reaction free nzvi had reached 75 of its final removal capacity whereas for the same period of time only 30 of the final removal capacity was achieved by the nzvi pan 9 230 on the other hand after 240 min of reaction even when the free nzvi removed twice the amount of cr vi per gram of nanoparticles than nzvi pan 9 230 inserted graph in fig 8a the removal capacity of both free and nc embedded nzvi is similar per unit mass of fe 0 this is a remarkable result since immobilized nanoparticles are expected to be less reactive as the polymer molecules can be irreversibly attached to the nanoparticle surfaces 7 67 and a smaller surface area of nzvi is exposed for reaction in this case the pan matrix surrounding the nanoparticles in the ncs seems to affect exclusively the reaction rate but not the reactivity itself an equivalent result and effect was found for nzvi pan 4 230 ncs figure s9 in the sm in addition the elevated reactivity of nzvi is the counterpart of a high chemical lability 68 and it is not evident that the immobilized nanoparticles will present the same physicochemical characteristics and performance as free nzvi in suspension thus a thorough characterization of the nanoparticles once retained in the supporting matrix whether it is organic inorganic or biological is crucial to understand the actual performance and potential application of immobilized nzvi and more specifically the fe 0 in their core in table 1 we compare the removal capacity of various materials based on nzvi for the removal of cr vi removal capacities in table 1 were calculated assuming complete efficiency in the entrapment immobilization of fe 0 nanoparticles or its precursors during the synthesis except in the case of the work of fu et al 70 that provides the information of total immobilized iron to the best of our knowledge the cr vi removal capacity of the nzvi pan ncs produced for this work is the highest found in the specific literature evaluated by mass of nzvi unfortunately the works reported in table 1 did not provide enough information to calculate the removal capacity as a function of the fe 0 composition finally to determine the nature of cr removed from the solution an experiment using cr iii instead of cr vi was performed cr iii concentration was measured by total cr content analysis the rcrtotal after 240 min contact with nzvi pan 0 230 and nzvi pan 17 230 beads with 65 μm cr vi or cr iii solutions at ph 3 is represented in fig 8b bare pan spheres treated at 230 c removed around 11 5 and 5 of the initial crtotal after 240 min of contact with cr vi and cr iii solutions respectively at ph 3 such a small retention capacity for cr iii can be explained as a consequence of surface repulsion between the beads and the main aqueous species of cr iii at ph 3 cr oh2 6 3 in turn nzvi pan 17 230 retained 41 6 and 34 of the initial crtotal in solution this implies that the total amount of cr withdrawn from the treated solution corresponds exclusively to precipitation of cr3 on the surface of the zvi nanoparticles according to eqs 3 5 the scheme presented in fig 9 summarizes the cr vi removal mechanism by the pan embedded nzvi at ph 3 hcro4 percolates through the polymer channelled structure where it is adsorbed in a small proportion or continues to diffuse until it reaches the immobilized nanoparticles where it is adsorbed and then reduced to cr3 part of the cr3 is retained in the surface of the nzvi as a passivating layer consistent in cr oh 3 and or cr iii fe iii hydr oxides and part of it slowly diffuses outside the polymer structure together with fe2 produced during the corrosion and reaction with cr vi 4 conclusions the current work has demonstrated the successful synthesis and application of nzvi embedded in pan spheres for the effective removal of cr from water over a range of ph conditions the results confirm that the embedded zvi nanoparticles interact with aqueous cr in the same reactive manner as free nzvi in aqueous suspension showing a similar total performance but slower rates of reaction the presence of the porous polymer support is considered to mitigate the rate at which cr vi can access the nzvi surfaces resulting in a slower rate of reaction but also a lower degree of fe dissolution and cr iii release given the proven applicability of nzvi to treat a large range of water pollutants the observed performance of the ncs presented here is potentially useful in water treatment applications where deploying free suspensions of nanoparticles is considered inappropriate instead the nzvi impregnated pan spheres offer a static treatment bed method for water remediation wherein the nanoparticles remain in a fixed location it is also noteworthy that the impregnated spheres can be produced in bulk quantities with relative ease declaration of competing

13711,nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi was immobilized within porous millimeter sized polyacrylonitrile pan beads by chemical coagulation followed by a heat treatment in air for stabilization of the polymer structure sem eds and porosimetry analysis showed that the nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in micron scale agglomerates within the hierarchically channeled inner structure of the pan spheres xrd measurements demonstrated that α fe phase was the main crystalline component until 230 c preserving in the latest case around 50 of the original nzvi mass according to mössbauer spectroscopy comparative studies undertaken in this work showed that both free nzvi in suspension and pan immobilized nzvi presented a removal capacity of 52 56 mg cr vi g fe 0 the effect of nzvi loading initial ph and heat treatment temperature of the beads in the composition structure and reactivity of the nanocomposites was studied complete cr vi removal was achieved with the beads pre treated at 230 c containing 17 m m of nzvi at ph 3 after parametric optimization of the synthesis process a versatile and simple procedure for production of pan immobilized nzvi was achieved with no significant decrease in reactivity and potential application in fixed bed large scale remediation processes keywords nanoscale zerovalent iron polyacrylonitrile cr vi removal fixed bed reactor immobilization 1 introduction over the last decades nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been demonstrated to be an efficient agent for the removal of a wide variety of water pollutants including nitroaromatics dyes heavy metals and chlorinated compounds 1 3 adeleye et al 4 estimated that the removal cost of several water pollutants by nzvi based materials is competitive with most of the traditional treatment technologies currently applied such as activated carbon adsorption coagulation and ion exchange among others although free zvi nanoparticles in aqueous suspension present elevated reactivity in comparison to other zvi materials such as iron powder iron fillings and microscale zvi 5 the nanoparticles can be highly mobile in aqueous media immobilization of nanoparticles within milli or microscale carriers is a promising strategy to overcome this problem and exploits the nzvi reactivity in fixed bed reactors reducing the potential risk of uncontrolled nanoparticle release into the environment after water treatment 6 7 previous studies have addressed the incorporation of nzvi into several support materials to form a nanocomposite nc including activated carbon 8 9 ostrich bone ash 10 biochar 11 13 clay 14 and resin 15 most recently the use of polymeric matrix supports such as polyvinylidene fluoride nanofibers 16 polyurethane foam 17 chitosan 18 19 and alginate 20 21 has become a novel alternative for the development of nanocomposites for environmental remediation the interest in polymeric supports is primarily due to the versatility of their synthesis that allows for a rational adjustment of relevant physicochemical properties morphology surface area porosity etc by controlled modifications of the polymeric matrix synthesis conditions most notably polyacrylonitrile pan is a good alternative as a polymeric matrix support for nanoparticle immobilization due to the ease of synthesis in forming porous fibres and spheres 22 23 which lends itself to upscaling for industrial production pan produced spheres are particularly promising tailor made structures with hierarchical and radial pore distribution suitable for dynamic or flow through applications 22 however to achieve better chemical and mechanical stability pan based structures must be subjected to a heat treatment at 200 280 c in air 24 and references therein which can lead to partial or total oxidation of the nzvi during the synthesis of the ncs 25 although pan nanofibers and pan membranes containing fe based adsorbents have been used for the removal of water pollutants 26 28 and disinfection 29 there are to the best of our knowledge very few studies of the use of pan immobilized nzvi ncs for treatment of contaminated water 30 33 none of them have included a systematic study of the influence of the thermal stabilization process in the composition structure and reactivity of the obtained ncs chromium is a major water and soil pollutant coming from industrial processes such as electroplating wood treatment leather tanning and steel manufacture among others 34 the most frequent species found in environmental systems is cr vi in the form of chromates hcro4 and cro4 2 and cr iii as a trivalent cation cr3 cr iii is the thermodynamically stable chromium species in water it is insoluble at ph values above 5 5 and is considered an essential nutrient contrarily cr vi exhibits high water mobility can penetrate biological cell walls and is considered causative for several types of cancer 35 the world health organization who established a recommended maximum concentration of total chromium in drinking water of 50 μg l 1 36 however other public health organizations like the california environmental protection agency have focussed their attention on the greater threat imposed by cr vi and it determined a maximum level of this species in 0 02 μg l 1 37 in the presence of nzvi cr vi may be chemically reduced to cr iii which co precipitates with nascent fe3 ions covering the nanoparticles with a passivating cr oh 3 or mixed fe iii cr iii hydr oxide layer 38 in addition to its inherent health thread cr vi is also an excellent target pollutant for nzvi based technologies 39 42 because it allows testing surface reactivity rate of electron transfer and retention capacity altogether in this manner results obtained with cr vi could also be useful as a proxy to estimate the removal performance of nzvi materials with other wastewater pollutants in this work we demonstrate that nzvi can be effectively entrapped in the polymeric matrix of hierarchically porous pan spheres without exhibiting significant loss in their reactivity for removal of cr vi from wastewater here we present an improved method forthe immobilization of nzvi that generates spherical ncs that are both suitable for domestic and industrial applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals nzvi nano star hereafter nstar

standard solutions were purchased from chem lab nv for analysis of total iron and chromium concentrations fetotal and crtotal respectively 2 2 synthesis of nzvi pan nanocomposites pan spheres were prepared following the methodology of scales et al 22 briefly powdered nzvi 0 1 1 0 g was grounded and then suspended in a glass beaker open to the atmosphere containing 40 g of a 6 m v pan in dmso solution the mixture was manually stirred with a glass rod for 1 min and then further ultrasonicated for 5 min to homogenize the suspension this step comprising stirring and ultrasonication was repeated three times to ensure a fine suspension of nzvi the nzvi suspension in pan dmso was added dropwise by means of a syringe pump at 50 μl s 1 into 500 ml of 0 01 m naoh solution the naoh solution was previously purged with n2 to eliminate dissolved o2 and kept under continual agitation by magnetic stirring during the synthesis sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate was added to the naoh solution in order to increase the miscibility between the water and dmso and to favour the formation of homogeneous nzvi pan spheres spherical nanocomposites referred to as nzvi pan x where x is the mass percentage of nzvi in the spheres were obtained the mass percentage of nzvi was calculated by considering the total mass of nzvi used for the synthesis and the corresponding pan concentration in the suspension once obtained the spheres were left in the solution for a further 15 min to ensure their complete polymerization subsequently the spheres were separated from the solution rinsed three times with milliq deoxygenated water and then dried in an oven at 50 c overnight finally the spheres were thermally treated in air to stabilize the polymer at temperatures ranging from 180 to 280 c for 3 h in an indef 332 muffle oven 24 the stabilized spheres were denominated nzvi pan x t where t indicates the thermal treatment temperature in the case of the spheres without stabilization the acronym nht no heating treatment was used 2 3 nzvi pan characterization materials characterization was performed using x ray diffraction xrd n2 adsorption desorption porosimetry scanning electron microscopy sem with coupled energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds mössbauer spectroscopy and fourier transform infra red ftir analysis the mean diameter and mass of each batch of spheres was determined in order to estimate the mean mass of the spheres a known number of dry beads was weighed in a shimadzu auw220d balance and the obtained value was divided by the number of beads the mean size of the ncs was determined by the processing of digital photographic images using the software imagej 43 several dried beads from each ncs batch the sampling size was always higher than 20 were placed on a petri dish lined with millimetre paper and photographed with a standard 5 mega pixel ccd camera the digital images of the ncs were processed using the particle analyzer tool in imagej to determine the size distribution using the lines on the millimetre paper as a size reference the size distribution and density of the spheres as a function of the thermal treatment temperature are displayed in figure s1 of the sm to prepare the ncs for xrd measurements the composites were physically ground to a powder using a mortar and pestle then deposited on a flat analysis plate powder xrd measurements were performed on a panalytical empyrian diffractometer with a cukα radiation and a pixcel3d detector in addition to automatic divergence slit beta filter and 0 04 rad soller slits on the incident and diffracted beam side porosimetry measurements were performed for all the different ncs batches the ncs were treated by a standard procedure under vacuum at 150 c for 600 min by applying a 5 c min 1 ramp and then analysed by a micromeritics asap 2420 system sem analysis was performed only in the case of nzvi pan 17 230 spheres using a fei inspect f50 microscope equipped with se secondary electrons bse backscattered electrons and eds detectors ftir spectrometric measurements were carried out using a nicolet 560 spectrometer in transition mode samples were pulverised in liquid nitrogen and mixed with nabr which was also used as analytical blank total iron contained in the ncs was measured by total x ray reflection fluorescence txrf as it is specified in sub section 2 5 the samples were pre treated by microwave assisted digestion briefly a known mass of grounded ncs between 0 02 and 0 2 g was introduced in a 15 ml falcon tube with 7 5 ml hf 40 and 0 5 ml of hclo4 70 and

of α fe 2 4 cr vi removal experiments cr vi removal experiments were performed in a batch water recycling system 250 ml min 1 flow rate consisting of a glass cylinder 10 mm internal diameter 50 mm length a peristaltic pump and a temperature controlled 25 c 250 ml cylindrical reservoir figure s2 sm in every experiment the glass cylinder was placed horizontally containing 0 18 g of ncs to form a porous bed in all cases 200 ml of a 65 μm cr vi solution were adjusted to ph values between 3 and 9 using dropwise addition of h2so4 0 5 m or naoh 0 5 m into the reservoir a reaction time of 4 h was used for each experiment withdrawing 1 ml samples at regular times to determine the remaining concentration of cr vi the reservoir was magnetically stirred throughout the reaction time one experiment was carried out following the above described experimental protocol but using 200 ml of a 65 μm cr iii solution at ph 3 comparator experiments using free nzvi in suspension were also carried out in a batch reactor as described elsewhere 39 all experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate ensuring repeatability of results 2 5 analytical techniques for the aqueous phase concentrations of cr vi and fetotal in solution were measured spectrophotometrically using a t80 pg instruments ltd spectrophotometer cr vi was measured following the diphenylcarbazide method at 540 nm 45 and fetotal was determined using the o phenanthroline method at 508 nm 46 crtotal was measured by txrf 47 a 10 μl aliquot of a 100 mg l 1 solution of ga was added to 990 μl of each sample to act as internal standard subsequently 10 μl of the resulting solutions were seeded onto a quartz disc and then inserted into a s2 picofox bruker spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem eds fig 1 a b and c show the sem images of a fractured nzvi pan 17 230 bead taken with a backscattered electron detector in order to highlight the z number contrast between the polymer background and the fe nanoparticles the pan sphere depicted is typical of those synthesized with 2 mm diameter and internal porous structure delineated by radially distributed but constricted channels with decreasing diameter towards the surface fig 1d shows the distribution of c n o and fe in the nc confirming that the bright spots in the backscattered images correspond to iron agglomerates by comparison the c n and o do not correlate with the distribution of the iron but instead correspond to the polymer structure the presence of c outside the structure of the sphere is ascribed to the use of adhesive carbon tape to affix the samples to the sample holder it is noteworthy that the oxygen distribution does not strongly correlate with the iron distribution suggesting that only limited partial oxidation of the nzvi aggregates has occurred 3 2 xrd analysis fig 1e displays the xrd patterns for free fresh nzvi nzvi pan 17 nht and nzvi pan 17 t samples after a 3 h thermal treatment at 180 230 and 280 c despite the aqueous chemistry involved in the gelation process there is no evidence of any significant changes in the crystalline structure of the nanoparticles the xrd patterns for nzvi pan 17 nht and raw nzvi powder are similar and indicate the presence of α fe as the unique detected phase the absence of magnetite peaks as one of the component phases of the nzvi table s1 suggests that any iron oxide layer would be limited in extent 20 nm or crystallinity for the samples heated at 180 and 230 c α fe is still the dominant phase indicated by xrd but low intensity peaks corresponding to magnetite were detectable however the dominant iron related phases are observed to change dramatically for the ncs treated at 280 c when only magnetite is detectable by xrd indicating a full oxidative conversion of the α fe driven kinetically faster by the higher treatment temperature a comparison of the xrd patterns of nzvi pan 17 230 and powdered nzvi treated at 230 c shows a directly comparable phase distribution figure s3 sm this result indicates that the presence of the polymer does not interfere with the oxidation of the nanoparticles and that the temperature dependent iron phases distribution in the embedded nzvi is in good agreement with that reported by kašlík et al for free nzvi 25 3 3 mössbauer spectroscopy the mössbauer spectrum from nzvi powder fig 2 a was fitted with two sextets and one doublet the major sextet constituting more than 90 of the fe bearing compounds in the sample has the hyperfine parameters characteristic of fe 0 bhf 33 1 t is 0 mm s 1 and 2εq 0 mm s 1 the other sextet instead has the typical parameters of a non stoichiometric magnetite in accordance with xrd results the doublet distinctive of fe3 cations indicates the presence of a superparamagnetic oxide spm presumably magnetite which corresponds to particle sizes of the order of a few nanometers these results suggest a distribution of particle sizes for the oxide in the case of nzvi pan 17 230 the spectrum was fitted to a sextet and two broad doublets once more the sextet represents fe 0 although this time its content is around 50 even after an aggressive aqueous synthesis and heat treatment it is worth mentioning that this result matches with the 45 of fe 0 obtained by kašlík et al 25 after calcination of free nzvi at 225 c in 2 mol of o2 atmosphere n2 balance the doublets exhibit hyperfine parameters which are consistent to those reported in the literature for paramagnetic akaganeite β feooh 48 akaganeite is formed exclusively in the presence of chloride or fluoride ions 49 which could be introduced to the reaction media as impurities in the naoh used for the coagulation however such doublets are not solely characteristic for akaganeite but also other fe3 bearing minerals considering the xrd results even the presence of spm magnetite and or maghemite seems to be masked by the intensity of these doublets 3 4 porosimetry specific surface area ssa and porosity data for plain pan and nzvi pan 17 t spheres are presented in fig 3 nitrogen adsorption isotherms displayed in fig 3a for pan 230 and nzvi pan 17 230 fit the typical shape of a type ii hysteresis curve according to iupac definitions 50 for a non porous or macro porous material this observation accords with observations made by sem which showed large radially distributed macro channels up to 100 μm in maximum diameter the complete set of hysteresis curves of pan t and nzvi pan 17 t before and after thermal treatement is consistent with a type ii isotherm and can be seen in figure s4 in the sm fig 3b shows the variation in ssa as a function of the thermal treatment temperature for nzvi pan 17 and pan beads the ssa of both types of material decreases with increasing thermal treatment temperature which can be ascribed to a shrinkage of the pan structure causing a loss of pore accessibility as observed by optical microscopy in a previous work 22 the shrinkage of the pan structure results in a decreasing mean size distribution and an increasing density of the ncs as a function of the thermal treatment temperature figure s1 of the sm in addition to the macro porosity confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption isotherms the analysis of pore size distribution as a function of pore width revealed the presence of micro to nano porosity in both curves presented in fig 3c it is possible to identify three different pore size distribution zones 1 2 nm 5 75 nm and 75 110 nm however the intensity of the distribution function is lower in the absence of nanoparticles fig 3c and this gap increases with the heat treatment temperature see inserted graph in fig 3c leading to a complete absence of signal between 10 170 nm for the samples calcined at 280 c figure s5 in the sm the decrease in pore accessibility correlates with the complete loss of smaller micro to nano scale pores but also with the reduced ssa after increasing thermal treatment temperature as shown in fig 3b however it is still not clear why the presence of nzvi moderates the effect of temperature in decreasing the pore size distribution and the specific surface area 3 5 ftir the ftir spectrum of the pan precursor used in this work fig 4 a shows bands typical of its main functional groups 51 52 from the aliphatic section of the polymer the bands at 2940 cm 1 and 1454 cm 1 were identified as the ch asymmetric stretching and bending of methylene groups respectively whereas the peaks at 1360 cm 1 and 1240 cm 1 were assigned to the ch bending and wagging of methine a broad absorption band is also observed at 2240 cm 1 and corresponds to the stretching band of the nitrile group the presence of a narrow and intense absorption band at 1736 cm 1 was assigned to bending of carbonyl groups from methyl methacrylate and or itaconic acid comonomers usually present in pan precursors 53 the additional spectra displayed in fig 4 correspond to the ncs before nzvi pan 17 nht b and after nzvi pan 17 180 230 and 280 c d and e respectively heat treatment while the incorporation of nzvi did not significantly alter the pan spectrum the effect of the heat treatment clearly affected the structure of the base polymer as reported by usami et al 53 as the temperature of the heat treatment increases the intensity of the absorption bands involving ch ch2 and c n decreases with a commensurate intensity increase of several peaks in the zone between 1200 and 1700 cm 1 corresponding to the formation of c c c n n h and cyclic c o 51 53 54 the process behind the change in the composition of pan after thermal treatment is the cyclization of the polymer leading to a ladder structure 55 identical thermal treatment was applied to pan pure spheres figure s6 sm the same general ftir behaviour described for the ncs beads was observed for the plain pan beads except for the absorption peak of the nitrile group after 3 h at 230 c and 280 c the peak at 2240 cm 1 was observed to persist and broadens towards lower wavenumbers in the presence of the nzvi the reason of this finding is not clear but similarly to the case of cu or al it could be attributable to stabilization through coordination with fe iii or fe ii on the surface of the iron nanoparticles 54 3 6 removal of cr vi 3 6 1 influence of the thermal treatment temperature the considered removal reaction is that surface fe ii is oxidized to form fe iii with a coupled reduction of cr vi to cr iii eq 1 in the zvi nanoparticles the fe 0 in the particle core can re reduce surface fe iii species thereby recovering the surface to partake in additional cr vi reduction eq 2 1 hcro4 3 fe ii 7 h cr3 3 fe iii 4 h2o 2 fe0 2 fe iii 3 fe ii the aqueous removal performance of the nzvi pan 27 t was studied in the batch recycling system described in the experimental section fig 5 shows the percentage of cr vi removed rcr vi using nzvi pan 17 spheres prepared without heat treatment and after 3 h at 180 230 and 280 c respectively cr vi removal performance was observed to increase with an increasing thermal pre treatment temperature of the ncs reaching maximum efficiency for nzvi pan 17 230 and falling at 280 c the peak performance was attributable to a combination of three factors 1 the rate of electron transfer through the external iron oxide layer 2 the remaining amount of fe 0 in the ncs and 3 the accessibility of the nanoparticles surface for cr vi reactions to take place regarding the first two factors surface passivation of nzvi has been demonstrated to be a successful strategy to decrease the reactivity of the nanoparticles allowing handling and storage in air 56 in the case of nstar they present a compact magnetite layer generated by leaving the pristine particles progressively in contact with the atmosphere 57 as stated in section 3 3 increasing the thermal pre treatment temperature in air led to an increasing outer magnetite layer by partial oxidation of the fe 0 in the core kašlík et al 25 demonstrated that this process is accompanied by an elevated prevalence of structural defects that favours the electron transfer from the fe 0 in the core to the adsorbed cr vi increasing the amount of cr vi reduced at the same reaction time however after treatment for 3 h at 280 c α fe is almost completely transformed into magnetite which has a lower removal efficiency for aqueous cr vi than fe 0 and magnetite coated nzvi 58 59 considering the third factor lee et al 60 found that the wetting angle of water droplets on pan fibre mats decreases as a function of increasing pre treatment time at 230 c probably as a consequence of the disappearance of non polar ch and ch2 groups and the formation of nh and cyclic c o in the same manner as produced by increasing thermal treatment temperature fig 4 an increased pan matrix wettability would explain the higher cr vi removal efficiency with increasing thermal treatment by raising cr vi mass transfer rate and favouring the contact between the occluded nzvi in the internal walls of the beads and the cr vi solution in the pores this effect would accompany the improved electron transfer of the thickening iron oxide layer and as in that case it would be counterbalanced by the complete disappearance of fe 0 after the ncs are treated at 280 c 3 6 2 influence of initial ph the removal percentage r of cr vi and crtotal monotonously decrease with increasing initial ph fig 6 in a similar fashion to free nzvi in aqueous suspension 61 the higher removal efficiency for acidic ph responses to a proton consuming overall reaction eq 1 but also to opposite charges set between aqueous cr vi and surface iron species nzvi surface is positively charged at ph 8 considering the point of zero charge 8 phpzc 8 5 62 and in the micro molar concentration range hcro4 and cro4 2 are the main cr vi species in aqueous phase from ph 2 6 and from 6 to 14 respectively 63 see figure s7 thus at initial ph between 3 and 8 cr vi adsorption onto the embedded nzvi is favoured however once cr vi reaches the nzvi surfaces it can be chemically reduced and immobilized to form a passivating layer consistent of cr oh 3 crxfe1 x oh 3 and or crxfe1 xooh 38 that poisons the surface of nzvi preventing further reaction eqs 3 5 3 cr3 3 h2o cr oh 3 s 3 h 4 x cr3 1 x fe3 3 h2o crxfe1 x oh 3 s 3 h 5 x cr3 1 x fe3 2 h2o crxfe1 xooh s 3 h 6 fe s 2 h ½ o2 fe2 aq h2o 7 hcro4 7 h 3 fe2 aq cr3 aq 3 fe3 aq 4 h2o at ph lower than 4 the passivation of the nzvi competes with its corrosion eq 6 giving place to a minor removal pathway through the direct reaction between dissolved cr vi and fe ii eq 7 39 therefore the dissolution of the external iron oxide layer which delivers fe ii into the aqueous solution inserted graph fig 6 prevents the surface poisoning physically incorporating only a small fraction of the cr iii produced at ph higher than 4 the iron corrosion loses efficiency and most of the cr iii is fixed onto the nzvi surface in addition for initial ph higher than 8 the main cr vi species are still negatively charged hcro4 and cro4 2 but the surface of the nzvi turns electro negative delaying cr vi removal due to mutual electrostatic repulsion it is notable that in a previous work from our group 39 the amount of fe dissolved at low ph was 36 of the total mass of iron in the nanoparticles by comparison when nzvi is incorporated into the ncs only 6 of the total iron was released into the solution calculated using the data from fig 6 3 6 3 influence of nzvi loading fig 7 a and b show the r of aqueous cr vi and crtotal fetotal and ph after 240 min in contact with nzvi pan x 230 for different initial nzvi loadings in the ncs the bare pan spheres thermally treated at 230 c nzvi pan 0 230 adsorbed only 11 5 of the initial cr vi at ph 3 through adsorption of hcro4 onto the positively charged surface of the polymer 3 1 phpzc 5 64 66 from that point rcr vi linearly increases with higher nzvi loading leading to complete cr vi removal by the ncs with 17 and 27 of nanoparticles in a similar manner rcrtotal also increases with nzvi loading but finding its maximum value at 50 for the ncs loaded with 27 of nzvi these results show that the polymer matrix acts as a robust physical host for the nanoparticles supporting a broad range of nzvi mass but also that it intervenes to reach higher rcrtotal in comparison with free nzvi where 95 of the initial crtotal remained in solution after 120 min at ph 3 39 the proportion of immobilized nzvi also affected the cr vi removal rate the time dependent cr vi removal curves for each nc with different nzvi loading figure s8 were successfully fitted to a pseudo first order kinetic model 31 and as shown in table s2 higher nzvi loading led to higher removal rate this effect could be explained by an increasing nzvi coating of the inner walls of the pan channels and the external layer of the beads with greater number of embedded nanoparticles the similar kinetic behaviour for ncs with 17 and 27 nzvi load may be indicating saturation of the inner and external surface of the polymer matrix beads in the case of fetotal a higher concentration of aqueous fe was found in the residual solutions treated with nc of higher nzvi loadings similar fetotal was observed for nzvi pan 17 230 and with nzvi pan 27 230 fig 7b this result was expected as the main source of fetotal in solution is the nzvi reaction with cr vi eq 1 and similar rcr vi were obtained with both materials moreover the minor ph increase observed after the removal reactions was ascribed to the involved proton consuming processes described in eqs 1 6 and 7 3 6 4 cr vi removal performance and mechanism of nzvi pan beads the removal capacities of nzvi pan 9 230 and free nzvi as a function of removal time were compared using two different scales 1 the mass of cr vi removed per mass of fe 0 fig 8 a and 2 the mass of cr vi removed per mass of nzvi inserted in fig 8a the total iron contained in the ncs was determined by txrf after the digestion of each ncs sample table s3 and the content of fe 0 with respect to fetotal was estimated from mössbauer spectroscopy on the one hand free nzvi has shown a higher reaction rate than pan immobilized nzvi for both cr vi removal capacity scales for example after 60 min of reaction free nzvi had reached 75 of its final removal capacity whereas for the same period of time only 30 of the final removal capacity was achieved by the nzvi pan 9 230 on the other hand after 240 min of reaction even when the free nzvi removed twice the amount of cr vi per gram of nanoparticles than nzvi pan 9 230 inserted graph in fig 8a the removal capacity of both free and nc embedded nzvi is similar per unit mass of fe 0 this is a remarkable result since immobilized nanoparticles are expected to be less reactive as the polymer molecules can be irreversibly attached to the nanoparticle surfaces 7 67 and a smaller surface area of nzvi is exposed for reaction in this case the pan matrix surrounding the nanoparticles in the ncs seems to affect exclusively the reaction rate but not the reactivity itself an equivalent result and effect was found for nzvi pan 4 230 ncs figure s9 in the sm in addition the elevated reactivity of nzvi is the counterpart of a high chemical lability 68 and it is not evident that the immobilized nanoparticles will present the same physicochemical characteristics and performance as free nzvi in suspension thus a thorough characterization of the nanoparticles once retained in the supporting matrix whether it is organic inorganic or biological is crucial to understand the actual performance and potential application of immobilized nzvi and more specifically the fe 0 in their core in table 1 we compare the removal capacity of various materials based on nzvi for the removal of cr vi removal capacities in table 1 were calculated assuming complete efficiency in the entrapment immobilization of fe 0 nanoparticles or its precursors during the synthesis except in the case of the work of fu et al 70 that provides the information of total immobilized iron to the best of our knowledge the cr vi removal capacity of the nzvi pan ncs produced for this work is the highest found in the specific literature evaluated by mass of nzvi unfortunately the works reported in table 1 did not provide enough information to calculate the removal capacity as a function of the fe 0 composition finally to determine the nature of cr removed from the solution an experiment using cr iii instead of cr vi was performed cr iii concentration was measured by total cr content analysis the rcrtotal after 240 min contact with nzvi pan 0 230 and nzvi pan 17 230 beads with 65 μm cr vi or cr iii solutions at ph 3 is represented in fig 8b bare pan spheres treated at 230 c removed around 11 5 and 5 of the initial crtotal after 240 min of contact with cr vi and cr iii solutions respectively at ph 3 such a small retention capacity for cr iii can be explained as a consequence of surface repulsion between the beads and the main aqueous species of cr iii at ph 3 cr oh2 6 3 in turn nzvi pan 17 230 retained 41 6 and 34 of the initial crtotal in solution this implies that the total amount of cr withdrawn from the treated solution corresponds exclusively to precipitation of cr3 on the surface of the zvi nanoparticles according to eqs 3 5 the scheme presented in fig 9 summarizes the cr vi removal mechanism by the pan embedded nzvi at ph 3 hcro4 percolates through the polymer channelled structure where it is adsorbed in a small proportion or continues to diffuse until it reaches the immobilized nanoparticles where it is adsorbed and then reduced to cr3 part of the cr3 is retained in the surface of the nzvi as a passivating layer consistent in cr oh 3 and or cr iii fe iii hydr oxides and part of it slowly diffuses outside the polymer structure together with fe2 produced during the corrosion and reaction with cr vi 4 conclusions the current work has demonstrated the successful synthesis and application of nzvi embedded in pan spheres for the effective removal of cr from water over a range of ph conditions the results confirm that the embedded zvi nanoparticles interact with aqueous cr in the same reactive manner as free nzvi in aqueous suspension showing a similar total performance but slower rates of reaction the presence of the porous polymer support is considered to mitigate the rate at which cr vi can access the nzvi surfaces resulting in a slower rate of reaction but also a lower degree of fe dissolution and cr iii release given the proven applicability of nzvi to treat a large range of water pollutants the observed performance of the ncs presented here is potentially useful in water treatment applications where deploying free suspensions of nanoparticles is considered inappropriate instead the nzvi impregnated pan spheres offer a static treatment bed method for water remediation wherein the nanoparticles remain in a fixed location it is also noteworthy that the impregnated spheres can be produced in bulk quantities with relative ease declaration of competing

13712,alarming water pollution is toxic to the aquatic ecosystem leading to a sharp decline in species diversity diatoms have great potency to survive in contaminated water bodies hence they can be compelling bioindicators to monitor the change in the environmental matrices effectively around the globe researchers are intended to evaluate the impact of pollution on the diatoms recovery and techniques used for the assessment the diatoms are precious for futuristic need viz value added products energy generation pharmaceuticals and aquaculture feedstocks all these applications led to a significant rise in diatoms research among the scientific community this review presents different isolation practices cultivation and other challenges associated with the diatoms a precise focus is given to diatoms isolation techniques from highly polluted water bodies with the main thrust towards obtaining an axenic culture to elucidate the significance of pure diatom cultures recovery of jewels of the sea from polluted water signifies the prospective ecological and economic aspects keywords axenic culture diatoms microalgae bioindicators isolation wastewater 1 introduction diatoms are the most successful contemporary group of photosynthetic eukaryotic microbes that inhabit almost every kind of aquatic ecosystem they can occur as endosymbionts in dinoflagellates 1 2 diatoms have arisen because of an endosymbiotic event between red algae and heterotrophic flagellate approximately 240 million years ago 3 although there are several types of microalgae present in water diatoms are the most important and unique as they are the only species with the presence of silica in their cell 3 4 diatoms are surrounded by a silica cell wall that allowing them to have varied shapes and sizes their silica cell wall is popularly known as frustules that offer protection from photoinhibition supply appropriate nutrients uptake manage sinking rate and playing a significant role as a mechanical barrier against grazers 5 their silica content varies from one species to another depending upon their size growth pattern and environmental variables such as light temperature salinity nutrients and growth phase 6 there are more than 200 000 extant species of diatoms distributed to a different ecosystem 7 they are widely present in all aquatic habitat constituting lentic lotic habitat and sand it is estimated that 70 of species occur in freshwater and 83 are benthic 8 aquatic ecosystems such as rivers oceans lakes etc support the lives of a large variety of organisms but excessive urbanization and industrialization transform them into the heavily polluted zone 9 10 the rising pollution level deteriorates the water quality index leading to a huge decline in species diversity due to untreated discharge of metals pesticides aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons etc which slows down the survival of an aquatic species thus posing a big threat 11 several organisms have been used as bioindicators such as protozoa bacteria fishes zooplankton algae etc however diatom based monitoring for the assessment of ecosystem remedy is in great demand 12 because diatoms produce organic matter to a large extent that permits natural inbuilt capacity to withstand toxicity levels in water bodies extended survival rate short regeneration time than microalgae fishes and other micro invertebrates thus making them one of the best candidate for water quality monitoring and excellent bioindicators of aquatic biological integrity 12 13 water quality analysis is essential as it allowed to detect the habitat linked information of the related organisms 14 as diatoms also produce eicosapentaenoic acid epa docosahexaenoic acid dha and other nutritional compounds they can be used as a food source to every aquatic organism such as zooplankton and fish they constitute 40 of oxygen in water bodies fix excessive chemical compounds and inorganic nutrients in the water such as carbon phosphorous silica etc 15 as fossil fuels are diminishing quickly therefore the demand for biofuel production has increased many folds since the last decades the crop and food producing plants will never be the top priority for biofuel production in the future diatoms will remain as the best candidate for biofuel production some strain of diatoms produces lipids as 50 to 80 of the dry weight that can be used in the production of biofuel thereby focusing on the role of diatoms as an ideal substitute for fossil fuels 16 despite having all these important characteristics they are the least explored aquatic species because isolation and maintenance of axenic culture is a tedious job 17 in this review an effort has been put forward on the details related to the isolation of diatoms from polluted water bodies the significance of diatoms and their future potential 2 ecological significance of diatoms rapid industrialization and urbanization releasing a toxic substance into the aquatic environment thousands of chemicals without any proper risk assessment and legislation are being introduced which are endangered to aquatic species 18 algae bacteria protozoa fishes micro invertebrates and zooplankton have been extensively used in biomonitoring purposes but recently diatoms have gained much more attention because they are primary producers and plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles of the aquatic food web 11 12 19 diatoms survive well in a variety of habitat such as oceans lakes estuaries wetlands etc the use of diatoms in ecotoxicological studies is advantageous to examine any possible effects of toxic elements this makes diatom a potential tool in bioassay than any other aquatic species because of its easy sampling and frustules identification 20 21 diatoms are highly sensitive to metal pollution than macroinvertebrates which could very well explain gradation in metal composition thus allows early identification of the presence of any heavy metal pollution in an aquatic ecosystem 12 diatom responds quickly to any organic matter or nutrient contamination for example metolachlor atrazine simazine phenols nitrate phosphate heavy metals and pahs 22 23 even though diatoms are ecologically diverse their potential in biomonitoring is underutilized in evaluating any risk assessment because of traditionally available metrices such as cell density biovolume and relative abundance new and advanced metrices are more advantageous in recognizing the dynamics of diatoms communities by demonstrating the sub lethal effect that is not evident in diatom counts 19 24 nuclear abnormalities cell membrane cytoplasmic content and photosynthetic apparatus alteration change in lipid content and diatoms classification using ecological status are the main parameters that were infrequently reported 25 27 this behavior demonstrates sensitivity and efficiency in quantifying the toxic elements stress detection after ultraviolet uv exposure which remains unnoticed by the conventional method 28 as reported calculating live diatom species in the biofilms seems to be a lucrative bioassessment tool similarly for assessing weak cytoplasmic content of freshwater species the ecological association of diatoms is examined for evaluating the environmental health of water bodies because these newer metrices are easy to acquire rapid detection low labor intensive good reproducibility standardized and worldwide acceptance 23 28 diatoms as bioindicators check and observe the integrity of the precious environment by enumerating the change in water quality over large geological areas provide variability and any possible backdrop precondition 29 investigator worldwide have examined various water bodies using pollution tolerant diatom species to measure the pollution level by employing algal indices such as palmer s algal index chlorophycean index nygaard s phytoplankton indices to better realize the water quality for example some investigator utilized nygaard s algal index to evaluate the trophic status of hatia dam revealing the oligotrophic condition of water bodies 30 mishra and co workers studied the bhoj wetland employing nygaard s algal index to illustrate the wetland s eutrophic nature 31 palmer index was utilized in determining the seasonal variation in phytoplankton diversity of pichhola lake of udaipur rajasthan 32 sharan and rekha used nygaard s algal index in their evaluation of the trophic status of hatia dam finding the waterbody to exhibit an oligotrophic status 33 but still diatoms potential is hardly exploited as bioindicators in determining the economic conditions as compared to other groups of microalgae 30 the environmental conditions of the target species must be taken into account as understanding their habitat and mimicking them in the laboratory play a crucial role in obtaining pure strains each aquatic ecosystem has different attributes river ecosystems may have less alkalinity than a marine ecosystem 34 these attributes directly or indirectly affect the occurrence of diatoms in a diverse aquatic ecosystem thus several factors such as seasonal variation ph temperature salinity etc should be considered as important factors 35 the representatives of the genus gomphonemoid can be examined from both marine and freshwater gomphonemoid is widely present often in freshwater epiphytic and epilithic communities 36 gomphonema one of the most common diatom strains its valve and girdle view the heteropolar cuneate shape can be recognized easily gomphonema is attached to the substratum by a mucilage stalk which assists in recognize strain from the rest of the other diatoms found in the freshwater ecosystem the valves are wide at the head than foot pole with both uniseriate and biseriate nearby amid individual areolae cover up externally by crescent shaped volae 37 39 the raphe is straight or sinuous with terminal fissures expanding both apices to the valve margin and inner central endings turn aside to one or the same side respectively the raphe is always shorter from the central nodule to the head pole thus extending towards the foot pole consequently a perforated distinct pole field of different structures is also present at the foot pole in many species isolated punctatum near the central nodule occurs the cingulum is arranged into many open bands every second band is shorter than the next one to form lingual at the foot pole each band is punctured by more than one row of pores many other diatom species with the same cuneate shape growing in the marine ecosystem can be compared to gomphonema by various workers 40 benthic diatoms are the significant controller in freshwater owing to their excellent adsorption absorption oxidation decomposition precipitation capability to store nutrients they are very well utilized in biomonitoring purposes since the last decade because these diatoms provide crucial linkage in the aquatic ecosystem stipulating the flow of energy cycling of materials and reveal the water environment 41 diatom based indices were first produced by kolkwitz marsson 42 since more than 20 indices have been created from 1975 to 2015 such as humic degree trophic level indicators eutrophication biological diatom index to name a few however the impact of indices has become less focal owing to the differences between floral geographical area and environment fluctuations guiding species to adapt according to the water quality criteria of the particular region in a particular instance of time 43 isolation and identification of benthic diatoms are problematic in comparison with planktonic species due to difficulties in sample treatment sampling and microscopic observation though benthic diatoms play the main role as bioindicators in the aquatic ecosystem because they attached to the substratum with secreted mucilage from their cell wall 44 45 the morphological features help in the classification of particular species morphological analysis by light microscope lm and electron microscope for instance transmission electron microscope tem scanning electron microscopy sem provides the better detailed result of diatom biodiversity 46 the detection of diatom communities on various substrata can be observed as the slimy layer of biofilm appears brown or yellow brown although there are several types of substrata for isolating diatoms the most preferred is from cobbles epilithon epiphytes also have diatoms attached to them 47 the taxonomy of the epiphyte should be recorded as specific strains attach to specific macrophytes a typical substratum can be introduced to the water manually if the preferred substratum is absent the isolated biofilm can be preserved or can be used for the preparation of axenic culture a well concentrated sample collected from a highly polluted habitat may have a more significant number of microalgae rather than diatoms sometimes an association between diatoms and other microalgae can be seen it may also contain empty or broken frustules highly polluted water may have a high concentration of biogenic compounds which may provide less nutrition or over nutrition this may profit in the growth of those strain which requires fewer nutrients or high nutrients respectively salinity ph light etc factors also play a role in the growth of such diatoms 48 the productivity of diatoms is higher than the other class of microalgae they have undergone 2 4 cell divisions per day they can survive in adverse climatic conditions since their silica cell wall is a nanoporous structure which allows them to act as a potential buffer system by improving carbonic anhydrase activity and helps in the transformation of bicarbonate to carbon di oxide co2 they actively participate in wastewater remediation and quenching of heavy metal leading to a degradation of environmental pollution 49 though bacteria fungus yeast and algal biomass are commonly used in the treatment of heavy metal diatoms are most preferred due to their large surface area mucilage nutritional requirement and faster growth rate bioremediation of heavy metal involves biosorption to metal binding ligands on the cell surface followed by bioaccumulation consists of inorganic molecules and related enzymes in biosorption the uptake of heavy metals is either carried out by the physiochemical pathway devoid of atp or during metabolism engaging atp energy this mode of heavy metal remediation is a cost effective approach through filtration it is an extracellular passive route of adsorption of heavy metal which is an energy independent process occurring at the cell surface in equilibrium 50 biosorption is dependent upon temperature ionic strength ph contact time biomass and metal concentration the composition of the cell wall and metallic ions complexation the principle behind biosorption is that diatoms are equipped with polymers their outer wall has a negative surface charge due to functional groups like carboxyl phosphoryl and amine the heavy metal with a positive surface charge attracts a negative charge through electrostatic interaction which finally supports biosorption bioaccumulation is an active intracellular process driven by energy the heavy metals grow along with nutrients that assist in bioremediation when heavy metals are accumulated the microalgae produce reactive oxygen species ros to control cellular metabolism there is an underlying passive uptake followed by an active process that is brought about by the detoxification of heavy metal at the cell surface by dehalogenation and denitrification process this triggers the exclusion of heavy metals to maintain equilibrium conditions thus eliminate toxic effects despite this a lot of work needs to be done in the treatment of wastewater by testing more species and study their capability of heavy metals removal the biological degradation of heavy metal is quite challenging but not impossible 49 51 3 taxonomic studies of the target species previously diatoms have been differentiating according to shape size pattern and ultrastructure of their exoskeleton which consists of silica known as frustules microscopic identification is based on the shape of their frustules but still they are challenging to identify and improper examination reflects misleading observation upon identification beyond the genus level 52 54 to combat such a drawback deoxyribonucleic acid dna sequence analysis has become a more potent approach in diatom research thus opens a new leaf into their systematic and evolution the main aim of the taxonomic examination is to make a hierarchical classification accurately reflecting evolutionary relationship which then converted into a hierarchy of names related to different levels in a hierarchy of taxonomic ranks recently diatoms phylogenetic analysis at the generic and infrageneric levels require internal transcribed spacer its region of the 18s 5 8s 26s nuclear ribosomal dna and among all 18s ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna sequencing resulting in the largest reference sequence dataset among the different markers used for diatoms 55 57 microarray technology enables parallel analysis of many genes in a single reaction here ordered matrices of dna sequence marked on the glass slide used for hybridization experiment with fluorescently labeled target genes and have been extensively used in both basic and applied aspects of the biological sciences 58 though several papers related to taxonomy and most of them provide line drawings or light microscopic images that are unable to give enough ultrastructure details of the diatom cell 59 a complete taxonomic survey can give the entire morphology of lesser known microalgae or diatoms as there can be a minor difference in the morphological structure of two or more organisms such organisms are difficult to identify even under the lm organisms like cyclotella brebisson may comprise more than complex 100 species which includes small specimens with a diameter of 5 μm 60 based on frustules morphology observation of these small specimens under a sem provides notable interspecific similarities that help in taxonomic studies as some species may have similar morphological characteristics which may be ecologically distinct their identification should be fundamentally accurate as it can provide quite an information about biodiversity which can be represented as an essential tool for different kind of studies such as ecological and applied studies proschkinia is a rare diatom of the family proschkiniaceae within the naviculales based on light microscopy it was classified as a relative of nitzschia the phylogenetic position of proschkinia was resolved with sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome of proschkinia complanatoides and compared the data set to other published diatom mitochondrial genes 61 to differentiate between diatoms strains that have similar morphology it is vital to know the taxonomy of the target species the nutritional requirements of various species also vary some species require less nutrition composition light temperature variables while some require more the taxonomy also helps in understanding the basic requirements of the target species 62 once the culture has been collected and identified they will be preserved in the world federation of culture collection centers which then made available to researchers and industry for intending applications and further experiments table 1 shows the list of available algae microalgae and diatom culture collection centers worldwide 4 understanding diatoms isolation and investigations 4 1 preparation for sample collection the field procedures play a crucial role in the isolation of diatoms microalgae or other species in a riverine environment small boulders rocks and cobbles are the most favored substratum for diatoms screening almost all diatom indexed to the eplithion community found here where epilithion s ecology is recognized better than any other group 63 bricks concrete bridge supports canal walls etc may be used as an alternative substratum whereas simulated substrate can be set up into the stream if pebbles cobbles boulders or macrophytes do not exist from the site though sampling should be done if they have been plunged for several weeks 47 sampling is an important step towards the collection of diatoms as the whole isolation process depends on it the collected water sample may contain dead cells or damaged cells which is not considered good so it becomes very crucial to ideally collect the sample and isolate the most viable cells at the earliest keeping the water sample for longer times is not recommended because environmental conditions change very frequently which leads to cell death some species multiply quickly and suddenly die in that case isolation should be done rapidly sometimes a planktonic net can be used to concentrate the sample as it removes other unwanted algal species microorganisms or debris but should be avoided as more concentrated sample leads to more damaged cells 47 63 the collected sample should be kept according to the target species environmental conditions for example several marine species are susceptible to sample concentration for a sampling of these strains of species special water bottles can be used as several factors like water depth pressure temperature or light influence the sample conditions so instead of using a concentrated sample a normal water sample taken in sterile containers can provide a better result the collected sample should always be kept in sterile containers at a stable temperature 63 often sample collected from different water bodies contains zooplankton or other species which feed on algae or specifically on diatoms so it is essential to remove the unwanted organisms gently by filtering the sample at the sample site however sometimes tiny organisms may pass through the filter which may pose threats to target species in that case dilution methods can be used to isolate the target species the health of species in nature also plays a crucial role as an isolated cell will have successful growth only if they were in a good state at the sample collection time it is advised to collect the sample carefully the use of sterile equipment is mandatory as dirty equipment may lead to contamination all the isolation techniques should be performed under sterile conditions 64 a general idea about field procedure laboratory procedure culture preparation and finally aim towards obtaining axenic culture is presented in fig 1 4 2 substrata selection the identification of a suitable substrate is a pivotal step to recognize the diatom communities in the natural environment diatom communities form a slimy layer or thin golden brown layer on the substratum it can be more noticeable by feel or touch and can be identified at a specific time depending on species the substratum can be differentiated into a preferred substrate and an alternative substrate diatom attaches to different substrata or facilitates locomotion by releasing mucilage from various structures of the cell wall 65 diatom community composition is mainly influenced by chemicals present in water water turbulence temperature and light present in water being eaten by large microorganisms etc the most preferred substratum is the solid substratum it mainly includes cobbles pebbles and small rocks epilithon fig 2 depicts various substrates intended for diatoms sampling they are widely available in almost every aquatic habitat and throughout the year in the absence of a solid substrate submerged or emerging macrophytic plants epiphyte should be sampled as it also provides a suitable habitat for diatom communities it is ideal to note the microhabitat of diatoms species 35 4 3 elimination of contaminants from collected sample the most effective method to eliminate contaminants is achieved by various techniques such as filtration sedimentation and centrifugation as gravity separation the most successful technique is filtration as it removes all unwanted microorganisms or other zooplankton which feed on diatoms from the sample in this a planktonic net of a specific size is used which does not allow any other organism to pass through except the target species in gravity separation diatoms settle down as sediments while leaving other microalgae in the suspension which can be discarded further 66 4 4 health and safety tips field operators should always wear thigh waders for the protection of feet they should wear life jackets while sampling they should never go in depth for sampling they should wear globes when sampling heavily polluted water bodies they should be very careful in habitats dominated by dangerous animals posing a threat to people and blood sucking worms like leeches 65 4 5 water quality analysis anthropogenic pressure from the urbanized area causes changes in the water quality of a river and leads to the eutrophication of reservoirs and the proliferation of algae the informal settlements without sanitary infrastructure aggravate the deterioration of water quality in urban water sources 67 the water quality index conducted by using the planktonic diatom index pdi for monitoring the lake erie s nearshore pelagic zone provides a robust assessment of water quality 68 the collected water sample should be adequately analyzed as it gives full information about the diatom habitat and its environment several factors should be measured hydrological characteristics of the stream which mainly examined with stream velocity and channel depth and channel breadth physical variables of water mainly involve water temperature and turbidity physico chemical variables are examined with ph conductivity total dissolved solids water contains nutrients such as orthophosphate phosphorus po4 p total phosphate tp ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n which should be further analyzed major cation anions such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na chloride cl sulphates so4 should also be estimated in water parameters for oxygen and organic matter like oxygen saturation chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total organic carbon toc should be analyzed all physicochemical parameters of water should be tested as per the american public health association apha standards 69 for monitoring the pollution of water bodies several indices have been developed such as the index of saprobity eutrophication idse 5 which utilizes the diatom population in terms of organic pollution 70 water can be divided into two types such as groundwater and surface water and both are at the risk of pollutants ranges from heavy metals pesticides fertilizers hazardous chemicals etc an accepted water quality criterion according to american public health association apha the world health organization who indian standard institution isi indian council of medical research icmr and central pollution control board cpcb consisting of various parameters are presented in table 2 71 5 laboratory procedures examination of the collected sample from different substrata should be done as quickly as possible to make sure that diatom assemblage contains live cells and not dead ones sample with more dead cells should be discarded and sampling should be performed again the environmental conditions of samples collected from various aquatic habitats should be mimicked in a laboratory it should be noted that all equipment like glass slide coverslip pipette forceps inoculating loop centrifuge tube glass test tube watch glass etc must be sterilized before use uncleaned equipment may lead to contaminations that further result in the death of cells after examination of diatoms in the collected sample standard isolation methods should be performed 72 5 1 standard isolation methods as the collected sample contains various microorganisms and other microalgae these standard isolation methods play a crucial role in the isolation of target species of diatom the isolator should focus on finding the target species in the collected sample viable cells should be cultured as soon as possible while avoiding contaminants all the following methods should be performed carefully 72 5 1 1 single cell isolation capillary action the simplest method of single cell isolation is performed with the help of micropipette first attempted by zumstein 1900 later improved by pringshiem 1949 17 73 74 a capillary is attached to the pasteur pipette to make it ideal for single cell isolation this method requires a lot of practice as diatoms have a minimal size one single cell can also be picked separately with the help of a micropipette single cell isolation with micropipette is to pick a single cell of target species without getting it damage and avoiding contaminants and deposit it into a sterile tube or watch glass and then transfer it to a culture tube the whole process is done with the help of a microscope especially an inverted microscope as it allows the isolator to work conveniently 75 76 5 2 dilution techniques this method is very useful while isolating cells from very contaminated samples with a tiny microorganism which is harder to separate from the sample the aim of this method to separate one single cell of target species and deposit it in a culture test tube usually dilution is repeated serially up to 1 10 77 5 3 isolation using agar it is probably the oldest and standard method available to isolate microorganisms most of the diatom species usually grow well in agar isolation using agar can be used with both streaking and spreading methods later single cells or colonies can be picked from the culture plate and observed under the microscope to study the colony diatom community characteristics agar plate method is advantageous the agar concentration should be between 0 8 to 1 5 and 2 0 while observing glass slide under a microscope if it contains a single diatom cell it can be replicated on the agar plate for culture agar pour plate method can also be used to isolate cells that do not grow on the surface of the agar plate 78 5 4 density centrifugation this is a physical technique for the pre separation of single cells of diatoms from polluted water the centrifugal technique applies gravity settling to isolate more prominent species from the microalgae low dense cells for example microscopic organisms and others present in the supernatant are emptied while diatoms species stay at the base as a pellet the speed and time of centrifugation vary depending upon the target microalgal species even though reasonably successful however it might harm delicate cells through sheer pressure 79 5 5 enrichment culture this method involves the use of enrichment media enrichment media is rich in one constitute which provides nutrition to only one two types of cells species while inhibiting the growth of other cells microorganisms for example it has been noted that the presence of silica in a culture media boost the growth of diatoms but inhibit the growth of other microalgae sometimes even a trace element makes an enormous difference in the growth of species so it is necessary to know the nutritional requirement of the target species and it should be reached as it will improve the growth of the target species 76 85 5 6 membrane filtration this is a pre isolation step towards the separation of diatoms samples can break into two portions depend upon particle size difference sometimes enrichment media can also be utilized for better outcomes while separating fungal cells from diatoms bigger species can be held at the membrane however diatom cells pass through the filter quickly this strategy is helpful advantageous and very adaptable 81 5 7 isolation with alginate beads another technique where alginate beads were utilized to isolate the algal species from the mixed algal culture 82 in this method the contaminated water is placed in nutrient media and incubate for one week or more to affirm the development of different species a known concentration of sodium alginate solution containing a mixed culture of diatoms is added drop by drop to a calcium chloride solution to form alginate beads and kept for 6 8 h to make beads stronger stiff and firm the beads transferred to a 96 well enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa microplate one bead per well smashed partially containing standard culture media and incubated under controlled conditions in the presence of light for one week to confirm the growth of isolated diatom species the trapped diatom species in the beads viewed microscopically for the confirmation of isolated species this methodology is simple easy cost effective compared with existing methods and can be easily applied for the mass cultivation of specific species 17 5 8 other methods there are other different strategies for the isolation of diatom species like anti microbials uv radiation anti microbial treatment hinders growth development by eliminating microorganisms thus help with getting the confined unadulterated culture of diatoms uv radiation act as a disinfectant that prevents bacteria and other contaminants since diatoms are better resistant to uv radiation over bacterial cells 81 photoinhibition is an immediate strategy that harms biomolecules by engrossing uv light which prompts the loss of natural capacity of microscopic organisms 17 6 advanced isolation techniques 6 1 micromanipulation diatoms are valuable for the aquatic food chain and give significant bioactive compounds to human prosperity segregating unadulterated species or getting axenic culture from a polluted water source is a complicated and tedious procedure with the current strategies hence it becomes necessary to search for other advanced isolation techniques micromanipulation is one such method permitting refined confining single species in a more cleansed manner prior fine capillary tubes were used focusing on target cells under microscopic observation which is a laborious task and threat to contamination 83 with the arrival of a modern sophisticated micromanipulator exploiting micromanipulator and stereomicroscope a high level of precision can be achieved for screening and isolation of species of interest 80 a cell of interest can be captured utilizing a focused laser and transferred to a sterile media of interest this system is still in its early stages because of the high state of expertise and time required 84 6 2 automated techniques the requirement for cutting edge new methods push researcher to redesign the flow cytometer coupling facs fluorescence activated cell sorting the premise of this procedure is light scattering and fluorescence 84 cells absorb the laser beam transmit fluorescence and give information on cell size pigments and reliability of species which is identified with the morphology and other characteristics of the species accordingly thus allowing characterization of up to 10 000 cells in a fraction of second 85 this technique can be employed to build up an axenic culture and get rid of any bacterial contamination in some cases mixed culture or aggregation of cells may make issues in the precise identification of cells which can be overcome by cell disruption through appropriate sonication under controlled conditions this technique is generally excellent for quick screening of organisms overproduces metabolites of interest in conjunction with fluorescent dyes for example bodipy or nile red facilitates the selection of desired mutants from a mixed population 86 an overview of the main techniques used to establish axenic diatom cultures is presented in table 3 6 3 importance of correct isolation in diatom research diatoms the most productive phytoplankton found all over the planet from antarctic glaciers to brick walls have drawn a tremendous awareness in the research field i e for the quantitative reconstructions of ocean surface conditions to establish palaeoceanographic records 87 they are one of the most promising candidates for various applications such as pharmaceuticals bioenergy industrial chemicals nutraceuticals and aquaculture 88 89 to make most out of it an axenic culture of diatom must be a prerequisite bearing in mind that a pure culture of diatoms is undoubtedly required in genome sequencing 90 to identify the producer of any novel bioactive compound for large scale manufacturing of nutraceutical 91 building a consortium for bioremediation 92 and to elucidate the relationship between other microalgae using omics tool 93 maintaining an axenic culture for a longer duration is very difficult because bacteria are vulnerable which frequently attacks the diatom the primary focus is to isolate pure species of diatoms and their maintenance 17 nevertheless an axenic strategy is dependent upon contamination and desirable organisms disclosing the possible relationship between them leading to the understanding selecting and developing an axenic culture which is a critical step thus alleviate the cultivation method mimicking the natural environment for optimum growth under laboratory conditions facilitates the development of an axenic culture but this step requires the correct isolation plan and approach 94 the fundamental question is are axenic culture genuine what is the acceptability of their purity level with the direct symbiotic association between diatoms and other aquatic organisms the development of a new advanced technique to assess the purity level cannot be ruled out therefore emphasis should be given towards improvement and innovation in isolation methods to standardize and establish the correct isolation practices to solve future energy crises nutritional requirement nutraceuticals pharmaceuticals by choosing the right technique for right diatom species for the benefit to the mankind society and last but not least the ecological balance 95 therefore constant effort to develop a new scientific method will surely pave the way towards the isolation of diatoms from mixed culture and maintaining their purity level to a greater extent diatoms virus interactions are rather difficult in obtaining pure culture the virus kills diatoms thus benefitting other algae the limitation in silicon levels in the oceans facilitates infection by the virus accelerating diatoms mortality due to viral infection is a major concern affecting the carbon cycle leading to global warming and ultimately changes climatic conditions drastically also ocean study is a difficult task the main emphasis is given towards the marine environment rather than terrestrial causing disparity about diatoms virus interactions as a result more isolations techniques and characterization is necessary for controlling the action of the virus in the regulation of host populations 96 several species of diatoms are found in a highly acidic environment and they continue to grow consistently near or in the acidic conditions both in marine and freshwater ecosystems they exhibited a significant response to the alterations in the growth conditions they are capable of integrating numerous physiological as well as morphological adaptations which favors their persistence diatoms growth inhibited majorly in silica limitations than any other nutrients because cell division cannot sustain for a more extended period under silica deprived conditions 97 highly acidic conditions resulted in decreased si indicating that close to the end of this century ocean acidification might persuade the c and si cycle and alter the composition of diatoms 34 considerable human interference is turning aquatic bodies towards the acidic zone and many countries have seen ocean acidification even in extreme low temperature conditions such as north america canada and italy due to the high concentration of hydrogen ions diatoms flora like nitzschia pinnularia eunotia and frustularia are exceptionally rich in habitats within the ph range of 4 5 5 98 in an acidic environment a higher cell volume chlorophyll and productivity were observed due to a change in water chemistry because in acidic conditions number of grazing macroinvertebrates and microheterotrophs were less in number 99 however it is unattainable to understand the natural influx of pre acidification natural fluctuations in conditions and the level of nutrients that tend to vary from habitat to habitat abundance and fall in diatom species can be explained based on physiological ph availability of the essential nutrients and biological interactions which could be the factor for the productivity of diatoms in extreme conditions very little is known about the influence of acidification on diatoms hence the effect of acidic environment on diatoms changes from the open sea near to the sea and deep sea and indeed not a decrease in diatoms productivity and growth 100 since diatoms nurture associated aquatic species to a greater extent within the marine environment so achieving utmost purity and break communication with unwanted organisms is a significant challenge therefore emphasis should be given to improve and channelize knowledge towards proper isolation techniques that will separate diatoms from contamination and any possible intervention to promote appropriate growth and development of diatoms 101 102 an outline of isolation of pure diatom species getting affected by the surrounding contaminants is challenging since they get heavily occupied with different interfering organisms which pose a significant threat in obtaining axenic culture as presented in fig 3 7 steps for obtaining axenic culture 7 1 preparation of culture media although there are several culture media are available but the most recommended culture media for isolation and growth of diatoms are f 2 si pm and wc media the composition of each culture media is prescribed according to the selection of diatoms for culturing for the desired application f 2 si culture media is widely used as the most effective media whereas pm media is utilized for culturing diatoms in an acidic environment wc media is generally used for culturing diatoms existing in an alkaline environment 6 all these culture media differ in their composition of major and minor nutrients and provide proper nourishment to diatom culture f 2 si media is required for marine species while pm and wc media supports the cultivation of freshwater species for marine it is advised to prepare both media with seawater and for freshwater prepare media with distilled water 103 the chemical composition of different culture media for diatoms cultivation are presented in table 4 7 2 elimination of contaminants from culture elimination of contaminants is important to maintain the pure culture of isolated species as stated the above contamination can be eliminated with gravity separation dilution techniques etc in the case of bacterial contamination antibiotics should be used in a specific amount in culture every equipment glassware used in isolation or culture should be sterilized before performing experiments culture should be maintained in aseptic and optimum conditions 104 7 3 sub culturing after preparing the axenic culture it should be subcultured after over a specific period subculturing should be done before the decline phase of the primary culture each subculture should be prepared in aseptic conditions after each subculture it should be observed for contaminations and in case of occurrence of contamination that specific subculture should be discarded and the process is repeated 105 7 4 preparation of axenic culture an axenic culture contains only one target species and is free of all contaminations after isolation of target species of diatoms it is necessary to maintain the culture free from contaminants so that a pure culture can be established pure isolated cultures can be obtained from a combination of techniques such as flow sorting pasteur pipette and agar plate methods the polluted water collected from various habitat will be immediately examined by monitoring ph and temperature at the site and will be carried to the laboratory in 2 3 liters plastic bottles the raw wastewater was filtered twice with a 0 45 μm pore size whatman filter paper to remove the large suspended solids particles and debris the wastewater will be autoclaved for sterilization and further used for the cultivation of the microalgae the physico chemical parameters of wastewater will be characterized as per the standard procedure of apha guidelines 69 106 initially the water sample will be serially diluted in a microwell plate and test tube to get a pure culture and observed under the microscope to confirm the presence of microalgae species isolation will also be carried out by spreading or streaking wastewater in a solid agar medium supplemented with silica once confirmed the microalgae species were transferred slowly and gradually in different volumes of erlenmeyer flasks containing artificial seawater enriched with f 2 si media at ph 8 3 and maintained in the culture room at 12 h dark light diurnal cycle with a desired luminous intensity at 22 23 c finally strains will be identified and their taxonomic classification will be established fig 4 shows the overview of obtaining pure culture diatoms from polluted water bodies 7 5 future perspectives and commercial value of diatoms diatoms are very young as compared to other phytoplanktons but have evolved rapidly over some time a decline return on investment in research and development r d and slow growing companies accelerating the demand for diatoms cultivation serving as a superfood the term nutraceutical refers to nutrition that provides physiological benefits coupled with the protection and prevention of disease these functional foods promote health by adding novel ingredients that are similar to conventional foods but with rich nutrition or bioactive compounds that may target the physiological mechanism of our body as characterized by the us department of agriculture agricultural research service 107 on account of large content of polyunsaturated fatty acids e g pufas n3 and n6 essential amino acids e g leucine isoleucine and valine and pigments e g lutein and β carotene and vitamins e g b12 the diatoms biomass have gained much popularity across the globe 6 nutraceutical industries manufacturing products on a large scale in collaboration with the food and pharmaceutical industry thus benefitting consumers diatoms are emerging as leading nutraceutical ingredients from a biotechnological point of view since they are equipped with polyunsaturated fatty acids essential amino acids pigments and vitamins according to the world health organization who the most severe challenge of the 21 st century is a lifestyle disease i e non communicable disease the current focus is to develop functional food and their products which combat the disease development 107 diatoms are underutilized among the microalgae and only a few species have been characterized thoroughly diatom based products are an excellent source for multifaceted use covering the health and nutraceutical sector therefore the cultivation of diatoms under different cultural conditions helps to understand their biochemistry to a large extent 108 diatoms cells after degradation settled down in the form of silica which is known as diatomaceous earth these death remains have tremendous applications for industrial and agriculture purposes ongoing covid 19 impacted the world economy the diatomite industry has also suffered significantly but successful in maintaining an optimistic growth for four years the average annual growth rate of the diatomite industry will reach millions usd in 2019 probably by 2024 the market potential will see a significant expansion 109 diatomaceous earth is one of the major causes of their successful existence on the globe and also act as carbon dioxide sequester on the ocean floor however more information is needed about nutrient upwellings and the causes of their bloom degradation in their natural habitats further a more in depth study on their self defense mechanisms will reveal the unfolded truth about the interaction of diatoms and their feeders in the food web to overcome the constraints of fossil fuels the generation of bioenergy makes renewable energy particularly interesting nowadays renewable resources are contributing 35 of the total energy of the world diatoms synthesize oil for human consumption which is rich in nutrition showing a promising alternative to meet the demand of future growing populations we need to emphasize the latest more productive technologies to overcome the cost of their cultivation and harvesting for optimum utilization of diatoms as biofuels valuable products wastewater remediation and aquaculture 110 the generation of bioenergy from novel sources like diatoms is incredibly significant as they contribute towards carbon dioxide mitigation generation of renewable energy concomitant with a plethora of value added products due to their unique evolutionary history and their adaptations to varied environmental conditions diatoms have spread all around the world undoubtedly diatoms are playing a significant role in the reduction of global warming gases such as carbon dioxide and provide possibilities to change the present climatic conditions but still more researches are needed on their biogeographic distribution and to learn more about factors which are responsible for their more successful existence diatoms cells after degradation settled down in the form of silica which is known as diatomaceous earth these death remains have tremendous applications for industrial and agriculture purposes diatomaceous earth is one of the major causes of their successful existence on the globe and also act as carbon dioxide sequester on the ocean floor 111 however more information is needed about nutrient upwellings and the causes of their bloom degradation in their natural habitats further a more in depth study on their self defense mechanisms will reveal the unfolded truth about the interaction of diatoms and their feeders in the food web to overcome the constraints of fossil fuels the generation of bioenergy makes renewable energy particularly interesting nowadays renewable resources are contributing 35 of the total energy of the world diatoms synthesize oil for human consumption which is rich in nutrition showing a promising alternative to meet the demand of future growing populations we need to emphasize the latest more productive technologies to overcome the cost of their cultivation and harvesting for optimum utilization of diatoms as biofuels valuable products wastewater remediation and aquaculture they are the primary food of most of the herbivores in freshwater as well as in marine water furthermore being the rich source of poly unsaturated fatty acid pufa they have a great scope in aquaculture therefore diatoms are the cost effective approach which sequesters co2 excess amount of heat reduce the extra amount of nutrients and remove metal contaminations from their habitats they could be a possible solution to energy savers and to reduce the threat of global warming conversely they may be a viable source of food and feeder for living beings diatoms and wastewater are an advanced integrated system that on the one hand utilize the potential of diatoms in purifying the wastewater thus it helps in restoring the original quality of habitat on the other hand their biomass can be utilized in the production of antiobesity antibacterial antioxidant biofuels anticancerous antiviral compounds diatoms have received great attention because they are the significant producer of lipids and biomass for various commercial applications such as biofuels comprising of biodiesel and aviation fuel they participate in cleaning the environment by fixing the atmospheric co2 and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas ghg 112 diatoms based biofuels are projected to be economically beneficial in the future but still some ambiguity exists whether they equate with fossil fuels or not is remain a question obtaining a biofuel require several steps like harvesting extraction conversion of biomass to target biofuel is economically not feasible one of the key bottlenecks is cell density which is similar to the water and negative surface charge that put off settling owing to gravity thus makes harvesting a most crucial and challenging step there is an urgent need for an efficient harvesting technique to improve the economics and efficiency of the whole downstream process 113 114 at present the technologies of the water purification industry have been used for harvest and recovery of microalgae but still some technical glitch needs to address that are sole to microalgae harvest firstly harvesting techniques must be species specific secondly a blend of different harvesting techniques must result in synergistic outcomes thirdly a complete cell separation from a diluted suspension to lower the cost of the downstream process fourthly steps such as lipid extraction and biofuel conversion should be minimized finally to come up with the idea of more advanced harvesting techniques in the future 114 the ultimate goal of economic feasibility is the conversion method by utilizing inexpensive chemicals and the release of the least toxic waste microalgae biomass is the best option for fossil fuels for transportation but the commercialization of microalgae based biofuel is a significant task new strategies should encourage innovative elements to the existing downstream process that can appreciably reduce the cost towards the realization of biofuel commercially and dispose of harmful co2 production to sum up harvest extraction and conversion steps must be environment friendly while making biofuels as future transportation fuels 113 114 all the above mentioned factors enhancing the popularity of diatoms globally strengthen their market potential and growth in the coming years their medicinal characteristics are likely to provide more interest in diatoms cultivation with a rising population considering health benefits the global diatoms market is expected to witness as one of the most emerging economies across the world 8 conclusions a general question raised by everyone about diatom s attractive potential and advantages but still exploring their true value is a long journey because high rich diversity limits their studies making it obscure and inaccurate it is high time to investigate new class and species of diatoms and understand their mechanism research models and the potential role for future perspectives the past few decades have seen a tremendous rise in diatoms research as reflected in the publication an undercurrent excitement is moving around but challenges are roaring high practically a good isolation practice is the only solution that will fill this void smart isolation practices are prerequisites that must help quick isolations and speedy recovery of diatoms from polluted water diatoms axenic culture is the first step towards a complete study of an organism and maintaining their pure culture can be further used in different applications such as bioindicators nutraceuticals cosmetics phycoremediation aquaculture etc thus growing diatoms is the most sustainable and

13712,alarming water pollution is toxic to the aquatic ecosystem leading to a sharp decline in species diversity diatoms have great potency to survive in contaminated water bodies hence they can be compelling bioindicators to monitor the change in the environmental matrices effectively around the globe researchers are intended to evaluate the impact of pollution on the diatoms recovery and techniques used for the assessment the diatoms are precious for futuristic need viz value added products energy generation pharmaceuticals and aquaculture feedstocks all these applications led to a significant rise in diatoms research among the scientific community this review presents different isolation practices cultivation and other challenges associated with the diatoms a precise focus is given to diatoms isolation techniques from highly polluted water bodies with the main thrust towards obtaining an axenic culture to elucidate the significance of pure diatom cultures recovery of jewels of the sea from polluted water signifies the prospective ecological and economic aspects keywords axenic culture diatoms microalgae bioindicators isolation wastewater 1 introduction diatoms are the most successful contemporary group of photosynthetic eukaryotic microbes that inhabit almost every kind of aquatic ecosystem they can occur as endosymbionts in dinoflagellates 1 2 diatoms have arisen because of an endosymbiotic event between red algae and heterotrophic flagellate approximately 240 million years ago 3 although there are several types of microalgae present in water diatoms are the most important and unique as they are the only species with the presence of silica in their cell 3 4 diatoms are surrounded by a silica cell wall that allowing them to have varied shapes and sizes their silica cell wall is popularly known as frustules that offer protection from photoinhibition supply appropriate nutrients uptake manage sinking rate and playing a significant role as a mechanical barrier against grazers 5 their silica content varies from one species to another depending upon their size growth pattern and environmental variables such as light temperature salinity nutrients and growth phase 6 there are more than 200 000 extant species of diatoms distributed to a different ecosystem 7 they are widely present in all aquatic habitat constituting lentic lotic habitat and sand it is estimated that 70 of species occur in freshwater and 83 are benthic 8 aquatic ecosystems such as rivers oceans lakes etc support the lives of a large variety of organisms but excessive urbanization and industrialization transform them into the heavily polluted zone 9 10 the rising pollution level deteriorates the water quality index leading to a huge decline in species diversity due to untreated discharge of metals pesticides aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons etc which slows down the survival of an aquatic species thus posing a big threat 11 several organisms have been used as bioindicators such as protozoa bacteria fishes zooplankton algae etc however diatom based monitoring for the assessment of ecosystem remedy is in great demand 12 because diatoms produce organic matter to a large extent that permits natural inbuilt capacity to withstand toxicity levels in water bodies extended survival rate short regeneration time than microalgae fishes and other micro invertebrates thus making them one of the best candidate for water quality monitoring and excellent bioindicators of aquatic biological integrity 12 13 water quality analysis is essential as it allowed to detect the habitat linked information of the related organisms 14 as diatoms also produce eicosapentaenoic acid epa docosahexaenoic acid dha and other nutritional compounds they can be used as a food source to every aquatic organism such as zooplankton and fish they constitute 40 of oxygen in water bodies fix excessive chemical compounds and inorganic nutrients in the water such as carbon phosphorous silica etc 15 as fossil fuels are diminishing quickly therefore the demand for biofuel production has increased many folds since the last decades the crop and food producing plants will never be the top priority for biofuel production in the future diatoms will remain as the best candidate for biofuel production some strain of diatoms produces lipids as 50 to 80 of the dry weight that can be used in the production of biofuel thereby focusing on the role of diatoms as an ideal substitute for fossil fuels 16 despite having all these important characteristics they are the least explored aquatic species because isolation and maintenance of axenic culture is a tedious job 17 in this review an effort has been put forward on the details related to the isolation of diatoms from polluted water bodies the significance of diatoms and their future potential 2 ecological significance of diatoms rapid industrialization and urbanization releasing a toxic substance into the aquatic environment thousands of chemicals without any proper risk assessment and legislation are being introduced which are endangered to aquatic species 18 algae bacteria protozoa fishes micro invertebrates and zooplankton have been extensively used in biomonitoring purposes but recently diatoms have gained much more attention because they are primary producers and plays a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles of the aquatic food web 11 12 19 diatoms survive well in a variety of habitat such as oceans lakes estuaries wetlands etc the use of diatoms in ecotoxicological studies is advantageous to examine any possible effects of toxic elements this makes diatom a potential tool in bioassay than any other aquatic species because of its easy sampling and frustules identification 20 21 diatoms are highly sensitive to metal pollution than macroinvertebrates which could very well explain gradation in metal composition thus allows early identification of the presence of any heavy metal pollution in an aquatic ecosystem 12 diatom responds quickly to any organic matter or nutrient contamination for example metolachlor atrazine simazine phenols nitrate phosphate heavy metals and pahs 22 23 even though diatoms are ecologically diverse their potential in biomonitoring is underutilized in evaluating any risk assessment because of traditionally available metrices such as cell density biovolume and relative abundance new and advanced metrices are more advantageous in recognizing the dynamics of diatoms communities by demonstrating the sub lethal effect that is not evident in diatom counts 19 24 nuclear abnormalities cell membrane cytoplasmic content and photosynthetic apparatus alteration change in lipid content and diatoms classification using ecological status are the main parameters that were infrequently reported 25 27 this behavior demonstrates sensitivity and efficiency in quantifying the toxic elements stress detection after ultraviolet uv exposure which remains unnoticed by the conventional method 28 as reported calculating live diatom species in the biofilms seems to be a lucrative bioassessment tool similarly for assessing weak cytoplasmic content of freshwater species the ecological association of diatoms is examined for evaluating the environmental health of water bodies because these newer metrices are easy to acquire rapid detection low labor intensive good reproducibility standardized and worldwide acceptance 23 28 diatoms as bioindicators check and observe the integrity of the precious environment by enumerating the change in water quality over large geological areas provide variability and any possible backdrop precondition 29 investigator worldwide have examined various water bodies using pollution tolerant diatom species to measure the pollution level by employing algal indices such as palmer s algal index chlorophycean index nygaard s phytoplankton indices to better realize the water quality for example some investigator utilized nygaard s algal index to evaluate the trophic status of hatia dam revealing the oligotrophic condition of water bodies 30 mishra and co workers studied the bhoj wetland employing nygaard s algal index to illustrate the wetland s eutrophic nature 31 palmer index was utilized in determining the seasonal variation in phytoplankton diversity of pichhola lake of udaipur rajasthan 32 sharan and rekha used nygaard s algal index in their evaluation of the trophic status of hatia dam finding the waterbody to exhibit an oligotrophic status 33 but still diatoms potential is hardly exploited as bioindicators in determining the economic conditions as compared to other groups of microalgae 30 the environmental conditions of the target species must be taken into account as understanding their habitat and mimicking them in the laboratory play a crucial role in obtaining pure strains each aquatic ecosystem has different attributes river ecosystems may have less alkalinity than a marine ecosystem 34 these attributes directly or indirectly affect the occurrence of diatoms in a diverse aquatic ecosystem thus several factors such as seasonal variation ph temperature salinity etc should be considered as important factors 35 the representatives of the genus gomphonemoid can be examined from both marine and freshwater gomphonemoid is widely present often in freshwater epiphytic and epilithic communities 36 gomphonema one of the most common diatom strains its valve and girdle view the heteropolar cuneate shape can be recognized easily gomphonema is attached to the substratum by a mucilage stalk which assists in recognize strain from the rest of the other diatoms found in the freshwater ecosystem the valves are wide at the head than foot pole with both uniseriate and biseriate nearby amid individual areolae cover up externally by crescent shaped volae 37 39 the raphe is straight or sinuous with terminal fissures expanding both apices to the valve margin and inner central endings turn aside to one or the same side respectively the raphe is always shorter from the central nodule to the head pole thus extending towards the foot pole consequently a perforated distinct pole field of different structures is also present at the foot pole in many species isolated punctatum near the central nodule occurs the cingulum is arranged into many open bands every second band is shorter than the next one to form lingual at the foot pole each band is punctured by more than one row of pores many other diatom species with the same cuneate shape growing in the marine ecosystem can be compared to gomphonema by various workers 40 benthic diatoms are the significant controller in freshwater owing to their excellent adsorption absorption oxidation decomposition precipitation capability to store nutrients they are very well utilized in biomonitoring purposes since the last decade because these diatoms provide crucial linkage in the aquatic ecosystem stipulating the flow of energy cycling of materials and reveal the water environment 41 diatom based indices were first produced by kolkwitz marsson 42 since more than 20 indices have been created from 1975 to 2015 such as humic degree trophic level indicators eutrophication biological diatom index to name a few however the impact of indices has become less focal owing to the differences between floral geographical area and environment fluctuations guiding species to adapt according to the water quality criteria of the particular region in a particular instance of time 43 isolation and identification of benthic diatoms are problematic in comparison with planktonic species due to difficulties in sample treatment sampling and microscopic observation though benthic diatoms play the main role as bioindicators in the aquatic ecosystem because they attached to the substratum with secreted mucilage from their cell wall 44 45 the morphological features help in the classification of particular species morphological analysis by light microscope lm and electron microscope for instance transmission electron microscope tem scanning electron microscopy sem provides the better detailed result of diatom biodiversity 46 the detection of diatom communities on various substrata can be observed as the slimy layer of biofilm appears brown or yellow brown although there are several types of substrata for isolating diatoms the most preferred is from cobbles epilithon epiphytes also have diatoms attached to them 47 the taxonomy of the epiphyte should be recorded as specific strains attach to specific macrophytes a typical substratum can be introduced to the water manually if the preferred substratum is absent the isolated biofilm can be preserved or can be used for the preparation of axenic culture a well concentrated sample collected from a highly polluted habitat may have a more significant number of microalgae rather than diatoms sometimes an association between diatoms and other microalgae can be seen it may also contain empty or broken frustules highly polluted water may have a high concentration of biogenic compounds which may provide less nutrition or over nutrition this may profit in the growth of those strain which requires fewer nutrients or high nutrients respectively salinity ph light etc factors also play a role in the growth of such diatoms 48 the productivity of diatoms is higher than the other class of microalgae they have undergone 2 4 cell divisions per day they can survive in adverse climatic conditions since their silica cell wall is a nanoporous structure which allows them to act as a potential buffer system by improving carbonic anhydrase activity and helps in the transformation of bicarbonate to carbon di oxide co2 they actively participate in wastewater remediation and quenching of heavy metal leading to a degradation of environmental pollution 49 though bacteria fungus yeast and algal biomass are commonly used in the treatment of heavy metal diatoms are most preferred due to their large surface area mucilage nutritional requirement and faster growth rate bioremediation of heavy metal involves biosorption to metal binding ligands on the cell surface followed by bioaccumulation consists of inorganic molecules and related enzymes in biosorption the uptake of heavy metals is either carried out by the physiochemical pathway devoid of atp or during metabolism engaging atp energy this mode of heavy metal remediation is a cost effective approach through filtration it is an extracellular passive route of adsorption of heavy metal which is an energy independent process occurring at the cell surface in equilibrium 50 biosorption is dependent upon temperature ionic strength ph contact time biomass and metal concentration the composition of the cell wall and metallic ions complexation the principle behind biosorption is that diatoms are equipped with polymers their outer wall has a negative surface charge due to functional groups like carboxyl phosphoryl and amine the heavy metal with a positive surface charge attracts a negative charge through electrostatic interaction which finally supports biosorption bioaccumulation is an active intracellular process driven by energy the heavy metals grow along with nutrients that assist in bioremediation when heavy metals are accumulated the microalgae produce reactive oxygen species ros to control cellular metabolism there is an underlying passive uptake followed by an active process that is brought about by the detoxification of heavy metal at the cell surface by dehalogenation and denitrification process this triggers the exclusion of heavy metals to maintain equilibrium conditions thus eliminate toxic effects despite this a lot of work needs to be done in the treatment of wastewater by testing more species and study their capability of heavy metals removal the biological degradation of heavy metal is quite challenging but not impossible 49 51 3 taxonomic studies of the target species previously diatoms have been differentiating according to shape size pattern and ultrastructure of their exoskeleton which consists of silica known as frustules microscopic identification is based on the shape of their frustules but still they are challenging to identify and improper examination reflects misleading observation upon identification beyond the genus level 52 54 to combat such a drawback deoxyribonucleic acid dna sequence analysis has become a more potent approach in diatom research thus opens a new leaf into their systematic and evolution the main aim of the taxonomic examination is to make a hierarchical classification accurately reflecting evolutionary relationship which then converted into a hierarchy of names related to different levels in a hierarchy of taxonomic ranks recently diatoms phylogenetic analysis at the generic and infrageneric levels require internal transcribed spacer its region of the 18s 5 8s 26s nuclear ribosomal dna and among all 18s ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna sequencing resulting in the largest reference sequence dataset among the different markers used for diatoms 55 57 microarray technology enables parallel analysis of many genes in a single reaction here ordered matrices of dna sequence marked on the glass slide used for hybridization experiment with fluorescently labeled target genes and have been extensively used in both basic and applied aspects of the biological sciences 58 though several papers related to taxonomy and most of them provide line drawings or light microscopic images that are unable to give enough ultrastructure details of the diatom cell 59 a complete taxonomic survey can give the entire morphology of lesser known microalgae or diatoms as there can be a minor difference in the morphological structure of two or more organisms such organisms are difficult to identify even under the lm organisms like cyclotella brebisson may comprise more than complex 100 species which includes small specimens with a diameter of 5 μm 60 based on frustules morphology observation of these small specimens under a sem provides notable interspecific similarities that help in taxonomic studies as some species may have similar morphological characteristics which may be ecologically distinct their identification should be fundamentally accurate as it can provide quite an information about biodiversity which can be represented as an essential tool for different kind of studies such as ecological and applied studies proschkinia is a rare diatom of the family proschkiniaceae within the naviculales based on light microscopy it was classified as a relative of nitzschia the phylogenetic position of proschkinia was resolved with sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome of proschkinia complanatoides and compared the data set to other published diatom mitochondrial genes 61 to differentiate between diatoms strains that have similar morphology it is vital to know the taxonomy of the target species the nutritional requirements of various species also vary some species require less nutrition composition light temperature variables while some require more the taxonomy also helps in understanding the basic requirements of the target species 62 once the culture has been collected and identified they will be preserved in the world federation of culture collection centers which then made available to researchers and industry for intending applications and further experiments table 1 shows the list of available algae microalgae and diatom culture collection centers worldwide 4 understanding diatoms isolation and investigations 4 1 preparation for sample collection the field procedures play a crucial role in the isolation of diatoms microalgae or other species in a riverine environment small boulders rocks and cobbles are the most favored substratum for diatoms screening almost all diatom indexed to the eplithion community found here where epilithion s ecology is recognized better than any other group 63 bricks concrete bridge supports canal walls etc may be used as an alternative substratum whereas simulated substrate can be set up into the stream if pebbles cobbles boulders or macrophytes do not exist from the site though sampling should be done if they have been plunged for several weeks 47 sampling is an important step towards the collection of diatoms as the whole isolation process depends on it the collected water sample may contain dead cells or damaged cells which is not considered good so it becomes very crucial to ideally collect the sample and isolate the most viable cells at the earliest keeping the water sample for longer times is not recommended because environmental conditions change very frequently which leads to cell death some species multiply quickly and suddenly die in that case isolation should be done rapidly sometimes a planktonic net can be used to concentrate the sample as it removes other unwanted algal species microorganisms or debris but should be avoided as more concentrated sample leads to more damaged cells 47 63 the collected sample should be kept according to the target species environmental conditions for example several marine species are susceptible to sample concentration for a sampling of these strains of species special water bottles can be used as several factors like water depth pressure temperature or light influence the sample conditions so instead of using a concentrated sample a normal water sample taken in sterile containers can provide a better result the collected sample should always be kept in sterile containers at a stable temperature 63 often sample collected from different water bodies contains zooplankton or other species which feed on algae or specifically on diatoms so it is essential to remove the unwanted organisms gently by filtering the sample at the sample site however sometimes tiny organisms may pass through the filter which may pose threats to target species in that case dilution methods can be used to isolate the target species the health of species in nature also plays a crucial role as an isolated cell will have successful growth only if they were in a good state at the sample collection time it is advised to collect the sample carefully the use of sterile equipment is mandatory as dirty equipment may lead to contamination all the isolation techniques should be performed under sterile conditions 64 a general idea about field procedure laboratory procedure culture preparation and finally aim towards obtaining axenic culture is presented in fig 1 4 2 substrata selection the identification of a suitable substrate is a pivotal step to recognize the diatom communities in the natural environment diatom communities form a slimy layer or thin golden brown layer on the substratum it can be more noticeable by feel or touch and can be identified at a specific time depending on species the substratum can be differentiated into a preferred substrate and an alternative substrate diatom attaches to different substrata or facilitates locomotion by releasing mucilage from various structures of the cell wall 65 diatom community composition is mainly influenced by chemicals present in water water turbulence temperature and light present in water being eaten by large microorganisms etc the most preferred substratum is the solid substratum it mainly includes cobbles pebbles and small rocks epilithon fig 2 depicts various substrates intended for diatoms sampling they are widely available in almost every aquatic habitat and throughout the year in the absence of a solid substrate submerged or emerging macrophytic plants epiphyte should be sampled as it also provides a suitable habitat for diatom communities it is ideal to note the microhabitat of diatoms species 35 4 3 elimination of contaminants from collected sample the most effective method to eliminate contaminants is achieved by various techniques such as filtration sedimentation and centrifugation as gravity separation the most successful technique is filtration as it removes all unwanted microorganisms or other zooplankton which feed on diatoms from the sample in this a planktonic net of a specific size is used which does not allow any other organism to pass through except the target species in gravity separation diatoms settle down as sediments while leaving other microalgae in the suspension which can be discarded further 66 4 4 health and safety tips field operators should always wear thigh waders for the protection of feet they should wear life jackets while sampling they should never go in depth for sampling they should wear globes when sampling heavily polluted water bodies they should be very careful in habitats dominated by dangerous animals posing a threat to people and blood sucking worms like leeches 65 4 5 water quality analysis anthropogenic pressure from the urbanized area causes changes in the water quality of a river and leads to the eutrophication of reservoirs and the proliferation of algae the informal settlements without sanitary infrastructure aggravate the deterioration of water quality in urban water sources 67 the water quality index conducted by using the planktonic diatom index pdi for monitoring the lake erie s nearshore pelagic zone provides a robust assessment of water quality 68 the collected water sample should be adequately analyzed as it gives full information about the diatom habitat and its environment several factors should be measured hydrological characteristics of the stream which mainly examined with stream velocity and channel depth and channel breadth physical variables of water mainly involve water temperature and turbidity physico chemical variables are examined with ph conductivity total dissolved solids water contains nutrients such as orthophosphate phosphorus po4 p total phosphate tp ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n which should be further analyzed major cation anions such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na chloride cl sulphates so4 should also be estimated in water parameters for oxygen and organic matter like oxygen saturation chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total organic carbon toc should be analyzed all physicochemical parameters of water should be tested as per the american public health association apha standards 69 for monitoring the pollution of water bodies several indices have been developed such as the index of saprobity eutrophication idse 5 which utilizes the diatom population in terms of organic pollution 70 water can be divided into two types such as groundwater and surface water and both are at the risk of pollutants ranges from heavy metals pesticides fertilizers hazardous chemicals etc an accepted water quality criterion according to american public health association apha the world health organization who indian standard institution isi indian council of medical research icmr and central pollution control board cpcb consisting of various parameters are presented in table 2 71 5 laboratory procedures examination of the collected sample from different substrata should be done as quickly as possible to make sure that diatom assemblage contains live cells and not dead ones sample with more dead cells should be discarded and sampling should be performed again the environmental conditions of samples collected from various aquatic habitats should be mimicked in a laboratory it should be noted that all equipment like glass slide coverslip pipette forceps inoculating loop centrifuge tube glass test tube watch glass etc must be sterilized before use uncleaned equipment may lead to contaminations that further result in the death of cells after examination of diatoms in the collected sample standard isolation methods should be performed 72 5 1 standard isolation methods as the collected sample contains various microorganisms and other microalgae these standard isolation methods play a crucial role in the isolation of target species of diatom the isolator should focus on finding the target species in the collected sample viable cells should be cultured as soon as possible while avoiding contaminants all the following methods should be performed carefully 72 5 1 1 single cell isolation capillary action the simplest method of single cell isolation is performed with the help of micropipette first attempted by zumstein 1900 later improved by pringshiem 1949 17 73 74 a capillary is attached to the pasteur pipette to make it ideal for single cell isolation this method requires a lot of practice as diatoms have a minimal size one single cell can also be picked separately with the help of a micropipette single cell isolation with micropipette is to pick a single cell of target species without getting it damage and avoiding contaminants and deposit it into a sterile tube or watch glass and then transfer it to a culture tube the whole process is done with the help of a microscope especially an inverted microscope as it allows the isolator to work conveniently 75 76 5 2 dilution techniques this method is very useful while isolating cells from very contaminated samples with a tiny microorganism which is harder to separate from the sample the aim of this method to separate one single cell of target species and deposit it in a culture test tube usually dilution is repeated serially up to 1 10 77 5 3 isolation using agar it is probably the oldest and standard method available to isolate microorganisms most of the diatom species usually grow well in agar isolation using agar can be used with both streaking and spreading methods later single cells or colonies can be picked from the culture plate and observed under the microscope to study the colony diatom community characteristics agar plate method is advantageous the agar concentration should be between 0 8 to 1 5 and 2 0 while observing glass slide under a microscope if it contains a single diatom cell it can be replicated on the agar plate for culture agar pour plate method can also be used to isolate cells that do not grow on the surface of the agar plate 78 5 4 density centrifugation this is a physical technique for the pre separation of single cells of diatoms from polluted water the centrifugal technique applies gravity settling to isolate more prominent species from the microalgae low dense cells for example microscopic organisms and others present in the supernatant are emptied while diatoms species stay at the base as a pellet the speed and time of centrifugation vary depending upon the target microalgal species even though reasonably successful however it might harm delicate cells through sheer pressure 79 5 5 enrichment culture this method involves the use of enrichment media enrichment media is rich in one constitute which provides nutrition to only one two types of cells species while inhibiting the growth of other cells microorganisms for example it has been noted that the presence of silica in a culture media boost the growth of diatoms but inhibit the growth of other microalgae sometimes even a trace element makes an enormous difference in the growth of species so it is necessary to know the nutritional requirement of the target species and it should be reached as it will improve the growth of the target species 76 85 5 6 membrane filtration this is a pre isolation step towards the separation of diatoms samples can break into two portions depend upon particle size difference sometimes enrichment media can also be utilized for better outcomes while separating fungal cells from diatoms bigger species can be held at the membrane however diatom cells pass through the filter quickly this strategy is helpful advantageous and very adaptable 81 5 7 isolation with alginate beads another technique where alginate beads were utilized to isolate the algal species from the mixed algal culture 82 in this method the contaminated water is placed in nutrient media and incubate for one week or more to affirm the development of different species a known concentration of sodium alginate solution containing a mixed culture of diatoms is added drop by drop to a calcium chloride solution to form alginate beads and kept for 6 8 h to make beads stronger stiff and firm the beads transferred to a 96 well enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa microplate one bead per well smashed partially containing standard culture media and incubated under controlled conditions in the presence of light for one week to confirm the growth of isolated diatom species the trapped diatom species in the beads viewed microscopically for the confirmation of isolated species this methodology is simple easy cost effective compared with existing methods and can be easily applied for the mass cultivation of specific species 17 5 8 other methods there are other different strategies for the isolation of diatom species like anti microbials uv radiation anti microbial treatment hinders growth development by eliminating microorganisms thus help with getting the confined unadulterated culture of diatoms uv radiation act as a disinfectant that prevents bacteria and other contaminants since diatoms are better resistant to uv radiation over bacterial cells 81 photoinhibition is an immediate strategy that harms biomolecules by engrossing uv light which prompts the loss of natural capacity of microscopic organisms 17 6 advanced isolation techniques 6 1 micromanipulation diatoms are valuable for the aquatic food chain and give significant bioactive compounds to human prosperity segregating unadulterated species or getting axenic culture from a polluted water source is a complicated and tedious procedure with the current strategies hence it becomes necessary to search for other advanced isolation techniques micromanipulation is one such method permitting refined confining single species in a more cleansed manner prior fine capillary tubes were used focusing on target cells under microscopic observation which is a laborious task and threat to contamination 83 with the arrival of a modern sophisticated micromanipulator exploiting micromanipulator and stereomicroscope a high level of precision can be achieved for screening and isolation of species of interest 80 a cell of interest can be captured utilizing a focused laser and transferred to a sterile media of interest this system is still in its early stages because of the high state of expertise and time required 84 6 2 automated techniques the requirement for cutting edge new methods push researcher to redesign the flow cytometer coupling facs fluorescence activated cell sorting the premise of this procedure is light scattering and fluorescence 84 cells absorb the laser beam transmit fluorescence and give information on cell size pigments and reliability of species which is identified with the morphology and other characteristics of the species accordingly thus allowing characterization of up to 10 000 cells in a fraction of second 85 this technique can be employed to build up an axenic culture and get rid of any bacterial contamination in some cases mixed culture or aggregation of cells may make issues in the precise identification of cells which can be overcome by cell disruption through appropriate sonication under controlled conditions this technique is generally excellent for quick screening of organisms overproduces metabolites of interest in conjunction with fluorescent dyes for example bodipy or nile red facilitates the selection of desired mutants from a mixed population 86 an overview of the main techniques used to establish axenic diatom cultures is presented in table 3 6 3 importance of correct isolation in diatom research diatoms the most productive phytoplankton found all over the planet from antarctic glaciers to brick walls have drawn a tremendous awareness in the research field i e for the quantitative reconstructions of ocean surface conditions to establish palaeoceanographic records 87 they are one of the most promising candidates for various applications such as pharmaceuticals bioenergy industrial chemicals nutraceuticals and aquaculture 88 89 to make most out of it an axenic culture of diatom must be a prerequisite bearing in mind that a pure culture of diatoms is undoubtedly required in genome sequencing 90 to identify the producer of any novel bioactive compound for large scale manufacturing of nutraceutical 91 building a consortium for bioremediation 92 and to elucidate the relationship between other microalgae using omics tool 93 maintaining an axenic culture for a longer duration is very difficult because bacteria are vulnerable which frequently attacks the diatom the primary focus is to isolate pure species of diatoms and their maintenance 17 nevertheless an axenic strategy is dependent upon contamination and desirable organisms disclosing the possible relationship between them leading to the understanding selecting and developing an axenic culture which is a critical step thus alleviate the cultivation method mimicking the natural environment for optimum growth under laboratory conditions facilitates the development of an axenic culture but this step requires the correct isolation plan and approach 94 the fundamental question is are axenic culture genuine what is the acceptability of their purity level with the direct symbiotic association between diatoms and other aquatic organisms the development of a new advanced technique to assess the purity level cannot be ruled out therefore emphasis should be given towards improvement and innovation in isolation methods to standardize and establish the correct isolation practices to solve future energy crises nutritional requirement nutraceuticals pharmaceuticals by choosing the right technique for right diatom species for the benefit to the mankind society and last but not least the ecological balance 95 therefore constant effort to develop a new scientific method will surely pave the way towards the isolation of diatoms from mixed culture and maintaining their purity level to a greater extent diatoms virus interactions are rather difficult in obtaining pure culture the virus kills diatoms thus benefitting other algae the limitation in silicon levels in the oceans facilitates infection by the virus accelerating diatoms mortality due to viral infection is a major concern affecting the carbon cycle leading to global warming and ultimately changes climatic conditions drastically also ocean study is a difficult task the main emphasis is given towards the marine environment rather than terrestrial causing disparity about diatoms virus interactions as a result more isolations techniques and characterization is necessary for controlling the action of the virus in the regulation of host populations 96 several species of diatoms are found in a highly acidic environment and they continue to grow consistently near or in the acidic conditions both in marine and freshwater ecosystems they exhibited a significant response to the alterations in the growth conditions they are capable of integrating numerous physiological as well as morphological adaptations which favors their persistence diatoms growth inhibited majorly in silica limitations than any other nutrients because cell division cannot sustain for a more extended period under silica deprived conditions 97 highly acidic conditions resulted in decreased si indicating that close to the end of this century ocean acidification might persuade the c and si cycle and alter the composition of diatoms 34 considerable human interference is turning aquatic bodies towards the acidic zone and many countries have seen ocean acidification even in extreme low temperature conditions such as north america canada and italy due to the high concentration of hydrogen ions diatoms flora like nitzschia pinnularia eunotia and frustularia are exceptionally rich in habitats within the ph range of 4 5 5 98 in an acidic environment a higher cell volume chlorophyll and productivity were observed due to a change in water chemistry because in acidic conditions number of grazing macroinvertebrates and microheterotrophs were less in number 99 however it is unattainable to understand the natural influx of pre acidification natural fluctuations in conditions and the level of nutrients that tend to vary from habitat to habitat abundance and fall in diatom species can be explained based on physiological ph availability of the essential nutrients and biological interactions which could be the factor for the productivity of diatoms in extreme conditions very little is known about the influence of acidification on diatoms hence the effect of acidic environment on diatoms changes from the open sea near to the sea and deep sea and indeed not a decrease in diatoms productivity and growth 100 since diatoms nurture associated aquatic species to a greater extent within the marine environment so achieving utmost purity and break communication with unwanted organisms is a significant challenge therefore emphasis should be given to improve and channelize knowledge towards proper isolation techniques that will separate diatoms from contamination and any possible intervention to promote appropriate growth and development of diatoms 101 102 an outline of isolation of pure diatom species getting affected by the surrounding contaminants is challenging since they get heavily occupied with different interfering organisms which pose a significant threat in obtaining axenic culture as presented in fig 3 7 steps for obtaining axenic culture 7 1 preparation of culture media although there are several culture media are available but the most recommended culture media for isolation and growth of diatoms are f 2 si pm and wc media the composition of each culture media is prescribed according to the selection of diatoms for culturing for the desired application f 2 si culture media is widely used as the most effective media whereas pm media is utilized for culturing diatoms in an acidic environment wc media is generally used for culturing diatoms existing in an alkaline environment 6 all these culture media differ in their composition of major and minor nutrients and provide proper nourishment to diatom culture f 2 si media is required for marine species while pm and wc media supports the cultivation of freshwater species for marine it is advised to prepare both media with seawater and for freshwater prepare media with distilled water 103 the chemical composition of different culture media for diatoms cultivation are presented in table 4 7 2 elimination of contaminants from culture elimination of contaminants is important to maintain the pure culture of isolated species as stated the above contamination can be eliminated with gravity separation dilution techniques etc in the case of bacterial contamination antibiotics should be used in a specific amount in culture every equipment glassware used in isolation or culture should be sterilized before performing experiments culture should be maintained in aseptic and optimum conditions 104 7 3 sub culturing after preparing the axenic culture it should be subcultured after over a specific period subculturing should be done before the decline phase of the primary culture each subculture should be prepared in aseptic conditions after each subculture it should be observed for contaminations and in case of occurrence of contamination that specific subculture should be discarded and the process is repeated 105 7 4 preparation of axenic culture an axenic culture contains only one target species and is free of all contaminations after isolation of target species of diatoms it is necessary to maintain the culture free from contaminants so that a pure culture can be established pure isolated cultures can be obtained from a combination of techniques such as flow sorting pasteur pipette and agar plate methods the polluted water collected from various habitat will be immediately examined by monitoring ph and temperature at the site and will be carried to the laboratory in 2 3 liters plastic bottles the raw wastewater was filtered twice with a 0 45 μm pore size whatman filter paper to remove the large suspended solids particles and debris the wastewater will be autoclaved for sterilization and further used for the cultivation of the microalgae the physico chemical parameters of wastewater will be characterized as per the standard procedure of apha guidelines 69 106 initially the water sample will be serially diluted in a microwell plate and test tube to get a pure culture and observed under the microscope to confirm the presence of microalgae species isolation will also be carried out by spreading or streaking wastewater in a solid agar medium supplemented with silica once confirmed the microalgae species were transferred slowly and gradually in different volumes of erlenmeyer flasks containing artificial seawater enriched with f 2 si media at ph 8 3 and maintained in the culture room at 12 h dark light diurnal cycle with a desired luminous intensity at 22 23 c finally strains will be identified and their taxonomic classification will be established fig 4 shows the overview of obtaining pure culture diatoms from polluted water bodies 7 5 future perspectives and commercial value of diatoms diatoms are very young as compared to other phytoplanktons but have evolved rapidly over some time a decline return on investment in research and development r d and slow growing companies accelerating the demand for diatoms cultivation serving as a superfood the term nutraceutical refers to nutrition that provides physiological benefits coupled with the protection and prevention of disease these functional foods promote health by adding novel ingredients that are similar to conventional foods but with rich nutrition or bioactive compounds that may target the physiological mechanism of our body as characterized by the us department of agriculture agricultural research service 107 on account of large content of polyunsaturated fatty acids e g pufas n3 and n6 essential amino acids e g leucine isoleucine and valine and pigments e g lutein and β carotene and vitamins e g b12 the diatoms biomass have gained much popularity across the globe 6 nutraceutical industries manufacturing products on a large scale in collaboration with the food and pharmaceutical industry thus benefitting consumers diatoms are emerging as leading nutraceutical ingredients from a biotechnological point of view since they are equipped with polyunsaturated fatty acids essential amino acids pigments and vitamins according to the world health organization who the most severe challenge of the 21 st century is a lifestyle disease i e non communicable disease the current focus is to develop functional food and their products which combat the disease development 107 diatoms are underutilized among the microalgae and only a few species have been characterized thoroughly diatom based products are an excellent source for multifaceted use covering the health and nutraceutical sector therefore the cultivation of diatoms under different cultural conditions helps to understand their biochemistry to a large extent 108 diatoms cells after degradation settled down in the form of silica which is known as diatomaceous earth these death remains have tremendous applications for industrial and agriculture purposes ongoing covid 19 impacted the world economy the diatomite industry has also suffered significantly but successful in maintaining an optimistic growth for four years the average annual growth rate of the diatomite industry will reach millions usd in 2019 probably by 2024 the market potential will see a significant expansion 109 diatomaceous earth is one of the major causes of their successful existence on the globe and also act as carbon dioxide sequester on the ocean floor however more information is needed about nutrient upwellings and the causes of their bloom degradation in their natural habitats further a more in depth study on their self defense mechanisms will reveal the unfolded truth about the interaction of diatoms and their feeders in the food web to overcome the constraints of fossil fuels the generation of bioenergy makes renewable energy particularly interesting nowadays renewable resources are contributing 35 of the total energy of the world diatoms synthesize oil for human consumption which is rich in nutrition showing a promising alternative to meet the demand of future growing populations we need to emphasize the latest more productive technologies to overcome the cost of their cultivation and harvesting for optimum utilization of diatoms as biofuels valuable products wastewater remediation and aquaculture 110 the generation of bioenergy from novel sources like diatoms is incredibly significant as they contribute towards carbon dioxide mitigation generation of renewable energy concomitant with a plethora of value added products due to their unique evolutionary history and their adaptations to varied environmental conditions diatoms have spread all around the world undoubtedly diatoms are playing a significant role in the reduction of global warming gases such as carbon dioxide and provide possibilities to change the present climatic conditions but still more researches are needed on their biogeographic distribution and to learn more about factors which are responsible for their more successful existence diatoms cells after degradation settled down in the form of silica which is known as diatomaceous earth these death remains have tremendous applications for industrial and agriculture purposes diatomaceous earth is one of the major causes of their successful existence on the globe and also act as carbon dioxide sequester on the ocean floor 111 however more information is needed about nutrient upwellings and the causes of their bloom degradation in their natural habitats further a more in depth study on their self defense mechanisms will reveal the unfolded truth about the interaction of diatoms and their feeders in the food web to overcome the constraints of fossil fuels the generation of bioenergy makes renewable energy particularly interesting nowadays renewable resources are contributing 35 of the total energy of the world diatoms synthesize oil for human consumption which is rich in nutrition showing a promising alternative to meet the demand of future growing populations we need to emphasize the latest more productive technologies to overcome the cost of their cultivation and harvesting for optimum utilization of diatoms as biofuels valuable products wastewater remediation and aquaculture they are the primary food of most of the herbivores in freshwater as well as in marine water furthermore being the rich source of poly unsaturated fatty acid pufa they have a great scope in aquaculture therefore diatoms are the cost effective approach which sequesters co2 excess amount of heat reduce the extra amount of nutrients and remove metal contaminations from their habitats they could be a possible solution to energy savers and to reduce the threat of global warming conversely they may be a viable source of food and feeder for living beings diatoms and wastewater are an advanced integrated system that on the one hand utilize the potential of diatoms in purifying the wastewater thus it helps in restoring the original quality of habitat on the other hand their biomass can be utilized in the production of antiobesity antibacterial antioxidant biofuels anticancerous antiviral compounds diatoms have received great attention because they are the significant producer of lipids and biomass for various commercial applications such as biofuels comprising of biodiesel and aviation fuel they participate in cleaning the environment by fixing the atmospheric co2 and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas ghg 112 diatoms based biofuels are projected to be economically beneficial in the future but still some ambiguity exists whether they equate with fossil fuels or not is remain a question obtaining a biofuel require several steps like harvesting extraction conversion of biomass to target biofuel is economically not feasible one of the key bottlenecks is cell density which is similar to the water and negative surface charge that put off settling owing to gravity thus makes harvesting a most crucial and challenging step there is an urgent need for an efficient harvesting technique to improve the economics and efficiency of the whole downstream process 113 114 at present the technologies of the water purification industry have been used for harvest and recovery of microalgae but still some technical glitch needs to address that are sole to microalgae harvest firstly harvesting techniques must be species specific secondly a blend of different harvesting techniques must result in synergistic outcomes thirdly a complete cell separation from a diluted suspension to lower the cost of the downstream process fourthly steps such as lipid extraction and biofuel conversion should be minimized finally to come up with the idea of more advanced harvesting techniques in the future 114 the ultimate goal of economic feasibility is the conversion method by utilizing inexpensive chemicals and the release of the least toxic waste microalgae biomass is the best option for fossil fuels for transportation but the commercialization of microalgae based biofuel is a significant task new strategies should encourage innovative elements to the existing downstream process that can appreciably reduce the cost towards the realization of biofuel commercially and dispose of harmful co2 production to sum up harvest extraction and conversion steps must be environment friendly while making biofuels as future transportation fuels 113 114 all the above mentioned factors enhancing the popularity of diatoms globally strengthen their market potential and growth in the coming years their medicinal characteristics are likely to provide more interest in diatoms cultivation with a rising population considering health benefits the global diatoms market is expected to witness as one of the most emerging economies across the world 8 conclusions a general question raised by everyone about diatom s attractive potential and advantages but still exploring their true value is a long journey because high rich diversity limits their studies making it obscure and inaccurate it is high time to investigate new class and species of diatoms and understand their mechanism research models and the potential role for future perspectives the past few decades have seen a tremendous rise in diatoms research as reflected in the publication an undercurrent excitement is moving around but challenges are roaring high practically a good isolation practice is the only solution that will fill this void smart isolation practices are prerequisites that must help quick isolations and speedy recovery of diatoms from polluted water diatoms axenic culture is the first step towards a complete study of an organism and maintaining their pure culture can be further used in different applications such as bioindicators nutraceuticals cosmetics phycoremediation aquaculture etc thus growing diatoms is the most sustainable and economical solution to meet the future demand of energy crises therefore a thorough study of diatoms for various applications is necessary declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13713,microplastics mps have recently been detected in different products and environmental samples ranging from wastewater to drinking water as well as in products consumed by humans however few studies have addressed the contamination by mps in bottled mineral water therefore in the present study the contamination by mps was investigated from 11 samples of popular brands of bottled mineral water in iran using a staining method and stereomicroscope analysis mps were detected in 9 out of the 11 sample brands the amount shape and color of mps varied in different bottles the most detected mps were in the shape of fragment 93 and fiber 7 with an average concentration of approximately 8 5 10 2 particles l in addition there were no mps in 20 of the collected samples which was the reason for the observed high variation of sd the presence of mps was demonstrated by ftir and raman stereoscopy and the most likely polymers found were pet ps and pp finally four scenarios were investigated for daily and annual human exposure to microplastics the study results indicate that the human daily and annual intake were negligible when compared using valmet textures approximately 0 015 p kg bw

introduction plastic is a synthetic or semi synthetic polymer and synthesized from biomass raw materials or hydrocarbon 1 plastics production has increased over the last 69 years from a million tons in 1945 to up to 300 million tons in 2014 2 plastic has been incredibly attractive for manufacturing because of its physiochemical properties such as its lightweight stability and durability due to these properties the integral molecular structures of plastics will change very little even with their degradation into smaller and smaller particles plastics are broken plastics into microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps through photo oxidative mechanisms the differences in size at this point in the degradation of plastics allows for plastics to cross the gastrointestinal tract easily and be transported to other parts of living organisms 3 4 currently plastic is used for the replacement of many materials such as glass in soft drinks and the bottling of mineral water as well as food packaging 5 along with the increasing usage of plastic in manufacturing and daily human activities e g medical devices food management strategies etc there has been an increased introduction of plastics into the external environment therefore more research is need to investigate the presence and effects of plastic in human lives in the early seventies the first investigations about small plastic pieces in bodies of water were reported 6 7 and most famously within the world s oceans 8 9 however recently the abundance of mps has been reported within different environmental storages 10 15 the uncontrolled entrance of these plastic polymers into the environment along with their environmental stability has led to the breakdown of these plastic fragments into microscopic pieces mps are defined as by products of plastic materials a size distribution ranging from 1 μm up to 5 mm and can originate from different environmental stress factors 13 16 19 plastic particles below 1 μm are commonly referred to nps rather than mps 20 mps have been detected in freshwater environments 11 21 22 the atmosphere seafood 23 24 the digestive tracts of several species 25 marine environments 26 salt 27 honey 28 as well as other food products and drinking water 29 30 although the risk of mps to human health has been reviewed 30 the exact mechanism of microplastic induced injury in organisms is not yet completely known limited data have shown that the ingestion and accumulation of mps by animals might cause local inflammation in the gut 31 and particle toxicity via inducing an immune response 32 in addition to different inputs of mps into the human diet especially indirectly through the consumption of fish and other seafood 33 34 that are likely contaminated by mps through leaking additives and other pollution 35 36 the simple but direct exposure of humans to mps from other sources such as drinking water highlight the importance of their examination to date the presence of mps in various water samples such as surface water groundwater and wastewater raises the question of whether pollution of drinking water occurs the first global investigation of sourced tap water pollution by plastic was published recently and focused on seven geographical regions from different continents 37 nevertheless there is only a limited number of studies that reported the existence of mps in tap and bottled water 37 40 as well as in samples of drinking water processed in drinking water treatment plants dwtp 39 41 some of these studies provoked more attention in the scientific community and in addition in the media thereby putting the consideration of the probable risk of mps to humans through drinking water high on the priority list of public health agencies worldwide the world health organization declared the urgency to investigate the possible effects of plastics on human health and released its review after several studies on 259 samples of bottled water of those samples 90 of the samples positive for the indication of shown mps pollution 38 due to the increase in reported contamination of bottled water by mps and the high consumption of mineral water media attention and public interest have been dedicated to this topic specifically therefore this study aimed to investigate bottled mineral water samples for mp contamination in addition the study aimed at identifying the particle shape size and color finally human exposure to mps was evaluated by calculating the estimated daily intake edi and annual intake eai 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection based on the branding survey 11 nationally distributed popular brands of mineral water contained in pet plastic bottles were purchased from different supermarkets in the province of kermanshah iran each bottle contained 500 ml of mineral water for each brand three different bottles were selected randomly all samples have an expiration date sometime between october and november of the year 2019 and thus the results of our study will not be affected by the variability of the durability between bottles the brands included were as follows aquafina rijab kimia oxab vata damavand izmir vivant landa souwer and kohrang 2 2 extraction of mps fume hood and nitrile gloves were used to reduce the cross contamination of mps in water samples during extractions in addition all lab personnel wore cotton coats and plastic materials were not used during any of the stages of the experiment all equipment was washed with distilled water before its use under the fume hood each sample bottle was opened and injected with 50 ml of a solution containing the biological stain rose bengal with a working concentration of 20 μg ml 1 and re capped rose bengal adsorbs to the surface of organic fibbers and matter and thus can be used to observe further details of the composition of pollutants in water samples 42 using this stain allows for better visual separation of the mps so that they could be assessed samples were incubated with the rose bengal solution for at least 30 min the bottled water was then vacuum filtered via a glass fiber filter glass microfiber filter paper grade

extraction of water samples a stereomicroscope olympus szx16 olympus k k japan was used for the quantitative and qualitative detection of mps visual examination of the amounts of mps and their size shape and color were recorded in order to aid in the differentiation between mps and other crystal structures like chemical and salt pieces the hot needle test was used 43 by using an extremely hot

quantification of mps the variability of the physical and chemical properties composition and concentration of the particles have caused a new challenge in assessing the risks of released mps 45 in total 11 samples of bottled mineral water were examined for the presence of mps fig 1 shows the total number of mps projected in a 1000 ml sample volume mps were found in nine of the 11 brands the results showed various amounts of mps in all samples as shown in fig 1 concentrations of mps varied between 0 and 36 particles l with an average 8 5 10 2 particles l whereby three of the samples contained the most mps while no mps observation was found in two samples in addition the weight percentage of mps in samples was found to the highest in three brands of bottled water therefore a higher standard deviation was observed regarding sample mean similar to our study schymanski et al published their study on mp contamination of bottled mineral water recently based on their results only a few micro pet particles 14 14 particles l were detected in single use plastic bottles 40 in contrast kosuth et al reported a lower concentration of mps 3 57 particles l in bottled water 46 when compared to our results table 1 some researches have been reported a higher concentration of mps in mineral water with different bottle packaging types oßmann et al demonstrated that mps were found in water from all bottle types including pet single use and pet reusable bottles as well as in glass bottles 47 they found that mps could be measured at 2649 2857 and 4889 5432 particles l in single and reusable pet bottles respectively and up to 6292 10 521 particles l in glass bottles these results demonstrate the low detection of mps in single use bottled water more recently a study on mp contamination finding that 11 brands of bottled water were contaminated was published 38 they found mps in 90 of the 259 bottles that were sampled an average of 325 m p particles l which is significantly higher when compared to our study the methods used in this study differed slightly in comparison to this earlier study most notably in the use of different identification techniques and the use of a special stain fluorescent techniques and nile red were used in the earlier study while stereomicroscope and rose bengal were used in the present work generally micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy μ ft ir is most commonly used for the detection of mps however other identification methods include atr ftir fpa ftir pyr gc ms raman spectroscopy and eds 48 a major weakness of the μ ft ir technique is its limit of detection for smaller particles below 20 mm as a result micro raman spectroscopy is needed to solve this problem 40 in general despite all the disadvantages and shortcomings visual monitoring of mps has been used as a simple easy and efficient method by researchers to reduce the concern of misdetection of mps qiu et al suggested that mps detection protocols should be standardized for extraction identification and quantification 48 3 2 mps qualification fig 2 displays the types and color distribution of mps in bottled water samples the bulk 93 of the mps were in the fragment form whereas only 7 of the mps detected had a fiber structure fig 2a similarly mason et al showed that fragments are the most dominant particle 65 within bottled water 49 another study that reported a similar result was conducted by ali et al 50 revealing that fragments and fibers made up approximately 58 7 and 32 2 of the mps found respectively literature revealed that the parent source of mps could cause the different shapes however results reported by mason et al revealed that 4 of the fragment particles had signatures of industrial lubricants which may come from the process of bottling the water 49 they suggested that breaking off of the cap could also be responsible for fragment particles found in bottled water some of the mp particles are presumably observed as films short fibers and unconventional shapes but due to the subjectivity of visual observation they were classified in the fragments group this could be the reason for the high percentage of fragments found in previous studies 51 rose bengal binds to natural materials fibers because it is a biological stain and synthetic mp particles cannot be stained by this method 52 due to this it is logical to conclude that the particles we found are at least synthetic and most likely could be classified as mps in this way the color of the mps could be assessed too which is not possible with other staining methods e g nile red which stains the mps in a way that discolors them 53 over 95 of the plastic particles were black and about 5 of those that remained had no color fig 2b the literature attributes transparent mps to polypropylene and opaque colors to polyethylene 54 thus in this study the transparent white and opaque particles were attributed to polypropylene and polyethylene however it should be noted that several pigments are added to polymer blends during the pet bottle manufacturing process 51 fig 3 shows the stereomicroscope images of some of the mps detected along with their color and size in addition fig 3 allows for the difference between mps and non plastic chemical structures e g salts to be compared the hot needle test was used as a method of distinguishing mps from salt pieces and other non plastic materials in the presence of an extremely hot needle the structure of plastic particles both fragment and fiber was modified and resulted in melting but no change was observed in non plastic materials fig 3a and b by using rose bengal staining non microplastic materials were stained while mp pieces remained their original color and were easily detectable fig 3e i the diameters of the detected mps ranged between 1 28 mm and 4 2 mm with an average size of 2 44 0 66 mm although the size distribution of mps was found to be within a wide range from smaller than 1 mm up to than 5 mm only less than 10 of what was recovered corresponded to particles between 1 and 5 mm mason et al reported that the 95 of microplastic which were present in mineral water were between 6 5 and 100 μm in size 49 3 3 raman and ftir spectra of leaked mps with regard to data collected through the ftir and raman analyses three distinct ranges at 470 650 cm 1 526 and 620 cm 1 1400 1680 cm 1 1563 and 1604 cm 1 and 2760 3200 cm 1 were highlighted figs s1 6 according to käppler et al raman spectrum data for different mps can be divided into three different groups based on spectral ranges 709 759 cm 1 symmetric stretching vibration of cf2 1580 1640 cm 1 aromatic bending vibration and 2780 2980 cm 1 stretching vibrations groups of ch ch2 ch3 53 these classified spectral bands are suitable to confirm the presence of the most common polymers therefore it is most likely that the polymers detected in this study s samples were polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene pp these results may have potentially occurred due to minimal amounts of microplastics in the bottled water samples and their small size the ftir findings reported by käppler et al for five different spectral range included 1174 1087 cm 1 cf2 stretching vibration 1480 1400 cm 1 ch2 bending vibration 1760 1670 cm 1 co stretching vibration 1800 1740 cm 1 co stretching vibration and 2980 2780 cm 1 stretching vibrations groups of ch ch2 ch3 53 in regards to this study the most likely polymers observed were pe pet and pp when compared to the literature table 1 the most abundant types of plastic polymers reported in bottled water included polyester primarily pet pe and pp with fragment and fiber structures by composition mason et al reported that pp is the most abundant polymer type with a percentage of 54 among polystyrene pe pet azlon polyacrylates and copolymers which found 49 similarly schymanski et al investigated the free mp particles composition of mineral water and observed pet with a 84 frequency 40 3 4 mps leak into bottled water several models have been developed and proposed to explain the release of mps into the bottled water fig 4 illustrates the main pathways of mp fragmentation from the body of the bottle these models imply that mps can be released from the body of the bottle mechanically as well as suggesting that mps can be impacted by chemical species in the water such as ions or biosolids 55 releasing mp particles from cap and bottleneck materials by opening and closing have been proposed by winkler et al 56 they also tested how the squeezing crushing of bottles affects the release of mps into the bottled water julienne et al revealed that mechanical properties and the fabrication process affect the fragmentation and distribution of pp 57 in light of the above three mechanical mechanisms that contribute to the release of mps are shown in fig 4 1 2 and 3 parts part 1 shows the shear stress during the filling process in which the body of the bottles underwent scraping forces from hydrodynamic pressure and under high pressure at these conditions mp particles can be released into water the effect of opening and closing the bottle is represented in part 2 cap and bottleneck can cause damage due to mechanical stress which is corresponding with the opening and closing finally the influence of squeezing on travel plastic material from the bottle body into the aqueous environment is shown part 3 although mps are released from the packaging and the caps due to the physical or external stress applied to the bottle during storage transport bottle shaking opening and or during an injection 51 they can also fallout from the atmosphere thermal impacts can enhance the migration of mps and their additives additionally mp leaching could have occurred during manufacturing processes kankanige and babel revealed that pet concentrations could arise from the packaging material and pe from the bottle caps 51 both pet and pe were largely identified in bottles made of plastic this result confirms the result of the present work when regarding the ftir and raman data figs s1 6 the findings showed pe pet and pp appear due to the release of mps into bottled water 3 5 the calculation of edi due to the low consumption of bottled mineral water among iranian people the edi was determined by the ir 15 20 l year it can be noticed that the ir for adult and children groups was considered equal this was done by ignoring the daily differences between the age groups the edi for the adult and children groups target populations were estimated and are reported in table 2 higher intake for two groups was obtained 0 015 p kg bw day and 5 35 p kg bw year in adults and around 0 065 p kg bw day and 23 43 p kg bw year in children respectively zuccarello et al suggested a relatively higher human exposure for both adults and children they estimated the edi for adults and children to be approximately 1 531 524 p kg bw day 40 1 mg kg bw day and 3 350 208 p kg bw day 87 8 mg kg bw day respectively 44 this difference is due to a higher detection of mp particles in the bottled mineral water and ir of drinking water rate 1 8 and 2 l for adults and children in most countries like iran there is a higher tendency to drink tap water rather than bottled water thus the edi is low in this study many other parameters can influence the edi including the availability of a drinking water sources quality of bottled material population tendency and consumption behavior storage condition of bottled water frequency usage of water bottle and detection procedure of mps a closer look at data regarding human toxicology and mps reveals that there are no strong results in this background limitations of human risk assessment were described by koelmans et al who believed that for assessing the human risk higher quality data is needed on the occurrence of mps in water drinking 45 the most abundant mp polymers that were reported to be found in mineral water included high density pe pet and pp despite their abundance these most commonly found plastic polymers are known as non toxic however some monomers of plastics such as the monomer of pvc vinyl chloride have been recently identified and are known to cause mutagenic and carcinogenic effects 58 available studies have focused on mps as a vector for heavy metals and organic matters which may lead to a higher risk of exposure to these known toxic substances 59 schwabl et al demonstrated that humans intake mps by the presence of mps in human stool 60 mps in stool could be attributed to their occurrence in water and foods as well as due to inhalation all things considered the adverse effects on human health is still unknown 61 nonetheless several problems that were reported from animal studies focused on exposure to mps are reported interference with immune response neurotoxicity impaired reproduction transgenerational effects and cytotoxicity in cerebral and epithelial human cells 59 61 4 conclusion eleven different brands of bottled water from supermarkets in the city of kermanshah iran were analyzed for contamination of mps nine of the 11 total bottles analyzed showed signs of contamination with mps different amounts of mps were found in all bottled water samples excluding two samples which had no observable detection of mps there was considerable variation among different brands of bottled water the most abundant mps were fragmented in shape and their structures were composed of 93 fiber and 7 of particles the most likely polymers recognized by ftir and raman stereoscopy were pet ps and pp according to the results it can be concluded that although plastic is a stable and durable material the abrasion breakdown and finally the release of mps in bottled water may have occurred due to packing manufacturing and transportation concerning the exceptionally low detected edi and eai there is no significant exposure to microplastics by the consumption of the analyzed bottled mineral water brands in our study ethical consideration the authors have observed all the ethical issues throughout the experiment including

13713,microplastics mps have recently been detected in different products and environmental samples ranging from wastewater to drinking water as well as in products consumed by humans however few studies have addressed the contamination by mps in bottled mineral water therefore in the present study the contamination by mps was investigated from 11 samples of popular brands of bottled mineral water in iran using a staining method and stereomicroscope analysis mps were detected in 9 out of the 11 sample brands the amount shape and color of mps varied in different bottles the most detected mps were in the shape of fragment 93 and fiber 7 with an average concentration of approximately 8 5 10 2 particles l in addition there were no mps in 20 of the collected samples which was the reason for the observed high variation of sd the presence of mps was demonstrated by ftir and raman stereoscopy and the most likely polymers found were pet ps and pp finally four scenarios were investigated for daily and annual human exposure to microplastics the study results indicate that the human daily and annual intake were negligible when compared using valmet textures approximately 0 015 p kg bw day and 5 35 p kg bw year for adults and approximately 0 065 p kg bw day and 23 43 p kg bw year for children keywords microplastic pet bottled mineral water human exposure estimated daily intake 1

between 6 5 and 100 μm in size 49 3 3 raman and ftir spectra of leaked mps with regard to data collected through the ftir and raman analyses three distinct ranges at 470 650 cm 1 526 and 620 cm 1 1400 1680 cm 1 1563 and 1604 cm 1 and 2760 3200 cm 1 were highlighted figs s1 6 according to käppler et al raman spectrum data for different mps can be divided into three different groups based on spectral ranges 709 759 cm 1 symmetric stretching vibration of cf2 1580 1640 cm 1 aromatic bending vibration and 2780 2980 cm 1 stretching vibrations groups of ch ch2 ch3 53 these classified spectral bands are suitable to confirm the presence of the most common polymers therefore it is most likely that the polymers detected in this study s samples were polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene pp these results may have potentially occurred due to minimal amounts of microplastics in the bottled water samples and their small size the ftir findings reported by käppler et al for five different spectral range included 1174 1087 cm 1 cf2 stretching vibration 1480 1400 cm 1 ch2 bending vibration 1760 1670 cm 1 co stretching vibration 1800 1740 cm 1 co stretching vibration and 2980 2780 cm 1 stretching vibrations groups of ch ch2 ch3 53 in regards to this study the most likely polymers observed were pe pet and pp when compared to the literature table 1 the most abundant types of plastic polymers reported in bottled water included polyester primarily pet pe and pp with fragment and fiber structures by composition mason et al reported that pp is the most abundant polymer type with a percentage of 54 among polystyrene pe pet azlon polyacrylates and copolymers which found 49 similarly schymanski et al investigated the free mp particles composition of mineral water and observed pet with a 84 frequency 40 3 4 mps leak into bottled water several models have been developed and proposed to explain the release of mps into the bottled water fig 4 illustrates the main pathways of mp fragmentation from the body of the bottle these models imply that mps can be released from the body of the bottle mechanically as well as suggesting that mps can be impacted by chemical species in the water such as ions or biosolids 55 releasing mp particles from cap and bottleneck materials by opening and closing have been proposed by winkler et al 56 they also tested how the squeezing crushing of bottles affects the release of mps into the bottled water julienne et al revealed that mechanical properties and the fabrication process affect the fragmentation and distribution of pp 57 in light of the above three mechanical mechanisms that contribute to the release of mps are shown in fig 4 1 2 and 3 parts part 1 shows the shear stress during the filling process in which the body of the bottles underwent scraping forces from hydrodynamic pressure and under high pressure at these conditions mp particles can be released into water the effect of opening and closing the bottle is represented in part 2 cap and bottleneck can cause damage due to mechanical stress which is corresponding with the opening and closing finally the influence of squeezing on travel plastic material from the bottle body into the aqueous environment is shown part 3 although mps are released from the packaging and the caps due to the physical or external stress applied to the bottle during storage transport bottle shaking opening and or during an injection 51 they can also fallout from the atmosphere thermal impacts can enhance the migration of mps and their additives additionally mp leaching could have occurred during manufacturing processes kankanige and babel revealed that pet concentrations could arise from the packaging material and pe from the bottle caps 51 both pet and pe were largely identified in bottles made of plastic this result confirms the result of the present work when regarding the ftir and raman data figs s1 6 the findings showed pe pet and pp appear due to the release of mps into bottled water 3 5 the calculation of edi due to the low consumption of bottled mineral water among iranian people the edi was determined by the ir 15 20 l year it can be noticed that the ir for adult and children groups was considered equal this was done by ignoring the daily differences between the age groups the edi for the adult and children groups target populations were estimated and are reported in table 2 higher intake for two groups was obtained 0 015 p kg bw day and 5 35 p kg bw year in adults and around 0 065 p kg bw day and 23 43 p kg bw year in children respectively zuccarello et al suggested a relatively higher human exposure for both adults and children they estimated the edi for adults and children to be approximately 1 531 524 p kg bw day 40 1 mg kg bw day and 3 350 208 p kg bw day 87 8 mg kg bw day respectively 44 this difference is due to a higher detection of mp particles in the bottled mineral water and ir of drinking water rate 1 8 and 2 l for adults and children in most countries like iran there is a higher tendency to drink tap water rather than bottled water thus the edi is low in this study many other parameters can influence the edi including the availability of a drinking water sources quality of bottled material population tendency and consumption behavior storage condition of bottled water frequency usage of water bottle and detection procedure of mps a closer look at data regarding human toxicology and mps reveals that there are no strong results in this background limitations of human risk assessment were described by koelmans et al who believed that for assessing the human risk higher quality data is needed on the occurrence of mps in water drinking 45 the most abundant mp polymers that were reported to be found in mineral water included high density pe pet and pp despite their abundance these most commonly found plastic polymers are known as non toxic however some monomers of plastics such as the monomer of pvc vinyl chloride have been recently identified and are known to cause mutagenic and carcinogenic effects 58 available studies have focused on mps as a vector for heavy metals and organic matters which may lead to a higher risk of exposure to these known toxic substances 59 schwabl et al demonstrated that humans intake mps by the presence of mps in human stool 60 mps in stool could be attributed to their occurrence in water and foods as well as due to inhalation all things considered the adverse effects on human health is still unknown 61 nonetheless several problems that were reported from animal studies focused on exposure to mps are reported interference with immune response neurotoxicity impaired reproduction transgenerational effects and cytotoxicity in cerebral and epithelial human cells 59 61 4 conclusion eleven different brands of bottled water from supermarkets in the city of kermanshah iran were analyzed for contamination of mps nine of the 11 total bottles analyzed showed signs of contamination with mps different amounts of mps were found in all bottled water samples excluding two samples which had no observable detection of mps there was considerable variation among different brands of bottled water the most abundant mps were fragmented in shape and their structures were composed of 93 fiber and 7 of particles the most likely polymers recognized by ftir and raman stereoscopy were pet ps and pp according to the results it can be concluded that although plastic is a stable and durable material the abrasion breakdown and finally the release of mps in bottled water may have occurred due to packing manufacturing and transportation concerning the exceptionally low detected edi and eai there is no significant exposure to microplastics by the consumption of the analyzed bottled mineral water brands in our study ethical consideration the authors have observed all the ethical issues throughout the experiment including

13714,aerobic granular sludge ags has emerged as a novel biotechnology for the effective treatment of both municipal and industrial wastewater two of the practical parameters that affect aerobic granule ag formation and stability are the feeding strategy and organic loading rate olr in this paper the impact of feeding strategy and olr on ag formation and stability are reviewed the feeding strategy that appears suitable for stable ag formation using all substrates is slow anaerobic feeding despite the long duration for ag cultivation at low olr compact and stable ag are formed high olrs result in fast ag formation but the developed granules are unstable due to the large size resulting from excessive microbial growth the recommended strategy for stable ag formation with enhanced treatment performance is stressed high olr for fast granule formation followed by reduced olr to ensure stability this can be combined with slow anaerobic feeding to select for slow growing microorganisms and nutrients removers such as phosphate accumulating organisms paos further research is recommended to explore ag formation at high olr using the slow anaerobic feeding strategy for long term stability keywords aerobic granular sludge ags ags stability feeding strategy organic loading rate wastewater treatment 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology has emerged as a novel biotechnology for the effective treatment of both municipal and industrial wastewater ags technology exhibits numerous advantages over the conventional activated sludge process these advantages include outstanding settleability strong microbial structure high biomass retention high resilience to toxic chemicals and good ability to handle high organic and shock loading rates 1 4 due to its strong potential to revolutionise the wastewater management industry ags biotechnology is considered by the international water association to be the most promising wastewater treatment technology of the 21 st century ags has been successfully used in the treatment of both municipal and a wide range of industrial wastewaters 4 6 during the granulation process the feeding strategy and organic loading rate olr play vital roles in the type and stability of aerobic granules ag that form a number of review papers have been published on ags biotechnology in the last 20 years 1 4 6 11 however none of the papers focus exclusively on the influence that these key operational parameters feeding strategy and olr have on aerobic granulation while it is generally agreed that hydrodynamic shear force and settling time have major influence on ag formation and stability the effect of feeding strategy and olr on the formation and stability of ags is often not highlighted regarding the relationship between these two parameters as applied to bioreactor operation in sequencing batch reactor sbr mode olr defines the amount of organic matter that is fed into a given reactor volume over a period of time while the feeding strategy defines how fast organic matter is fed into the reactor and the form of carbon available at the beginning of the aeration reaction phase of the sbr cycle e g when anaerobic feeding strategy is adopted easily biodegradable carbon in the feed is converted into slowly biodegradable storage polymers during the feeding phase in general olr is a volumetric loading rate that relates to the cycle time feed concentration and the volumetric exchange ratio of the sbr the feeding strategy has been demonstrated to affect the long term stability of ag the microbial community and treatment performance it is generally accepted that the agglomeration of activated sludge into ag depends on the substrate concentration however ag kinetic behaviour depends on the applied substrate loading 12 13 although olr has been widely viewed as not having a significant effect on ag formation 3 14 it appears that it impacts how quickly ag form their characteristics and stability the focus of this review therefore is on the impact of these two factors on the formation stability and performance of ags the paper will be of benefit to researchers working in the field of ags biotechnology as it highlights areas needing further research the information contained in this review could also benefit wastewater management industry professionals in the design and successful operation of ags bioreactors 2 feeding strategy 2 1 background of the various feeding strategies feeding strategy the method adopted in filling the ags sequencing batch reactor sbr affects the morphology performance and stability of granules five different feeding strategies have been implemented in the formation and maintenance of ag as follows a fast static feeding strategy where the influent is fed to the reactor within a few minutes without aeration or mixing b slow static anaerobic feeding strategy whereby the influent is fed to the reactor through a settled sludge bed over an extended period of time without aeration or mixing in the ags bioreactor because the feeding period is long typically about 1 h the dissolved oxygen do concentration drops making the reactor totally anaerobic c fast static feeding followed by anaerobic mixing which is a slight modification of the slow anaerobic feeding strategy d aerated feeding strategy in which feeding and aeration mixing all take place at the same time e split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy which is a combination of static and aerated feeding strategies the fast static feeding strategy is done by feeding the reactor through the settled sludge within a few minutes without aeration or mixing 15 17 from the top of the reactor 18 19 or through a port on the side of the reactor this feeding strategy has been variously employed in ag formation 15 16 20 28 the fast static feeding strategy allows for fast ag formation although ag formation poses no problem instability has been the main issue with ag formed using this feeding strategy 29 30 generally the growth rate of microorganisms inside ag has been identified as a suitable parameter to enhance the stability of ags 8 when microorganisms within the granule grow excessively the granule becomes big in size and its structure is weakened the weakened granules then disintegrate impacting treatment performance on the other hand slow microbial growth rates have been demonstrated to promote the formation of compact granules with high integrity and physical strength 8 31 32 the selection for slow growing microorganisms has been reported to suppress filamentous growth and improve ag stability 31 33 34 this explains the choice of microbial growth rate as a suitable parameter for enhancing ags stability with the fast static feeding strategy no anaerobic condition is created to convert easily biodegradable carbon into storage polymers as such easily biodegradable carbon is transferred to the aeration phase promoting fast heterotrophic growth 34 research indicates that the growth rate of heterotrophic microorganisms decreases when the substrate is slowly biodegradable storage polymers unlike readily biodegradable carbon 35 the excessive growth of heterotrophic microbes results in large size granules that disintegrate over time the slow static anaerobic feeding strategy was first proposed in 2004 36 the rationale behind the proposal was to control the growth of filamentous organisms that ultimately result in granule instability during feeding the high substrate concentration in the feed penetrates the entire depth of the settled ags bed promoting the conversion of the available carbon to storage polymers by phosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos under anaerobic conditions in the subsequent aeration phase microorganisms utilise the internally stored carbon sources to grow at a low rate 8 limiting the excessive aerobic growth of fast growing heterotrophic microorganisms on readily available carbon that causes unstable ag 34 additionally this feeding strategy specifically allows for the selection of slow growing microorganisms paos and or gaos which promote the formation and maintenance of compact granules the selection for slow growing nitrifying bacteria has also been shown to allow for stable ags 31 in terms of performance the combination of paos with nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria enhances the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen and phosphorus various other studies have utilised the slow anaerobic feeding strategy for ag formation and stability 31 34 37 39 mcswain et al 40 compared the slow anaerobic feeding strategy with split anaerobic aerobic feeding at an olr of 2 4 kg cod m3 d the authors reported ag formation under both feeding strategies however only the reactor with the former feeding strategy formed compact and stable granules 40 the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy resulted in the selection and growth of filamentous organisms that affected the structure of the granules wagner et al 41 explored the use of the slow anaerobic feeding strategy to treat wastewater containing particulate matter they found the slow anaerobic phase to be beneficial for the formation of compact granules 41 slow anaerobic feeding alongside a fixed feast famine period ratio and selective discharge of mature ag was utilised to enhance ag stability 42 stable reactor operation was maintained in over 240 d of the study numerous other studies have found the slow anaerobic feeding strategy to be beneficial for the development of compact ag with long term stability 43 46 fig 1 presents granules formed using the slow anaerobic feeding strategy the fast static feeding followed by a period of anaerobic mixing was explored by rocktäschel et al 47 who compared it to the slow anaerobic feeding strategy they found that both feeding strategies resulted in ag formation however anaerobic mixing showed some merits over the anaerobic plug flow feeding regime granule growth was more stable allowing for a suitable balance between the growth of heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms 47 the aerated feeding strategy was found to develop a loose ag structure with a weak anaerobic core compared to the compact granules formed when the slow anaerobic feeding strategy was adopted 48 the treatment performance in terms of total nitrogen removal was higher mean efficiency of 91 7 4 1 with the granules developed using the anaerobic feeding strategy when the granules were developed using the aerated feeding strategy the removal was poor mean efficiency of 58 8 7 4 it has also been shown that the aerated feeding strategy allows for the fast formation of granules but with the capability of removing only organic matter as the selected microorganisms majorly organic matter degraders outcompete the microorganisms responsible for nitrogen removal 45 46 49 in the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy instead of the long slow anaerobic feeding period a part of the feeding period is done under anaerobic conditions and the remaining period is aerated feeding feeding aeration and mixing recent research reported that the split anaerobic aerobic feeding was suitable for the formation and maintenance of ag at low olrs 50 this is in contrast to an earlier study by mcswain et al 40 in which long anaerobic feeding formed compact and stable granules compared to the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy 40 however it must be pointed out that the substrate type and the loading rate used in the two studies were not the same while mcswain et al 40 used synthetic wastewater made from glucose and peptone at a loading rate of 2 4 kg cod m3 d thwaites et al 50 utilised real municipal wastewater containing high salinity in the range of 5 000 7 000 mg l total dissolved solids at loading rate of 0 76 1 15 kg cod m3 d as such the difference in findings may also be attributed to other parameters hence further studies need to be conducted in this area the influent and effluent wastewater characteristics as applied to the different feeding strategies are presented in table 1 below 2 2 perspectives on the feeding strategies the aerated feeding strategies can lead to fast granulation but at the expense of nutrient removal since the favoured organisms mainly only remove organic matter and outcompete nitrifiers 51 both the aerated and fast static feeding strategies are applicable in situations where the removal of only organic matter is desired additionally they are suitable where the wastewater has high organic matter content and fluctuations in wastewater composition are expected in such situations the long term stability of the developed granules needs to be considered other operational parameters that control ag stability would need to be implemented when these feeding strategies are adopted the slow anaerobic feeding strategy has been found to form compact and stable ag where the excessive growth of heterotrophic microorganisms is kept in check while allowing slow growing microorganisms to thrive long anaerobic contact time plays three salient roles the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable substrates into readily biodegradable substrates the formation of volatile fatty acids through the fermentation of slowly degradable substrates and preferential uptake and storage of the slowly degradable substrates by slow growing paos and gaos 41 45 46 in addition to enabling ag stability the treatment performance particularly nitrogen and phosphorus removal of the ag developed under this feeding strategy is enhanced particularly for phosphorus the anaerobic condition during the feeding phase is essential for high removal efficiency 52 53 another way to look at this is to consider that the anaerobic feeding regime is the plug flow type in which the feed passes through the settled bed of ag as it is the plug flow type large sized and dense ag are expected to settle at the bottom of the reactor allowing higher nutrient loads to be received by these large granules 51 this will allow substrate gradient from the reactor bottom upwards to penetrate the stratified structure of the big granules enabling biochemical reactions to take place within the granules further with fluctuating industrial effluents this feeding strategy would be handy as it would allow adequate time for enough wastewater to accumulate and be used as feed in the next sbr cycle the slow anaerobic feeding period makes a simplified feeding and withdrawal system possible 36 in order to avoid filamentous outgrowth on the granule surface it was suggested that slowly degradable substances found in real wastewater such as colloids and particulate matter be run through an anaerobic hydrolysis pre step 54 55 the slow anaerobic feeding strategy would allow for the hydrolysis and fermentation of such slowly degradable substrates allowing for a quick uptake in the subsequent aeration phase of the sbr cycle this would create the desired feast famine conditions in the reactor which keep heterotrophic growth under check enabling long term ag stability and increased treatment performance the main shortcoming of the slow anaerobic feeding strategy is the increase in the duration of the cycle which increases the hydraulic retention time of the treatment the slow anaerobic feeding strategy is applicable in situations where the removal of both organic matter and nutrients is required in situations of fluctuating industrial effluents and where the wastewater contains high organic nutrient loads as well as slowly degradable substances such as colloids and particulate matter as for the fast static feeding followed by the anaerobic mixing strategy feeding under anaerobic mixing conditions at an industrial scale is suitable as it would allow complete mixing of the influent wastewater when compared to an ideal plug flow influent stream however the reactor design stage would need to consider issues around the anaerobic mixing step the issues would include the equalisation tanks required and the number of sbrs to custom build another issue to consider is the additional operational cost that would be required for incorporating mixing during the feeding phase of the sbr cycle the fast static feeding followed by the anaerobic mixing strategy is applicable for industrial wastewater different feeding strategies are suitable to different substrates while fast static feeding can be suitable when using easily biodegradable substrates such as acetate it is not desirable where slowly biodegradable substrates are involved substrates such as methanol which can be aerobically converted by relatively slow growing bacteria are able to form stable granules even under the fast aerobic feeding strategy 56 despite the positives here it is still more advantageous to employ the slow anaerobic feeding strategy as it will allow for energy savings resulting from not using aeration during the feeding phase and the stability made possible by the slow anaerobic feeding strategy would allow for stable reactor operation the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy is suitable for wastewater treatment plants with low olrs while one study has found the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy to be suitable for ags formation and maintenance at low olr 50 there are no similar studies reported in the literature further research may be needed in this area using different substrates and operating at various olrs to establish the threshold olr for the adoption of this feeding strategy another consideration is that introducing aeration during the feeding would increase the energy consumption adding to the operational cost 3 organic loading rate 3 1 background of the range of organic loading rate used in aerobic granulation the olr is one of the most salient parameters affecting biological wastewater treatment systems 14 as applied to ags and the sense used in this paper reactor olr values are divided into three categories low below 2 kg cod m3 d moderate 2 4 kg cod m3 d and high above 4 kg cod m3 d while the cultivation of ag has been possible across a wide range of olrs 0 6 24 kg cod m3 d 3 12 13 57 58 ag instability has been the major issue at high olrs moy et al 12 first studied the effect of olr 6 9 12 and 15 kg cod m3 d on ag formation using two substrates glucose and acetate while ag was formed at all the olrs tested when glucose was the substrate the ag formed at 6 kg cod m3 d were dominated by filamentous bacteria and had a loose fluffy morphology whereas ag formed at 9 kg cod m3 d and above were irregularly shaped and contained folds depressions and crevices with acetate as the substrate compact ag with enhanced settleability and strength were formed at 6 and 9 kg cod m3 d however the acetate fed ag disintegrated at an olr of 9 kg cod m3 d similarly tay et al 59 found that olr influenced ag formation as well as its characteristics and stability at a low olr of 1 kg cod m3 d loose structured flocs dominated the reactor without ag formation stable and compact ag were formed at a moderate olr of 4 kg cod m3 d while at a high olr of 8 kg cod m3 d the formed ag coexisted with flocs containing pores and filament 59 no ag formation occurred at low olr of 1 2 kg cod m3 d in another study whereas operating at 4 kg cod m3 d resulted in stable ag 60 at a high olr of 8 kg cod m3 d ag appeared on day 18 of operation however the ag exhibited instability and disintegrated within two weeks 60 61 using dairy wastewater as the substrate at a high olr of 5 9 kg cod m3 d filamentous growth and ag instability were reported 54 with continuous exploration of the ag reactor operation at a high olr zheng et al 21 reported the formation of compact round ag at an olr of 6 kg cod m3 d using a sucrose substrate however the ag showed instability as they grew larger due to the growth of a filamentous microbial community resulting in the reduction of hydrophobicity and specific gravity 21 large ag have reportedly formed at high olr 13 32 in the study granule strength exhibited the opposite trend decreasing with an increase in olr 13 a study found that the mean size of ag increased from 1 6 to 1 9 mm when the olr was increased from a moderate olr of 3 kg cod m3 d to high olr of 9 kg cod m3 d 14 using glucose fed substrate at olrs of 1 5 3 and 4 5 kg cod m3 d li et al 62 reported that ag exhibited different morphologies structural properties and bacterial species at varying olrs large and loose ag formed within a short period at a high olr whereas smaller and more tightly packed ag took longer to form at a low olr in terms of species diversity the lowest species diversity was found at a higher olr while the highest species diversity was found in the reactor with the lowest olr 62 with acetate as the carbon source stable granules with good characteristics were obtained within the olr range of 6 15 kg cod m3 d 63 the olr in this study was increased in a step wise fashion from 6 to 15 kg cod m3 d adav et al 64 cultivated ag using acetate substrate at olrs ranging from 9 to 21 3 kg cod m3 d whereas ag formation was successful at olrs up to 19 5 kg cod m3 d disintegration occurred at very high olr of 21 3 kg cod m3 d another study reported the successful formation of ag at 3 6 and 9 kg cod m3 d using acetate as the carbon source 65 with more research ag formation has been found to be feasible even at a much lower olr than the range usually reported in the literature peyong et al 57 reported the successful formation and maintenance of ag at olr as low as 0 6 kg cod m3 d it is expected that the granules formed at such low olrs will exhibit long term stability the olr has also been demonstrated to impact the microbial composition of ags the change in the microbial community will have an influence not only on the stability but also the performance of the ag reactor the stepwise increase of the olr was reported to lead to the loss of microbial diversity with the selection of only a functional microbial consortium at high olr 66 with a mixture of centrate reject from dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge and acetate as substrate low 0 9 kg cod m3 d 1 9 kg cod m3 d and moderate 3 7 kg cod m3 d olrs were tested 67 at the different olrs the reactors were dominated by paracoccus thauera zoogloea and meganema that exhibited functions such as extracellular polymeric substances eps formation polyhydroxyalkanoate pha storage and denitrification as a fast start up strategy ag formation was sped up by using a high olr zhang et al 58 applied 24 kg cod m3 d and reported ag formation within 7 h however the granules disintegrated within two days of operation when the olr was reduced to 12 kg cod m3 d and subsequently to 6 kg cod m3 d ag were formed within 24 h and the granules maintained stability with steady state attained within 12 d 58 in the same line of research liu and tay 68 stressed the olr to 12 kg cod m3 d during ag formation once the system attained steady state the olr was reduced to 6 kg cod m3 d and stability was achieved 68 in this way it was possible to quickly start up the ag reactor and enhance its successful operation alternating between varying levels of olr values has been explored as a way to enhance ag stability yang et al 69 applied alternating olr feeding to speed up ag formation alternating between 4 4 and 17 4 kg cod m3 d they found that the stress the microbial community was subjected to allowed for the secretion of the alginate like exopolysaccharides which accumulated and eventually enhanced the ag structure 69 compared to the operation at a constant 8 kg cod m3 d olr granulation was faster with the alternating olr approach with the increase in the amount of eps and cell adhesiveness for granule stability long et al 70 found that ags exhibited structural stability at olrs 15 kg cod m3 d however olrs 18 kg cod m3 d resulted in instability this is because an increase in the size of ag results in an increase in the growth of anaerobic cores inside the granules formed by massive dead cells 70 in general while operation at low and moderate olrs takes longer to form granules it allows for stable granules high olrs allow for fast granulation but at the expense of ags stability at high olrs 4 kg cod m3 d the rate of granulation granule structure and morphology also depend on the substrate type for example energy rich substrates such as glucose may allow for the proliferation of filamentous bacteria which result in loose morphology and fluffy surface 8 additionally whereas simple carbon sources e g acetate select for simple and uniform microstructures relatively complex carbon sources such as carbohydrates produce granules with layered and complex microstructures and a greater diversity of microorganisms this implies real wastewater which typically contain a complex composition of different substrates are likely to exhibit different substrate degradation rates which would impact ag stability and the microbial community within ag 54 71 3 2 perspectives on the organic loading rate the formation of ag has been demonstrated to be possible at both a very low olr 0 6 kg cod m3 d and a very high olr 24 kg cod m3 d the variable result is the time it takes for ag to form and the type of the resulting granules ag formation at a low olr takes several weeks while only a few hours or days are required at a high olr where there is enough time for granule formation ag formation at a low olr would be advantageous since stable small size granules are formed in situations in which time is of the essence the application of a high olr to form granules is desired however the major concern is the maintenance of ag stability at a high olr since increasing the olr leads to an increase in granule size which ultimately results in anaerobic conditions within the granule core due to oxygen diffusion limitations this weakens the structural integrity of the granule ultimately leading to granule disintegration with compact and small granules oxygen transfer limitation into the granule does not pose any problem it keeps the development of anaerobic conditions within the granule core in check current research efforts are geared towards enhancing ag integrity by exploring ways to control the granule size previous studies have explored alternating between high and low olr to maintain granule integrity it is suggested here to conduct research on the combination of high olr and slow anaerobic feeding strategy to enhance granule stability the slow anaerobic feeding strategy has been demonstrated to select for slow growing microorganisms 31 36 that control the excessive growth of heterotrophic organisms in the subsequent aeration phase within the sbr cycle the combination of high olr and slow anaerobic feeding strategy will allow for the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable substrates in the feed into readily biodegradable substrates during the feeding phase this will create the desired feast famine conditions within the sbr cycle necessary to maintain granule integrity a filling period of at least 1 h is suggested to allow adequate time for the feed to slowly penetrate through the settled granule bed even at high olrs such a long filling time would prove to be beneficial in allowing a small amount of the substrate into the bioreactor at a time in addition the newly developed strategy of stressing the olr using a high olr to form granules and lowering the olr once a steady state is reached 58 68 can be further exploited for ag stability the stressed olr will serve the purpose of obtaining granules within the shortest possible time this will be useful for faster start ups of ag plants once the purpose of granule formation has been achieved it may be worth exploring the possibility of enhancing the treatment performance of the ag reactors since granule formation at high olr results in the loss of diversity of the microbial species it is suggested here to adopt the slow anaerobic feeding strategy at the reduced olr after attaining granulation this would allow for the development of a microbial community necessary to enhance the removal of both organic matter and nutrients such a feeding arrangement would permit the growth of slow growing microorganisms that are also nutrient removers 31 36 a similar strategy has been recommended for the enhancement of treatment performance in situations where an increase in olr is required such as a switch from lab scale to pilot or full scale or where a change in the type of wastewater to be treated is desired a gradual increase of the olr was earlier suggested for high treatment performance in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus removal 46 this will maintain the microbial community within the system in practice while municipal wastewater treatment plants operate at low olrs with no issues of ag instability it is desirable to operate ag reactors at high olrs for high strength organic wastewaters to allow for compact reactors with a small footprint a stepwise increase of olr would have to be adopted during such a switch a stepwise increase of olr was previously demonstrated to select for a functional microbial consortium at a high olr 66 in terms of the wastewater type substrate to be treated the impact that olr has on ag formation and stability is substrate specific with glucose as the substrate fluffy ag with filamentous growth formed while acetate grown ag exhibited a more round and compact structure compact ag show high hydrophobicity a characteristic that allows for granule stability on the other hand large filamentous ag formed when glucose was the substrate exhibited low hydrophobicity and specific gravity as the olr increased the compact acetate fed granules grew to a stage where problems associated with diffusion limitation probably became insurmountable with acetate olr above 21 kg cod m3 d resulted in ag disintegration 64 as such before initiating granulation at pilot or full scale it may be worth conducting lab scale testing on the substrate to ascertain the threshold olr that can allow for both ag formation and long term stability where it is practically possible alternating between low and high olr can also enhance ag stability it was previously reported that alternating between a feed olr of 4 4 and 17 4 kg cod m3 d resulted in the accumulation of secreted alginate like exopolysaccharides that strengthened the ag structure 69 this is an interesting area for further research as it may open the door to co mingling different industrial wastewater types for effective treatment in addition to enhancing ag stability quite often situations arise where effluents from different industrial processes are to be treated the alternation between low and high olr would allow for treatment in the same bioreactor additionally where industrial effluent discharge fluctuates dilution would allow for maintaining the same flow rate whilst allowing for the alternation between low and high olr that enhance granule stability ags stability is adversely affected at high olrs due to the large size of the cultivated granules as a result of the increase in the growth of the anaerobic core inside the granules formed by massive dead cells 70 a topic for further research in this regard is the combination of a high olr with a slow anaerobic feeding strategy at high olr there is abundant food available for microorganisms and this allows for excessive growth of the microbes with the unlimited food and excessive microbial growth the granule size becomes large leading to the weakening of the granule structure the slow anaerobic feeding on the other hand selects for slow growing microbes that allow for compact granules as well as enhance treatment performance as such the adoption of slow anaerobic feeding at high olr would enable the proliferation of slow growing microbial species that would keep the granule size in check despite the abundance of food this operating strategy would contribute to granule stability as well as increase the microbial diversity necessary for enhanced treatment performance of the bioreactor 4 discussion feeding strategy and olr the main operational parameters discussed in this paper are not the only operational parameters that enhance granule stability the other salient parameters necessary for both ag formation and stability include hydrodynamic shear force settling time cycle time volumetric exchange ratio ver the ratio of the volume of the effluent withdrawn to total working volume of the reactor and solids retention time srt the hydrodynamic shear force and settling time are particularly important for granule formation these other salient parameters are briefly discussed here the hydrodynamic shear force in the form of up flow superficial air velocity is a prime parameter for both ag formation and stability generally higher shear force enhances ag formation and stability a threshold value of 1 2 cm s is reported in the literature as the minimum up flow superficial air velocity required for granule formation 60 72 high up flow superficial air velocities allow for dense and stable ag by detaching filamentous outgrowth and by increasing the production of exopolysaccharides ag specific gravity and hydrophobicity 6 from a cost savings perspective it is desirable to operate at lower up flow superficial air velocities that allow for reduced aeration intensity resulting in reduced energy demand combined with other parameters studies have reported granule formation at 0 8 cm s 73 0 6 cm s 74 0 42 cm s 75 and 0 41 cm s for low strength wastewater 76 however the ag formed at the lower up flow superficial air velocities had a loose microbial structure exhibiting instability 73 74 devlin et al 76 demonstrated that at 0 41 cm s stable ag could only be formed using low strength cod of 340 mg l but not medium strength 630 mg l or high strength 1300 mg l wastewater this demonstrates that the threshold up flow superficial air velocity for stable ag depends on the olr operating at low olrs would require low values of up flow superficial air velocities implying reduced energy demand as a result of the reduced aeration intensity using high strength wastewater 2000 mg cod l chen et al 73 reported successful granulation at up flow superficial air velocities in the range of 0 8 3 2 cm s however ag formed at the low values of 0 8 and 1 6 cm s were large and had filamentous bacteria a loose structure and an irregular shape that resulted in instability while formation is possible at low up flow superficial air velocities long term stability is an issue at such low values the combination of the slow anaerobic feeding strategy and low superficial upflow air velocity could prove vital in this regard a better understanding of the self immobilisation of microbes under these operating conditions is required to elucidate our understanding of ag formation and stability the settling time is an important hydraulic selection pressure on the microbial community for ag formation it is a significant operational parameter for ag formation settling time determines the quantity and type of sludge to be accumulated in the reactor which will eventually agglomerate to form granules long settling times will result in the accumulation of both fast settling and slow settling sludge resulting in the formation of flocculated biomass short settling times select fast settling bacteria while allowing the poorly settling flocs to wash out thus enhancing granulation 3 however extremely short settling times allow the washout of even fast settling sludge leading to the accumulation of insufficient biomass for granulation 20 generally a 5 min settling time has been indicated to be essential for granulation 77 78 this allows for the formation of granules with outstanding settleability which is essential for the effective functioning of biological wastewater treatment systems for the start up of ags bioreactors settling times are usually long about 30 min at the beginning and progressively reduced to 2 5 min as granulation proceeds cycle time determines the feast famine regimes in the reactor short cycle times result in short hydraulic retention times that favour rapid granulation such short cycle times stimulate the microbial activity and production of cell polysaccharides and improve cell hydrophobicity a wide range of cycle times has been reported in the literature 1 5 24 h while short cycle times favour ag formation granules formed at such short cycle times exhibit instability for long term ag stability a suitable feast famine regime should be created in the reactor periodic starvation strongly impacts cell hydrophobicity a long starvation period was shown to favour ag stability 16 79 the cycle starvation period for ag stability reported in the literature is in the range of 60 80 80 81 this requirement for long term stability will impact the cycle time as slowly degradable substrates such as industrial wastewater require long cycle times to achieve the feast famine regime required for ag stability as such the cycle time to be adopted depends on the type of wastewater to be treated for instance saline wastewater with a phenol concentration of 1000 mg l required a 17 h cycle time for 99 treatment efficiency 82 treatment of dairy wastewater for 90 cod removal required an 8 h cycle time 54 and a 6 h cycle time was required for an ags reactor treating brewery wastewater 83 a 3 6 h cycle time was required for rubber wastewater 84 85 corsino et al 86 reported successful ag formation using brewery wastewater at a 6 h cycle time but the granules were unstable stability was restored by extending the cycle time to 12 h this extended the famine conditions that favour slow growing bacteria 86 hence for each type of wastewater to be treated cycle test analyses would need to be conducted to determine when the substrate is completely degraded within the cycle from there the cycle time could be adopted the ver at the end of each sbr cycle acts as the selection pressure to get rid of non granular sludge from the reactor the granulation process can be enhanced at a higher ver with a ver from 20 to 80 it was reported that faster ag formation occurred at a higher ver 87 this is expected because a high ver would allow for more substrate to be loaded into the reactor in each cycle allowing for the increased growth of microorganisms pilot scale and full scale sbrs have been operated at a ver of 50 75 allowing for compact and dense ag 88 91 the choice of the ver depends on other practical factors as well for low strength wastewater it may be desirable to operate at a higher ver in order to increase the quantity of substrate in the reactor for faster granulation granulation using medium or high strength wastewater has been possible at 50 or less ver 36 84 92 93 hence the choice of the ver to be adopted depends on the wastewater type the majority of studies and full scale applications have utilised a 50 ver to retrofit existing reactors into ags bioreactors for practical reasons the ver to be adopted depends on the reactor geometry the srt in ags bioreactors is an important parameter for ag stability and treatment performance ag formation has been possible across a wide range of srt 2 40 d 52 94 95 implying that it has no effect on granulation it has been shown that long srts are detrimental to ag stability 96 granule disintegration impacts treatment performance since some microbial species are located at ag outer layers nitrifiers were found to be specifically located at the outer ag layers with a mean srt of 11 3 d with paos and gaos located both on the outer and inner layers with a mean srt of 13 4 d the mean srt of the nitrifiers was shorter than the mean reactor srt 14 4 days 97 implying granule disintegration will impact the ags bioreactor s capacity to remove nutrients for long term ag stability and ags bioreactor treatment performance the trend now is to fix the srt through the selective withdrawal of mature granules from the bottom of the reactor 42 96 98 this strategy allows for a good mixture of both old and newly formed ag with suitable micro environments for the removal of organic matter and nutrients typical srts used for ag stability and enhanced ags treatment performance lie in the range of 9 15 d 5 conclusion the impact of feeding strategy and olr on ag formation and stability has been reviewed the feeding strategy that appears suitable for stable ag formation using various substrates is the slow anaerobic feeding strategy compact and stable granules are formed at low olrs although the formation time is long operating at high olrs results in fast granule formation but these granules are unstable for the formation of stable granules with enhanced performance it is recommended to use a strategy of stressing high olr for fast granule formation followed by reducing olr to ensure stability this can be combined with anaerobic slow feeding to select for slow growing microorganisms and nutrients removers such as paos further research can explore granule

13714,aerobic granular sludge ags has emerged as a novel biotechnology for the effective treatment of both municipal and industrial wastewater two of the practical parameters that affect aerobic granule ag formation and stability are the feeding strategy and organic loading rate olr in this paper the impact of feeding strategy and olr on ag formation and stability are reviewed the feeding strategy that appears suitable for stable ag formation using all substrates is slow anaerobic feeding despite the long duration for ag cultivation at low olr compact and stable ag are formed high olrs result in fast ag formation but the developed granules are unstable due to the large size resulting from excessive microbial growth the recommended strategy for stable ag formation with enhanced treatment performance is stressed high olr for fast granule formation followed by reduced olr to ensure stability this can be combined with slow anaerobic feeding to select for slow growing microorganisms and nutrients removers such as phosphate accumulating organisms paos further research is recommended to explore ag formation at high olr using the slow anaerobic feeding strategy for long term stability keywords aerobic granular sludge ags ags stability feeding strategy organic loading rate wastewater treatment 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology has emerged as a novel biotechnology for the effective treatment of both municipal and industrial wastewater ags technology exhibits numerous advantages over the conventional activated sludge process these advantages include outstanding settleability strong microbial structure high biomass retention high resilience to toxic chemicals and good ability to handle high organic and shock loading rates 1 4 due to its strong potential to revolutionise the wastewater management industry ags biotechnology is considered by the international water association to be the most promising wastewater treatment technology of the 21 st century ags has been successfully used in the treatment of both municipal and a wide range of industrial wastewaters 4 6 during the granulation process the feeding strategy and organic loading rate olr play vital roles in the type and stability of aerobic granules ag that form a number of review papers have been published on ags biotechnology in the last 20 years 1 4 6 11 however none of the papers focus exclusively on the influence that these key operational parameters feeding strategy and olr have on aerobic granulation while it is generally agreed that hydrodynamic shear force and settling time have major influence on ag formation and stability the effect of feeding strategy and olr on the formation and stability of ags is often not highlighted regarding the relationship between these two parameters as applied to bioreactor operation in sequencing batch reactor sbr mode olr defines the amount of organic matter that is fed into a given reactor volume over a period of time while the feeding strategy defines how fast organic matter is fed into the reactor and the form of carbon available at the beginning of the aeration reaction phase of the sbr cycle e g when anaerobic feeding strategy is adopted easily biodegradable carbon in the feed is converted into slowly biodegradable storage polymers during the feeding phase in general olr is a volumetric loading rate that relates to the cycle time feed concentration and the volumetric exchange ratio of the sbr the feeding strategy has been demonstrated to affect the long term stability of ag the microbial community and treatment performance it is generally accepted that the agglomeration of activated sludge into ag depends on the substrate concentration however ag kinetic behaviour depends on the applied substrate loading 12 13 although olr has been widely viewed as not having a significant effect on ag formation 3 14 it appears that it impacts how quickly ag form their characteristics and stability the focus of this review therefore is on the impact of these two factors on the formation stability and performance of ags the paper will be of benefit to researchers working in the field of ags biotechnology as it highlights areas needing further research the information contained in this review could also benefit wastewater management industry professionals in the design and successful operation of ags bioreactors 2 feeding strategy 2 1 background of the various feeding strategies feeding strategy the method adopted in filling the ags sequencing batch reactor sbr affects the morphology performance and stability of granules five different feeding strategies have been implemented in the formation and maintenance of ag as follows a fast static feeding strategy where the influent is fed to the reactor within a few minutes without aeration or mixing b slow static anaerobic feeding strategy whereby the influent is fed to the reactor through a settled sludge bed over an extended period of time without aeration or mixing in the ags bioreactor because the feeding period is long typically about 1 h the dissolved oxygen do concentration drops making the reactor totally anaerobic c fast static feeding followed by anaerobic mixing which is a slight modification of the slow anaerobic feeding strategy d aerated feeding strategy in which feeding and aeration mixing all take place at the same time e split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy which is a combination of static and aerated feeding strategies the fast static feeding strategy is done by feeding the reactor through the settled sludge within a few minutes without aeration or mixing 15 17 from the top of the reactor 18 19 or through a port on the side of the reactor this feeding strategy has been variously employed in ag formation 15 16 20 28 the fast static feeding strategy allows for fast ag formation although ag formation poses no problem instability has been the main issue with ag formed using this feeding strategy 29 30 generally the growth rate of microorganisms inside ag has been identified as a suitable parameter to enhance the stability of ags 8 when microorganisms within the granule grow excessively the granule becomes big in size and its structure is weakened the weakened granules then disintegrate impacting treatment performance on the other hand slow microbial growth rates have been demonstrated to promote the formation of compact granules with high integrity and physical strength 8 31 32 the selection for slow growing microorganisms has been reported to suppress filamentous growth and improve ag stability 31 33 34 this explains the choice of microbial growth rate as a suitable parameter for enhancing ags stability with the fast static feeding strategy no anaerobic condition is created to convert easily biodegradable carbon into storage polymers as such easily biodegradable carbon is transferred to the aeration phase promoting fast heterotrophic growth 34 research indicates that the growth rate of heterotrophic microorganisms decreases when the substrate is slowly biodegradable storage polymers unlike readily biodegradable carbon 35 the excessive growth of heterotrophic microbes results in large size granules that disintegrate over time the slow static anaerobic feeding strategy was first proposed in 2004 36 the rationale behind the proposal was to control the growth of filamentous organisms that ultimately result in granule instability during feeding the high substrate concentration in the feed penetrates the entire depth of the settled ags bed promoting the conversion of the available carbon to storage polymers by phosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos under anaerobic conditions in the subsequent aeration phase microorganisms utilise the internally stored carbon sources to grow at a low rate 8 limiting the excessive aerobic growth of fast growing heterotrophic microorganisms on readily available carbon that causes unstable ag 34 additionally this feeding strategy specifically allows for the selection of slow growing microorganisms paos and or gaos which promote the formation and maintenance of compact granules the selection for slow growing nitrifying bacteria has also been shown to allow for stable ags 31 in terms of performance the combination of paos with nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria enhances the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen and phosphorus various other studies have utilised the slow anaerobic feeding strategy for ag formation and stability 31 34 37 39 mcswain et al 40 compared the slow anaerobic feeding strategy with split anaerobic aerobic feeding at an olr of 2 4 kg cod m3 d the authors reported ag formation under both feeding strategies however only the reactor with the former feeding strategy formed compact and stable granules 40 the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy resulted in the selection and growth of filamentous organisms that affected the structure of the granules wagner et al 41 explored the use of the slow anaerobic feeding strategy to treat wastewater containing particulate matter they found the slow anaerobic phase to be beneficial for the formation of compact granules 41 slow anaerobic feeding alongside a fixed feast famine period ratio and selective discharge of mature ag was utilised to enhance ag stability 42 stable reactor operation was maintained in over 240 d of the study numerous other studies have found the slow anaerobic feeding strategy to be beneficial for the development of compact ag with long term stability 43 46 fig 1 presents granules formed using the slow anaerobic feeding strategy the fast static feeding followed by a period of anaerobic mixing was explored by rocktäschel et al 47 who compared it to the slow anaerobic feeding strategy they found that both feeding strategies resulted in ag formation however anaerobic mixing showed some merits over the anaerobic plug flow feeding regime granule growth was more stable allowing for a suitable balance between the growth of heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms 47 the aerated feeding strategy was found to develop a loose ag structure with a weak anaerobic core compared to the compact granules formed when the slow anaerobic feeding strategy was adopted 48 the treatment performance in terms of total nitrogen removal was higher mean efficiency of 91 7 4 1 with the granules developed using the anaerobic feeding strategy when the granules were developed using the aerated feeding strategy the removal was poor mean efficiency of 58 8 7 4 it has also been shown that the aerated feeding strategy allows for the fast formation of granules but with the capability of removing only organic matter as the selected microorganisms majorly organic matter degraders outcompete the microorganisms responsible for nitrogen removal 45 46 49 in the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy instead of the long slow anaerobic feeding period a part of the feeding period is done under anaerobic conditions and the remaining period is aerated feeding feeding aeration and mixing recent research reported that the split anaerobic aerobic feeding was suitable for the formation and maintenance of ag at low olrs 50 this is in contrast to an earlier study by mcswain et al 40 in which long anaerobic feeding formed compact and stable granules compared to the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy 40 however it must be pointed out that the substrate type and the loading rate used in the two studies were not the same while mcswain et al 40 used synthetic wastewater made from glucose and peptone at a loading rate of 2 4 kg cod m3 d thwaites et al 50 utilised real municipal wastewater containing high salinity in the range of 5 000 7 000 mg l total dissolved solids at loading rate of 0 76 1 15 kg cod m3 d as such the difference in findings may also be attributed to other parameters hence further studies need to be conducted in this area the influent and effluent wastewater characteristics as applied to the different feeding strategies are presented in table 1 below 2 2 perspectives on the feeding strategies the aerated feeding strategies can lead to fast granulation but at the expense of nutrient removal since the favoured organisms mainly only remove organic matter and outcompete nitrifiers 51 both the aerated and fast static feeding strategies are applicable in situations where the removal of only organic matter is desired additionally they are suitable where the wastewater has high organic matter content and fluctuations in wastewater composition are expected in such situations the long term stability of the developed granules needs to be considered other operational parameters that control ag stability would need to be implemented when these feeding strategies are adopted the slow anaerobic feeding strategy has been found to form compact and stable ag where the excessive growth of heterotrophic microorganisms is kept in check while allowing slow growing microorganisms to thrive long anaerobic contact time plays three salient roles the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable substrates into readily biodegradable substrates the formation of volatile fatty acids through the fermentation of slowly degradable substrates and preferential uptake and storage of the slowly degradable substrates by slow growing paos and gaos 41 45 46 in addition to enabling ag stability the treatment performance particularly nitrogen and phosphorus removal of the ag developed under this feeding strategy is enhanced particularly for phosphorus the anaerobic condition during the feeding phase is essential for high removal efficiency 52 53 another way to look at this is to consider that the anaerobic feeding regime is the plug flow type in which the feed passes through the settled bed of ag as it is the plug flow type large sized and dense ag are expected to settle at the bottom of the reactor allowing higher nutrient loads to be received by these large granules 51 this will allow substrate gradient from the reactor bottom upwards to penetrate the stratified structure of the big granules enabling biochemical reactions to take place within the granules further with fluctuating industrial effluents this feeding strategy would be handy as it would allow adequate time for enough wastewater to accumulate and be used as feed in the next sbr cycle the slow anaerobic feeding period makes a simplified feeding and withdrawal system possible 36 in order to avoid filamentous outgrowth on the granule surface it was suggested that slowly degradable substances found in real wastewater such as colloids and particulate matter be run through an anaerobic hydrolysis pre step 54 55 the slow anaerobic feeding strategy would allow for the hydrolysis and fermentation of such slowly degradable substrates allowing for a quick uptake in the subsequent aeration phase of the sbr cycle this would create the desired feast famine conditions in the reactor which keep heterotrophic growth under check enabling long term ag stability and increased treatment performance the main shortcoming of the slow anaerobic feeding strategy is the increase in the duration of the cycle which increases the hydraulic retention time of the treatment the slow anaerobic feeding strategy is applicable in situations where the removal of both organic matter and nutrients is required in situations of fluctuating industrial effluents and where the wastewater contains high organic nutrient loads as well as slowly degradable substances such as colloids and particulate matter as for the fast static feeding followed by the anaerobic mixing strategy feeding under anaerobic mixing conditions at an industrial scale is suitable as it would allow complete mixing of the influent wastewater when compared to an ideal plug flow influent stream however the reactor design stage would need to consider issues around the anaerobic mixing step the issues would include the equalisation tanks required and the number of sbrs to custom build another issue to consider is the additional operational cost that would be required for incorporating mixing during the feeding phase of the sbr cycle the fast static feeding followed by the anaerobic mixing strategy is applicable for industrial wastewater different feeding strategies are suitable to different substrates while fast static feeding can be suitable when using easily biodegradable substrates such as acetate it is not desirable where slowly biodegradable substrates are involved substrates such as methanol which can be aerobically converted by relatively slow growing bacteria are able to form stable granules even under the fast aerobic feeding strategy 56 despite the positives here it is still more advantageous to employ the slow anaerobic feeding strategy as it will allow for energy savings resulting from not using aeration during the feeding phase and the stability made possible by the slow anaerobic feeding strategy would allow for stable reactor operation the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy is suitable for wastewater treatment plants with low olrs while one study has found the split anaerobic aerobic feeding strategy to be suitable for ags formation and maintenance at low olr 50 there are no similar studies reported in the literature further research may be needed in this area using different substrates and operating at various olrs to establish the threshold olr for the adoption of this feeding strategy another consideration is that introducing aeration during the feeding would increase the energy consumption adding to the operational cost 3 organic loading rate 3 1 background of the range of organic loading rate used in aerobic granulation the olr is one of the most salient parameters affecting biological wastewater treatment systems 14 as applied to ags and the sense used in this paper reactor olr values are divided into three categories low below 2 kg cod m3 d moderate 2 4 kg cod m3 d and high above 4 kg cod m3 d while the cultivation of ag has been possible across a wide range of olrs 0 6 24 kg cod m3 d 3 12 13 57 58 ag instability has been the major issue at high olrs moy et al 12 first studied the effect of olr 6 9 12 and 15 kg cod m3 d on ag formation using two substrates glucose and acetate while ag was formed at all the olrs tested when glucose was the substrate the ag formed at 6 kg cod m3 d were dominated by filamentous bacteria and had a loose fluffy morphology whereas ag formed at 9 kg cod m3 d and above were irregularly shaped and contained folds depressions and crevices with acetate as the substrate compact ag with enhanced settleability and strength were formed at 6 and 9 kg cod m3 d however the acetate fed ag disintegrated at an olr of 9 kg cod m3 d similarly tay et al 59 found that olr influenced ag formation as well as its characteristics and stability at a low olr of 1 kg cod m3 d loose structured flocs dominated the reactor without ag formation stable and compact ag were formed at a moderate olr of 4 kg cod m3 d while at a high olr of 8 kg cod m3 d the formed ag coexisted with flocs containing pores and filament 59 no ag formation occurred at low olr of 1 2 kg cod m3 d in another study whereas operating at 4 kg cod m3 d resulted in stable ag 60 at a high olr of 8 kg cod m3 d ag appeared on day 18 of operation however the ag exhibited instability and disintegrated within two weeks 60 61 using dairy wastewater as the substrate at a high olr of 5 9 kg cod m3 d filamentous growth and ag instability were reported 54 with continuous exploration of the ag reactor operation at a high olr zheng et al 21 reported the formation of compact round ag at an olr of 6 kg cod m3 d using a sucrose substrate however the ag showed instability as they grew larger due to the growth of a filamentous microbial community resulting in the reduction of hydrophobicity and specific gravity 21 large ag have reportedly formed at high olr 13 32 in the study granule strength exhibited the opposite trend decreasing with an increase in olr 13 a study found that the mean size of ag increased from 1 6 to 1 9 mm when the olr was increased from a moderate olr of 3 kg cod m3 d to high olr of 9 kg cod m3 d 14 using glucose fed substrate at olrs of 1 5 3 and 4 5 kg cod m3 d li et al 62 reported that ag exhibited different morphologies structural properties and bacterial species at varying olrs large and loose ag formed within a short period at a high olr whereas smaller and more tightly packed ag took longer to form at a low olr in terms of species diversity the lowest species diversity was found at a higher olr while the highest species diversity was found in the reactor with the lowest olr 62 with acetate as the carbon source stable granules with good characteristics were obtained within the olr range of 6 15 kg cod m3 d 63 the olr in this study was increased in a step wise fashion from 6 to 15 kg cod m3 d adav et al 64 cultivated ag using acetate substrate at olrs ranging from 9 to 21 3 kg cod m3 d whereas ag formation was successful at olrs up to 19 5 kg cod m3 d disintegration occurred at very high olr of 21 3 kg cod m3 d another study reported the successful formation of ag at 3 6 and 9 kg cod m3 d using acetate as the carbon source 65 with more research ag formation has been found to be feasible even at a much lower olr than the range usually reported in the literature peyong et al 57 reported the successful formation and maintenance of ag at olr as low as 0 6 kg cod m3 d it is expected that the granules formed at such low olrs will exhibit long term stability the olr has also been demonstrated to impact the microbial composition of ags the change in the microbial community will have an influence not only on the stability but also the performance of the ag reactor the stepwise increase of the olr was reported to lead to the loss of microbial diversity with the selection of only a functional microbial consortium at high olr 66 with a mixture of centrate reject from dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge and acetate as substrate low 0 9 kg cod m3 d 1 9 kg cod m3 d and moderate 3 7 kg cod m3 d olrs were tested 67 at the different olrs the reactors were dominated by paracoccus thauera zoogloea and meganema that exhibited functions such as extracellular polymeric substances eps formation polyhydroxyalkanoate pha storage and denitrification as a fast start up strategy ag formation was sped up by using a high olr zhang et al 58 applied 24 kg cod m3 d and reported ag formation within 7 h however the granules disintegrated within two days of operation when the olr was reduced to 12 kg cod m3 d and subsequently to 6 kg cod m3 d ag were formed within 24 h and the granules maintained stability with steady state attained within 12 d 58 in the same line of research liu and tay 68 stressed the olr to 12 kg cod m3 d during ag formation once the system attained steady state the olr was reduced to 6 kg cod m3 d and stability was achieved 68 in this way it was possible to quickly start up the ag reactor and enhance its successful operation alternating between varying levels of olr values has been explored as a way to enhance ag stability yang et al 69 applied alternating olr feeding to speed up ag formation alternating between 4 4 and 17 4 kg cod m3 d they found that the stress the microbial community was subjected to allowed for the secretion of the alginate like exopolysaccharides which accumulated and eventually enhanced the ag structure 69 compared to the operation at a constant 8 kg cod m3 d olr granulation was faster with the alternating olr approach with the increase in the amount of eps and cell adhesiveness for granule stability long et al 70 found that ags exhibited structural stability at olrs 15 kg cod m3 d however olrs 18 kg cod m3 d resulted in instability this is because an increase in the size of ag results in an increase in the growth of anaerobic cores inside the granules formed by massive dead cells 70 in general while operation at low and moderate olrs takes longer to form granules it allows for stable granules high olrs allow for fast granulation but at the expense of ags stability at high olrs 4 kg cod m3 d the rate of granulation granule structure and morphology also depend on the substrate type for example energy rich substrates such as glucose may allow for the proliferation of filamentous bacteria which result in loose morphology and fluffy surface 8 additionally whereas simple carbon sources e g acetate select for simple and uniform microstructures relatively complex carbon sources such as carbohydrates produce granules with layered and complex microstructures and a greater diversity of microorganisms this implies real wastewater which typically contain a complex composition of different substrates are likely to exhibit different substrate degradation rates which would impact ag stability and the microbial community within ag 54 71 3 2 perspectives on the organic loading rate the formation of ag has been demonstrated to be possible at both a very low olr 0 6 kg cod m3 d and a very high olr 24 kg cod m3 d the variable result is the time it takes for ag to form and the type of the resulting granules ag formation at a low olr takes several weeks while only a few hours or days are required at a high olr where there is enough time for granule formation ag formation at a low olr would be advantageous since stable small size granules are formed in situations in which time is of the essence the application of a high olr to form granules is desired however the major concern is the maintenance of ag stability at a high olr since increasing the olr leads to an increase in granule size which ultimately results in anaerobic conditions within the granule core due to oxygen diffusion limitations this weakens the structural integrity of the granule ultimately leading to granule disintegration with compact and small granules oxygen transfer limitation into the granule does not pose any problem it keeps the development of anaerobic conditions within the granule core in check current research efforts are geared towards enhancing ag integrity by exploring ways to control the granule size previous studies have explored alternating between high and low olr to maintain granule integrity it is suggested here to conduct research on the combination of high olr and slow anaerobic feeding strategy to enhance granule stability the slow anaerobic feeding strategy has been demonstrated to select for slow growing microorganisms 31 36 that control the excessive growth of heterotrophic organisms in the subsequent aeration phase within the sbr cycle the combination of high olr and slow anaerobic feeding strategy will allow for the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable substrates in the feed into readily biodegradable substrates during the feeding phase this will create the desired feast famine conditions within the sbr cycle necessary to maintain granule integrity a filling period of at least 1 h is suggested to allow adequate time for the feed to slowly penetrate through the settled granule bed even at high olrs such a long filling time would prove to be beneficial in allowing a small amount of the substrate into the bioreactor at a time in addition the newly developed strategy of stressing the olr using a high olr to form granules and lowering the olr once a steady state is reached 58 68 can be further exploited for ag stability the stressed olr will serve the purpose of obtaining granules within the shortest possible time this will be useful for faster start ups of ag plants once the purpose of granule formation has been achieved it may be worth exploring the possibility of enhancing the treatment performance of the ag reactors since granule formation at high olr results in the loss of diversity of the microbial species it is suggested here to adopt the slow anaerobic feeding strategy at the reduced olr after attaining granulation this would allow for the development of a microbial community necessary to enhance the removal of both organic matter and nutrients such a feeding arrangement would permit the growth of slow growing microorganisms that are also nutrient removers 31 36 a similar strategy has been recommended for the enhancement of treatment performance in situations where an increase in olr is required such as a switch from lab scale to pilot or full scale or where a change in the type of wastewater to be treated is desired a gradual increase of the olr was earlier suggested for high treatment performance in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus removal 46 this will maintain the microbial community within the system in practice while municipal wastewater treatment plants operate at low olrs with no issues of ag instability it is desirable to operate ag reactors at high olrs for high strength organic wastewaters to allow for compact reactors with a small footprint a stepwise increase of olr would have to be adopted during such a switch a stepwise increase of olr was previously demonstrated to select for a functional microbial consortium at a high olr 66 in terms of the wastewater type substrate to be treated the impact that olr has on ag formation and stability is substrate specific with glucose as the substrate fluffy ag with filamentous growth formed while acetate grown ag exhibited a more round and compact structure compact ag show high hydrophobicity a characteristic that allows for granule stability on the other hand large filamentous ag formed when glucose was the substrate exhibited low hydrophobicity and specific gravity as the olr increased the compact acetate fed granules grew to a stage where problems associated with diffusion limitation probably became insurmountable with acetate olr above 21 kg cod m3 d resulted in ag disintegration 64 as such before initiating granulation at pilot or full scale it may be worth conducting lab scale testing on the substrate to ascertain the threshold olr that can allow for both ag formation and long term stability where it is practically possible alternating between low and high olr can also enhance ag stability it was previously reported that alternating between a feed olr of 4 4 and 17 4 kg cod m3 d resulted in the accumulation of secreted alginate like exopolysaccharides that strengthened the ag structure 69 this is an interesting area for further research as it may open the door to co mingling different industrial wastewater types for effective treatment in addition to enhancing ag stability quite often situations arise where effluents from different industrial processes are to be treated the alternation between low and high olr would allow for treatment in the same bioreactor additionally where industrial effluent discharge fluctuates dilution would allow for maintaining the same flow rate whilst allowing for the alternation between low and high olr that enhance granule stability ags stability is adversely affected at high olrs due to the large size of the cultivated granules as a result of the increase in the growth of the anaerobic core inside the granules formed by massive dead cells 70 a topic for further research in this regard is the combination of a high olr with a slow anaerobic feeding strategy at high olr there is abundant food available for microorganisms and this allows for excessive growth of the microbes with the unlimited food and excessive microbial growth the granule size becomes large leading to the weakening of the granule structure the slow anaerobic feeding on the other hand selects for slow growing microbes that allow for compact granules as well as enhance treatment performance as such the adoption of slow anaerobic feeding at high olr would enable the proliferation of slow growing microbial species that would keep the granule size in check despite the abundance of food this operating strategy would contribute to granule stability as well as increase the microbial diversity necessary for enhanced treatment performance of the bioreactor 4 discussion feeding strategy and olr the main operational parameters discussed in this paper are not the only operational parameters that enhance granule stability the other salient parameters necessary for both ag formation and stability include hydrodynamic shear force settling time cycle time volumetric exchange ratio ver the ratio of the volume of the effluent withdrawn to total working volume of the reactor and solids retention time srt the hydrodynamic shear force and settling time are particularly important for granule formation these other salient parameters are briefly discussed here the hydrodynamic shear force in the form of up flow superficial air velocity is a prime parameter for both ag formation and stability generally higher shear force enhances ag formation and stability a threshold value of 1 2 cm s is reported in the literature as the minimum up flow superficial air velocity required for granule formation 60 72 high up flow superficial air velocities allow for dense and stable ag by detaching filamentous outgrowth and by increasing the production of exopolysaccharides ag specific gravity and hydrophobicity 6 from a cost savings perspective it is desirable to operate at lower up flow superficial air velocities that allow for reduced aeration intensity resulting in reduced energy demand combined with other parameters studies have reported granule formation at 0 8 cm s 73 0 6 cm s 74 0 42 cm s 75 and 0 41 cm s for low strength wastewater 76 however the ag formed at the lower up flow superficial air velocities had a loose microbial structure exhibiting instability 73 74 devlin et al 76 demonstrated that at 0 41 cm s stable ag could only be formed using low strength cod of 340 mg l but not medium strength 630 mg l or high strength 1300 mg l wastewater this demonstrates that the threshold up flow superficial air velocity for stable ag depends on the olr operating at low olrs would require low values of up flow superficial air velocities implying reduced energy demand as a result of the reduced aeration intensity using high strength wastewater 2000 mg cod l chen et al 73 reported successful granulation at up flow superficial air velocities in the range of 0 8 3 2 cm s however ag formed at the low values of 0 8 and 1 6 cm s were large and had filamentous bacteria a loose structure and an irregular shape that resulted in instability while formation is possible at low up flow superficial air velocities long term stability is an issue at such low values the combination of the slow anaerobic feeding strategy and low superficial upflow air velocity could prove vital in this regard a better understanding of the self immobilisation of microbes under these operating conditions is required to elucidate our understanding of ag formation and stability the settling time is an important hydraulic selection pressure on the microbial community for ag formation it is a significant operational parameter for ag formation settling time determines the quantity and type of sludge to be accumulated in the reactor which will eventually agglomerate to form granules long settling times will result in the accumulation of both fast settling and slow settling sludge resulting in the formation of flocculated biomass short settling times select fast settling bacteria while allowing the poorly settling flocs to wash out thus enhancing granulation 3 however extremely short settling times allow the washout of even fast settling sludge leading to the accumulation of insufficient biomass for granulation 20 generally a 5 min settling time has been indicated to be essential for granulation 77 78 this allows for the formation of granules with outstanding settleability which is essential for the effective functioning of biological wastewater treatment systems for the start up of ags bioreactors settling times are usually long about 30 min at the beginning and progressively reduced to 2 5 min as granulation proceeds cycle time determines the feast famine regimes in the reactor short cycle times result in short hydraulic retention times that favour rapid granulation such short cycle times stimulate the microbial activity and production of cell polysaccharides and improve cell hydrophobicity a wide range of cycle times has been reported in the literature 1 5 24 h while short cycle times favour ag formation granules formed at such short cycle times exhibit instability for long term ag stability a suitable feast famine regime should be created in the reactor periodic starvation strongly impacts cell hydrophobicity a long starvation period was shown to favour ag stability 16 79 the cycle starvation period for ag stability reported in the literature is in the range of 60 80 80 81 this requirement for long term stability will impact the cycle time as slowly degradable substrates such as industrial wastewater require long cycle times to achieve the feast famine regime required for ag stability as such the cycle time to be adopted depends on the type of wastewater to be treated for instance saline wastewater with a phenol concentration of 1000 mg l required a 17 h cycle time for 99 treatment efficiency 82 treatment of dairy wastewater for 90 cod removal required an 8 h cycle time 54 and a 6 h cycle time was required for an ags reactor treating brewery wastewater 83 a 3 6 h cycle time was required for rubber wastewater 84 85 corsino et al 86 reported successful ag formation using brewery wastewater at a 6 h cycle time but the granules were unstable stability was restored by extending the cycle time to 12 h this extended the famine conditions that favour slow growing bacteria 86 hence for each type of wastewater to be treated cycle test analyses would need to be conducted to determine when the substrate is completely degraded within the cycle from there the cycle time could be adopted the ver at the end of each sbr cycle acts as the selection pressure to get rid of non granular sludge from the reactor the granulation process can be enhanced at a higher ver with a ver from 20 to 80 it was reported that faster ag formation occurred at a higher ver 87 this is expected because a high ver would allow for more substrate to be loaded into the reactor in each cycle allowing for the increased growth of microorganisms pilot scale and full scale sbrs have been operated at a ver of 50 75 allowing for compact and dense ag 88 91 the choice of the ver depends on other practical factors as well for low strength wastewater it may be desirable to operate at a higher ver in order to increase the quantity of substrate in the reactor for faster granulation granulation using medium or high strength wastewater has been possible at 50 or less ver 36 84 92 93 hence the choice of the ver to be adopted depends on the wastewater type the majority of studies and full scale applications have utilised a 50 ver to retrofit existing reactors into ags bioreactors for practical reasons the ver to be adopted depends on the reactor geometry the srt in ags bioreactors is an important parameter for ag stability and treatment performance ag formation has been possible across a wide range of srt 2 40 d 52 94 95 implying that it has no effect on granulation it has been shown that long srts are detrimental to ag stability 96 granule disintegration impacts treatment performance since some microbial species are located at ag outer layers nitrifiers were found to be specifically located at the outer ag layers with a mean srt of 11 3 d with paos and gaos located both on the outer and inner layers with a mean srt of 13 4 d the mean srt of the nitrifiers was shorter than the mean reactor srt 14 4 days 97 implying granule disintegration will impact the ags bioreactor s capacity to remove nutrients for long term ag stability and ags bioreactor treatment performance the trend now is to fix the srt through the selective withdrawal of mature granules from the bottom of the reactor 42 96 98 this strategy allows for a good mixture of both old and newly formed ag with suitable micro environments for the removal of organic matter and nutrients typical srts used for ag stability and enhanced ags treatment performance lie in the range of 9 15 d 5 conclusion the impact of feeding strategy and olr on ag formation and stability has been reviewed the feeding strategy that appears suitable for stable ag formation using various substrates is the slow anaerobic feeding strategy compact and stable granules are formed at low olrs although the formation time is long operating at high olrs results in fast granule formation but these granules are unstable for the formation of stable granules with enhanced performance it is recommended to use a strategy of stressing high olr for fast granule formation followed by reducing olr to ensure stability this can be combined with anaerobic slow feeding to select for slow growing microorganisms and nutrients removers such as paos further research can explore granule formation at high olr with a slow anaerobic feeding strategy to assess the long term stability of such aerobic granules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
