fox and squire 1990 and viscous layer keller 1998 models these three models have been combined into a viscoelastic model which recovers the previous three under appropriate limiting conditions wang and shen 2010a in this general model the ice cover is assumed to be a viscoelastic continuum with arbitrary thickness and the water underneath is inviscid all of these models assume that the water body does not consume energy in addition damping due to the water body has been considered in several models further models include a thin and highly viscous layer over a slightly viscous water weber 1987 a thin elastic plate over a turbulent water body parameterized by eddy viscosity liu and mollo christensen 1988 and a more general two layer viscous fluid with arbitrary thickness de carolis and desiderio 2002 recently stopa et al 2016 also provided a detailed formulation that considers a smooth transition between a laminar and turbulent boundary layer in the water body their model focuses only on long waves and it assumes no change in wave dispersion with no damping from the ice cover currently the wavewatch iii ww3 global ocean wave model provides several switches to consider the effects of ice on wave propagation in the most recent version of ww3 v5 16 tolman et al 2016 these switches include ic0 ic1 ic2 ic3 and ic4 for non conservative attenuation and is1 and is2 for the conservative attenuation due to scattering alone the scattering mechanism which has been modeled using the transport equation by meylan and masson 2006 redistributes wave energy directionally without dissipation in order to focus on non conservative attenuation ic0 assumes that an ice cover behaves as an island that partially blocks energy propagation while ic1 assumes constant attenuation for all frequencies ic2 assumes that all damping is from the boundary layer under the ice cover ic3 assumes that all damping is from the viscosity of the ice cover and ic4 uses data to obtain an empirical formula for wave attenuation based on the frequency and ice thickness in this study we focus on ic2 and ic3 i e the boundary layer dissipation model and the viscoelastic model which focus on damping in the water body and the ice layer respectively at present these two models are mutually exclusive the ic2 boundary layer model provides two choices the eddy viscosity given by liu and mollo

turbulent boundary layer with eddy viscosity and an inviscid water layer the detailed formulation is provided in the following subsections 2 1 governing equations we consider a three layer system where a homogeneous viscoelastic ice layer of finite thickness h overlays water of finite depth h with a turbulent boundary layer of thickness b under the ice cover as shown in fig 1 the problem is two dimensional with waves propagating in the x direction while z is positive upward and translational symmetry is applied in the y direction a small amplitude linear wave is considered for simplicity we use a voigt viscoelastic continuum model for the ice cover as described by wang and shen 2010a 1 τ m n p δ m n 2 g s m n 2 ρ i c e ν i c e s m n where ρ ice is the density of the ice layer τ mn smn and s m n represent the stress tensor strain tensor and strain rate tensor respectively m and n represent x or z g and ν ice are the shear modulus and kinematic viscosity of the ice layer respectively

for ϕ n and ψ n n 1 2 as shown in the appendix using the general solutions 22 and 23 in the eight equations we obtain a homogeneous 8 8 linear system for the coefficients an bn cn and dn n 1 2 the dispersion relation is obtained for ω and k by requiring that the determinant of the coefficients matrix vanishes the solution of this dispersion relation for a given wave frequency ω is generally a complex number k kr iki where the real part is the propagating wavenumber and the imaginary part is the amplitude attenuation coefficient we note that this system of equations has infinitely many roots and each has a distinct physical nature as discussed by zhao et al 2017 for the simpler viscoelastic model by using a numerical procedure to solve for the flexural gravity wave mode which is the dominant wave mode care is taken to select an initial estimate that is close to the dominant mode in order to ensure convergence to the correct mode 3 results first we demonstrated the convergence of the current three layer model to the viscoelastic eddy viscosity and two layer viscous fluid models next we fitted a set of experimental data to the three layer model to show the improvement compared with the previous viscoelastic model we then studied the sensitivity of the results obtained by the model to the eddy viscosity and boundary layer thickness 3 1 convergence to the viscoelastic model fig 2 shows the convergence of the three layer model to the viscoelastic layer model when the boundary layer thickness and eddy viscosity both approach 0 in the various cases shown the boundary layer thickness b varies from 10 6 m to 10 m and the eddy viscosity varies from 10 6 m2 s to 10 2 m2 s the selected maximum eddy viscosity value is based on previously reported data mcphee and martinson 1994 marchenko et al 2017 the maximum boundary layer thickness is of the same order as previously reported data the wavenumber kr is insensitive to the eddy viscosity and boundary layer thickness for the range of parameters tested the attenuation coefficient ki increases significantly with the eddy viscosity for the open water case the wavenumber k 0 is calculated from the dispersion relation 26 ω 2 k g tanh k h it is interesting to note that the gradient of the wave attenuation is milder for long wave periods than intermediate wave periods there is also a slight bump in the attenuation trend when t is between 5 s and 10 s i e the roll over phenomenon discussed by liu et al 1991 the location and the size of this bump depend on the shear modulus as discussed in the following 3 2 convergence to the eddy viscosity model when we let the boundary layer thickness approach the water depth and the viscosity of the ice cover vanish the current model conceptually approaches the eddy viscosity model described by liu and mollo christensen 1988 which assumes a uniform viscous water body under a thin elastic plate fig 3 shows the results obtained for the cases where the ice shear modulus is fixed at 109 pa with no viscosity and the eddy viscosity was fixed at ν t 0 001 m2 s the boundary layer thickness varies from 0 01 m to 100 m when the water depth is 100 m the wavenumber calculated using the proposed model is again insensitive to b the attenuation is sensitive to the boundary layer and it indeed converges to that obtained by the eddy viscosity model when b approaches the total water depth this approach is quite rapid the results become insensitive to b for b 1 m which is actually much smaller than most boundary layer thicknesses in the field due to the exponential decay of the velocity field with depth the velocity gradient and thus the viscous energy loss in the water body decreases very quickly from the ice water interface 3 3 convergence to the two layer viscous model next we determine the convergence of our three layer model to the two layer viscous model proposed by de carolis and desiderio 2002 there are two main differences between the three layer model and the two layer viscous model 1 the non slip bottom boundary condition for velocities in the two layer viscous model and 2 the shear modulus effect in the ice layer of the three layer model to avoid a singularity at the bottom when the boundary layer thickness is exactly equal to the water depth we employ non slip boundary conditions at the seafloor given this addition we compare the results obtained with the two layer viscous model and then study the effect of the shear modulus in the three layer model fig 4 presents the results obtained when the ice thickness was 0 5 m the boundary layer thickness is equal to the water depth of 100 m and the viscosities of the ice layer and eddy viscosity were ν ice 0 01 m2 s and ν t 0 001 m2 s respectively over the entire wave period range our model converges to the two layer viscous case when the shear modulus approaches 0 as the shear modulus increases the bump in the attenuation curve mentioned in section 3 1 become prominent particularly in the case where g 106 pa this bump is visible in both the wavenumber curve and the wave attenuation curve over approximately the same wave period range the location of the bump varies for different g values furthermore it is interesting to note that the attenuation decreased for short periods when g increases from 0 thus the roll over phenomenon described by liu et al 1991 is still present in this three layer model 3 4 comparison with laboratory experiments to further examine the contribution of the eddy viscosity under ice cover we tune the viscoelastic model and the three layer model to fit the laboratory data reported by zhao and shen 2015 who used the viscoelastic model to predict the wavenumber and wave attenuation where the results were in good agreement with the wavenumber data but the viscoelastic model underestimated the wave attenuation data at low frequencies in the present study we again employ the levenberg marquardt algorithm to fit the same experimental data with the three layer model the initial estimates of the ice viscosity and shear modulus used in the optimization procedure are the same as those employed by zhao and shen 2015 for the viscoelastic model the fitted physical parameters are listed in tables 1 and 2 the initial estimate is important in the optimization procedure because there are many local optimal solutions to ensure that the global optimal solution is obtained we compare the total error with different initial estimates that cover all possible regimes for the physical parameters the total error is the summation of the error for each data point 27 ɛ t o t a l n 1 n k r n k r ω n 2 c 2 k i n k i ω n 2 where k r n and k i n are the measured wave number and attenuation data at the angular frequency ω n respectively and kr ω n and ki ω n are the predicted wave number and attenuation obtained from the models the parameter c is the ratio of k r n and k i n fig 5 shows the prediction for the first test given by zhao and shen 2015 the comparison of the viscoelastic model and the three layer model in terms of the wavenumber data differ between the two models but the three layer model improves the prediction significantly for the wave attenuation compared with the viscoelastic model similar results are shown in figs 6 and 7 for the second and third tests given by zhao and shen 2015 in fig 8 the three layer model is also compared with the experimental data given by wang and shen 2010b the three layer model improves the viscoelastic model but it still underestimates the wave attenuation data the wavenumber data predictions are accurate but some viscous damping mechanisms may still be missing in the proposed model for example the relative motions between ice floes and water may further induce additional damping to the wave energy this damping mechanism exists in the upper layer but is not included in the linear voigt model the three layer model significantly improves the comparison with the data but this comparison is qualitative at best because direct measurements of the boundary layer structure are missing from these experiments 3 5 sensitivity analysis based on the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer when applying the three layer model the boundary layer thickness is a difficult parameter to determine from direct measurements or estimations therefore we investigate the model s sensitivity to the boundary layer thickness as shown in fig 9 we select a special case corresponding to a laboratory scale in order to plot the wavenumber and wave attenuation with different boundary layer thicknesses we find that when the boundary layer thickness is of the same order as the ice thickness the wave attenuation becomes sensitive to the boundary layer thickness however when the boundary layer thickness is much larger than the ice thickness there are only slight differences in the wave attenuation with different boundary layer thicknesses the wavenumber is not influenced by the boundary layer thickness we consider that in a real ocean the boundary layer would be at least as large as the ice thickness as shown by limited direct measurements mcphee and martinsen 1994 marchenko et al 2017 in this regime the actual boundary layer thickness is not important for wave damping therefore we could roughly estimate the boundary layer thickness without affecting the wavenumber or wave attenuation 3 6 sensitivity analysis based on the eddy viscosity we then study the effects of the magnitude of the eddy viscosity on the wavenumber and wave attenuation fig 10 shows that the eddy viscosity does not significantly influence the wavenumber but it has a clear influence on the magnitude of the wave attenuation these results demonstrate the importance of including the effect of damping from the boundary layer when determining the wave attenuation 4 discussion instead of using the three layer model directly it might be tempting to use the viscoelastic model and eddy viscosity model separately and then adding their predicted attenuation rates however this hybrid approach does not give the same result as the three layer model due to the coupling at the interface between ice and water particularly the no slip condition both the wave dispersion and attenuation depend on the properties of both layers the boundary layer models either assume thin elastic plate dispersion liu and mollo christensen 1988 or open water dispersion stopa et al 2016 they are different from each other as well as different from the dispersion of the viscoelastic model furthermore the coupling of the ice and water layers is nonlinear so the straightforward addition of individual damping coefficients might not provide a good estimate of the coupled system in the following we demonstrate the differences between the hybrid model and three layer model in fig 11 we show the values of the wavenumber and attenuation calculated with the viscoelastic model eddy viscosity model and the three layer model using the selected parameter set there are no differences among the three models in terms of the wavenumber however the wave attenuation clearly differs between the hybrid eddy viscosity plus viscoelastic model and the three layer model using other parameter sets both the real wavenumber and attenuation coefficient may differ with the hybrid and the three layer model a thorough study of the effects of different parameter is not the goal of the present investigation so we only consider one case to demonstrate the coupling effect recently meylan et al 2018 compared the functional behavior of wave attenuation versus the frequency in several theoretical models with various field data sets they found that ki f 3 27appeared to be the best fit the attenuation predicted by the viscoelastic model exhibited asymptotic behavior ki f 7in the low frequency regime for the eddy viscosity model in the low frequency regime according to liu and mollo christensen 1988 we have 28 k i ν t k r 2 ω 3 2 2 ω 2 4 2 b k r 5 b e h 3 12 1 s 2 ρ w a t e r where e is young s modulus and s is the poisson ratio in the low frequency regime ω 0 kr 0 ω2 krg hence ki ω3 5 in fig 12 we show the asymptotic power law of the three layer model in the low frequency regime for two different cases where the power is nearly 2 for the high shear modulus case and 3 5 for the low shear modulus further study is required to thoroughly investigate the effects of elasticity on the power law behavior of this three layer model 5 conclusions in this study we have provided a theoretical solution for wave in ice models this theory is based on damping mechanisms derived from both the ice cover and water body processes in the ice cover contribute to changes in the wave speed and wave attenuation including the viscous interactions of small ice crystals ice floe collisions and inelastic ice sheet bending all of these processes are parameterized into an equivalent viscosity for the ice layer damping is generated in the boundary layer of the water body which is parameterized by an eddy viscosity we have modeled this situation by dividing the ice covered ocean into three layers comprising a viscoelastic upper ice layer viscous middle boundary layer and an inviscid lower ocean layer we have shown that this general model reproduces the results obtained by all the existing models that considered these mechanisms separately and under more simplified conditions this general model means that wave modelers do not need to choose between boundary layer damping and viscoelastic ice models for their simulations in fact both are present in nature in future field and laboratory experiments we expect that direct measurements of the eddy viscosity and boundary layer thickness will be systematically obtained in ice covered waters until better theories are developed based on first principles the model parameters need to be determined based on field and laboratory data and using an inverse method determining the parameter values is challenging but we have provided a theoretical framework to guide experiments and to integrate data measurements into a coherent model finally for application purposes we have provided an efficient way of integrating various mechanisms into a compact model to determine the resulting wavenumber and attenuation

for ϕ n and ψ n n 1 2 as shown in the appendix using the general solutions 22 and 23 in the eight equations we obtain a homogeneous 8 8 linear system for the coefficients an bn cn and dn n 1 2 the dispersion relation is obtained for ω and k by requiring that the determinant of the coefficients matrix vanishes the solution of this dispersion relation for a given wave frequency ω is generally a complex number k kr iki where the real part is the propagating wavenumber and the imaginary part is the amplitude attenuation coefficient we note that this system of equations has infinitely many roots and each has a distinct physical nature as discussed by zhao et al 2017 for the simpler viscoelastic model by using a numerical procedure to solve for the flexural gravity wave mode which is the dominant wave mode care is taken to select an initial estimate that is close to the dominant mode in order to ensure convergence to the correct mode 3 results first we demonstrated the convergence of the current three layer model to the viscoelastic eddy viscosity and two layer viscous fluid models next we fitted a set of experimental data to the three layer model to show the improvement compared with the previous viscoelastic model we then studied the sensitivity of the results obtained by the model to the eddy viscosity and boundary layer thickness 3 1 convergence to the viscoelastic model fig 2 shows the convergence of the three layer model to the viscoelastic layer model when the boundary layer thickness and eddy viscosity both approach 0 in the various cases shown the boundary layer thickness b varies from 10 6 m to 10 m and the eddy viscosity varies from 10 6 m2 s to 10 2 m2 s the selected maximum eddy viscosity value is based on previously reported data mcphee and martinson 1994 marchenko et al 2017 the maximum boundary layer thickness is of the same order as previously reported data the wavenumber kr is insensitive to the eddy viscosity and boundary layer thickness for the range of parameters tested the attenuation coefficient ki increases significantly with the eddy viscosity for the open water case the wavenumber k 0 is calculated from the dispersion relation 26 ω 2 k g tanh k h it is interesting to note that the gradient of the wave attenuation is milder for long wave periods than intermediate wave periods there is also a slight bump in the attenuation trend when t is between 5 s and 10 s i e the roll over phenomenon discussed by liu et al 1991 the location and the size of this bump depend on the shear modulus as discussed in the following 3 2 convergence to the eddy viscosity model when we let the boundary layer thickness approach the water depth and the viscosity of the ice cover vanish the current model conceptually approaches the eddy viscosity model described by liu and mollo christensen 1988 which assumes a uniform viscous water body under a thin elastic plate fig 3 shows the results obtained for the cases where the ice shear modulus is fixed at 109 pa with no viscosity and the eddy viscosity was fixed at ν t 0 001 m2 s the boundary layer thickness varies from 0 01 m to 100 m when the water depth is 100 m the wavenumber calculated using the proposed model is again insensitive to b the attenuation is sensitive to the boundary layer and it indeed converges to that obtained by the eddy viscosity model when b approaches the total water depth this approach is quite rapid the results become insensitive to b for b 1 m which is actually much smaller than most boundary layer thicknesses in the field due to the exponential decay of the velocity field with depth the velocity gradient and thus the viscous energy loss in the water body decreases very quickly from the ice water interface 3 3 convergence to the two layer viscous model next we determine the convergence of our three layer model to the two layer viscous model proposed by de carolis and desiderio 2002 there are two main differences between the three layer model and the two layer viscous model 1 the non slip bottom boundary condition for velocities in the two layer viscous model and 2 the shear modulus effect in the ice layer of the three layer model to avoid a singularity at the bottom when the boundary layer thickness is exactly equal to the water depth we employ non slip boundary conditions at the seafloor given this addition we compare the results obtained with the two layer viscous model and then study the effect of the shear modulus in the three layer model fig 4 presents the results obtained when the ice thickness was 0 5 m the boundary layer thickness is equal to the water depth of 100 m and the viscosities of the ice layer and eddy viscosity were ν ice 0 01 m2 s and ν t 0 001 m2 s respectively over the entire wave period range our model converges to the two layer viscous case when the shear modulus approaches 0 as the shear modulus increases the bump in the attenuation curve mentioned in section 3 1 become prominent particularly in the case where g 106 pa this bump is visible in both the wavenumber curve and the wave attenuation curve over approximately the same wave period range the location of the bump varies for different g values furthermore it is interesting to note that the attenuation decreased for short periods when g increases from 0 thus the roll over phenomenon described by liu et al 1991 is still present in this three layer model 3 4 comparison with laboratory experiments to further examine the contribution of the eddy viscosity under ice cover we tune the viscoelastic model and the three layer model to fit the laboratory data reported by zhao and shen 2015 who used the viscoelastic model to predict the wavenumber and wave attenuation where the results were in good agreement with the wavenumber data but the viscoelastic model underestimated the wave attenuation data at low frequencies in the present study we again employ the levenberg marquardt algorithm to fit the same experimental data with the three layer model the initial estimates of the ice viscosity and shear modulus used in the optimization procedure are the same as those employed by zhao and shen 2015 for the viscoelastic model the fitted physical parameters are listed in tables 1 and 2 the initial estimate is important in the optimization procedure because there are many local optimal solutions to ensure that the global optimal solution is obtained we compare the total error with different initial estimates that cover all possible regimes for the physical parameters the total error is the summation of the error for each data point 27 ɛ t o t a l n 1 n k r n k r ω n 2 c 2 k i n k i ω n 2 where k r n and k i n are the measured wave number and attenuation data at the angular frequency ω n respectively and kr ω n and ki ω n are the predicted wave number and attenuation obtained from the models the parameter c is the ratio of k r n and k i n fig 5 shows the prediction for the first test given by zhao and shen 2015 the comparison of the viscoelastic model and the three layer model in terms of the wavenumber data differ between the two models but the three layer model improves the prediction significantly for the wave attenuation compared with the viscoelastic model similar results are shown in figs 6 and 7 for the second and third tests given by zhao and shen 2015 in fig 8 the three layer model is also compared with the experimental data given by wang and shen 2010b the three layer model improves the viscoelastic model but it still underestimates the wave attenuation data the wavenumber data predictions are accurate but some viscous damping mechanisms may still be missing in the proposed model for example the relative motions between ice floes and water may further induce additional damping to the wave energy this damping mechanism exists in the upper layer but is not included in the linear voigt model the three layer model significantly improves the comparison with the data but this comparison is qualitative at best because direct measurements of the boundary layer structure are missing from these experiments 3 5 sensitivity analysis based on the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer when applying the three layer model the boundary layer thickness is a difficult parameter to determine from direct measurements or estimations therefore we investigate the model s sensitivity to the boundary layer thickness as shown in fig 9 we select a special case corresponding to a laboratory scale in order to plot the wavenumber and wave attenuation with different boundary layer thicknesses we find that when the boundary layer thickness is of the same order as the ice thickness the wave attenuation becomes sensitive to the boundary layer thickness however when the boundary layer thickness is much larger than the ice thickness there are only slight differences in the wave attenuation with different boundary layer thicknesses the wavenumber is not influenced by the boundary layer thickness we consider that in a real ocean the boundary layer would be at least as large as the ice thickness as shown by limited direct measurements mcphee and martinsen 1994 marchenko et al 2017 in this regime the actual boundary layer thickness is not important for wave damping therefore we could roughly estimate the boundary layer thickness without affecting the wavenumber or wave attenuation 3 6 sensitivity analysis based on the eddy viscosity we then study the effects of the magnitude of the eddy viscosity on the wavenumber and wave attenuation fig 10 shows that the eddy viscosity does not significantly influence the wavenumber but it has a clear influence on the magnitude of the wave attenuation these results demonstrate the importance of including the effect of damping from the boundary layer when determining the wave attenuation 4 discussion instead of using the three layer model directly it might be tempting to use the viscoelastic model and eddy viscosity model separately and then adding their predicted attenuation rates however this hybrid approach does not give the same result as the three layer model due to the coupling at the interface between ice and water particularly the no slip condition both the wave dispersion and attenuation depend on the properties of both layers the boundary layer models either assume thin elastic plate dispersion liu and mollo christensen 1988 or open water dispersion stopa et al 2016 they are different from each other as well as different from the dispersion of the viscoelastic model furthermore the coupling of the ice and water layers is nonlinear so the straightforward addition of individual damping coefficients might not provide a good estimate of the coupled system in the following we demonstrate the differences between the hybrid model and three layer model in fig 11 we show the values of the wavenumber and attenuation calculated with the viscoelastic model eddy viscosity model and the three layer model using the selected parameter set there are no differences among the three models in terms of the wavenumber however the wave attenuation clearly differs between the hybrid eddy viscosity plus viscoelastic model and the three layer model using other parameter sets both the real wavenumber and attenuation coefficient may differ with the hybrid and the three layer model a thorough study of the effects of different parameter is not the goal of the present investigation so we only consider one case to demonstrate the coupling effect recently meylan et al 2018 compared the functional behavior of wave attenuation versus the frequency in several theoretical models with various field data sets they found that ki f 3 27appeared to be the best fit the attenuation predicted by the viscoelastic model exhibited asymptotic behavior ki f 7in the low frequency regime for the eddy viscosity model in the low frequency regime according to liu and mollo christensen 1988 we have 28 k i ν t k r 2 ω 3 2 2 ω 2 4 2 b k r 5 b e h 3 12 1 s 2 ρ w a t e r where e is young s modulus and s is the poisson ratio in the low frequency regime ω 0 kr 0 ω2 krg hence ki ω3 5 in fig 12 we show the asymptotic power law of the three layer model in the low frequency regime for two different cases where the power is nearly 2 for the high shear modulus case and 3 5 for the low shear modulus further study is required to thoroughly investigate the effects of elasticity on the power law behavior of this three layer model 5 conclusions in this study we have provided a theoretical solution for wave in ice models this theory is based on damping mechanisms derived from both the ice cover and water body processes in the ice cover contribute to changes in the wave speed and wave attenuation including the viscous interactions of small ice crystals ice floe collisions and inelastic ice sheet bending all of these processes are parameterized into an equivalent viscosity for the ice layer damping is generated in the boundary layer of the water body which is parameterized by an eddy viscosity we have modeled this situation by dividing the ice covered ocean into three layers comprising a viscoelastic upper ice layer viscous middle boundary layer and an inviscid lower ocean layer we have shown that this general model reproduces the results obtained by all the existing models that considered these mechanisms separately and under more simplified conditions this general model means that wave modelers do not need to choose between boundary layer damping and viscoelastic ice models for their simulations in fact both are present in nature in future field and laboratory experiments we expect that direct measurements of the eddy viscosity and boundary layer thickness will be systematically obtained in ice covered waters until better theories are developed based on first principles the model parameters need to be determined based on field and laboratory data and using an inverse method determining the parameter values is challenging but we have provided a theoretical framework to guide experiments and to integrate data measurements into a coherent model finally for application purposes we have provided an efficient way of integrating various mechanisms into a compact model to determine the resulting wavenumber and attenuation

24076,in this paper the combined use of model simulations and altimeter data suggests that during the interval 1998 2006 the kuroshio extension ke low frequency variability was mainly of intrinsic origin the model is based on the primitive equations for a reduced gravity ocean is eddy permitting and relatively idealized but it includes essential elements of realism and is driven by a time independent climatological wind field so that the modelled variability is necessarily of intrinsic oceanic origin the altimeter data are provided by aviso and include all the data available to date a new composite index λ φ specifically conceived for the ke is used in the analysis of both model and altimeter data φ gives the mean latitudinal position of the ke jet and λ is a measure of the high frequency variability of the ke path a set of sensitivity numerical experiments shows that the frontal dynamics is extremely sensitive to the horizontal eddy viscosity a self sustained relaxation oscillation emerging from a reference simulation is represented by a loop in the λ φ plane and is characterized by four phases each one being controlled by a specific dynamical mechanism an interval ranging from january 1998 to march 2006 is identified in the altimeter data during which the altimeter derived index is very similar to the modelled one a detailed analysis based also on sea surface height maps shows that the real ke evolution possesses four phases characterized by basically the same dynamical behaviour recognized in the model loop the conclusion is that during that interval the ke dynamics was controlled by an oceanic intrinsic mode of low frequency variability and that the directly driven dynamics and ocean atmosphere coupled modes of variability did not overshadow the intrinsic evolution the self sustained vs excited character of the relaxation oscillation is finally discussed keywords ocean modelling altimeter data kuroshio extension climate indices intrinsic low frequency variability 1 introduction one of the main tasks of ocean modelling in the current climate change research is to distinguish the natural variability intrinsic intrinsic variability in short to the ocean system from the ocean variability directly forced by the atmosphere or due to coupled ocean atmosphere mechanisms understanding this distinction is important not only from a merely cognitive viewpoint but also in a climate prediction perspective since the intrinsic ocean variability is typically chaotic and can therefore affect the overall predictability of the climate system considerably the role of ocean modelling is fundamental to this respect because it allows one to isolate the ocean system from the global climate and to analyse its response under different forcing agents the analysis of the oceanic intrinsic low frequency variability lfv occurring on the interannual to decadal time scales focused in the last two decades mainly on western boundary current extensions wbces and was carried out through a variety of model studies in the framework of the so called double gyre problem of the wind driven ocean circulation e g see dijkstra and ghil 2005 dijkstra 2005 ghil 2017 for reviews the approaches range from extremely idealized low order models to coarse resolution eddy permitting or even eddy resolving quasigeostrophic or primitive equation layer models with different degrees of idealization in the implementation most models are forced by atmospheric forcing deprived of any low frequency time dependence so that the obtained ocean variability is necessarily intrinsic more recently time dependent forcing has been used to explore new and more advanced aspects of the problem e g pierini et al 2016 ghil 2017 the most notable results are that the ocean is indeed capable of producing highly nonlinear intrinsic wbce fluctuations and that these are extremely sensitive to the model implementation and to the values of some control parameters to disentangle the extreme complexity of the phenomena the use of concepts and methods of nonlinear dynamical systems theory has proved fundamental dijkstra 2005 ghil 2015 besides wbces the intrinsic variabilities of the global ocean are now being systematically studied by means of high resolution ocean general circulation models ogcms e g penduff et al 2011 2014 zhang et al 2015 nonaka et al 2016 bessières et al 2017 leroux et al 2018 etc the validation of any theory of the intrinsic ocean variability relies heavily on satellite altimetry which provides a regular and synoptic mapping of the sea surface height ssh from which surface geostrophic currents can be derived e g stammer and cazenave 2018 among the wbces the kuroshio extension ke in the north pacific is the jet displaying the most dramatic and fascinating lfv whose structure latitudinal location and associated mesoscale eddy field exhibit very strong and complex changes over the decadal time scale that affect the climate of vast areas e g qiu 2000 2002 kelly et al 2010 kwon et al 2010 the ke lfv was therefore analysed through satellite altimeter measurements already with geosat e g tai and white 1990 qiu et al 1991 le traon 1992 jacobs et al 1996 mitchell et al 1996 and later on with topex poseidon ers 1 2 and more recent altimeter missions e g sainz trapaga et al 2001 qiu 2002 qiu and chen 2005 2010 jayne et al 2009 bessières et al 2013 qiu et al 2014 the possibility that the ke lfv be at least in part intrinsic has been suggested by several model studies that were sufficiently realistic to allow for some form of model data comparison e g schmeits and dijkstra 2001 pierini 2006 taguchi et al 2007 pierini et al 2009 pierini and dijkstra 2009 zhang et al 2015 nonaka et al 2016 see pierini et al 2014 for a review pierini 2006 and pierini et al 2009 used two indices proposed by qiu and chen 2005 namely the length of the ke axis lke and mean latitudinal position φ of the same axis to compare their model results with altimeter data the parameter lke was also used by qiu and chen 2010 qiu et al 2014 pierini 2014a and zhang et al 2015 to characterize the ke evolution such model data comparison suggested a relevant role of nonlinear intrinsic mechanisms in the ke lfv a more robust description of the ke lfv was proposed by pierini 2015 in the framework of a model study by introducing a composite dynamic index λ φ φ gives the low passed filtered mean latitudinal position of the ke jet and λ is a parameter measuring the high frequency variability hfv of the ke path obtained by integrating over a high frequency range the wavelet amplitude of lke it is worth stressing that the variations of the high frequency eddy kinetic energy level associated with mesoscale eddies in the upstream ke region is recognized to be one of the main aspects of the ke lfv the composite index λ φ was therefore suggested to provide an efficient and unequivocal characterization of the ke lfv in terms of an orbit in the λ φ plane the study of pierini 2015 has however four main limitations i the composite index was computed only for a single reference simulation ii it was computed for a single oscillation and iii it was not computed with altimeter data so that model validation was not possible and therefore iv it was not possible to detect precise intervals during which the observed ke lfv could possibly be related to model results in the present study these four limitations are overcome i four sensitivity experiments with different values of the lateral eddy viscosity coefficient ah are carried out with the model of pierini 2006 forced by steady climatological winds unlike in pierini 2015 in which a time dependent wind component was present so that the intrinsic nature of the model response is now even more evident λ φ is then computed for each simulation ii the index is computed for a 70 years interval which includes several oscillations iii the same index is now evaluated also with the altimeter data distributed by archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data aviso from january 1993 to april 2017 i e including all the data available to date as a result iv a hysteresis loop surprisingly similar to a typical loop emerging from model simulations is identified in the altimeter data during 1998 2006 and partly during 2006 2011 the hypothesis of a lfv controlled by intrinsic oceanic mechanisms during those intervals is therefore supported the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the ocean model the altimeter data set and the composite ke index are presented section 3 is devoted to the numerical simulations sensitivity numerical experiments are presented and a typical hysteresis loop emerging from the model is discussed with specific reference to four distinct phases section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the altimeter data and to their comparison with model results an interval ranging from january 1998 to march 2006 is identified thanks to the composite index that is consistent with the modelled loop a detailed discussion based on ssh maps confirms the hypothesis further discussion on the self sustained vs excited character of the loop is contained in the same section finally in section 5 further discussion on the modelling strategies aimed at identifying the oceanic intrinsic variability are presented and conclusions are drawn 2 model data and methodology 2 1 the ocean model the ocean model is the same used in pierini 2006 it is based on the nonlinear reduced gravity primitive equations describing the dynamics of a surface active layer superimposed on a much deeper quiescent lower layer 1a u t u u f k u g η τ ρ h a h 2 u γ u u 1b η t h u 0 where u u v 0 is the vertically averaged horizontal velocity in the upper active layer η is the positive downward interface displacement h d η is the upper layer thickness where d 500 m is the undisturbed layer thickness k 0 0 1 τ τ1 y 0 0 g gδρ ρ 0 045 m s 2 is the reduced gravity and f is the coriolis parameter γ 5 10 4 m 1 is the interfacial friction coefficient and ah is the lateral eddy viscosity coefficient the positive upward ssh η can be obtained by the relation η η δ ρ ρ the horizontal grid steps are δx δy 20 km and the temporal step is δt 20min fig 1 shows the domain of integration and the curl of the time independent zonal wind forcing τ1 y fig 2 shows an example of instantaneous ssh field obtained with ah 210 m2 s 1 see section 3 1 pierini 2008 discusses the crucial role played by the north western coastline and by the zonal extension of the domain on the degree of realism of the ocean response the same model was used to analyse the excitation of the ke lfv by and the synchronization with a time dependent forcing pierini 2010 2014a and in predictability studies of the ke transition processes kramer et al 2012 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the model 1a b is obviously baroclinic e g baroclinic mesoscale eddies are produced cfr pierini 2006 baroclinic rossby waves shape the transient broad scale ocean response cf pierini 2014a 2015 but baroclinic instability is lacking as it needs at least two active layers to allow for the available potential energy kinetic energy conversion on the other hand barotropic instability is obviously included on the other hand by using both altimeter data and gridded temperature and salinity fields based on argo data wang et al 2016 concluded that baroclinic instability is not the dominant mechanism controlling the ke lfv while barotropic instability makes a positive contribution to the decadal modulation of the jet in addition yang et al 2017 recognized that the decadal modulation of the ke is mainly controlled by the barotropic instability of the background flow the choice of the reduced gravity approximation 1a b appears therefore to be fully justified in a numerical process study of the ke lfv finally it is worth stressing that layer models can in principle simulate extremely sharp fronts such as the ke jet much better than the more sophisticated sigma coordinate general circulation models e g kantha and clayson 2000 2 2 the altimeter data set we investigate the ke lfv through the global absolute dynamic topography adt data set provided by the ssalto duacs multimission altimeter products distributed by aviso with support from the centre national d études spatiales cnes the data covering the period january 1993 april 2017 thus including all the data available to date are gridded calibrated and validated through a crosscheck with mean sea level anomalies derived from in situ argo t s data profiles and grace grgs v2 data the first data set is representative of the steric elevation associated with the thermohaline expansion of the water column from the surface to 900 dbar while the second is used to estimate the mass contribution to the water column the data used for this study are of delayed time kind obtained from several altimeter missions such as topex poseidon ers 1 2 jason 1 2 geosat follow on gfo envisat saral altika this choice insures the best temporal sampling and accuracy in the measurements of the elevation of the sea surface the adt includes geophysical and instrumental corrections tidal inverse barometer drift of the oscillators carried by the satellite and represents the ssh above the geoid obtained by adding the sea level anomalies on the mean dynamic topography computed over the period 1993 2013 thus the ssh η λ ϕ is basically the stream function of the surface geostrophic current we have used the duacs 2014 products first released by aviso in 2014 which include several significant upgrades e g a better temporal and spatial resolutions 1 day and 1 4 on a cartesian grid compared with the previous ones 1 week and 1 3 on a mercator grid a better orbital and processing accuracy and a more refined geoid goce dir r4 finally we have processed the adt data set by means of the basic radar altimetry toolbox brat distributed by the european space agency esa and the cnes 2 3 the composite ke index in a recent process model study pierini 2015 used lke modified through the application of the wavelet transform and φ in combination to represent the modelled ke lfv as an orbit on a two dimensional plane in the present study we will adopt the same methodology for both model and altimeter data the first step requires the computation of lke t and φ t following pierini 2006 2014a this will be done by computing the length and mean latitude of a reference isoline defined in section 3 1 for model data and in section 4 1 for altimeter data within the upstream ke range 141 e 153 e used by qiu and chen 2010 which at the ke latitude corresponds to x 18 28 100 km of the model domain of fig 1 episodes of hfv evidenced in lke computed with altimeter data are recognized by qiu and chen 2010 to represent the most significant information provided by that time series they correspond to a strong mesoscale eddy field accompanied by the formation of the so called elongated state characterized by two well defined and weakly variable anticyclonic meanders to effectively extract this information from lke following pierini 2015 we compute the wavelet amplitude w s t e g torrence and compo 1998 s is the temporal scale of lke t and integrate its modulus over a high frequency range 2 l s 0 t 0 s 0 w s t d s where the maximum temporal scale s 0 is chosen as s 0 1 year and a moving average ft with t 1 year is finally applied to both l s 0 and φ to obtain 3 λ f t l s 0 φ f t φ the composite ke index is thus given by λ φ the choice of the annual period for s 0 in 2 is now discussed pierini 2015 introduced λ to describe the slow changes of the ke hfv associated with the mesoscale eddy field which during a specific stage of the ke evolution called phase 2 in sections 3 2 and 4 2 below feeds the ke jet through an inverse energy cascade typical of two dimensional turbulence e g vallis 2006 the inverse relationship between the eddy kinetic energy and the strength of a western boundary current extension is in fact an important oceanographic phenomenon first found to be acting in the ke by qiu and chen 2005 see also yang et al 2017 now the oceanic mesoscale at midlatitudes is well known to yield time scales ranging from few weeks to few months for example in their eddy resolving global ocean sea ice model simulations sérazin et al 2018 have shown that in the midlatitude north pacific eddies with time scales shorter than 0 3 0 4 year continually lose kinetic energy feeding motions with longer time scales moreover the frequency spectrum of kinetic energy yields a maximum at t 0 8 year except for a sharp peak at the annual period thus our choice s 0 1 year is appropriate simple and better justified than the 800 day threshold adopted by pierini 2015 3 numerical simulations 3 1 sensitivity numerical experiments pierini et al 2009 obtained a bifurcation diagram fig 4 therein in which the range of variability of the kinetic energy per unit mass ea integrated in sector a shown in fig 1 is plotted as a function of ah for ah a h1 400 m2 s 1 the response is steady whereas periodic oscillations appear for smaller values thus in the language of dynamical systems theory a h1 corresponds to a hopf bifurcation as ah decreases the range of variability of ea increases until a local transition to chaos occurs beginning from a h 255 m 2 s 1 finally for a h2 235 m2 s 1 a dramatic change in the system associated with a global bifurcation occurs for ah a h2 the fluctuations depart only slightly from an unstable fixed point as shown for example in fig 3 b for ah 240 m2 s 1 by the probability density function pdf of localization of the modelled ke orbit in the eb ea plane eb is the kinetic energy integrated in sector b of fig 1 a very small decrease of ah e g for ah a h2 fig 3a leads to the collapse of the pdf and to the occurrence of chaotic self sustained relaxation oscillations ros following a terminology introduced by van der pol 1926 see also ginoux and letellier 2012 that are similar to some features of the observed ke lfv cfr pierini 2006 a further reduction of ah does not affect substantially the structure of the ro but new attractors appear in phase space that can make the evolution of the autonomous system quite complex see pierini et al 2009 for details bearing this in mind fig 4 shows the time series of ea for the simulation s0 table 1 with initialization from rest and ah 240 m2 s 1 the two large amplitude episodes emerging before t 30 year correspond to ke like ro but do not contribute to the pdf of fig 3b because the latter is computed from the asymptotic evolution only for t 30 year the orbit in phase space is attracted by an unrealistic small amplitude low energy limit cycle this is a clear example of the extremely complex and intricate character of the nonlinear dynamics pierini 2014a showed that for s0 a suitable time dependent wind forcing can nonetheless excite the ro which is structured in phase space even before the global bifurcation see section 4 3 for a discussion of this point to explore different model behaviours with the aim of identifying a ro comparable to observations four simulations are carried out differing only for the value of ah chosen within a restricted range about a h2 ah 210 220 230 240 m2 s 1 these simulations s1 4 see table 1 are initialized from the state obtained at t 80 year from s0 so that the spinup is almost immediate in fig 5 we begin by characterizing s1 4 through their ea time series this approach was shown by pierini 2006 to provide useful information about the ke evolution the case ah 240 m2 s 1 s1 black line is simply the prosecution of s0 for ah 230 m2 s 1 s2 cyan line the system switches chaotically between a low energy state similar to that of s1 and the ro two oscillations emerge in the 70 year long time series in the remaining two cases s3 4 green and magenta lines the ros are continuously self sustained ah 220 m2 s 1 corresponds to the reference case of pierini 2006 in the case ah 210 m2 s 1 s4 two anomalously energetic ros emerge during t 112 135 year it is worth noting that similar oscillations appear during the transient response in the corresponding simulation initialized from rest cf pierini 2006 and fig 7a therein but in that case the following evolution is attracted by a very low energy limit cycle this is another example of the extreme complexity and sensitivity of model behaviour typical of highly nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems the parameters lke and φ fig 6 λ and φ fig 7 and λ φ fig 8 are computed for each simulation for the reference isoline η 0 15 m the same adopted in pierini 2015 fig 2 shows that such value is the optimal choice for the ke jet axis the different range of variability of λ in pierini 2015 is due to a normalization used in that study that is now absent the substantially different character of the evolution between for example s1 ah a h2 and s4 ah a h2 already evident in fig 5 appears clearly also in these new indices a succession of clockwise loops with a time scale of 7 8 year emerges in the orbits in the λ φ plane shown in fig 8 which effectively summarizes the four simulations the range of variability of λ changes from 50 λ 300 in s3 and s4 apart from two more extended loops in s4 to 0 λ 200 in s1 and s2 while the range of variability of φ changes from 33 5 φ 35 in s3 and s4 again apart for the two large loops in s4 to 33 5 φ 34 5 in s1 and s2 now we examine two typical loops one with ah a h2 s1 and one with ah a h2 s4 in s1 the system is virtually periodic cf figs 6d d 7d 8d in fig 9 a the loop ranging from t 81 year to t 89 year is reported while in figs 9b i eight consecutive instantaneous ssh maps in the ke region are reported they show that the system fluctuates about a weak jet state resembling what is usually referred to as the contracted ke state qiu 2002 e g see phase 1 of fig 16 below the two strong anticyclonic crests of the ke that are typical of the elongated state qiu 2002 e g see phase 3 of fig 16 are never obtained thus simulation s1 produces a totally unrealistic ke lfv the loop of simulation s4 deserves a more thorough discussion 3 2 discussion of a hysteresis loop in s4 the system is chaotic cf figs 6a a 7a 8a and is characterized by a much larger variability than in s1 in fig 10 a a reference loop ranging from t 97 year to t 104 year see the dashed lines in fig 7a is reported while in figs 10b h seven consecutive instantaneous ssh maps in the ke region are shown the four phases characterizing the self sustained ro and identified with different colours in the orbit will now be discussed they correspond to the stages identified by pierini 2015 in a simulation in which the forcing included a time dependent component representing schematically the north pacific oscillation cfr pierini 2014a before analysing the loop it is worth stressing that the transition from one phase to the other is not precisely defined as it is based on qualitative characters of the ke evolution that do not have an exact beginning and an end for the sake of simplicity we have used annual intervals to characterize the phases with the advantage of representing each of them with one or two annually averaged ssh maps figs 10b h but a slightly different choice could as well be acceptable for example the beginning of phase 2 could be shifted to the second half of year 98 and its end could be shifted to the first half of year 99 but the discussion would remain virtually unchanged on the other hand in the case of observational altimeter data section 4 2 we will have to rely on variable intervals to take account of the high complexity of the real ocean dynamics phase 1 this phase begins with a weak jet state fig 10b similar to that of s1 at t 81 year fig 9b and is followed by an increase of both the hfv λ and mean latitudinal position of the jet φ thus the jet becomes more variable more convoluted so with a longer path and more energetic fig 10c pierini 2006 suggested that the ke intensifies being fed by the flux of negative relative vorticity coming from the southern recirculation gyre this is possible because in this phase the cyclonic meander south of japan is too weak to act as a barrier as it instead occurs in phase 3 see below phase 2 in this phase the same process goes on until a maximum value of both λ and φ is achieved at t 99 5 year during this period of strong hfv λ 350 the meridionally elongated anticyclonic meander located off the eastern coasts of japan becomes more and more energetic figs 10c d until a fully developed first crest is established fig 10e followed to the east by a weaker but well defined second crest the ke intensification begun in phase 1 continues and is now accompanied by the ejection of cold core eddies e g see sequence c of fig 6 in pierini 2006 detaching from the cyclonic meander south of japan this process is well known to occur in that location e g nishida 1982 qiu and miao 2000 which is now meridionally elongated the intensification of a weak ke jet while the mesoscale hfv is stronger see section 2 3 is counterintuitive but as we will see in section 4 2 it does occur in the real ocean phase 3 this phase is characterized by a persistent two meander state figs 10e f accompanied by a remarkable decrease of the hfv the two anticyclonic meanders are now very strong and weakly variable this is evidenced here by the smaller and smaller values of φ and by the almost complete lack of hfv in the ke path not shown besides during this process the intensity and zonal extent of the first crest decrease slowly this can be noticed by comparing figs 10e f pierini 2006 proposes the following physical explanation for this behaviour the strong cyclonic meander isolates the southern recirculation gyre from the ke thus acting as a dynamical barrier this is because south of japan a nonlinear balance is achieved between the excess of anticyclonic relative vorticity and vorticity dissipation due to the lateral eddy viscosity therefore east of japan the ke slowly weakens because the reduced flux of negative relative vorticity can no longer balance dissipation of the free inertial jet phase 4 this phase begins with a rapid transition to a state in which the two crests vanish fig 10g as a consequence of the erosion of the ke jet initiated in phase 3 from now on the jet can again be fed by the vorticity flux this produces already at t 103 year the formation of a weak anticyclonic meander which evolves at t 104 year into a state not shown that is virtually indistinguishable from that at t 97 year when the loop has begun in the next section we will see that this hysteresis loop has a close counterpart in the real ke evolution as documented by the altimeter data during a specific time interval 4 model data comparison 4 1 the composite ke index computed with altimeter data an example of duacs 2014 adt data used in this study is given in fig 11 where the map of η λ ϕ averaged over the 47th week of year 2015 in the region 25 50 n 130 165 e is reported the thick black line corresponding to the η 0 9 m isoline represents the ke jet axis for this data set and is therefore chosen as the reference isoline for the computation of λ and φ section 2 3 with the aviso altimeter data set the first step for the computation of λ φ requires the determination of φ t and lke t these are shown in figs 12 a b respectively these graphs ranging from january 1993 to april 2017 can be compared with those limited to december 2012 obtained by qiu et al 2014 see fig 3a and c therein it is worth noting that the small differences in lke between the two graphs are due to the different aviso data sets used see section 2 2 while the differences in φ are also due to the different longitudinal range used in the two computations in qiu et al 2014 the average was performed from 141 e to 158 e whereas we have preferred to use for φ the same range 141 e 153 e adopted for lke fig 12c shows the map of the wavelet amplitude w s t of lke t from which λ is computed according to 2 3 with the same s 0 and t used for model data λ and φ thus computed are shown in fig 13 the corresponding orbit in the λ φ plane split into four consecutive time intervals is reported in fig 14 two virtually closed loops are present in the altimeter data one in 1994 1998 fig 14a in this case λ and φ are mostly anti correlated i e the ke jet is more southerly oriented when it is more variable and vice versa and the other in 1998 2006 fig 14b in the first loop however the evolution is anticlockwise in the λ φ plane while in the second loop the evolution is clockwise like in the simulated one of fig 10 besides also the shape and range of variability of λ and φ are roughly similar to those of the simulated loop in s4 this justifies the following detailed analysis of the loop of fig 14b we will see that such similarity goes well beyond those two parameters the real loop can in fact be divided into four phases during which the ke behaviour shares surprising similarities with the corresponding modelled phases 4 2 discussion of the loop ranging from january 1998 to march 2006 we begin by providing a more detailed comparison between the simulated loop and the altimeter derived one in terms of λ and φ by showing in fig 15 the time series of these two parameters already reported in fig 7a for model data and in fig 13 for altimeter data limited to the time intervals under investigation moreover in fig 16 a the loop of fig 14b is decomposed into four phases whose detailed analysis and model data comparison will now be presented in such a comparison we should bear in mind that we are comparing an extremely complex oceanographic phenomenon with the results of a very idealized model forced by a schematic and most important time independent wind forcing thus the inconsistencies that emerge should be considered in such perspective phase 1 this phase lasts roughly one year 1998 the corresponding annual average is shown in fig 16b the ke starts from a weak jet of minimum mean kinetic energy the subsequent evolution yields a more and more intense mesoscale eddy field and hfv with λ passing from λ 155 to λ 280 leading to an increasingly convoluted jet figs 17 a d show the first part of this transition shifting to the north with φ passing from φ 34 9 to φ 35 4 the final state of this phase not shown is very similar to the yearly average of 1999 fig 16c in turn by comparing fig 10b with fig 16b and fig 10c with fig 16c significant model data comparison emerges for phase 1 phase 2 this phase lasts roughly three years the corresponding annual averages are shown in figs 16c e the hfv and mean latitudinal position attain their maximum in mid 1999 with λ 310 and φ 36 respectively the eddy field in the ke region is initially very strong so the jet is very convoluted but then it weakens in time with λ passing from λ 310 to λ 200 at the same time the ke jet becomes more and more intense as shown by the three annual averages 1999 2001 in fig 16 the four successive weekly averages of figs 17e h show a more intense ke jet compared with the previous 1998 sequence and a complex and energetic mesoscale eddy field well representative of this phase thus the intensification of the ke jet occurring while the hfv is stronger observed in phase 2 of the model simulation corresponds quite well with what emerges from altimeter data in the same phase this counterintuitive inverse relationship between the eddy kinetic energy and the ke strength was recently analysed by yang et al 2017 through a time varying energetics diagnostic methodology applied to the estimating the circulation and climate of the ocean ecco phase ii ke data and it was shown to be mainly controlled by barotropic instability processes finally the blue line in fig 16a shows that in the final stage of phase 2 φ displays an oscillation that ends at the beginning of 2002 this sub loop can be traced in the time series of φ in fig 12a from 2001 to 2002 and is likely due to local air sea interactions absent in the model phase 3 in this phase lasting 3 5 years a persistent two meander ke state is present like in phase 3 of the model simulation the maps of fig 16f h show two energetic and well defined anticyclonic meanders whose hfv is very weak e g as shown in the four week sequence of figs 17i l and by the low values of λ which reaches its minimum during 2003 2004 λ 100 this stage of the evolution was denoted as stable by qiu and chen 2005 2010 to stress the weak variability of the ke as for the final part of the phase the 1 month sequence of figs 17m p shows the progressive erosion of the two anticyclonic meanders occurring while the cyclonic meander south of japan assumes the so called typical large meander path e g kawabe 1995 see also the semiannual average of fig 16i thus both the stable two meander state and the final weakening of the ke associated with a strong cyclonic meander south of japan produced by the numerical simulation in phase 3 are also present in the corresponding phase of the altimeter data phase 4 in this last phase the complete erosion of the two main crests is accompanied by a non large meander path e g kawabe 1995 of the cyclonic circulation south of japan figs 16j k leading eventually to the reestablishment a weak jet state fig 16l similar to the one from which the loop began fig 16b thus once more the numerical simulation of phase 4 is in substantial agreement with the observations for the corresponding phase in conclusion the significant model data comparison just presented suggests that during the interval 1998 2006 25 the ke dynamics may have been controlled by an intrinsic mode of lfv such as that described in section 3 2 this positive comparison would in turn imply that the directly driven dynamics and or ocean atmosphere coupled modes of variability e g qiu et al 2014 did not overshadow the intrinsic dynamics during that period it is also worth stressing that the different duration of each phase in the altimeter and model data is inherent of the highly idealized model setting and does not affect the significance of the model data comparison moreover while the ranges of variability of λ in the altimeter and model data are comparable the mean ke latitude φ varies in the range 33 5 35 in the model data while it is more northerly oriented by 1 in the altimeter data varying in the range 34 9 36 this mismatch is acceptable as well in consideration of the idealized nature of the western coastlines and of the climatological wind forcing fig 1 which is even chosen as longitude independent 4 3 self sustained vs excited relaxation oscillations we have already mentioned in section 3 1 that the same ro that is self sustained beyond the tipping point ah a h2 can emerge even if the system is set before that threshold provided it is excited by a suitable time dependent forcing in other terms the ros can be either self sustained for ah a h2 or excited for ah a h2 pierini 2014a relied on this property to propose a mechanism that could explain the synchronization of the ke lfv observed by qiu and chen 2010 while still retaining the intrinsic character of the dynamics according to that model study the mechanism of synchronization can be summarized as follows 1 the system is set to be excitable i e ah a h2 e g ah 240 m 2 s 1 like in s1 the ke is initially in a weak jet state e g as that of fig 5 s1 black line that would persist indefinitely under time independent climatological forcing 2 phase 1 i e a rapid increase of the hfv is triggered by the arrival in the ke region of negative ssh anomalies carried by rossby waves and generated in the central and eastern north pacific by a suitable time dependent atmospheric mode of variability 3 the subsequent evolution is determined by the intrinsic ro and is virtually independent of the time dependent forcing if we now examine the time longitude plot of the ssh anomalies reported in fig 18 we can see that at the beginning of 1998 when the loop began the anomalies are mainly negative in the ke region but the same occurred also years in advance thus according to the theoretical framework just described the loop discussed in section 4 2 was not remotely excited and can therefore be considered as self sustained as it is indeed the case in the simulation discussed in the present study this amounts to saying that the intrinsic mode of variability was triggered by internal oceanic variability not directly induced by the atmosphere on the contrary the rapid increase in λ evidenced in fig 14c starting from 2006 corresponds to a largely negative ssh anomaly in the ke region beginning just during that year i e fig 18 this is consistent with the excitation mechanism to this respect in order to test the validity of the ke index 3 pierini 2015 analysed the intrinsic model loop excited by the time dependent forcing of pierini 2014a starting from year 2006 we take advantage of the altimeter derived index now available to reconsider the problem the ke evolution of fig 14c is again reported in fig 19 a the initial weak jet state coinciding with fig 16l is followed by a rapid increase of λ by a highly variable and convoluted jet and eventually by the formation of a two meander state this is compatible with phases 1 2 and 3 but important differences with respect to the hysteresis loop are present as well the line in fig 19a is dashed to stress the difference in particular at the beginning of phase 2 the first anticyclonic meander is strong and meridionally elongated in 1999 fig 16c while it is now weaker and less elongated fig 19c moreover the route to the strong two meander state is through a notable increase of φ which is connected with the absence of phase 4 thus the intrinsic mode of lfv discussed in this study appears to have been in fact excited at the beginning of year 2006 but other effects not included in the model see section 5 have affected the subsequent global evolution 5 further discussion and conclusions modelling ocean dynamics is necessary to recognize oceanic intrinsic lfv in this regard several modelling strategies can be followed in the framework of sufficiently realistic simulations i an ogcm can be forced by realistic atmospheric forcing and by the corresponding climatological annual cycle by comparing these two simulations one can isolate the low frequency variability of intrinsic origin from that directly forced by the atmosphere e g as done by penduff et al 2011 nonaka et al 2012 and sérazin et al 2016 ii few hindcasts can be performed with an ogcm under the same realistic atmospheric forcing but with slightly different initial conditions e g cfr nonaka et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 nonaka et al 2016 for the ke lfv since the intrinsic variability is typically chaotic yielding therefore extreme dependence on initialization modes of variability appearing with different phases in the simulations will be identified as intrinsic iii if the strategy ii is extended to a large number of hindcasts a statistical approach can be followed the forced and intrinsic variabilities can thus be estimated through the ensemble mean and spread respectively e g bessières et al 2017 sérazin et al 2017 and leroux et al 2018 followed this methodology with a 50 member ensemble of global eddy permitting nemo simulations naturally the extremely high computational cost of these simulations do not allow one to perform sensitivity numerical experiments iv another modelling approach based on model data comparison is that of extending the classical extremely idealized double gyre problem of the ocean circulation driven by time independent winds e g dijkstra and ghil 2005 ghil 2017 to models that are simplified and are therefore still much less computer expensive than ogcms so that sensitivity studies can be carried out but that at the same time include sufficient elements of realism so as to allow for some form of model data comparison intrinsic processes can thus be disentangled from the observational data typically altimeter data if modelled modes of variability which in this case are necessarily intrinsic are found to compare well with real oceanic processes the possibility of analysing model sensitivity to specific control parameters is fundamental because it allows one to identify various model scenarios that can be very different but are all equally admissible in principle to be compared with data on the other hand this approach can be successful only if an intrinsic process present in the real ocean is not overwhelmed by the directly forced dynamics and or by coupled ocean atmosphere modes of variability in the present paper methodology iv is successfully applied for the first time at the best of the authors knowledge the focus is on the ke lfv the eddy permitting ocean model pierini 2006 is driven by a time independent wind field and is relatively idealized but it includes essential elements of realism the aviso altimeter data set is used for model data comparison and moreover the analysis relies also on a new composite index λ φ specifically conceived for the ke pierini 2015 a set of numerical simulations has first evidenced the typical extreme sensitivity of the model response to the value of the lateral eddy viscosity coefficient ah a reference simulation s4 with ah 210 m2 s 1 has then been chosen yielding large amplitude self sustained relaxation oscillations one of these oscillations has been studied in detail and has been characterized by four phases each one being controlled by a specific dynamical mechanism an interval has then been identified in the altimeter derived index that resembles the model loop a detailed comparison with the model has thus been carried out with the help of ssh maps the observed loop ranging from january 1998 to march 2006 is found to possess four phases each one characterized by a dynamical behaviour that is very similar to that recognized in the corresponding phase of the model loop the natural conclusion is that during that interval the ke dynamics may have been controlled by an intrinsic mode of lfv such as that obtained by the model and that the directly driven dynamics and or ocean atmosphere coupled modes of variability were not so strong as to overshadow the intrinsic evolution the self sustained vs excited character of the relaxation oscillation has been finally discussed also in direct connection with the variability observed from 2006 to 2011 in the analysis a central role is played by the new composite index as a matter of fact the ke lfv is found to provide a nice example of an extremely complex oceanographic phenomenon yielding a simple behaviour even comparable with a simplified ocean model if described through the index λ φ in general despite the huge complexity of the climate system fundamental aspects of climate variability reveal amazingly simple behaviors if data analyses are performed through suitable climate indices e g stocker et al 2013 section 2 7 8 in a paleoclimate context some impressive examples are provided by the main fluctuations over the pleistocene such as the glacial interglacial transitions and the dansgaard oeschger warming events e g shackleton et al 1984 johnsen et al 1992 dansgaard et al 1993 ganopolski and rahmstorf 2001 crucifix 2012 in these cases the available proxies are expressed in terms of parameters that appear to be themselves ideal indices to describe the gross features of the phenomena however in general a suitable choice of the indices can be crucial to identify notable features of the climate processes under investigation that could otherwise remain unnoticed our index has successfully fulfilled this task for the ke another relevant result of this study in line with pierini 2006 and pierini et al 2009 is the demonstration of the extreme sensitivity of the lfv of a strong frontal jet well known in the literature on idealized double gyre modelling in a realistic context in which direct comparison with altimeter data is carried out if ah is increased by just 14 passing from s4 to s1 the modelled loop loses all the dynamical features that are found to compare well with the observed loop becoming completely unrealistic this suggests that much caution should be taken when interpreting results of ogcms concerning frontal processes such as western boundary current low frequency fluctuations future perspectives include an analysis of the oceanic intrinsic ke lfv identified by the modelling strategies i iii can intrinsic ke loops similar to that of fig 10 be recognized in a more realistic modelling setup the three member ensemble simulations of zhang et al 2015 and nonaka et al 2016 appear to already provide a positive answer to this question another important aspect that should be investigated is the cause of the very complex ke behaviour in connection of the possible existence of oceanic intrinsic ke lfv why is the ke evolution so profoundly different in the four intervals of fig 14 several recent studies e g kelly et al 2010 putrasahan et al 2013 tsujino et al 2013 qiu et al 2014 o reilly and czaja 2015 wang et al 2016 ma et al 2016 have shown that local air sea interactions and feedbacks mesoscale eddy dynamics and wind variability can strongly affect the ke state so that intrinsic ocean modes of lfv variability if potentially present can be substantially modified by those effects this might have occurred in the intervals of figs 14a c d this is an intriguing and subtle problem whose investigation will require a thorough analysis of the atmospheric forcing of the local air sea interactions and of ke observations further eddy resolving ocean only and coupled ocean atmosphere general circulation model studies and sensitivity numerical experiments will be necessary to interpret the phenomena studies of this kind will also bring further insight into the predictability of the ke evolution e g nonaka et al 2012 kramer et al 2012 qiu et al 2014 wang et al 2017 which depends crucially on the capability of the ocean system to produce intrinsic modes of lfv and on the mechanisms that produce their onset e g nonaka et al 2012 pierini 2014a in this context multi member ensemble hindcast simulations such as those quoted in the modelling strategy iii will also be required theoretical modelling studies based on low order ocean models and relying on the combined use of ensemble simulations and pullback attractors e g pierini 2014b ghil 2017 drótos et al 2015 2017 pierini et al 2016 will also turn out to be valuable in suggesting new modelling strategies that could not be tested with primitive equation ocean models due to their prohibitive computational cost finally although the combined ke index λ φ was constructed in the framework of a model process study pierini 2015 its application to altimeter data has proved useful and appropriate this in turn suggests that the same index could as well be a powerful tool to characterize and monitor the ke lfv in eddy

24076,in this paper the combined use of model simulations and altimeter data suggests that during the interval 1998 2006 the kuroshio extension ke low frequency variability was mainly of intrinsic origin the model is based on the primitive equations for a reduced gravity ocean is eddy permitting and relatively idealized but it includes essential elements of realism and is driven by a time independent climatological wind field so that the modelled variability is necessarily of intrinsic oceanic origin the altimeter data are provided by aviso and include all the data available to date a new composite index λ φ specifically conceived for the ke is used in the analysis of both model and altimeter data φ gives the mean latitudinal position of the ke jet and λ is a measure of the high frequency variability of the ke path a set of sensitivity numerical experiments shows that the frontal dynamics is extremely sensitive to the horizontal eddy viscosity a self sustained relaxation oscillation emerging from a reference simulation is represented by a loop in the λ φ plane and is characterized by four phases each one being controlled by a specific dynamical mechanism an interval ranging from january 1998 to march 2006 is identified in the altimeter data during which the altimeter derived index is very similar to the modelled one a detailed analysis based also on sea surface height maps shows that the real ke evolution possesses four phases characterized by basically the same dynamical behaviour recognized in the model loop the conclusion is that during that interval the ke dynamics was controlled by an oceanic intrinsic mode of low frequency variability and that the directly driven dynamics and ocean atmosphere coupled modes of variability did not overshadow the intrinsic evolution the self sustained vs excited character of the relaxation oscillation is finally discussed keywords ocean modelling altimeter data kuroshio extension climate indices intrinsic low frequency variability 1 introduction one of the main tasks of ocean modelling in the current climate change research is to distinguish the natural variability intrinsic intrinsic variability in short to the ocean system from the ocean variability directly forced by the atmosphere or due to coupled ocean atmosphere mechanisms understanding this distinction is important not only from a merely cognitive viewpoint but also in a climate prediction perspective since the intrinsic ocean variability is typically chaotic and can therefore affect the overall predictability of the climate system considerably the role of ocean modelling is fundamental to this respect because it allows one to isolate the ocean system from the global climate and to analyse its response under different forcing agents the analysis of the oceanic intrinsic low frequency variability lfv occurring on the interannual to decadal time scales focused in the last two decades mainly on western boundary current extensions wbces and was carried out through a variety of model studies in the framework of the so called double gyre problem of the wind driven ocean circulation e g see dijkstra and ghil 2005 dijkstra 2005 ghil 2017 for reviews the approaches range from extremely idealized low order models to coarse resolution eddy permitting or even eddy resolving quasigeostrophic or primitive equation layer models with different degrees of idealization in the implementation most models are forced by atmospheric forcing deprived of any low frequency time dependence so that the obtained ocean variability is necessarily intrinsic more recently time dependent forcing has been used to explore new and more advanced aspects of the problem e g pierini et al 2016 ghil 2017 the most notable results are that the ocean is indeed capable of producing highly nonlinear intrinsic wbce fluctuations and that these are extremely sensitive to the model implementation and to the values of some control parameters to disentangle the extreme complexity of the phenomena the use of concepts and methods of nonlinear dynamical systems theory has proved fundamental dijkstra 2005 ghil 2015 besides wbces the intrinsic variabilities of the global ocean are now being systematically studied by means of high resolution ocean general circulation models ogcms e g penduff et al 2011 2014 zhang et al 2015 nonaka et al 2016 bessières et al 2017 leroux et al 2018 etc the validation of any theory of the intrinsic ocean variability relies heavily on satellite altimetry which provides a regular and synoptic mapping of the sea surface height ssh from which surface geostrophic currents can be derived e g stammer and cazenave 2018 among the wbces the kuroshio extension ke in the north pacific is the jet displaying the most dramatic and fascinating lfv whose structure latitudinal location and associated mesoscale eddy field exhibit very strong and complex changes over the decadal time scale that affect the climate of vast areas e g qiu 2000 2002 kelly et al 2010 kwon et al 2010 the ke lfv was therefore analysed through satellite altimeter measurements already with geosat e g tai and white 1990 qiu et al 1991 le traon 1992 jacobs et al 1996 mitchell et al 1996 and later on with topex poseidon ers 1 2 and more recent altimeter missions e g sainz trapaga et al 2001 qiu 2002 qiu and chen 2005 2010 jayne et al 2009 bessières et al 2013 qiu et al 2014 the possibility that the ke lfv be at least in part intrinsic has been suggested by several model studies that were sufficiently realistic to allow for some form of model data comparison e g schmeits and dijkstra 2001 pierini 2006 taguchi et al 2007 pierini et al 2009 pierini and dijkstra 2009 zhang et al 2015 nonaka et al 2016 see pierini et al 2014 for a review pierini 2006 and pierini et al 2009 used two indices proposed by qiu and chen 2005 namely the length of the ke axis lke and mean latitudinal position φ of the same axis to compare their model results with altimeter data the parameter lke was also used by qiu and chen 2010 qiu et al 2014 pierini 2014a and zhang et al 2015 to characterize the ke evolution such model data comparison suggested a relevant role of nonlinear intrinsic mechanisms in the ke lfv a more robust description of the ke lfv was proposed by pierini 2015 in the framework of a model study by introducing a composite dynamic index λ φ φ gives the low passed filtered mean latitudinal position of the ke jet and λ is a parameter measuring the high frequency variability hfv of the ke path obtained by integrating over a high frequency range the wavelet amplitude of lke it is worth stressing that the variations of the high frequency eddy kinetic energy level associated with mesoscale eddies in the upstream ke region is recognized to be one of the main aspects of the ke lfv the composite index λ φ was therefore suggested to provide an efficient and unequivocal characterization of the ke lfv in terms of an orbit in the λ φ plane the study of pierini 2015 has however four main limitations i the composite index was computed only for a single reference simulation ii it was computed for a single oscillation and iii it was not computed with altimeter data so that model validation was not possible and therefore iv it was not possible to detect precise intervals during which the observed ke lfv could possibly be related to model results in the present study these four limitations are overcome i four sensitivity experiments with different values of the lateral eddy viscosity coefficient ah are carried out with the model of pierini 2006 forced by steady climatological winds unlike in pierini 2015 in which a time dependent wind component was present so that the intrinsic nature of the model response is now even more evident λ φ is then computed for each simulation ii the index is computed for a 70 years interval which includes several oscillations iii the same index is now evaluated also with the altimeter data distributed by archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data aviso from january 1993 to april 2017 i e including all the data available to date as a result iv a hysteresis loop surprisingly similar to a typical loop emerging from model simulations is identified in the altimeter data during 1998 2006 and partly during 2006 2011 the hypothesis of a lfv controlled by intrinsic oceanic mechanisms during those intervals is therefore supported the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the ocean model the altimeter data set and the composite ke index are presented section 3 is devoted to the numerical simulations sensitivity numerical experiments are presented and a typical hysteresis loop emerging from the model is discussed with specific reference to four distinct phases section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the altimeter data and to their comparison with model results an interval ranging from january 1998 to march 2006 is identified thanks to the composite index that is consistent with the modelled loop a detailed discussion based on ssh maps confirms the hypothesis further discussion on the self sustained vs excited character of the loop is contained in the same section finally in section 5 further discussion on the modelling strategies aimed at identifying the oceanic intrinsic variability are presented and conclusions are drawn 2 model data and methodology 2 1 the ocean model the ocean model is the same used in pierini 2006 it is based on the nonlinear reduced gravity primitive equations describing the dynamics of a surface active layer superimposed on a much deeper quiescent lower layer 1a u t u u f k u g η τ ρ h a h 2 u γ u u 1b η t h u 0 where u u v 0 is the vertically averaged horizontal velocity in the upper active layer η is the positive downward interface displacement h d η is the upper layer thickness where d 500 m is the undisturbed layer thickness k 0 0 1 τ τ1 y 0 0 g gδρ ρ 0 045 m s 2 is the reduced gravity and f is the coriolis parameter γ 5 10 4 m 1 is the interfacial friction coefficient and ah is the lateral eddy viscosity coefficient the positive upward ssh η can be obtained by the relation η η δ ρ ρ the horizontal grid steps are δx δy 20 km and the temporal step is δt 20min fig 1 shows the domain of integration and the curl of the time independent zonal wind forcing τ1 y fig 2 shows an example of instantaneous ssh field obtained with ah 210 m2 s 1 see section 3 1 pierini 2008 discusses the crucial role played by the north western coastline and by the zonal extension of the domain on the degree of realism of the ocean response the same model was used to analyse the excitation of the ke lfv by and the synchronization with a time dependent forcing pierini 2010 2014a and in predictability studies of the ke transition processes kramer et al 2012 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the model 1a b is obviously baroclinic e g baroclinic mesoscale eddies are produced cfr pierini 2006 baroclinic rossby waves shape the transient broad scale ocean response cf pierini 2014a 2015 but baroclinic instability is lacking as it needs at least two active layers to allow for the available potential energy kinetic energy conversion on the other hand barotropic instability is obviously included on the other hand by using both altimeter data and gridded temperature and salinity fields based on argo data wang et al 2016 concluded that baroclinic instability is not the dominant mechanism controlling the ke lfv while barotropic instability makes a positive contribution to the decadal modulation of the jet in addition yang et al 2017 recognized that the decadal modulation of the ke is mainly controlled by the barotropic instability of the background flow the choice of the reduced gravity approximation 1a b appears therefore to be fully justified in a numerical process study of the ke lfv finally it is worth stressing that layer models can in principle simulate extremely sharp fronts such as the ke jet much better than the more sophisticated sigma coordinate general circulation models e g kantha and clayson 2000 2 2 the altimeter data set we investigate the ke lfv through the global absolute dynamic topography adt data set provided by the ssalto duacs multimission altimeter products distributed by aviso with support from the centre national d études spatiales cnes the data covering the period january 1993 april 2017 thus including all the data available to date are gridded calibrated and validated through a crosscheck with mean sea level anomalies derived from in situ argo t s data profiles and grace grgs v2 data the first data set is representative of the steric elevation associated with the thermohaline expansion of the water column from the surface to 900 dbar while the second is used to estimate the mass contribution to the water column the data used for this study are of delayed time kind obtained from several altimeter missions such as topex poseidon ers 1 2 jason 1 2 geosat follow on gfo envisat saral altika this choice insures the best temporal sampling and accuracy in the measurements of the elevation of the sea surface the adt includes geophysical and instrumental corrections tidal inverse barometer drift of the oscillators carried by the satellite and represents the ssh above the geoid obtained by adding the sea level anomalies on the mean dynamic topography computed over the period 1993 2013 thus the ssh η λ ϕ is basically the stream function of the surface geostrophic current we have used the duacs 2014 products first released by aviso in 2014 which include several significant upgrades e g a better temporal and spatial resolutions 1 day and 1 4 on a cartesian grid compared with the previous ones 1 week and 1 3 on a mercator grid a better orbital and processing accuracy and a more refined geoid goce dir r4 finally we have processed the adt data set by means of the basic radar altimetry toolbox brat distributed by the european space agency esa and the cnes 2 3 the composite ke index in a recent process model study pierini 2015 used lke modified through the application of the wavelet transform and φ in combination to represent the modelled ke lfv as an orbit on a two dimensional plane in the present study we will adopt the same methodology for both model and altimeter data the first step requires the computation of lke t and φ t following pierini 2006 2014a this will be done by computing the length and mean latitude of a reference isoline defined in section 3 1 for model data and in section 4 1 for altimeter data within the upstream ke range 141 e 153 e used by qiu and chen 2010 which at the ke latitude corresponds to x 18 28 100 km of the model domain of fig 1 episodes of hfv evidenced in lke computed with altimeter data are recognized by qiu and chen 2010 to represent the most significant information provided by that time series they correspond to a strong mesoscale eddy field accompanied by the formation of the so called elongated state characterized by two well defined and weakly variable anticyclonic meanders to effectively extract this information from lke following pierini 2015 we compute the wavelet amplitude w s t e g torrence and compo 1998 s is the temporal scale of lke t and integrate its modulus over a high frequency range 2 l s 0 t 0 s 0 w s t d s where the maximum temporal scale s 0 is chosen as s 0 1 year and a moving average ft with t 1 year is finally applied to both l s 0 and φ to obtain 3 λ f t l s 0 φ f t φ the composite ke index is thus given by λ φ the choice of the annual period for s 0 in 2 is now discussed pierini 2015 introduced λ to describe the slow changes of the ke hfv associated with the mesoscale eddy field which during a specific stage of the ke evolution called phase 2 in sections 3 2 and 4 2 below feeds the ke jet through an inverse energy cascade typical of two dimensional turbulence e g vallis 2006 the inverse relationship between the eddy kinetic energy and the strength of a western boundary current extension is in fact an important oceanographic phenomenon first found to be acting in the ke by qiu and chen 2005 see also yang et al 2017 now the oceanic mesoscale at midlatitudes is well known to yield time scales ranging from few weeks to few months for example in their eddy resolving global ocean sea ice model simulations sérazin et al 2018 have shown that in the midlatitude north pacific eddies with time scales shorter than 0 3 0 4 year continually lose kinetic energy feeding motions with longer time scales moreover the frequency spectrum of kinetic energy yields a maximum at t 0 8 year except for a sharp peak at the annual period thus our choice s 0 1 year is appropriate simple and better justified than the 800 day threshold adopted by pierini 2015 3 numerical simulations 3 1 sensitivity numerical experiments pierini et al 2009 obtained a bifurcation diagram fig 4 therein in which the range of variability of the kinetic energy per unit mass ea integrated in sector a shown in fig 1 is plotted as a function of ah for ah a h1 400 m2 s 1 the response is steady whereas periodic oscillations appear for smaller values thus in the language of dynamical systems theory a h1 corresponds to a hopf bifurcation as ah decreases the range of variability of ea increases until a local transition to chaos occurs beginning from a h 255 m 2 s 1 finally for a h2 235 m2 s 1 a dramatic change in the system associated with a global bifurcation occurs for ah a h2 the fluctuations depart only slightly from an unstable fixed point as shown for example in fig 3 b for ah 240 m2 s 1 by the probability density function pdf of localization of the modelled ke orbit in the eb ea plane eb is the kinetic energy integrated in sector b of fig 1 a very small decrease of ah e g for ah a h2 fig 3a leads to the collapse of the pdf and to the occurrence of chaotic self sustained relaxation oscillations ros following a terminology introduced by van der pol 1926 see also ginoux and letellier 2012 that are similar to some features of the observed ke lfv cfr pierini 2006 a further reduction of ah does not affect substantially the structure of the ro but new attractors appear in phase space that can make the evolution of the autonomous system quite complex see pierini et al 2009 for details bearing this in mind fig 4 shows the time series of ea for the simulation s0 table 1 with initialization from rest and ah 240 m2 s 1 the two large amplitude episodes emerging before t 30 year correspond to ke like ro but do not contribute to the pdf of fig 3b because the latter is computed from the asymptotic evolution only for t 30 year the orbit in phase space is attracted by an unrealistic small amplitude low energy limit cycle this is a clear example of the extremely complex and intricate character of the nonlinear dynamics pierini 2014a showed that for s0 a suitable time dependent wind forcing can nonetheless excite the ro which is structured in phase space even before the global bifurcation see section 4 3 for a discussion of this point to explore different model behaviours with the aim of identifying a ro comparable to observations four simulations are carried out differing only for the value of ah chosen within a restricted range about a h2 ah 210 220 230 240 m2 s 1 these simulations s1 4 see table 1 are initialized from the state obtained at t 80 year from s0 so that the spinup is almost immediate in fig 5 we begin by characterizing s1 4 through their ea time series this approach was shown by pierini 2006 to provide useful information about the ke evolution the case ah 240 m2 s 1 s1 black line is simply the prosecution of s0 for ah 230 m2 s 1 s2 cyan line the system switches chaotically between a low energy state similar to that of s1 and the ro two oscillations emerge in the 70 year long time series in the remaining two cases s3 4 green and magenta lines the ros are continuously self sustained ah 220 m2 s 1 corresponds to the reference case of pierini 2006 in the case ah 210 m2 s 1 s4 two anomalously energetic ros emerge during t 112 135 year it is worth noting that similar oscillations appear during the transient response in the corresponding simulation initialized from rest cf pierini 2006 and fig 7a therein but in that case the following evolution is attracted by a very low energy limit cycle this is another example of the extreme complexity and sensitivity of model behaviour typical of highly nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems the parameters lke and φ fig 6 λ and φ fig 7 and λ φ fig 8 are computed for each simulation for the reference isoline η 0 15 m the same adopted in pierini 2015 fig 2 shows that such value is the optimal choice for the ke jet axis the different range of variability of λ in pierini 2015 is due to a normalization used in that study that is now absent the substantially different character of the evolution between for example s1 ah a h2 and s4 ah a h2 already evident in fig 5 appears clearly also in these new indices a succession of clockwise loops with a time scale of 7 8 year emerges in the orbits in the λ φ plane shown in fig 8 which effectively summarizes the four simulations the range of variability of λ changes from 50 λ 300 in s3 and s4 apart from two more extended loops in s4 to 0 λ 200 in s1 and s2 while the range of variability of φ changes from 33 5 φ 35 in s3 and s4 again apart for the two large loops in s4 to 33 5 φ 34 5 in s1 and s2 now we examine two typical loops one with ah a h2 s1 and one with ah a h2 s4 in s1 the system is virtually periodic cf figs 6d d 7d 8d in fig 9 a the loop ranging from t 81 year to t 89 year is reported while in figs 9b i eight consecutive instantaneous ssh maps in the ke region are reported they show that the system fluctuates about a weak jet state resembling what is usually referred to as the contracted ke state qiu 2002 e g see phase 1 of fig 16 below the two strong anticyclonic crests of the ke that are typical of the elongated state qiu 2002 e g see phase 3 of fig 16 are never obtained thus simulation s1 produces a totally unrealistic ke lfv the loop of simulation s4 deserves a more thorough discussion 3 2 discussion of a hysteresis loop in s4 the system is chaotic cf figs 6a a 7a 8a and is characterized by a much larger variability than in s1 in fig 10 a a reference loop ranging from t 97 year to t 104 year see the dashed lines in fig 7a is reported while in figs 10b h seven consecutive instantaneous ssh maps in the ke region are shown the four phases characterizing the self sustained ro and identified with different colours in the orbit will now be discussed they correspond to the stages identified by pierini 2015 in a simulation in which the forcing included a time dependent component representing schematically the north pacific oscillation cfr pierini 2014a before analysing the loop it is worth stressing that the transition from one phase to the other is not precisely defined as it is based on qualitative characters of the ke evolution that do not have an exact beginning and an end for the sake of simplicity we have used annual intervals to characterize the phases with the advantage of representing each of them with one or two annually averaged ssh maps figs 10b h but a slightly different choice could as well be acceptable for example the beginning of phase 2 could be shifted to the second half of year 98 and its end could be shifted to the first half of year 99 but the discussion would remain virtually unchanged on the other hand in the case of observational altimeter data section 4 2 we will have to rely on variable intervals to take account of the high complexity of the real ocean dynamics phase 1 this phase begins with a weak jet state fig 10b similar to that of s1 at t 81 year fig 9b and is followed by an increase of both the hfv λ and mean latitudinal position of the jet φ thus the jet becomes more variable more convoluted so with a longer path and more energetic fig 10c pierini 2006 suggested that the ke intensifies being fed by the flux of negative relative vorticity coming from the southern recirculation gyre this is possible because in this phase the cyclonic meander south of japan is too weak to act as a barrier as it instead occurs in phase 3 see below phase 2 in this phase the same process goes on until a maximum value of both λ and φ is achieved at t 99 5 year during this period of strong hfv λ 350 the meridionally elongated anticyclonic meander located off the eastern coasts of japan becomes more and more energetic figs 10c d until a fully developed first crest is established fig 10e followed to the east by a weaker but well defined second crest the ke intensification begun in phase 1 continues and is now accompanied by the ejection of cold core eddies e g see sequence c of fig 6 in pierini 2006 detaching from the cyclonic meander south of japan this process is well known to occur in that location e g nishida 1982 qiu and miao 2000 which is now meridionally elongated the intensification of a weak ke jet while the mesoscale hfv is stronger see section 2 3 is counterintuitive but as we will see in section 4 2 it does occur in the real ocean phase 3 this phase is characterized by a persistent two meander state figs 10e f accompanied by a remarkable decrease of the hfv the two anticyclonic meanders are now very strong and weakly variable this is evidenced here by the smaller and smaller values of φ and by the almost complete lack of hfv in the ke path not shown besides during this process the intensity and zonal extent of the first crest decrease slowly this can be noticed by comparing figs 10e f pierini 2006 proposes the following physical explanation for this behaviour the strong cyclonic meander isolates the southern recirculation gyre from the ke thus acting as a dynamical barrier this is because south of japan a nonlinear balance is achieved between the excess of anticyclonic relative vorticity and vorticity dissipation due to the lateral eddy viscosity therefore east of japan the ke slowly weakens because the reduced flux of negative relative vorticity can no longer balance dissipation of the free inertial jet phase 4 this phase begins with a rapid transition to a state in which the two crests vanish fig 10g as a consequence of the erosion of the ke jet initiated in phase 3 from now on the jet can again be fed by the vorticity flux this produces already at t 103 year the formation of a weak anticyclonic meander which evolves at t 104 year into a state not shown that is virtually indistinguishable from that at t 97 year when the loop has begun in the next section we will see that this hysteresis loop has a close counterpart in the real ke evolution as documented by the altimeter data during a specific time interval 4 model data comparison 4 1 the composite ke index computed with altimeter data an example of duacs 2014 adt data used in this study is given in fig 11 where the map of η λ ϕ averaged over the 47th week of year 2015 in the region 25 50 n 130 165 e is reported the thick black line corresponding to the η 0 9 m isoline represents the ke jet axis for this data set and is therefore chosen as the reference isoline for the computation of λ and φ section 2 3 with the aviso altimeter data set the first step for the computation of λ φ requires the determination of φ t and lke t these are shown in figs 12 a b respectively these graphs ranging from january 1993 to april 2017 can be compared with those limited to december 2012 obtained by qiu et al 2014 see fig 3a and c therein it is worth noting that the small differences in lke between the two graphs are due to the different aviso data sets used see section 2 2 while the differences in φ are also due to the different longitudinal range used in the two computations in qiu et al 2014 the average was performed from 141 e to 158 e whereas we have preferred to use for φ the same range 141 e 153 e adopted for lke fig 12c shows the map of the wavelet amplitude w s t of lke t from which λ is computed according to 2 3 with the same s 0 and t used for model data λ and φ thus computed are shown in fig 13 the corresponding orbit in the λ φ plane split into four consecutive time intervals is reported in fig 14 two virtually closed loops are present in the altimeter data one in 1994 1998 fig 14a in this case λ and φ are mostly anti correlated i e the ke jet is more southerly oriented when it is more variable and vice versa and the other in 1998 2006 fig 14b in the first loop however the evolution is anticlockwise in the λ φ plane while in the second loop the evolution is clockwise like in the simulated one of fig 10 besides also the shape and range of variability of λ and φ are roughly similar to those of the simulated loop in s4 this justifies the following detailed analysis of the loop of fig 14b we will see that such similarity goes well beyond those two parameters the real loop can in fact be divided into four phases during which the ke behaviour shares surprising similarities with the corresponding modelled phases 4 2 discussion of the loop ranging from january 1998 to march 2006 we begin by providing a more detailed comparison between the simulated loop and the altimeter derived one in terms of λ and φ by showing in fig 15 the time series of these two parameters already reported in fig 7a for model data and in fig 13 for altimeter data limited to the time intervals under investigation moreover in fig 16 a the loop of fig 14b is decomposed into four phases whose detailed analysis and model data comparison will now be presented in such a comparison we should bear in mind that we are comparing an extremely complex oceanographic phenomenon with the results of a very idealized model forced by a schematic and most important time independent wind forcing thus the inconsistencies that emerge should be considered in such perspective phase 1 this phase lasts roughly one year 1998 the corresponding annual average is shown in fig 16b the ke starts from a weak jet of minimum mean kinetic energy the subsequent evolution yields a more and more intense mesoscale eddy field and hfv with λ passing from λ 155 to λ 280 leading to an increasingly convoluted jet figs 17 a d show the first part of this transition shifting to the north with φ passing from φ 34 9 to φ 35 4 the final state of this phase not shown is very similar to the yearly average of 1999 fig 16c in turn by comparing fig 10b with fig 16b and fig 10c with fig 16c significant model data comparison emerges for phase 1 phase 2 this phase lasts roughly three years the corresponding annual averages are shown in figs 16c e the hfv and mean latitudinal position attain their maximum in mid 1999 with λ 310 and φ 36 respectively the eddy field in the ke region is initially very strong so the jet is very convoluted but then it weakens in time with λ passing from λ 310 to λ 200 at the same time the ke jet becomes more and more intense as shown by the three annual averages 1999 2001 in fig 16 the four successive weekly averages of figs 17e h show a more intense ke jet compared with the previous 1998 sequence and a complex and energetic mesoscale eddy field well representative of this phase thus the intensification of the ke jet occurring while the hfv is stronger observed in phase 2 of the model simulation corresponds quite well with what emerges from altimeter data in the same phase this counterintuitive inverse relationship between the eddy kinetic energy and the ke strength was recently analysed by yang et al 2017 through a time varying energetics diagnostic methodology applied to the estimating the circulation and climate of the ocean ecco phase ii ke data and it was shown to be mainly controlled by barotropic instability processes finally the blue line in fig 16a shows that in the final stage of phase 2 φ displays an oscillation that ends at the beginning of 2002 this sub loop can be traced in the time series of φ in fig 12a from 2001 to 2002 and is likely due to local air sea interactions absent in the model phase 3 in this phase lasting 3 5 years a persistent two meander ke state is present like in phase 3 of the model simulation the maps of fig 16f h show two energetic and well defined anticyclonic meanders whose hfv is very weak e g as shown in the four week sequence of figs 17i l and by the low values of λ which reaches its minimum during 2003 2004 λ 100 this stage of the evolution was denoted as stable by qiu and chen 2005 2010 to stress the weak variability of the ke as for the final part of the phase the 1 month sequence of figs 17m p shows the progressive erosion of the two anticyclonic meanders occurring while the cyclonic meander south of japan assumes the so called typical large meander path e g kawabe 1995 see also the semiannual average of fig 16i thus both the stable two meander state and the final weakening of the ke associated with a strong cyclonic meander south of japan produced by the numerical simulation in phase 3 are also present in the corresponding phase of the altimeter data phase 4 in this last phase the complete erosion of the two main crests is accompanied by a non large meander path e g kawabe 1995 of the cyclonic circulation south of japan figs 16j k leading eventually to the reestablishment a weak jet state fig 16l similar to the one from which the loop began fig 16b thus once more the numerical simulation of phase 4 is in substantial agreement with the observations for the corresponding phase in conclusion the significant model data comparison just presented suggests that during the interval 1998 2006 25 the ke dynamics may have been controlled by an intrinsic mode of lfv such as that described in section 3 2 this positive comparison would in turn imply that the directly driven dynamics and or ocean atmosphere coupled modes of variability e g qiu et al 2014 did not overshadow the intrinsic dynamics during that period it is also worth stressing that the different duration of each phase in the altimeter and model data is inherent of the highly idealized model setting and does not affect the significance of the model data comparison moreover while the ranges of variability of λ in the altimeter and model data are comparable the mean ke latitude φ varies in the range 33 5 35 in the model data while it is more northerly oriented by 1 in the altimeter data varying in the range 34 9 36 this mismatch is acceptable as well in consideration of the idealized nature of the western coastlines and of the climatological wind forcing fig 1 which is even chosen as longitude independent 4 3 self sustained vs excited relaxation oscillations we have already mentioned in section 3 1 that the same ro that is self sustained beyond the tipping point ah a h2 can emerge even if the system is set before that threshold provided it is excited by a suitable time dependent forcing in other terms the ros can be either self sustained for ah a h2 or excited for ah a h2 pierini 2014a relied on this property to propose a mechanism that could explain the synchronization of the ke lfv observed by qiu and chen 2010 while still retaining the intrinsic character of the dynamics according to that model study the mechanism of synchronization can be summarized as follows 1 the system is set to be excitable i e ah a h2 e g ah 240 m 2 s 1 like in s1 the ke is initially in a weak jet state e g as that of fig 5 s1 black line that would persist indefinitely under time independent climatological forcing 2 phase 1 i e a rapid increase of the hfv is triggered by the arrival in the ke region of negative ssh anomalies carried by rossby waves and generated in the central and eastern north pacific by a suitable time dependent atmospheric mode of variability 3 the subsequent evolution is determined by the intrinsic ro and is virtually independent of the time dependent forcing if we now examine the time longitude plot of the ssh anomalies reported in fig 18 we can see that at the beginning of 1998 when the loop began the anomalies are mainly negative in the ke region but the same occurred also years in advance thus according to the theoretical framework just described the loop discussed in section 4 2 was not remotely excited and can therefore be considered as self sustained as it is indeed the case in the simulation discussed in the present study this amounts to saying that the intrinsic mode of variability was triggered by internal oceanic variability not directly induced by the atmosphere on the contrary the rapid increase in λ evidenced in fig 14c starting from 2006 corresponds to a largely negative ssh anomaly in the ke region beginning just during that year i e fig 18 this is consistent with the excitation mechanism to this respect in order to test the validity of the ke index 3 pierini 2015 analysed the intrinsic model loop excited by the time dependent forcing of pierini 2014a starting from year 2006 we take advantage of the altimeter derived index now available to reconsider the problem the ke evolution of fig 14c is again reported in fig 19 a the initial weak jet state coinciding with fig 16l is followed by a rapid increase of λ by a highly variable and convoluted jet and eventually by the formation of a two meander state this is compatible with phases 1 2 and 3 but important differences with respect to the hysteresis loop are present as well the line in fig 19a is dashed to stress the difference in particular at the beginning of phase 2 the first anticyclonic meander is strong and meridionally elongated in 1999 fig 16c while it is now weaker and less elongated fig 19c moreover the route to the strong two meander state is through a notable increase of φ which is connected with the absence of phase 4 thus the intrinsic mode of lfv discussed in this study appears to have been in fact excited at the beginning of year 2006 but other effects not included in the model see section 5 have affected the subsequent global evolution 5 further discussion and conclusions modelling ocean dynamics is necessary to recognize oceanic intrinsic lfv in this regard several modelling strategies can be followed in the framework of sufficiently realistic simulations i an ogcm can be forced by realistic atmospheric forcing and by the corresponding climatological annual cycle by comparing these two simulations one can isolate the low frequency variability of intrinsic origin from that directly forced by the atmosphere e g as done by penduff et al 2011 nonaka et al 2012 and sérazin et al 2016 ii few hindcasts can be performed with an ogcm under the same realistic atmospheric forcing but with slightly different initial conditions e g cfr nonaka et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 nonaka et al 2016 for the ke lfv since the intrinsic variability is typically chaotic yielding therefore extreme dependence on initialization modes of variability appearing with different phases in the simulations will be identified as intrinsic iii if the strategy ii is extended to a large number of hindcasts a statistical approach can be followed the forced and intrinsic variabilities can thus be estimated through the ensemble mean and spread respectively e g bessières et al 2017 sérazin et al 2017 and leroux et al 2018 followed this methodology with a 50 member ensemble of global eddy permitting nemo simulations naturally the extremely high computational cost of these simulations do not allow one to perform sensitivity numerical experiments iv another modelling approach based on model data comparison is that of extending the classical extremely idealized double gyre problem of the ocean circulation driven by time independent winds e g dijkstra and ghil 2005 ghil 2017 to models that are simplified and are therefore still much less computer expensive than ogcms so that sensitivity studies can be carried out but that at the same time include sufficient elements of realism so as to allow for some form of model data comparison intrinsic processes can thus be disentangled from the observational data typically altimeter data if modelled modes of variability which in this case are necessarily intrinsic are found to compare well with real oceanic processes the possibility of analysing model sensitivity to specific control parameters is fundamental because it allows one to identify various model scenarios that can be very different but are all equally admissible in principle to be compared with data on the other hand this approach can be successful only if an intrinsic process present in the real ocean is not overwhelmed by the directly forced dynamics and or by coupled ocean atmosphere modes of variability in the present paper methodology iv is successfully applied for the first time at the best of the authors knowledge the focus is on the ke lfv the eddy permitting ocean model pierini 2006 is driven by a time independent wind field and is relatively idealized but it includes essential elements of realism the aviso altimeter data set is used for model data comparison and moreover the analysis relies also on a new composite index λ φ specifically conceived for the ke pierini 2015 a set of numerical simulations has first evidenced the typical extreme sensitivity of the model response to the value of the lateral eddy viscosity coefficient ah a reference simulation s4 with ah 210 m2 s 1 has then been chosen yielding large amplitude self sustained relaxation oscillations one of these oscillations has been studied in detail and has been characterized by four phases each one being controlled by a specific dynamical mechanism an interval has then been identified in the altimeter derived index that resembles the model loop a detailed comparison with the model has thus been carried out with the help of ssh maps the observed loop ranging from january 1998 to march 2006 is found to possess four phases each one characterized by a dynamical behaviour that is very similar to that recognized in the corresponding phase of the model loop the natural conclusion is that during that interval the ke dynamics may have been controlled by an intrinsic mode of lfv such as that obtained by the model and that the directly driven dynamics and or ocean atmosphere coupled modes of variability were not so strong as to overshadow the intrinsic evolution the self sustained vs excited character of the relaxation oscillation has been finally discussed also in direct connection with the variability observed from 2006 to 2011 in the analysis a central role is played by the new composite index as a matter of fact the ke lfv is found to provide a nice example of an extremely complex oceanographic phenomenon yielding a simple behaviour even comparable with a simplified ocean model if described through the index λ φ in general despite the huge complexity of the climate system fundamental aspects of climate variability reveal amazingly simple behaviors if data analyses are performed through suitable climate indices e g stocker et al 2013 section 2 7 8 in a paleoclimate context some impressive examples are provided by the main fluctuations over the pleistocene such as the glacial interglacial transitions and the dansgaard oeschger warming events e g shackleton et al 1984 johnsen et al 1992 dansgaard et al 1993 ganopolski and rahmstorf 2001 crucifix 2012 in these cases the available proxies are expressed in terms of parameters that appear to be themselves ideal indices to describe the gross features of the phenomena however in general a suitable choice of the indices can be crucial to identify notable features of the climate processes under investigation that could otherwise remain unnoticed our index has successfully fulfilled this task for the ke another relevant result of this study in line with pierini 2006 and pierini et al 2009 is the demonstration of the extreme sensitivity of the lfv of a strong frontal jet well known in the literature on idealized double gyre modelling in a realistic context in which direct comparison with altimeter data is carried out if ah is increased by just 14 passing from s4 to s1 the modelled loop loses all the dynamical features that are found to compare well with the observed loop becoming completely unrealistic this suggests that much caution should be taken when interpreting results of ogcms concerning frontal processes such as western boundary current low frequency fluctuations future perspectives include an analysis of the oceanic intrinsic ke lfv identified by the modelling strategies i iii can intrinsic ke loops similar to that of fig 10 be recognized in a more realistic modelling setup the three member ensemble simulations of zhang et al 2015 and nonaka et al 2016 appear to already provide a positive answer to this question another important aspect that should be investigated is the cause of the very complex ke behaviour in connection of the possible existence of oceanic intrinsic ke lfv why is the ke evolution so profoundly different in the four intervals of fig 14 several recent studies e g kelly et al 2010 putrasahan et al 2013 tsujino et al 2013 qiu et al 2014 o reilly and czaja 2015 wang et al 2016 ma et al 2016 have shown that local air sea interactions and feedbacks mesoscale eddy dynamics and wind variability can strongly affect the ke state so that intrinsic ocean modes of lfv variability if potentially present can be substantially modified by those effects this might have occurred in the intervals of figs 14a c d this is an intriguing and subtle problem whose investigation will require a thorough analysis of the atmospheric forcing of the local air sea interactions and of ke observations further eddy resolving ocean only and coupled ocean atmosphere general circulation model studies and sensitivity numerical experiments will be necessary to interpret the phenomena studies of this kind will also bring further insight into the predictability of the ke evolution e g nonaka et al 2012 kramer et al 2012 qiu et al 2014 wang et al 2017 which depends crucially on the capability of the ocean system to produce intrinsic modes of lfv and on the mechanisms that produce their onset e g nonaka et al 2012 pierini 2014a in this context multi member ensemble hindcast simulations such as those quoted in the modelling strategy iii will also be required theoretical modelling studies based on low order ocean models and relying on the combined use of ensemble simulations and pullback attractors e g pierini 2014b ghil 2017 drótos et al 2015 2017 pierini et al 2016 will also turn out to be valuable in suggesting new modelling strategies that could not be tested with primitive equation ocean models due to their prohibitive computational cost finally although the combined ke index λ φ was constructed in the framework of a model process study pierini 2015 its application to altimeter data has proved useful and appropriate this in turn suggests that the same index could as well be a powerful tool to characterize and monitor the ke lfv in eddy

24077,the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism which uses unstructured grids is set up for the north and baltic seas with a resolution of 100 m in the narrow straits connecting the two basins this model accurately resolves the inter basin exchange validation against observations in the straits shows the model has good skill in simulating the transport and vertical profiles of temperature salinity and currents the timing and magnitude of the major inflow event in 2014 2015 is also realistically simulated the analysis is focused on the two layer exchange its dependence on the atmospheric forcing and dominant physical balances the two layer flows in the three connecting straits show different dependencies upon the net transport the spatial variability of this dependence is also quite pronounced the three strait system developed specific dynamics with time lags and differences between currents in the individual straits during inflow and outflow conditions analysis on the impact of resolution indicates that the performance of the model changes depending on whether the narrow parts of the straits are resolved with a resolution of 500 m or 100 m with this ultra fine resolution gravity flows and variability of salinity in deep layers is generally more adequately simulated this paper identifies the needs for more profound analysis of the coupled dynamics of baltic and north seas with a focus on the danish straits 1 introduction european straits linking different semi enclosed seas or connecting them with the ocean e g the bosporus dardanelles great belt are from one to several kilometers wide the net transport in those straits is largely driven by river runoff the shallow depths 30 m at places keep the hydrological characteristics of adjacent basins very different a two layer exchange which is similar to the transport in tidal estuaries dominates the straits dynamics with upper layer transport to basins that are more saline and bottom layer transport in the opposite direction the danish straits between the baltic sea and north sea figs 1 and 2 include the little belt great belt and øresund commonly known in english as the sound the widths of the above straits are 1 km 15 32 km and 4 km respectively the comparison of these geometrical scales with the internal baroclinic rossby radius of deformation 5 km in the kattegat see fennel et al 1991 indicates that the great belt could be rotationally influenced tides are small in the baltic sea and most of the mechanical energy input is provided by air pressure and wind the balance between the pressure gradient and friction roughly dominates flow regime in the straits the analysis of cross channel density structure by umlauf and arneborg 2009a 2009b reveals dynamics that are more complex the observed transverse ekman transport is balanced by the geostrophic transport due to the down channel tilt of the interface in the baltic sea there also are numerous sills critical to the separation between sub basins and water exchange leppäranta and myrberg 2009 thus the processes over the shallows are important for the internal mixing and transport of surface and bottom waters reissmann et al 2009 much progress has been made in recent decades in the physical oceanography of the baltic sea feistel et al 2008 leppäranta and myrberg 2009 including a growing understanding of the role of baltic sea s straits and sills omstedt et al 2014 one of the major gaps in our regional knowledge is in the field of exchange between sub basins turbulent mixing reissmann et al 2009 and water mass formation these processes are crucial for the deep water ventilation meier et al 2006 and upwelling in the baltic sea lehmann et al 2012 so far the physical oceanography of the baltic sea is rather incomplete because in most modelling studies the two layer exchange is neither sufficiently resolved nor considered as fully two way coupled with the general circulation of interconnected basins elucidating and solving some problems in this field is the basic motivation for the present study and the main difference from our previous studies stanev et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the water and salt balances which are intimately related to their major physical drivers such as evaporation precipitation and river run off are at the heart of dynamics of estuarine basins however these balances are largely dependent on the dynamical control in the straits connecting the semi enclosed basins and open ocean and in particular on the atmospheric and tidal forcings there are a number of process studies dealing with hydraulics in the straits two layer exchange and outflows which captured the basic physics stigebrandt 1983 armi 1986 armi and farmer 1988 farmer and armi 1988 borenäs and lundberg 1986 pratt and lundberg 1991 laanearu and lundberg 2000 gustafsson 2004 garrett 2004 arneborg et al 2007 there are also many 3d numerical model studies lehmann 1995 schrum 1997 schrum and backhaus 1999 meier et al 1999 janssen 2002 some of which show large bias in the water balance and a tendency towards reduced salinities as recognized by janssen et al 2001 and omstedt et al 2014 the ability of the models to simulate saltwater inflows through the kattegat into the baltic proper to continuously renew the baltic deep water and keep the halocline stable is a prerequisite for multi year simulations of the baltic sea in earlier 3d modelling studies the transition zone between the baltic sea and north sea hereinafter the area including the kattegat danish straits and the western part of the baltic sea will be referred to as the north sea baltic sea transition zone nbtz was resolved in the best case with grids of 1 km and even coarser in scenario studies this resolution is not optimal for narrow straits such as the sound or little belt cross sectional area in the straits depends also on the position of sea level which is not fixed therefore climate model scenarios meier et al 2017 could be affected by sea level rise sensitivity to global changes is expected to be strongest in the shallow straits where the dynamic balances could change if sea level change is comparable with the depth some positive trends of the structured grid modelling of water exchange between the north sea and baltic sea with respect to model resolution requirement are documented by gräwe et al 2015 who used a multi nested modeling system with horizontal resolution ranging between 8 km and 600 m in the straits mohrholz et al 2015 also reported model simulations with resolution of 600 m even with this fine resolution models cannot fully resolve the geometry of the little belt or the complex topographic structures of the other two straits therefore another strong motivation for this study is to investigate the model performance when using ultra fine resolution scales e g between 100 and 500 m using one way nesting techniques is also not adequate to address the dynamics of inter connected basins e g the coupled system north sea baltic sea in this case the possible interaction between dynamics in the straits and in the basins connected by the straits is missing thus insufficient model resolution and one way nesting are considered the major sources of uncertainties and explain the limited or controversial knowledge of the straits role in the dynamics of the european seas the key and different role of individual baltic sea straits and sills in water exchange and mixing still remains largely unclear one problem revealed by the field campaigns is the intermittent regime of straits exchange and diverse appearances of inflow and associated mixing and entrainment all of which have relatively small spatial scales a clear 4d view based on observations on temporally variable inflows and outflows in the straits areas is still missing numerical modelling is considered here as an important research tool as complementary to observations to address the complexity of straits dynamics unstructured grid models overcome some nesting and resolution problems and allow addressing various ocean and coastal scales at the same time lermusiaux et al 2013 danilov 2013 scholz et al 2013 stanev et al 2017 the simulation of water exchange in the nbtz zhang et al 2016a also demonstrated promising perspectives earlier kliem et al 2006 described simulation for the baltic sea using a 2d unstructured grid model in the present study we describe the improvements in the set up used here in comparison to the model of zhang et al 2016a for the same area it is not possible in a single study to address all interesting physical aspects studied in several dozen previously published papers therefore we will focus our analysis on 1 model validation against observations in the nbtz 2 the role of resolution 3 responses to atmospheric forcing with time scales ranging from synoptic to annual and 4 the appearances of the two layer strait exchange in the individual straits dynamics studied earlier will be presented in more general terms just to demonstrate the consistency of the present numerical simulations with the previous studies this study is an extension of the work of zhang et al 2016a but focused on the major baltic sea inflow mbi in 2014 2015 it adds to the study of stanev et al 2015 which addressed simulations of earlier mbi s and the inter dependence between transports in the individual straits one improvement here is that we increase the horizontal resolution in the straits by about ten times compared to the 0 5 nm horizontal resolution of stanev et al 2015 who used a two way nested modelling approach another new aspect is the more profound model validation in the nbtz and inter comparison of results from numerical simulations using grids with different resolutions one specific research challenge not addressed in our previous studies motivating the present study is the impact of sea level dynamics on the variability of water and salt exchange in the north sea and baltic sea this issue is relevant to the causality of inflow events we will also address the interdependency of the exchange flows in the individual straits and the temporal and spatial variability of the two layer exchange in a following publication the emphasis will be on the quantification of individual processes governing the two layer exchange and mixing in the nbtz the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the numerical model its validation against observations is presented in section 3 sections 4 and 5 describe the circulation in the nbtz and its temporal and spatial variability section 6 addresses the response of individual straits to atmospheric forcing and regional inter dependence between straits transport and sea level section 7 presents the two layer exchange in the three straits connecting the north sea and the baltic sea and section 8 quantifies the advantage of using ultra fine resolution in the straits the paper ends with a brief conclusion 2 numerical model 2 1 model description semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism is a derivative product of the original selfe semi implicit eulerian lagrangian finite element model zhang and baptista 2008 with many improvements described in zhang et al 2016b schism solves the primitive equations using a hybrid finite element and finite volume approach an example of the grid is shown in fig 3 a terms that place stringent stability constraints e g cfl are treated implicitly eulerian lagrangian method elm is used for the momentum advection the model version used in this study is hydrostatic with boussinesq approximation the combination of galerkin finite element method gfem with 1 the implicit time stepping which enables efficiency and robustness and with 2 the elm enables a good balance in terms of numerical diffusion and dispersion because numerical diffusion inherent in an implicit method and elm balances out by the numerical dispersion inherent in gfem the model is not immune to sensitivity with respect to grid generation see next section schism has been previously used to simulate the circulation in the north sea and baltic sea zhang et al 2016a and therefore its presentation here is very short the parameterizations see zhang et al 2016a b allow resolving the baroclinic instability which is very important for areas dominated by eddy dynamics bottom roughness is set to a constant value of 0 5 mm the bi harmonic viscosity used is described by zhang et al 2016b no explicit horizontal diffusivity is used as the higher order solver is monotone by design the vertical viscosity and diffusivity are calculated from the generic length scale model umlauf and burchard 2003 with a k kl configuration the improvements in the present paper compared to the setup of zhang et al 2016a are basically associated with better resolution in some critical areas and with improved forcing 2 2 model area bathymetry data used in the present study are the same as the ones used by zhang et al 2016a however additionally we use here the baltic sea bathymetry database version 0 9 3 http data bshc pro last accessed on june 5 2015 with 500 m resolution to improve the bathymetry in the nbtz model refinements compared to bathymetry and grid of zhang et al 2016a have also been done in skagerrak norwegian trench wadden sea and the area around the mouth of oder river the computational grid has 400 k nodes compared with about 300 k nodes in the topography of zhang et al 2016a with a minimum grid side length of 80 m in the narrow areas of the little belt fig 3 the model grid for the other two straits is shown for example in the supplementary material fig s1 and fig s2 most of the change of resolution is specified on the shallow shelf where dynamics are dominated by friction an essentially uniform resolution of 3 km is used in the open sea parts of two basins minimizing wave distortion because of non uniform resolution in unstructured grid models the vertical lsc2 grid described by zhang et al 2015 is used here see fig 3b it allows flexible placement of vertical nodes at each horizontal position the vanishing quasi sigma vqs dukhovskoy et al 2009 ensures smoothness among neighboring nodes shaved cell technique zhang et al 2015 eliminates staircases shuts down the diapycnal mixing and reduces the co ordinate slope and thus the pressure gradient errors tests conducted to demonstrate the performance of the lsc2 grid can be found in zhang et al 2015 as demonstrated by zhang et al 2016a on the example of baltic proper see their figure fig a 1 the use of lsc2 grid contributes to simulating realistic stratification this couldn t be achieved in s grid even with the number of layers being doubled the vertical lsc2 grid used here consists of up to 59 layers in the norwegian trench with an average number of 31 levels in the whole model domain 2 3 initialization and forcing monthly climatological salinity and temperature data janssen et al 1999 are used to initialize the model like this was the case in the paper by zhang et al 2016a however we use here finer resolution data for atmospheric forcing including hourly wind atmospheric pressure air temperature dew point temperature and cloud cover from the 7 km resolution cosmo eu model of german weather service dwd from these data the wind stress fluxes of sensible and latent heat as well as short wave and long wave radiation are computed the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi ehype pan european hydrological predictions for the environment product is used for the freshwater fluxes from 34 rivers discharging into the baltic sea and north sea the model has two open boundaries west of the english channel and between the british isles and scandinavia fig 1 at these boundaries hourly values of elevation horizontal velocity salinity and temperature were used which were taken from the copernicus product http marine copernicus eu last accessed in may 2017 interpolated at each time step onto the model grid the use of these data is considered an optimal solution because they are dynamically consistent based on up to date modelling o dea et al 2012 and have been validated extensively after an initialization period of four years the model is run for another two years 1 march 2014 to 31 march 2016 which is the period analyzed in this paper we will refer to this reference experiment as the control run cr an additional experiment was carried out in which all areas in the nbtz where the resolution in the cr was finer than 500 m were resolved with a horizontal resolution of 500 m we will refer to this experiment w as the e 500 389k nodes comparison between fig 3c d and fig 3a b illustrates the difference in the model resolution of two experiments for the area of little belt fig s1 and fig s2 illustrate the difference between the cr and e 500 for the straits of sound and great belt respectively the simulations were conducted on mistral peta scale supercomputer of the german climate computing center deutsches klimarechenzentrum gmbh dkrz on 1024 cpus the model runs 150 times faster than real time 3 validation against observations 3 1 sea level and transport in the straits the overall performance of schism for the area in the present study has been addressed by zhang et al 2016a therefore the validation here will focus primarily on areas and specific periods which have not been addressed in this earlier study and include the nbtz and periods of recent extreme events the studied period is chosen such that it includes the mbi in 2014 2015 for which there are already observations mohrholz et al 2015 and analyses the realism of the model with respect to the transport in the straits will be assessed we will compare our estimates with the computations based on the method proposed by håkansson citation from meier et al 2003 which assumes a balance between along strait pressure gradient and bottom friction term this dominant balance is proven in those studies after estimating the correlation between sea level difference in two locations at both sides of the straits and the observed volumetric flows obtained from adcp ship borne transects and moored aanderaa current meters across the drogden sill the calibration proposed by those authors used the two tide gauge stations viken and klagshamn located in the northern and southern entrance of the sound respectively see fig 2 for their positions the index of agreement d proposed by willmott 1981 measures the degree to which the observed data o is estimated by the predicted value p 1 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 here n is the number of observations index i and the overbar is the temporal mean of the observed data a value of 1 would indicate perfect agreement whereas a value of 0 would indicate no agreement at all in the third and fourth line of table 1 p and o are the normalized transports estimated from the parametric model presented by meier et al 2003 and numerical model respectively the observed and simulated sea levels at these two stations are in a very good agreement fig 4 a b and table 1 noteworthy is the phase difference between sea level at these stations compare fig 4a and fig 4b the pressure gradient between the two of them changes to strongly negative fig 4e giving the first push of the mbi in 2014 the timing of this event is shown by the vertical green line the model errors are small in comparison to the variances of analyzed variables and therefore d is quite high the index of agreement from the parametric model of 0 97 is considered here as an ideal agreement because it is based on calibrated data our simulations yield 0 94 which demonstrated that the agreement between the observations and the fluxes q m computed with schism is very close to that ideal case the temporal evolution of sea level fig 4a c up to the baltic sea stations visby and degerby the latter known recently as föglö see fig 1 for their position demonstrates a synchronous sea level dynamics over a larger area the green vertical line shows that phase differences are relatively small these stations are representative of the volume change of the whole baltic sea e g jacobsen 1980 as demonstrated by janssen et al 2001 station degerby has high skill in describing the variability of baltic sea surface elevation the accurate predictions of sea level elevation in stations visby and degerby manifests the model skill with respect to the dominant dynamics in the baltic sea according to håkansson citation from meier et al 2003 the agreement between the observed and simulated sea levels at stations viken and klagshamn guarantees a correct prediction of the volumetric transport through the sound this concept is based on the assumption of balance between along strait pressure gradient and bottom friction term it is supported by the third and fourth lines in table 1 which show the agreement between non dimensional sea level differences at these two stations and net transport see also fig 4e notably the parametric estimations of håkansson were calibrated to observations schism was not specifically calibrated these results indicate that also in schism the balance between along strait pressure gradient and bottom friction plays the major role in the sound furthermore the correct estimate of the straits transport is a prerequisite for the good model skill in the entire baltic sea obviously the good skill in stations visby and degerby fig 4a c and in the straits are consistent with each other 3 2 currents in the straits data from three adcp stations in the danish straits operated by the dmi are used here to validate simulated currents two stations østerrenden 55 363266 n 11 022787e and vengeancegrund 55 207542 n11 086632e are in the great belt and the third drogden fyr 55 536380 n 12 711413e is in the sound see fig 2 for their position data used here are recorded at 3 depths at all three stations during 01 october 2014 01 june 2015 comparison with simulations demonstrated a good qualitative agreement at the three stations fig 5 the model overestimates slightly the velocity maxima the quantitative validation shows that the coefficient of agreement is above 0 82 reaching 0 94 at vengeancegrund table 2 compared to the relatively large amplitudes of currents the rms error is not too big the maximum bias is 6 cm s which is also reasonable keeping in mind that model forcing is not perfect it is noteworthy that the signals in the two straits differ substantially not only by their magnitude but also by phase 3 3 salinity earlier validations of schism against marnet observations http www bsh de en marine data observations marnet monitoring network index jsp last accessed july 2017 revealed a good consistency of simulations zhang et al 2016a in the following we will present model validation against different data source e g freely available ctd and bottle data from the international council for the exploration of the sea ices database http ocean ices dk hydchem hydchem aspx plot yes last accessed july 2017 from this dataset we selected the observations situated along the pathway of salt intrusions by 1 by 5 by 7 and by 15 see fig 1 for their positions the validation was performed for a period of one year starting 1 september 2014 and thus covering the time of the mbi during the winter 2014 2015 the ability of model to capture the change of thermohaline characteristics of the north sea waters penetrating into the baltic sea during the mbi along their way over the sills and in the small regional sub basins is illustrated in fig 6 simulations and observations show clearly the delayed appearance of salt water intrusions with increasing distance from the straits as well as a decrease of the amplitude of salinity outbreak associated with the mbi at stations far from the nbtz the model skill is good d is above 0 91 in bottom layers in all stations in the surface layers d is also above 0 91 only in stations by 7 and by 5 d drops to 0 80 which is a reasonable value taking into consideration possible errors in the model and its forcing namely using hourly data with 7 km horizontal resolution is perhaps still not fine enough since the baltic sea is enclosed basin unresolved atmospheric dynamics in its large coastal areas could bias ocean simulations bulk aerodynamic formulas are also not perfect using coupled atmosphere ocean models with high resolution in the straits and other sensitive areas could be an adequate step toward improvement of atmospheric forcing the time versus depth diagrams of salinity fig 7 demonstrate that the time when the mixed north sea water reaches the observational locations is very well forecasted by the model in the stations darss and arkona simulated salinity values exceed the observed ones while in the gotland basin simulated bottom salinity values are slightly underestimated compare fig 7g and h although peaks in salinity associated with the mbi are slightly overestimated in the shallow nbtz area the mixing on their way down to the gotland basin reduces the magnitude of salinity signal below the observed values the agreement between simulations and observations in the gotland basin is very valuable because the gotland basin integrates temporal development of salinity in the kattegat belt sea and the western baltic janssen et al 2001 in conclusion without special tuning the model captures salinity intrusions in the straits the deterioration of the bottom water properties in e 500 will be addressed in section 8 see the panels on the right of fig 7 more realistic representation of the penetration of mixed water down to the gotland basin and its spreading there could be achieved after a closer look at the parameterizations used which will be addressed in future publications 4 overall presentation of the circulation in the nbtz the model allows resolving sharp fronts in salinity the panels on the left hand side of fig 8 and numerous small scale features in the relative vorticity the panels on the right hand side of fig 8 the comparison between the inflow and outflow patterns demonstrates that the position of positive and negative vorticity alternates that is demonstrated well in the great belt the vorticity alternation follows the alternating direction of flow in the straits with a much coarser resolution as used in earlier modelling studies based on structured grids one cannot accurately resolve the velocity gradients in the straits the zoom in views of the model grid in fig 3 see also supplementary figs s1 and s2 and the insets in the sound and great belt shown in fig s3 support this conclusion the complex flow structure could be important for the resistance in the straits which depends on the velocity shear the above reasoning is supported by the analysis on the role of horizontal resolution cr versus e 500 presented in section 8 with increasing distance from the straits the scales of vorticity patterns increase most of them show an elongated shape which is explained by the predominant narrow jets in the area of the arkona and bornholm basins the inflow and outflow situations are well distinguished in the salinity patterns fig 8a c during the outflow conditions low salinity surface water displaces to the north see also the sharp front in fig s3e f resulting in a reduction of sea surface salinity sss in the kattegat by about 6 the propagation pathways of these low salinity water masses are well seen in the plumes originating from the great belt and sound fig 8a the salinity front separating the skagerrak water mass from the kattegat water mass is pushed north of the skagen fig 8a in most inflow cases the skagerrak water with higher salinity depicts a jet like propagation pattern in the direction of the sound the front separating these two water masses is extremely strong reaching more than 10 salinity units per km fig s3f at certain times the two straits provide two sources of high salinity water entering the bornholm basin fig 8c the vertical salinity section through the sound shows a typical gravity current type propagation starting from the drogden sill the shallowest location in fig 9 this current is seen even better in the turbulent kinetic energy tke patterns maximum values are in a thin bottom layer tke shows another maximum zone at the northern entrance of the sound where the jet from the kattegat converges towards the strait fig 8c this is a zone of extreme vertical mixing its dynamics can change vertical stratification and strongly affect the propagation properties of gravity currents the tke decreases in the middle of the water column particularly in the baltic sea part of the cross section it further increases in the surface layer displaying a characteristic profile known from other similar strait environments stanev et al 2017 5 temporal and spatial patterns of inflows and outflows 5 1 chronology of the mbi in 2014 2015 inflows and outflows in the danish straits have much in common with tidally driven estuarine exchange however in the case of the baltic sea the role of atmospheric forcing is more important than that of tides stanev et al 2015 mbis are to a first order barotropic phenomena driven by an emptying refilling process of the baltic sea schimanke et al 2014 existing concepts explaining their chronology have been mostly based on observations lass and matthäus 1996 however observations are not available over large areas and for sufficiently long periods furthermore mbis appear rarely about once per ten years in the recent times and their statistical description is difficult numerical modelling provides an opportunity to address the timing and causality of mbi for the entire area of inter connected basins the temporal spatial evolution of mbi during 2014 2015 is presented in fig 10 along the section line shown in fig 1 in the area of the straits this line follows the section line through the sound as shown in fig 2 sea level in the baltic sea is higher than in the north sea this is typical in estuarine basins the mean difference between the areas to the left and to the right of drogden sill see the blue arrows in fig 10 is 17 cm this sill the shallowest depth in fig 9 physically separates the two basins as seen by the variability pattern in fig 10a we will come again to the separation issue in section 6 1 in the north sea the temporal variability is dominated by tides for better readability of plots model data have been filtered with a window of 1 day so only neap spring variability is seen in fig 10 sea level variability in the baltic sea is largely driven by atmospheric forcing the event at the beginning of december 2014 is of particular importance on 2 december 2014 triangle symbol on the time axis in fig 10a sea level in the baltic sea dropped to 52 cm below the sea level found to the north of the sound see also fig 4 manifesting the precursory period in only 2 days this slope triggered a huge transport mbi resulting in an increase of sea level in the baltic sea by 82 cm during the next 40 days fig 4c d a similar situation was observed in november 2015 this time the mbi appearing as two strong pulses in the winter of 2015 2016 fig 10a the presentation in fig 10a is instructive also for some important general circulation features one feature is the low sea level at km 800 in the skagerrak that reflects the cyclonic rotation of currents there as seen in fig 10e bottom salinity in the baltic sea shows an increase positive anomaly right after the outbreak of mbi in 2014 this signal propagates to the east which is deduced from the slope of the salinity anomaly pattern the speed of propagation decreases with increasing distance from the strait particularly approaching the gotland basin this basin is the final destination of positive bottom salinity anomaly compare with the delay of phases of salinity signal illustrated by the blue line in fig 6 there is not a clear response of the bottom salinity in the north sea to the mbi which is easily understandable however this does not hold for the sss indeed the surface plume propagation depicts situations with alternating positive and negative anomalies which propagate to the west the slope of contours in the north sea fig 10c is opposite to the one in the baltic sea fig 10e the overall temporal variability is approximately seasonal what seems non trivial is that the largest positive anomalies on both sides of the drogden sill are generated almost simultaneously and propagate in both directions as surface plumes in the north sea and bottom plumes in the baltic sea another interesting result of the simulations is the entrapment of saltier water at about km 1500 which is the area of bornholm basin red arrows in fig 10 this basin accumulates saltier water and acts as a long term reservoir which sporadically discharges parcels of salty water to the east this is seen as short term positive anomaly strips following the direction of bottom water propagation while the presence of these strips is consistent with the dominant concept about the periodic export of saltier bottom waters from the retention basins e g the bornholm basin jakobsen 1995 an explanation of the vertical strips seen in the bottom salinity anomaly is needed this is not an unphysical result its appearance is explained by the fact that the anomalies of bottom salinity depend on the position of the chosen thalweg as well as on the vertical stratification the latter is highly variable in different depth intervals 5 2 different dynamics in the three straits comparison of the schism simulations in the three straits little belt great belt and sound are shown in fig 11 in order to give more detailed views on the results time versus distance diagrams in these figures are shown only in the nbtz that is along the section lines in fig 2 while the pressure gradient forcing appears in a semi coherent way in the three straits the temporal spatial response of individual straits to atmospheric forcing is rather different the sea level anomalies left panels in fig 11a are extremely large in the winter months of 2014 and 2015 providing the major drivers for the strong inter basin exchange this barotropic forcing triggers a clear salinity response in the three straits which largely differs between the surface and bottom layers in the sound fig 11b pulses of higher salinity surface water are very weak and with a very small along strait extension however bottom salinity pulses appear quasi periodically in this strait fig 11c the strongest of them extends up to the bornholm basin km 300 the low salinity values in the sound area between km 150 and 250 in fig 11c do not mean an absence of salinity intrusions there but demonstrate that these are shallow areas with salinity values close to the surface ones saltier mixed north sea water shows much longer excursions in the great belt both in the surface and bottom layers than in the surface layers of sound great belt section reveals the zones of saltier bottom waters in the arkona basin about km 300 note that the position of 300 km along the sound pathway almost coincides with the position of 500 km along the great belt section fig 2 these positions demarcate the bornholm basin an area of salt water accumulation in the two straits mbi is better identified by the salinity change in the bottom layers the comparison between the sections along the great belt and sound which slightly overlap at the end of the great belt section demonstrates that the high bottom salinity reflects the water originating from the sound this conclusion is justified by the fact that the bottom salinity maximum at about km 500 along the great belt section is separated from the main pulse of saltier bottom water the little belt shows more diffuse patterns which is due to the fact that the narrow opening in this strait needs more time to propagate the saltier north sea water while the importance of the little belt for the exchange between the north sea and baltic sea is small under normal events it becomes more substantial during the mbi in the southernmost part of the section line in this strait at about km 200 a backward propagation of positive salinity anomaly occurs which is identified by the opposite slope of the contours in the time versus distance diagram this illustrates the fact that saltier water in the great belt which tends to fill the western baltic sea reaches this location faster and in bigger amounts than water originating from the little belt 6 synchronous and asynchronous responses in the individual straits 6 1 interdependence of straits transport and sea level it is still unclear whether the changes of sea level in the baltic sea and north sea are equally important for the net transport and what the expected dependence during inflow and outflow situations is to answer these questions we analyze first the dependence of the volume fluxes integrated over the threes straits on the difference between sea level in the kattegat and central baltic sea unlike the analysis presented in section 3 1 which was focused on the dominant frictional control in the straits the difference between sea levels in the kattegat and central baltic sea reflects the role of general oceanographic conditions in the two basins and can potentially elucidate the leading role of one of them see the discussion in section 3 1 about the representativeness of sea level in the central baltic sea the scatter plots in fig 12 are shown for two 14 days periods during which the transport was dominated by either outflow from the baltic sea 1 15 nov 2014 or inflow 6 21 dec 2014 as expected there is a clear correlation between sea level difference and net flow the smaller correlation during the inflow situation the period of mbi is not so trivial and is explained with the help of fig 12d the inflow period 1 was characterized by multiple pulses which is consistent with a similar situation during the 1993 mbi stanev et al 2015 this is comparable with the salinity change described by jakobsen 1995 inflows were characterized by larger oscillations while outflows showed smoother changes obviously the 1993 case observed by jakobsen 1995 was almost repeated in 2014 2015 the unstable dynamics during inflows thus makes it possible that large outflows occur in times of small sea level differences between the kattegat and central baltic sea i e oscillations of sea levels in the two basins and the strait flow could become asynchronous the correlation between the sea level differences between the two basins and the sea level in the kattegat fig 12b from one side and the central baltic sea fig 12c from the other demonstrates that the variability of sea level in the kattegat plays the leading role correlation 0 91 sea level in the central baltic sea correlates weakly with the sea level difference during outflows correlation 0 38 changes of sea level in the central baltic sea are more important for the inflows in this case the correlation reverses with 0 73 and 0 5 for the baltic sea and the kattegat respectively this result is reminiscent of similar results for the black sea mediterranean sea system based on analysis of observations volkov et al 2016 and numerical simulations stanev et al 2017 i e the major driver is the forcing from the outside basin however inflows are strongly dependent on the sea level in the central baltic sea which supports the existing concepts lass and matthäus 1996 the areal distribution of correlation between net straits transport and sea level fig 12e reveals an overall anti symmetric pattern positive correlation in the kattegat and negative correlation in the southern baltic sea with increasing distance from the straits the magnitude of correlation decreases this reflects the delay associated with the propagation of barotropic signal to remote locations the areas of transition from positive to negative values are very sharp and identify the natural physical boundaries between the north sea and baltic sea the trend of larger negative correlations along the scandinavian baltic sea coast reveals the role of geostrophic control the larger correlation along the south western coast of kattegat is explained with the larger tidal range there see fig 6 of stanev et al 2015 6 2 similarities and differences in the response of individual straits to atmospheric forcing using a numerical model with horizontal resolution of 0 5 nm stanev et al 2015 demonstrated that the correlation between transports in the sound and great belt cannot be represented with a simple linear regression line this does not fully conform to the simple idea that the transports in the straits are linearly proportional the coefficient being the ratio between cross sectional areas there are different estimates for this ratio mattsson 1996 claims that the narrow passages in the belt sea have vertical cross sectional areas on the order of 300 000 m2 while the narrow cross sectional areas in the sound are about 60 000 m2 they found that the mean partition of the instantaneous flows through the great belt sea and sound is 8 2 rather than the generally accepted at that time estimate of 8 3 kullenberg and jacobsen 1981 reported a quite different ratio between cross sectional areas of two straits they claimed that the cross sectional area over the sill in the sound was 0 1 km2 in the belt sea the narrowest section was 0 16 km2 the ratio between the transports in the two straits estimated by sayin and krauss 1996 was 3 1 the estimations of jakobsen and trebuchet 2000 for the transport ratio tr was 2 67 the estimation of fu 2013 was 2 78 besides the ratio between transports in the two strait the response times are also subject to large uncertainties stanev et al 2015 one could expect that the differences between previous estimates of exchange flows were most probably due to the use of different cross sectional areas more generally topographies the areas of narrowest cross sections in the two straits based on the topography and model resolution used in the present study are 121 100 m² and 73 000 m² the ratio between the smallest cross sectional areas of the great belt between nakskov and langeland and sound in our model is 1 66 we will call this number area ratio ar the barotropic transports in the great belt and sound for october 2014 may 2015 indicate that the magnitudes of oscillations in the two straits largely exceed the mean values fig 13 a in the great belt the rms difference of barotropic transport from its mean value is 6 64 104 m³ s the corresponding number for the sound is 2 89 104 m³ s while the net transport for the baltic sea is about 1 5 104 m³ s liljebladh and stigebrandt 1996 the averaged tr for october 2014 may 2015 estimated here is 2 70 see the regression curve in fig 13b which compares well with the numbers 2 63 2 75 of stanev et al 2015 who used a model of the same area with a resolution of 1 km this result can serve as a justification that the tr is reasonably simulated even with this coarse resolution of 1 km there is a substantial difference between the tr estimated from the regression curve 2 70 and the ar 1 66 demonstrating that the narrower and shallower strait sound exerts larger resistance the scatter plot fig 13b gives an idea about the robustness and stability of the above averaged estimates the comparison between this averaged number 2 70 and the large variance of tr 2 30 demonstrated the complex inter relationship between transports in the two straits see fig 13g and their large variations over time stronger variability in the great belt compared to the sound is partially due to high frequency tidal oscillations in the former the sound effectively filters out the tidal oscillations stanev et al 2015 the distribution of the tr is non gaussian fig 13e there is a clear inflow tail i e the transport in the sound gets relatively stronger during inflow events this tendency during inflows is illustrated in the comparison between fig 13c and d where the distribution of the tr is separately shown for inflow and outflow cases although the shapes of these histograms are not fully identical with the results of stanev et al 2015 compare with their fig 8 the overall result suggests that the change in transport starts first in the sound the temporal evolution of the distribution of the transport ratio fig 13g clearly explains the non gaussian shape of histograms the asynchronous responses of the two straits revealed by the asymmetry of the curve in fig 13f against zero time lag is explained as a result of the sound being closer to the inflowing waters which follow the eastern kattegat coast see fig 8c unlike the similar analysis in stanev et al 2015 we did not filter out the tides therefore the lagged time correlation in fig 13f is affected by m2 tides the basic difference between the correlation of barotropic transports in the little belt and great belt not shown here from the case addressed above sound and great belt is that the coefficient in the regression curve is about two times smaller because the transport in the little belt is about half of that in the sound notably the average tr 5 11 is much smaller than its variance of 12 96 due to a very low correlation between the flows in the little belt and great belt 7 two layer exchange in the straits in some straits connecting estuarine basins with the neighboring seas the net transport in the upper and bottom layers shows opposite trends with the increase of net outflow i e the transport in the direction of the long term mean barotropic transport the upper layer flow increases and the bottom flow decreases and is sometimes blocked during the inflow situation the upper layer transport decreases and the bottom layer transport increases möller 1928 this old concept usually assumes that there are two water masses in the upper and bottom layers moving in opposite directions separated by an interface where velocity tends to zero this is a typical situation in estuarine circulation one such case is the strait of bosporus where the two layer exchange is well known in the nbtz the frontal area separating the kattegat and baltic sea water masses is periodically displaced back and forth by the atmospheric forcing fig 9a c the vertical structure of the two layer flow is not always well pronounced unlike in the bosporus strait see for more detail stanev et al 2017 the latter resembles a salt wedge where the interface is almost horizontal slope of 1 2 m per kilometer and covers the entire strait the simulated dynamics in the baltic sea straits show rather different and more diverse appearances the lack of profile observations over large areas in the straits makes it impossible to validate extensively the two layer volume exchange we can at least compare the present simulations against other similar cases and check whether concepts valid for other straits hold for the baltic sea straits whether this is the case everywhere in these straits and what the differences are as shown in section 3 1 the volumetric transport is simulated reasonably well fig 4 this barotropic transport integrated over the sections shown in fig 14 a is used as the independent variable x axis in fig 14 against which we compare the transports in the upper and bottom layers across the same sections y axis along most of these sections the simulated upper layer flow decreases and the bottom layer flow increases with decreasing net transport this supports the previous estimates based on simulations with the same model and observations in other similar straits stanev et al 2017 it is noteworthy that the model has not been specially tuned to earlier theoretical analyses some of which were based on simpler theoretical concepts or observations this demonstrates that these results have general applicability what has not been sufficiently addressed in earlier analyses in the nbtz is the spatial variability of the dependence of transport in each layer on the net transport this is illustrated in fig 14 for three sections in the little belt on the left four sections in the belt sea in the middle and four sections in the sound on the right the positions of the analyzed sections are shown in fig 14a the plots on the top correspond to the northernmost transect and the plot on the bottom to the southernmost transect the comparison between two layer flows in the three straits shows similar trends but the magnitudes are different notice different ranges for each strait with the exception of the northernmost section in the sound fig 14c and the southernmost section in the little belt fig 14j all other plots show that in most cases the flow is unidirectional for most of the transport variability ranges this means that either the surface or bottom flow equals the net transport i e we observe a blocking of transport in one of the layers oğuz et al 1990 as the magnitude of net transport decreases below some critical value the transport becomes two directional this transition is not linear as seen by the curvature of transport dependence in an idealized case the surface and bottom transports can be represented by two crossing curves oğuz et al 1990 this would mean that for one value of net transport there is one and only one pair of values for the upper and bottom layer transports the scatter of data suggests that the appearance of two layer transport is quite diverse different possible combinations of surface and bottom flows could correspond to the same net transport furthermore the scatter is different in different straits and at different locations in the straits this manifests that there are not a unique critical values of net water transport beyond which two layer transport transforms into one layer transport several representative examples are addressed below one for each strait extreme transports in the little belt are more than five times smaller than the extreme transports in the great belt two way transport is observed for only very low net transports below 3 103 m3 s 1 0 003 sv at the southernmost end of this strait the spread of data is large which suggests that the two layer transport there is substantially affected by other processes e g the local circulation after the flow leaves this narrow strait along the entire great belt from the northernmost reaches down to the fehmarn belt the transport curves look very similar the largest scatter of data at the fehmarn belt and at the northernmost section is due to larger scale oceanographic conditions that is in these areas simple concept of straits transport are not applicable blocking events for surface and bottom flows occur at different net transports which is most pronounced for the section across langeland fjord fig 14h in this case the asymmetry of curves left and right of the zero transport value is clearly seen furthermore for all sections there is no unique magnitude of net transport beyond which blocking events occur at the great belt south section fig 14e upper layer transport is blocked for net transport above 0 3 105 m3 s 1 for the bottom layer transport the respective value is 0 2 105 m3 s 1 north of the sound the scatter of data demonstrates that this area is subject to oceanographic conditions originating from the kattegat e g transport appears rather stochastic and not fully constrained by the straits dynamics and therefore for the same net transport different combinations of surface and bottom transport are possible the upper and bottom layer transport across the southern sections in the sound are much more constrained by the straits physics and therefore the scatter of data is smaller nevertheless the scatter of data is too big to define a threshold value for blocking either surface or bottom transport in the sound it is interesting to see that this scatter increases in some sections fig 14f but only under the inflow situation this is similar to the case in the great belt fig 14h but much more clearly pronounced in the sound asymmetric response this is in qualitative agreement with the results shown in fig 12 and previous analyses of jakobsen 1995 and stanev et al 2015 in conclusion the scatter of individual transports is usually larger at both ends of the strait while in the middle of the straits the relationships are reminiscent of the canonical relationship known for other straits although the simulated two layer transport is similar to other strait cases there are specific asymmetries in the baltic sea straits the relationships between the net transport and transport in the surface and bottom layer are not unique thus deviating from simple theoretical estimations 8 fine versus coarse resolution simulations with a resolution of 500 m in the nbtz the cross sectional areas in the great belt and sound are 122 300 m² and 68 800 m² respectively 121 100 m² and 73 000 m² in cr the tr is 1 78 1 65 in cr thus it changed relatively little 8 with changing the resolution this small change is at least partially due to the fact that the dem used in the cr and e 500 is the same however as seen in fig 3 the straits are resolved in the cr with only a few vertical columns therefore although the changes of topography in the cr and e 500 were relatively small the different horizontal resolution led to substantial effects which will be considered below in the great belt the mean magnitude of barotropic transport during october 2014 may 2015 changed from 9 32 104 m³ s in the cr to 8 49 104 m³ s in e 500 the respective numbers for the sound are 4 66 104 m³ s and 4 08 104 m³ s the averaged tr between the simulated transports in the two straits for the same period changed from 2 70 cr to 3 0 e 500 the analysis of transport properties in the two straits fig s4 similar to what has been shown in fig 13 for cr demonstrated that the changes in the model resolutions affected the tr distribution curves compare the histograms in fig 13 and fig s4 the inflow histogram in e 500 tends to a gaussian type which can be interpreted as a trend to lower asymmetry between strait exchanges in the case of coarser resolution of straits the temporal evolution of the distribution of the tr compare fig 13g and fig s4g gives another illustration of the differences between the two experiments each time slice in these plots represents a normalized histogram of the tr analyzed for a period of three days the secondary maximum in the histograms during outflow conditions fig s4d is clearly seen for small and negative values of tr fig s4g although the transport in the straits does not change drastically in the two experiments their relative distribution and correlation is strongly affected by the horizontal resolution the areal distribution of correlation between the transport in the straits and sea level in e 500 almost repeats the pattern shown in fig 12e the difference between the respective correlations in two experiments can be used to identify areas where changes in the dynamical balances occur this difference does not exceed several percent fig 12f however its pattern is not trivial notably far from the straits where the horizontal resolution in the two experiments is the same the areal distribution of this correlation is different the coarser resolution of narrow sections in e 500 results in an overall decrease of correlation in the kattegat the maximum decrease is along the western coast where the tidal range is larger stanev et al 2015 south of the straits the correlation increases in e 500 in comparison to cr and the difference pattern in fig 12f depicts approximately the propagation pathway of the north sea mixed water the correlation pattern shows strong sensitivity to horizontal resolution in narrow channels e g between the langeland and the fyn sio sound and in the area around darss sill in both areas fig 12f shows reversals of correlation and small scale patterns demonstrating that dynamical changes can be locally strongly affected by the resolution in particular the response to changed resolution in the sound could explain at least some of the differences in the water mass transformation and propagation towards the gotland basin differences between the cr and e 500 originate from the areas where horizontal resolution has substantially been changed as can be seen in the enlarged diagrams in figs s3 and s5 inflow salinities are higher in the cr compare figs s3b f and s5b f and in the sound the core of high salinity water is very pronounced in the cr see the difference between figs s3f and s5f in the outflow situations shown in these figures salinity is lower in the cr of particular importance to illustrate the differences between the two experiments is the comparison of vorticity in the straits which yields information about the velocity shear in the sound these differences are much clearer during inflow events compare figs s3h and s5h the respective outflow situations figs s3g and s5g show much better similarity the conclusion is that with finer resolution in the cr compare fig s1b and d velocity shear along straits coasts is better resolved which changes the patterns of velocity and salinity in several of the illustrations figs 6 7 10 11 simulations with e 500 were shown next to ones from the cr but were not commented on because the analyses were focused on physical interpretation of results in the following we will present briefly the major differences between the cr and e 500 overall the fine resolution model overestimates bottom salinity in arkona basin fig 6a before the mbi bottom salinity in the bornholm basin simulated in the cr was closer to the observed one while after the mbi observed data lay between e 500 and the cr simulations fig 6c in the stolpe channel and further down to the gotland basin the quality of cr simulations was better notice the different colors in fig 6d corresponding to individual experiments sss values were much closer in the two models than the bottom ones obviously changing the resolution affects the properties of bottom layers the panels on the right hand side of fig 10 are based on the results from e 500 qualitatively both simulations look similar but differences on both sides of the straits are also clearly seen the low sea level in the area of skagerrak is further reduced in the e 500 simulations furthermore the positive sss anomaly is more pronounced in the north sea in e 500 these changes are explained by larger mixing in the straits overturning of water during extreme situations bringing bottom water closer to the sea surface which further propagates in the direction of the north sea compare also figs s3a e and s5a e after the mbi the freshening trend in e 500 is stronger these results prove that the resolution in the straits can affect remote areas the differences between two models are more obvious in the baltic sea where the bottom salinity anomaly is much clearer in the cr in e 500 the signal almost does not reach the gotland basin this is seen from the comparison between fig 7h and fig 7i and the data fig 7g and supports the conclusions from analysis of fig 6 with more realistic bottom topography and better resolution of the narrow flows the penetration of saltier water in the straits simulated in the cr is larger and their accumulation in the arkona basin and bornholm deep reservoir provides enough source water to be pushed via the stolpe channel in the direction of the gotland basin under favorable conditions compare fig 10e and f this is in line with the analysis of janssen 2002 who stated that ventilation of the gotland basin is only possible when water mass characteristics in the arkona basin are beyond a critical value enabling sufficient salty water to reach the bornholm basin obviously the cr fulfilled these requirements more complete presentation of the agreement between the two models is shown in fig 11 sss and bottom salinity along section lines in fig 2 simulated in the two experiments fig 11b c agree with each other as was also the case with the larger scale analysis in fig 10 although sss patterns qualitatively agree and the bottom salinity shows similar appearances of salt intrusions the magnitude of the variability is different in the two models particularly in the sound at all analyzed stations the cr gives larger salinity values more detailed analysis shows larger differences e g in station viken where e 500 shows lower amplitudes of oscillations in this location the position of the salinity front shifts under different resolutions which explains the relatively larger salinity differences there d 0 73 this changing skill of schism in different areas depending upon the resolution in the straits figs 6 and 7 gives a motivation to further address the parameterizations used to more reasonably simulate the penetration of the mixed north sea water along its way from the kattegat down to the gotland basin obviously the problem with realistic propagation of bottom water could not be resolved with the increased resolution in the straits alone 9 conclusions one basic idea behind this research was to use results from numerical modelling to address different issues of straits physics and dynamics of interconnected basins this approach is justified by the fact that observations are not available over large areas and for sufficiently long periods with the needed resolution an unstructured grid model was presented which overcame some deficiencies in past studies caused by the coarse resolution of the two layer exchange in the straits and or not using two way coupling between the general circulation of interconnected basins and straits physics analyses gave a closer look at the impact of ultra fine resolution scales e g between 100 and 500 m the extensive validation against available observations demonstrated a very good model skill giving sufficient credibility to simulations as 4d representation of dominant processes we used these synthetic data to explain the key and different role of individual baltic sea straits and the temporal and spatial variability of their dynamics the realism of the model was first demonstrated with respect to the transport in the straits and the variability of sea levels at two ends of the straits the volumetric transport showed a very good skill revealing the leading role of the balance between along strait pressure gradient and bottom friction furthermore the consistency between basin scale and strait scale dynamics appeared crucial for the quality of the simulated gravity flows and basin scale baroclinic dynamics the model appeared capable of capturing the change of thermohaline characteristics of the north sea waters penetrating into the baltic sea during the mbi along their way over the sills and in the small regional sub basins the timing of arrival of mixed north sea water at several observational locations was accurately forecasted the penetration of the bottom salinity signal into the gotland basin matched the observed one particularly well up to stolpe channel there are number of geophysical specificities which have been revealed from the simulations the sound appeared as an area where extreme vertical mixing changes vertical stratification and strongly affects the propagation properties of gravity currents in the baltic sea and surface plume in the north sea while the former can be expected the fate of the surface plume in the north sea was not so trivial this plume was seen as alternating positive and negative anomalies which propagated to the west it was demonstrated that the drogden sill played the role of the generator of large salinity anomalies mixer because of shallow depths these anomalies propagated in either direction depending on the alteration of the straits transport as surface plumes in the north sea and bottom plumes in the baltic sea substantial differences between short term variability during inflow and outflow situations were identified the inflows were characterized by multiple pulses and large oscillations in transport and salinity while the outflows showed smoother changes during periods of strong currents the flow in the straits was unidirectional decreasing the magnitude of the net transport below some critical value caused the transport to become two directional however the appearance of two layer transport was quite diverse which was seen by the different pairs of surface and bottom flows corresponding to the same net transport the magnitude of net flow beyond which one of the two way currents was blocked was also not unique this ambiguity was different in different straits and at different locations in the straits in the interior of the straits the two layer transport tended to the canonical one known from theory oguz et al 1990 north and south of the straits the scatter of transport pairs surface and bottom ones increased because these areas were exposed to oceanographic conditions furthermore the two layer exchange was not symmetric for inflow and outflow conditions non canonical behavior under the inflow situation the three individual straits revealed very different dynamics saltier mixed north sea water showed much longer excursions in the great belt both in the surface and bottom layers than in the surface layers of the sound nevertheless during the mbi of 2014 2015 the salinity signal in the bornholm basin reflected water originating from the sound although there are concepts about the causality of inflow events svansson 1959 jakobsen et al 2010 schimanke et al 2014 the contribution of the sea level changes in the baltic sea and north sea for transports in the straits have not been previously quantified the model simulations were reminiscent of similar results for the black sea mediterranean sea system volkov et al 2016 i e the major driver was the forcing from the outside basin however inflows were strongly dependent on the sea level in the central baltic sea which supported the existing concepts lass and matthäus 1996 the correlation between net straits transport and sea level revealed an overall anti symmetric pattern the transition from positive to negative values made it possible to identify the natural physical boundaries between the north sea and baltic sea the interdependence of the exchange in the individual straits does not fully conform to the simple idea that transports in the straits are linearly proportional the coefficient being the ratio between the smallest cross sectional areas in fact the transport in the sound is smaller which reveals the stronger frictional control there we demonstrated that there are very complex relationships between transports in the two straits partially manifested by the large magnitudes of oscillations comparable to the mean values the coefficient of linear regression between transports in the sound and great belt increased during the mbi dominated cases demonstrating the role of the sound as a pathway for north sea waters associated with extreme events furthermore the transport in the great belt lags the one in the sound which was explained as a result of the sound being closer to the inflowing waters following the eastern coast of kattegat the changes in the model resolutions from fine to ultra fine affected the strait exchange the almost gaussian type histograms in the coarser simulation e 500 can be interpreted as a trend to lower asymmetry between strait exchanges in the case of coarser resolution of straits in the sound the position of the salinity front shifts under different resolutions overall the fine resolution model cr overestimated slightly bottom salinity in the arkona basin however in the stolpe channel and further down to the gotland basin the cr simulations were superior comparisons between the cr and e 500 proved that the resolution in the straits affects remote locations in both inter connected basins the improvements due to using ultra fine resolution appeared fundamental in the baltic sea allowing more realistic simulation of the propagation of the salinity signal down to the gotland basin this was due to the fact that in the cr the penetration of saltier water in the straits was larger and its accumulation in the bornholm deep reservoir provided enough source water for the deep ocean ventilation it is questionable whether the increased resolution in the straits alone could fully solve the problem with realistic propagation of bottom water some further improvement of model skill could be achieved after a closer look at the physical parameterizations contributing to more

24077,the semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism which uses unstructured grids is set up for the north and baltic seas with a resolution of 100 m in the narrow straits connecting the two basins this model accurately resolves the inter basin exchange validation against observations in the straits shows the model has good skill in simulating the transport and vertical profiles of temperature salinity and currents the timing and magnitude of the major inflow event in 2014 2015 is also realistically simulated the analysis is focused on the two layer exchange its dependence on the atmospheric forcing and dominant physical balances the two layer flows in the three connecting straits show different dependencies upon the net transport the spatial variability of this dependence is also quite pronounced the three strait system developed specific dynamics with time lags and differences between currents in the individual straits during inflow and outflow conditions analysis on the impact of resolution indicates that the performance of the model changes depending on whether the narrow parts of the straits are resolved with a resolution of 500 m or 100 m with this ultra fine resolution gravity flows and variability of salinity in deep layers is generally more adequately simulated this paper identifies the needs for more profound analysis of the coupled dynamics of baltic and north seas with a focus on the danish straits 1 introduction european straits linking different semi enclosed seas or connecting them with the ocean e g the bosporus dardanelles great belt are from one to several kilometers wide the net transport in those straits is largely driven by river runoff the shallow depths 30 m at places keep the hydrological characteristics of adjacent basins very different a two layer exchange which is similar to the transport in tidal estuaries dominates the straits dynamics with upper layer transport to basins that are more saline and bottom layer transport in the opposite direction the danish straits between the baltic sea and north sea figs 1 and 2 include the little belt great belt and øresund commonly known in english as the sound the widths of the above straits are 1 km 15 32 km and 4 km respectively the comparison of these geometrical scales with the internal baroclinic rossby radius of deformation 5 km in the kattegat see fennel et al 1991 indicates that the great belt could be rotationally influenced tides are small in the baltic sea and most of the mechanical energy input is provided by air pressure and wind the balance between the pressure gradient and friction roughly dominates flow regime in the straits the analysis of cross channel density structure by umlauf and arneborg 2009a 2009b reveals dynamics that are more complex the observed transverse ekman transport is balanced by the geostrophic transport due to the down channel tilt of the interface in the baltic sea there also are numerous sills critical to the separation between sub basins and water exchange leppäranta and myrberg 2009 thus the processes over the shallows are important for the internal mixing and transport of surface and bottom waters reissmann et al 2009 much progress has been made in recent decades in the physical oceanography of the baltic sea feistel et al 2008 leppäranta and myrberg 2009 including a growing understanding of the role of baltic sea s straits and sills omstedt et al 2014 one of the major gaps in our regional knowledge is in the field of exchange between sub basins turbulent mixing reissmann et al 2009 and water mass formation these processes are crucial for the deep water ventilation meier et al 2006 and upwelling in the baltic sea lehmann et al 2012 so far the physical oceanography of the baltic sea is rather incomplete because in most modelling studies the two layer exchange is neither sufficiently resolved nor considered as fully two way coupled with the general circulation of interconnected basins elucidating and solving some problems in this field is the basic motivation for the present study and the main difference from our previous studies stanev et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the water and salt balances which are intimately related to their major physical drivers such as evaporation precipitation and river run off are at the heart of dynamics of estuarine basins however these balances are largely dependent on the dynamical control in the straits connecting the semi enclosed basins and open ocean and in particular on the atmospheric and tidal forcings there are a number of process studies dealing with hydraulics in the straits two layer exchange and outflows which captured the basic physics stigebrandt 1983 armi 1986 armi and farmer 1988 farmer and armi 1988 borenäs and lundberg 1986 pratt and lundberg 1991 laanearu and lundberg 2000 gustafsson 2004 garrett 2004 arneborg et al 2007 there are also many 3d numerical model studies lehmann 1995 schrum 1997 schrum and backhaus 1999 meier et al 1999 janssen 2002 some of which show large bias in the water balance and a tendency towards reduced salinities as recognized by janssen et al 2001 and omstedt et al 2014 the ability of the models to simulate saltwater inflows through the kattegat into the baltic proper to continuously renew the baltic deep water and keep the halocline stable is a prerequisite for multi year simulations of the baltic sea in earlier 3d modelling studies the transition zone between the baltic sea and north sea hereinafter the area including the kattegat danish straits and the western part of the baltic sea will be referred to as the north sea baltic sea transition zone nbtz was resolved in the best case with grids of 1 km and even coarser in scenario studies this resolution is not optimal for narrow straits such as the sound or little belt cross sectional area in the straits depends also on the position of sea level which is not fixed therefore climate model scenarios meier et al 2017 could be affected by sea level rise sensitivity to global changes is expected to be strongest in the shallow straits where the dynamic balances could change if sea level change is comparable with the depth some positive trends of the structured grid modelling of water exchange between the north sea and baltic sea with respect to model resolution requirement are documented by gräwe et al 2015 who used a multi nested modeling system with horizontal resolution ranging between 8 km and 600 m in the straits mohrholz et al 2015 also reported model simulations with resolution of 600 m even with this fine resolution models cannot fully resolve the geometry of the little belt or the complex topographic structures of the other two straits therefore another strong motivation for this study is to investigate the model performance when using ultra fine resolution scales e g between 100 and 500 m using one way nesting techniques is also not adequate to address the dynamics of inter connected basins e g the coupled system north sea baltic sea in this case the possible interaction between dynamics in the straits and in the basins connected by the straits is missing thus insufficient model resolution and one way nesting are considered the major sources of uncertainties and explain the limited or controversial knowledge of the straits role in the dynamics of the european seas the key and different role of individual baltic sea straits and sills in water exchange and mixing still remains largely unclear one problem revealed by the field campaigns is the intermittent regime of straits exchange and diverse appearances of inflow and associated mixing and entrainment all of which have relatively small spatial scales a clear 4d view based on observations on temporally variable inflows and outflows in the straits areas is still missing numerical modelling is considered here as an important research tool as complementary to observations to address the complexity of straits dynamics unstructured grid models overcome some nesting and resolution problems and allow addressing various ocean and coastal scales at the same time lermusiaux et al 2013 danilov 2013 scholz et al 2013 stanev et al 2017 the simulation of water exchange in the nbtz zhang et al 2016a also demonstrated promising perspectives earlier kliem et al 2006 described simulation for the baltic sea using a 2d unstructured grid model in the present study we describe the improvements in the set up used here in comparison to the model of zhang et al 2016a for the same area it is not possible in a single study to address all interesting physical aspects studied in several dozen previously published papers therefore we will focus our analysis on 1 model validation against observations in the nbtz 2 the role of resolution 3 responses to atmospheric forcing with time scales ranging from synoptic to annual and 4 the appearances of the two layer strait exchange in the individual straits dynamics studied earlier will be presented in more general terms just to demonstrate the consistency of the present numerical simulations with the previous studies this study is an extension of the work of zhang et al 2016a but focused on the major baltic sea inflow mbi in 2014 2015 it adds to the study of stanev et al 2015 which addressed simulations of earlier mbi s and the inter dependence between transports in the individual straits one improvement here is that we increase the horizontal resolution in the straits by about ten times compared to the 0 5 nm horizontal resolution of stanev et al 2015 who used a two way nested modelling approach another new aspect is the more profound model validation in the nbtz and inter comparison of results from numerical simulations using grids with different resolutions one specific research challenge not addressed in our previous studies motivating the present study is the impact of sea level dynamics on the variability of water and salt exchange in the north sea and baltic sea this issue is relevant to the causality of inflow events we will also address the interdependency of the exchange flows in the individual straits and the temporal and spatial variability of the two layer exchange in a following publication the emphasis will be on the quantification of individual processes governing the two layer exchange and mixing in the nbtz the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the numerical model its validation against observations is presented in section 3 sections 4 and 5 describe the circulation in the nbtz and its temporal and spatial variability section 6 addresses the response of individual straits to atmospheric forcing and regional inter dependence between straits transport and sea level section 7 presents the two layer exchange in the three straits connecting the north sea and the baltic sea and section 8 quantifies the advantage of using ultra fine resolution in the straits the paper ends with a brief conclusion 2 numerical model 2 1 model description semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism is a derivative product of the original selfe semi implicit eulerian lagrangian finite element model zhang and baptista 2008 with many improvements described in zhang et al 2016b schism solves the primitive equations using a hybrid finite element and finite volume approach an example of the grid is shown in fig 3 a terms that place stringent stability constraints e g cfl are treated implicitly eulerian lagrangian method elm is used for the momentum advection the model version used in this study is hydrostatic with boussinesq approximation the combination of galerkin finite element method gfem with 1 the implicit time stepping which enables efficiency and robustness and with 2 the elm enables a good balance in terms of numerical diffusion and dispersion because numerical diffusion inherent in an implicit method and elm balances out by the numerical dispersion inherent in gfem the model is not immune to sensitivity with respect to grid generation see next section schism has been previously used to simulate the circulation in the north sea and baltic sea zhang et al 2016a and therefore its presentation here is very short the parameterizations see zhang et al 2016a b allow resolving the baroclinic instability which is very important for areas dominated by eddy dynamics bottom roughness is set to a constant value of 0 5 mm the bi harmonic viscosity used is described by zhang et al 2016b no explicit horizontal diffusivity is used as the higher order solver is monotone by design the vertical viscosity and diffusivity are calculated from the generic length scale model umlauf and burchard 2003 with a k kl configuration the improvements in the present paper compared to the setup of zhang et al 2016a are basically associated with better resolution in some critical areas and with improved forcing 2 2 model area bathymetry data used in the present study are the same as the ones used by zhang et al 2016a however additionally we use here the baltic sea bathymetry database version 0 9 3 http data bshc pro last accessed on june 5 2015 with 500 m resolution to improve the bathymetry in the nbtz model refinements compared to bathymetry and grid of zhang et al 2016a have also been done in skagerrak norwegian trench wadden sea and the area around the mouth of oder river the computational grid has 400 k nodes compared with about 300 k nodes in the topography of zhang et al 2016a with a minimum grid side length of 80 m in the narrow areas of the little belt fig 3 the model grid for the other two straits is shown for example in the supplementary material fig s1 and fig s2 most of the change of resolution is specified on the shallow shelf where dynamics are dominated by friction an essentially uniform resolution of 3 km is used in the open sea parts of two basins minimizing wave distortion because of non uniform resolution in unstructured grid models the vertical lsc2 grid described by zhang et al 2015 is used here see fig 3b it allows flexible placement of vertical nodes at each horizontal position the vanishing quasi sigma vqs dukhovskoy et al 2009 ensures smoothness among neighboring nodes shaved cell technique zhang et al 2015 eliminates staircases shuts down the diapycnal mixing and reduces the co ordinate slope and thus the pressure gradient errors tests conducted to demonstrate the performance of the lsc2 grid can be found in zhang et al 2015 as demonstrated by zhang et al 2016a on the example of baltic proper see their figure fig a 1 the use of lsc2 grid contributes to simulating realistic stratification this couldn t be achieved in s grid even with the number of layers being doubled the vertical lsc2 grid used here consists of up to 59 layers in the norwegian trench with an average number of 31 levels in the whole model domain 2 3 initialization and forcing monthly climatological salinity and temperature data janssen et al 1999 are used to initialize the model like this was the case in the paper by zhang et al 2016a however we use here finer resolution data for atmospheric forcing including hourly wind atmospheric pressure air temperature dew point temperature and cloud cover from the 7 km resolution cosmo eu model of german weather service dwd from these data the wind stress fluxes of sensible and latent heat as well as short wave and long wave radiation are computed the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi ehype pan european hydrological predictions for the environment product is used for the freshwater fluxes from 34 rivers discharging into the baltic sea and north sea the model has two open boundaries west of the english channel and between the british isles and scandinavia fig 1 at these boundaries hourly values of elevation horizontal velocity salinity and temperature were used which were taken from the copernicus product http marine copernicus eu last accessed in may 2017 interpolated at each time step onto the model grid the use of these data is considered an optimal solution because they are dynamically consistent based on up to date modelling o dea et al 2012 and have been validated extensively after an initialization period of four years the model is run for another two years 1 march 2014 to 31 march 2016 which is the period analyzed in this paper we will refer to this reference experiment as the control run cr an additional experiment was carried out in which all areas in the nbtz where the resolution in the cr was finer than 500 m were resolved with a horizontal resolution of 500 m we will refer to this experiment w as the e 500 389k nodes comparison between fig 3c d and fig 3a b illustrates the difference in the model resolution of two experiments for the area of little belt fig s1 and fig s2 illustrate the difference between the cr and e 500 for the straits of sound and great belt respectively the simulations were conducted on mistral peta scale supercomputer of the german climate computing center deutsches klimarechenzentrum gmbh dkrz on 1024 cpus the model runs 150 times faster than real time 3 validation against observations 3 1 sea level and transport in the straits the overall performance of schism for the area in the present study has been addressed by zhang et al 2016a therefore the validation here will focus primarily on areas and specific periods which have not been addressed in this earlier study and include the nbtz and periods of recent extreme events the studied period is chosen such that it includes the mbi in 2014 2015 for which there are already observations mohrholz et al 2015 and analyses the realism of the model with respect to the transport in the straits will be assessed we will compare our estimates with the computations based on the method proposed by håkansson citation from meier et al 2003 which assumes a balance between along strait pressure gradient and bottom friction term this dominant balance is proven in those studies after estimating the correlation between sea level difference in two locations at both sides of the straits and the observed volumetric flows obtained from adcp ship borne transects and moored aanderaa current meters across the drogden sill the calibration proposed by those authors used the two tide gauge stations viken and klagshamn located in the northern and southern entrance of the sound respectively see fig 2 for their positions the index of agreement d proposed by willmott 1981 measures the degree to which the observed data o is estimated by the predicted value p 1 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 here n is the number of observations index i and the overbar is the temporal mean of the observed data a value of 1 would indicate perfect agreement whereas a value of 0 would indicate no agreement at all in the third and fourth line of table 1 p and o are the normalized transports estimated from the parametric model presented by meier et al 2003 and numerical model respectively the observed and simulated sea levels at these two stations are in a very good agreement fig 4 a b and table 1 noteworthy is the phase difference between sea level at these stations compare fig 4a and fig 4b the pressure gradient between the two of them changes to strongly negative fig 4e giving the first push of the mbi in 2014 the timing of this event is shown by the vertical green line the model errors are small in comparison to the variances of analyzed variables and therefore d is quite high the index of agreement from the parametric model of 0 97 is considered here as an ideal agreement because it is based on calibrated data our simulations yield 0 94 which demonstrated that the agreement between the observations and the fluxes q m computed with schism is very close to that ideal case the temporal evolution of sea level fig 4a c up to the baltic sea stations visby and degerby the latter known recently as föglö see fig 1 for their position demonstrates a synchronous sea level dynamics over a larger area the green vertical line shows that phase differences are relatively small these stations are representative of the volume change of the whole baltic sea e g jacobsen 1980 as demonstrated by janssen et al 2001 station degerby has high skill in describing the variability of baltic sea surface elevation the accurate predictions of sea level elevation in stations visby and degerby manifests the model skill with respect to the dominant dynamics in the baltic sea according to håkansson citation from meier et al 2003 the agreement between the observed and simulated sea levels at stations viken and klagshamn guarantees a correct prediction of the volumetric transport through the sound this concept is based on the assumption of balance between along strait pressure gradient and bottom friction term it is supported by the third and fourth lines in table 1 which show the agreement between non dimensional sea level differences at these two stations and net transport see also fig 4e notably the parametric estimations of håkansson were calibrated to observations schism was not specifically calibrated these results indicate that also in schism the balance between along strait pressure gradient and bottom friction plays the major role in the sound furthermore the correct estimate of the straits transport is a prerequisite for the good model skill in the entire baltic sea obviously the good skill in stations visby and degerby fig 4a c and in the straits are consistent with each other 3 2 currents in the straits data from three adcp stations in the danish straits operated by the dmi are used here to validate simulated currents two stations østerrenden 55 363266 n 11 022787e and vengeancegrund 55 207542 n11 086632e are in the great belt and the third drogden fyr 55 536380 n 12 711413e is in the sound see fig 2 for their position data used here are recorded at 3 depths at all three stations during 01 october 2014 01 june 2015 comparison with simulations demonstrated a good qualitative agreement at the three stations fig 5 the model overestimates slightly the velocity maxima the quantitative validation shows that the coefficient of agreement is above 0 82 reaching 0 94 at vengeancegrund table 2 compared to the relatively large amplitudes of currents the rms error is not too big the maximum bias is 6 cm s which is also reasonable keeping in mind that model forcing is not perfect it is noteworthy that the signals in the two straits differ substantially not only by their magnitude but also by phase 3 3 salinity earlier validations of schism against marnet observations http www bsh de en marine data observations marnet monitoring network index jsp last accessed july 2017 revealed a good consistency of simulations zhang et al 2016a in the following we will present model validation against different data source e g freely available ctd and bottle data from the international council for the exploration of the sea ices database http ocean ices dk hydchem hydchem aspx plot yes last accessed july 2017 from this dataset we selected the observations situated along the pathway of salt intrusions by 1 by 5 by 7 and by 15 see fig 1 for their positions the validation was performed for a period of one year starting 1 september 2014 and thus covering the time of the mbi during the winter 2014 2015 the ability of model to capture the change of thermohaline characteristics of the north sea waters penetrating into the baltic sea during the mbi along their way over the sills and in the small regional sub basins is illustrated in fig 6 simulations and observations show clearly the delayed appearance of salt water intrusions with increasing distance from the straits as well as a decrease of the amplitude of salinity outbreak associated with the mbi at stations far from the nbtz the model skill is good d is above 0 91 in bottom layers in all stations in the surface layers d is also above 0 91 only in stations by 7 and by 5 d drops to 0 80 which is a reasonable value taking into consideration possible errors in the model and its forcing namely using hourly data with 7 km horizontal resolution is perhaps still not fine enough since the baltic sea is enclosed basin unresolved atmospheric dynamics in its large coastal areas could bias ocean simulations bulk aerodynamic formulas are also not perfect using coupled atmosphere ocean models with high resolution in the straits and other sensitive areas could be an adequate step toward improvement of atmospheric forcing the time versus depth diagrams of salinity fig 7 demonstrate that the time when the mixed north sea water reaches the observational locations is very well forecasted by the model in the stations darss and arkona simulated salinity values exceed the observed ones while in the gotland basin simulated bottom salinity values are slightly underestimated compare fig 7g and h although peaks in salinity associated with the mbi are slightly overestimated in the shallow nbtz area the mixing on their way down to the gotland basin reduces the magnitude of salinity signal below the observed values the agreement between simulations and observations in the gotland basin is very valuable because the gotland basin integrates temporal development of salinity in the kattegat belt sea and the western baltic janssen et al 2001 in conclusion without special tuning the model captures salinity intrusions in the straits the deterioration of the bottom water properties in e 500 will be addressed in section 8 see the panels on the right of fig 7 more realistic representation of the penetration of mixed water down to the gotland basin and its spreading there could be achieved after a closer look at the parameterizations used which will be addressed in future publications 4 overall presentation of the circulation in the nbtz the model allows resolving sharp fronts in salinity the panels on the left hand side of fig 8 and numerous small scale features in the relative vorticity the panels on the right hand side of fig 8 the comparison between the inflow and outflow patterns demonstrates that the position of positive and negative vorticity alternates that is demonstrated well in the great belt the vorticity alternation follows the alternating direction of flow in the straits with a much coarser resolution as used in earlier modelling studies based on structured grids one cannot accurately resolve the velocity gradients in the straits the zoom in views of the model grid in fig 3 see also supplementary figs s1 and s2 and the insets in the sound and great belt shown in fig s3 support this conclusion the complex flow structure could be important for the resistance in the straits which depends on the velocity shear the above reasoning is supported by the analysis on the role of horizontal resolution cr versus e 500 presented in section 8 with increasing distance from the straits the scales of vorticity patterns increase most of them show an elongated shape which is explained by the predominant narrow jets in the area of the arkona and bornholm basins the inflow and outflow situations are well distinguished in the salinity patterns fig 8a c during the outflow conditions low salinity surface water displaces to the north see also the sharp front in fig s3e f resulting in a reduction of sea surface salinity sss in the kattegat by about 6 the propagation pathways of these low salinity water masses are well seen in the plumes originating from the great belt and sound fig 8a the salinity front separating the skagerrak water mass from the kattegat water mass is pushed north of the skagen fig 8a in most inflow cases the skagerrak water with higher salinity depicts a jet like propagation pattern in the direction of the sound the front separating these two water masses is extremely strong reaching more than 10 salinity units per km fig s3f at certain times the two straits provide two sources of high salinity water entering the bornholm basin fig 8c the vertical salinity section through the sound shows a typical gravity current type propagation starting from the drogden sill the shallowest location in fig 9 this current is seen even better in the turbulent kinetic energy tke patterns maximum values are in a thin bottom layer tke shows another maximum zone at the northern entrance of the sound where the jet from the kattegat converges towards the strait fig 8c this is a zone of extreme vertical mixing its dynamics can change vertical stratification and strongly affect the propagation properties of gravity currents the tke decreases in the middle of the water column particularly in the baltic sea part of the cross section it further increases in the surface layer displaying a characteristic profile known from other similar strait environments stanev et al 2017 5 temporal and spatial patterns of inflows and outflows 5 1 chronology of the mbi in 2014 2015 inflows and outflows in the danish straits have much in common with tidally driven estuarine exchange however in the case of the baltic sea the role of atmospheric forcing is more important than that of tides stanev et al 2015 mbis are to a first order barotropic phenomena driven by an emptying refilling process of the baltic sea schimanke et al 2014 existing concepts explaining their chronology have been mostly based on observations lass and matthäus 1996 however observations are not available over large areas and for sufficiently long periods furthermore mbis appear rarely about once per ten years in the recent times and their statistical description is difficult numerical modelling provides an opportunity to address the timing and causality of mbi for the entire area of inter connected basins the temporal spatial evolution of mbi during 2014 2015 is presented in fig 10 along the section line shown in fig 1 in the area of the straits this line follows the section line through the sound as shown in fig 2 sea level in the baltic sea is higher than in the north sea this is typical in estuarine basins the mean difference between the areas to the left and to the right of drogden sill see the blue arrows in fig 10 is 17 cm this sill the shallowest depth in fig 9 physically separates the two basins as seen by the variability pattern in fig 10a we will come again to the separation issue in section 6 1 in the north sea the temporal variability is dominated by tides for better readability of plots model data have been filtered with a window of 1 day so only neap spring variability is seen in fig 10 sea level variability in the baltic sea is largely driven by atmospheric forcing the event at the beginning of december 2014 is of particular importance on 2 december 2014 triangle symbol on the time axis in fig 10a sea level in the baltic sea dropped to 52 cm below the sea level found to the north of the sound see also fig 4 manifesting the precursory period in only 2 days this slope triggered a huge transport mbi resulting in an increase of sea level in the baltic sea by 82 cm during the next 40 days fig 4c d a similar situation was observed in november 2015 this time the mbi appearing as two strong pulses in the winter of 2015 2016 fig 10a the presentation in fig 10a is instructive also for some important general circulation features one feature is the low sea level at km 800 in the skagerrak that reflects the cyclonic rotation of currents there as seen in fig 10e bottom salinity in the baltic sea shows an increase positive anomaly right after the outbreak of mbi in 2014 this signal propagates to the east which is deduced from the slope of the salinity anomaly pattern the speed of propagation decreases with increasing distance from the strait particularly approaching the gotland basin this basin is the final destination of positive bottom salinity anomaly compare with the delay of phases of salinity signal illustrated by the blue line in fig 6 there is not a clear response of the bottom salinity in the north sea to the mbi which is easily understandable however this does not hold for the sss indeed the surface plume propagation depicts situations with alternating positive and negative anomalies which propagate to the west the slope of contours in the north sea fig 10c is opposite to the one in the baltic sea fig 10e the overall temporal variability is approximately seasonal what seems non trivial is that the largest positive anomalies on both sides of the drogden sill are generated almost simultaneously and propagate in both directions as surface plumes in the north sea and bottom plumes in the baltic sea another interesting result of the simulations is the entrapment of saltier water at about km 1500 which is the area of bornholm basin red arrows in fig 10 this basin accumulates saltier water and acts as a long term reservoir which sporadically discharges parcels of salty water to the east this is seen as short term positive anomaly strips following the direction of bottom water propagation while the presence of these strips is consistent with the dominant concept about the periodic export of saltier bottom waters from the retention basins e g the bornholm basin jakobsen 1995 an explanation of the vertical strips seen in the bottom salinity anomaly is needed this is not an unphysical result its appearance is explained by the fact that the anomalies of bottom salinity depend on the position of the chosen thalweg as well as on the vertical stratification the latter is highly variable in different depth intervals 5 2 different dynamics in the three straits comparison of the schism simulations in the three straits little belt great belt and sound are shown in fig 11 in order to give more detailed views on the results time versus distance diagrams in these figures are shown only in the nbtz that is along the section lines in fig 2 while the pressure gradient forcing appears in a semi coherent way in the three straits the temporal spatial response of individual straits to atmospheric forcing is rather different the sea level anomalies left panels in fig 11a are extremely large in the winter months of 2014 and 2015 providing the major drivers for the strong inter basin exchange this barotropic forcing triggers a clear salinity response in the three straits which largely differs between the surface and bottom layers in the sound fig 11b pulses of higher salinity surface water are very weak and with a very small along strait extension however bottom salinity pulses appear quasi periodically in this strait fig 11c the strongest of them extends up to the bornholm basin km 300 the low salinity values in the sound area between km 150 and 250 in fig 11c do not mean an absence of salinity intrusions there but demonstrate that these are shallow areas with salinity values close to the surface ones saltier mixed north sea water shows much longer excursions in the great belt both in the surface and bottom layers than in the surface layers of sound great belt section reveals the zones of saltier bottom waters in the arkona basin about km 300 note that the position of 300 km along the sound pathway almost coincides with the position of 500 km along the great belt section fig 2 these positions demarcate the bornholm basin an area of salt water accumulation in the two straits mbi is better identified by the salinity change in the bottom layers the comparison between the sections along the great belt and sound which slightly overlap at the end of the great belt section demonstrates that the high bottom salinity reflects the water originating from the sound this conclusion is justified by the fact that the bottom salinity maximum at about km 500 along the great belt section is separated from the main pulse of saltier bottom water the little belt shows more diffuse patterns which is due to the fact that the narrow opening in this strait needs more time to propagate the saltier north sea water while the importance of the little belt for the exchange between the north sea and baltic sea is small under normal events it becomes more substantial during the mbi in the southernmost part of the section line in this strait at about km 200 a backward propagation of positive salinity anomaly occurs which is identified by the opposite slope of the contours in the time versus distance diagram this illustrates the fact that saltier water in the great belt which tends to fill the western baltic sea reaches this location faster and in bigger amounts than water originating from the little belt 6 synchronous and asynchronous responses in the individual straits 6 1 interdependence of straits transport and sea level it is still unclear whether the changes of sea level in the baltic sea and north sea are equally important for the net transport and what the expected dependence during inflow and outflow situations is to answer these questions we analyze first the dependence of the volume fluxes integrated over the threes straits on the difference between sea level in the kattegat and central baltic sea unlike the analysis presented in section 3 1 which was focused on the dominant frictional control in the straits the difference between sea levels in the kattegat and central baltic sea reflects the role of general oceanographic conditions in the two basins and can potentially elucidate the leading role of one of them see the discussion in section 3 1 about the representativeness of sea level in the central baltic sea the scatter plots in fig 12 are shown for two 14 days periods during which the transport was dominated by either outflow from the baltic sea 1 15 nov 2014 or inflow 6 21 dec 2014 as expected there is a clear correlation between sea level difference and net flow the smaller correlation during the inflow situation the period of mbi is not so trivial and is explained with the help of fig 12d the inflow period 1 was characterized by multiple pulses which is consistent with a similar situation during the 1993 mbi stanev et al 2015 this is comparable with the salinity change described by jakobsen 1995 inflows were characterized by larger oscillations while outflows showed smoother changes obviously the 1993 case observed by jakobsen 1995 was almost repeated in 2014 2015 the unstable dynamics during inflows thus makes it possible that large outflows occur in times of small sea level differences between the kattegat and central baltic sea i e oscillations of sea levels in the two basins and the strait flow could become asynchronous the correlation between the sea level differences between the two basins and the sea level in the kattegat fig 12b from one side and the central baltic sea fig 12c from the other demonstrates that the variability of sea level in the kattegat plays the leading role correlation 0 91 sea level in the central baltic sea correlates weakly with the sea level difference during outflows correlation 0 38 changes of sea level in the central baltic sea are more important for the inflows in this case the correlation reverses with 0 73 and 0 5 for the baltic sea and the kattegat respectively this result is reminiscent of similar results for the black sea mediterranean sea system based on analysis of observations volkov et al 2016 and numerical simulations stanev et al 2017 i e the major driver is the forcing from the outside basin however inflows are strongly dependent on the sea level in the central baltic sea which supports the existing concepts lass and matthäus 1996 the areal distribution of correlation between net straits transport and sea level fig 12e reveals an overall anti symmetric pattern positive correlation in the kattegat and negative correlation in the southern baltic sea with increasing distance from the straits the magnitude of correlation decreases this reflects the delay associated with the propagation of barotropic signal to remote locations the areas of transition from positive to negative values are very sharp and identify the natural physical boundaries between the north sea and baltic sea the trend of larger negative correlations along the scandinavian baltic sea coast reveals the role of geostrophic control the larger correlation along the south western coast of kattegat is explained with the larger tidal range there see fig 6 of stanev et al 2015 6 2 similarities and differences in the response of individual straits to atmospheric forcing using a numerical model with horizontal resolution of 0 5 nm stanev et al 2015 demonstrated that the correlation between transports in the sound and great belt cannot be represented with a simple linear regression line this does not fully conform to the simple idea that the transports in the straits are linearly proportional the coefficient being the ratio between cross sectional areas there are different estimates for this ratio mattsson 1996 claims that the narrow passages in the belt sea have vertical cross sectional areas on the order of 300 000 m2 while the narrow cross sectional areas in the sound are about 60 000 m2 they found that the mean partition of the instantaneous flows through the great belt sea and sound is 8 2 rather than the generally accepted at that time estimate of 8 3 kullenberg and jacobsen 1981 reported a quite different ratio between cross sectional areas of two straits they claimed that the cross sectional area over the sill in the sound was 0 1 km2 in the belt sea the narrowest section was 0 16 km2 the ratio between the transports in the two straits estimated by sayin and krauss 1996 was 3 1 the estimations of jakobsen and trebuchet 2000 for the transport ratio tr was 2 67 the estimation of fu 2013 was 2 78 besides the ratio between transports in the two strait the response times are also subject to large uncertainties stanev et al 2015 one could expect that the differences between previous estimates of exchange flows were most probably due to the use of different cross sectional areas more generally topographies the areas of narrowest cross sections in the two straits based on the topography and model resolution used in the present study are 121 100 m² and 73 000 m² the ratio between the smallest cross sectional areas of the great belt between nakskov and langeland and sound in our model is 1 66 we will call this number area ratio ar the barotropic transports in the great belt and sound for october 2014 may 2015 indicate that the magnitudes of oscillations in the two straits largely exceed the mean values fig 13 a in the great belt the rms difference of barotropic transport from its mean value is 6 64 104 m³ s the corresponding number for the sound is 2 89 104 m³ s while the net transport for the baltic sea is about 1 5 104 m³ s liljebladh and stigebrandt 1996 the averaged tr for october 2014 may 2015 estimated here is 2 70 see the regression curve in fig 13b which compares well with the numbers 2 63 2 75 of stanev et al 2015 who used a model of the same area with a resolution of 1 km this result can serve as a justification that the tr is reasonably simulated even with this coarse resolution of 1 km there is a substantial difference between the tr estimated from the regression curve 2 70 and the ar 1 66 demonstrating that the narrower and shallower strait sound exerts larger resistance the scatter plot fig 13b gives an idea about the robustness and stability of the above averaged estimates the comparison between this averaged number 2 70 and the large variance of tr 2 30 demonstrated the complex inter relationship between transports in the two straits see fig 13g and their large variations over time stronger variability in the great belt compared to the sound is partially due to high frequency tidal oscillations in the former the sound effectively filters out the tidal oscillations stanev et al 2015 the distribution of the tr is non gaussian fig 13e there is a clear inflow tail i e the transport in the sound gets relatively stronger during inflow events this tendency during inflows is illustrated in the comparison between fig 13c and d where the distribution of the tr is separately shown for inflow and outflow cases although the shapes of these histograms are not fully identical with the results of stanev et al 2015 compare with their fig 8 the overall result suggests that the change in transport starts first in the sound the temporal evolution of the distribution of the transport ratio fig 13g clearly explains the non gaussian shape of histograms the asynchronous responses of the two straits revealed by the asymmetry of the curve in fig 13f against zero time lag is explained as a result of the sound being closer to the inflowing waters which follow the eastern kattegat coast see fig 8c unlike the similar analysis in stanev et al 2015 we did not filter out the tides therefore the lagged time correlation in fig 13f is affected by m2 tides the basic difference between the correlation of barotropic transports in the little belt and great belt not shown here from the case addressed above sound and great belt is that the coefficient in the regression curve is about two times smaller because the transport in the little belt is about half of that in the sound notably the average tr 5 11 is much smaller than its variance of 12 96 due to a very low correlation between the flows in the little belt and great belt 7 two layer exchange in the straits in some straits connecting estuarine basins with the neighboring seas the net transport in the upper and bottom layers shows opposite trends with the increase of net outflow i e the transport in the direction of the long term mean barotropic transport the upper layer flow increases and the bottom flow decreases and is sometimes blocked during the inflow situation the upper layer transport decreases and the bottom layer transport increases möller 1928 this old concept usually assumes that there are two water masses in the upper and bottom layers moving in opposite directions separated by an interface where velocity tends to zero this is a typical situation in estuarine circulation one such case is the strait of bosporus where the two layer exchange is well known in the nbtz the frontal area separating the kattegat and baltic sea water masses is periodically displaced back and forth by the atmospheric forcing fig 9a c the vertical structure of the two layer flow is not always well pronounced unlike in the bosporus strait see for more detail stanev et al 2017 the latter resembles a salt wedge where the interface is almost horizontal slope of 1 2 m per kilometer and covers the entire strait the simulated dynamics in the baltic sea straits show rather different and more diverse appearances the lack of profile observations over large areas in the straits makes it impossible to validate extensively the two layer volume exchange we can at least compare the present simulations against other similar cases and check whether concepts valid for other straits hold for the baltic sea straits whether this is the case everywhere in these straits and what the differences are as shown in section 3 1 the volumetric transport is simulated reasonably well fig 4 this barotropic transport integrated over the sections shown in fig 14 a is used as the independent variable x axis in fig 14 against which we compare the transports in the upper and bottom layers across the same sections y axis along most of these sections the simulated upper layer flow decreases and the bottom layer flow increases with decreasing net transport this supports the previous estimates based on simulations with the same model and observations in other similar straits stanev et al 2017 it is noteworthy that the model has not been specially tuned to earlier theoretical analyses some of which were based on simpler theoretical concepts or observations this demonstrates that these results have general applicability what has not been sufficiently addressed in earlier analyses in the nbtz is the spatial variability of the dependence of transport in each layer on the net transport this is illustrated in fig 14 for three sections in the little belt on the left four sections in the belt sea in the middle and four sections in the sound on the right the positions of the analyzed sections are shown in fig 14a the plots on the top correspond to the northernmost transect and the plot on the bottom to the southernmost transect the comparison between two layer flows in the three straits shows similar trends but the magnitudes are different notice different ranges for each strait with the exception of the northernmost section in the sound fig 14c and the southernmost section in the little belt fig 14j all other plots show that in most cases the flow is unidirectional for most of the transport variability ranges this means that either the surface or bottom flow equals the net transport i e we observe a blocking of transport in one of the layers oğuz et al 1990 as the magnitude of net transport decreases below some critical value the transport becomes two directional this transition is not linear as seen by the curvature of transport dependence in an idealized case the surface and bottom transports can be represented by two crossing curves oğuz et al 1990 this would mean that for one value of net transport there is one and only one pair of values for the upper and bottom layer transports the scatter of data suggests that the appearance of two layer transport is quite diverse different possible combinations of surface and bottom flows could correspond to the same net transport furthermore the scatter is different in different straits and at different locations in the straits this manifests that there are not a unique critical values of net water transport beyond which two layer transport transforms into one layer transport several representative examples are addressed below one for each strait extreme transports in the little belt are more than five times smaller than the extreme transports in the great belt two way transport is observed for only very low net transports below 3 103 m3 s 1 0 003 sv at the southernmost end of this strait the spread of data is large which suggests that the two layer transport there is substantially affected by other processes e g the local circulation after the flow leaves this narrow strait along the entire great belt from the northernmost reaches down to the fehmarn belt the transport curves look very similar the largest scatter of data at the fehmarn belt and at the northernmost section is due to larger scale oceanographic conditions that is in these areas simple concept of straits transport are not applicable blocking events for surface and bottom flows occur at different net transports which is most pronounced for the section across langeland fjord fig 14h in this case the asymmetry of curves left and right of the zero transport value is clearly seen furthermore for all sections there is no unique magnitude of net transport beyond which blocking events occur at the great belt south section fig 14e upper layer transport is blocked for net transport above 0 3 105 m3 s 1 for the bottom layer transport the respective value is 0 2 105 m3 s 1 north of the sound the scatter of data demonstrates that this area is subject to oceanographic conditions originating from the kattegat e g transport appears rather stochastic and not fully constrained by the straits dynamics and therefore for the same net transport different combinations of surface and bottom transport are possible the upper and bottom layer transport across the southern sections in the sound are much more constrained by the straits physics and therefore the scatter of data is smaller nevertheless the scatter of data is too big to define a threshold value for blocking either surface or bottom transport in the sound it is interesting to see that this scatter increases in some sections fig 14f but only under the inflow situation this is similar to the case in the great belt fig 14h but much more clearly pronounced in the sound asymmetric response this is in qualitative agreement with the results shown in fig 12 and previous analyses of jakobsen 1995 and stanev et al 2015 in conclusion the scatter of individual transports is usually larger at both ends of the strait while in the middle of the straits the relationships are reminiscent of the canonical relationship known for other straits although the simulated two layer transport is similar to other strait cases there are specific asymmetries in the baltic sea straits the relationships between the net transport and transport in the surface and bottom layer are not unique thus deviating from simple theoretical estimations 8 fine versus coarse resolution simulations with a resolution of 500 m in the nbtz the cross sectional areas in the great belt and sound are 122 300 m² and 68 800 m² respectively 121 100 m² and 73 000 m² in cr the tr is 1 78 1 65 in cr thus it changed relatively little 8 with changing the resolution this small change is at least partially due to the fact that the dem used in the cr and e 500 is the same however as seen in fig 3 the straits are resolved in the cr with only a few vertical columns therefore although the changes of topography in the cr and e 500 were relatively small the different horizontal resolution led to substantial effects which will be considered below in the great belt the mean magnitude of barotropic transport during october 2014 may 2015 changed from 9 32 104 m³ s in the cr to 8 49 104 m³ s in e 500 the respective numbers for the sound are 4 66 104 m³ s and 4 08 104 m³ s the averaged tr between the simulated transports in the two straits for the same period changed from 2 70 cr to 3 0 e 500 the analysis of transport properties in the two straits fig s4 similar to what has been shown in fig 13 for cr demonstrated that the changes in the model resolutions affected the tr distribution curves compare the histograms in fig 13 and fig s4 the inflow histogram in e 500 tends to a gaussian type which can be interpreted as a trend to lower asymmetry between strait exchanges in the case of coarser resolution of straits the temporal evolution of the distribution of the tr compare fig 13g and fig s4g gives another illustration of the differences between the two experiments each time slice in these plots represents a normalized histogram of the tr analyzed for a period of three days the secondary maximum in the histograms during outflow conditions fig s4d is clearly seen for small and negative values of tr fig s4g although the transport in the straits does not change drastically in the two experiments their relative distribution and correlation is strongly affected by the horizontal resolution the areal distribution of correlation between the transport in the straits and sea level in e 500 almost repeats the pattern shown in fig 12e the difference between the respective correlations in two experiments can be used to identify areas where changes in the dynamical balances occur this difference does not exceed several percent fig 12f however its pattern is not trivial notably far from the straits where the horizontal resolution in the two experiments is the same the areal distribution of this correlation is different the coarser resolution of narrow sections in e 500 results in an overall decrease of correlation in the kattegat the maximum decrease is along the western coast where the tidal range is larger stanev et al 2015 south of the straits the correlation increases in e 500 in comparison to cr and the difference pattern in fig 12f depicts approximately the propagation pathway of the north sea mixed water the correlation pattern shows strong sensitivity to horizontal resolution in narrow channels e g between the langeland and the fyn sio sound and in the area around darss sill in both areas fig 12f shows reversals of correlation and small scale patterns demonstrating that dynamical changes can be locally strongly affected by the resolution in particular the response to changed resolution in the sound could explain at least some of the differences in the water mass transformation and propagation towards the gotland basin differences between the cr and e 500 originate from the areas where horizontal resolution has substantially been changed as can be seen in the enlarged diagrams in figs s3 and s5 inflow salinities are higher in the cr compare figs s3b f and s5b f and in the sound the core of high salinity water is very pronounced in the cr see the difference between figs s3f and s5f in the outflow situations shown in these figures salinity is lower in the cr of particular importance to illustrate the differences between the two experiments is the comparison of vorticity in the straits which yields information about the velocity shear in the sound these differences are much clearer during inflow events compare figs s3h and s5h the respective outflow situations figs s3g and s5g show much better similarity the conclusion is that with finer resolution in the cr compare fig s1b and d velocity shear along straits coasts is better resolved which changes the patterns of velocity and salinity in several of the illustrations figs 6 7 10 11 simulations with e 500 were shown next to ones from the cr but were not commented on because the analyses were focused on physical interpretation of results in the following we will present briefly the major differences between the cr and e 500 overall the fine resolution model overestimates bottom salinity in arkona basin fig 6a before the mbi bottom salinity in the bornholm basin simulated in the cr was closer to the observed one while after the mbi observed data lay between e 500 and the cr simulations fig 6c in the stolpe channel and further down to the gotland basin the quality of cr simulations was better notice the different colors in fig 6d corresponding to individual experiments sss values were much closer in the two models than the bottom ones obviously changing the resolution affects the properties of bottom layers the panels on the right hand side of fig 10 are based on the results from e 500 qualitatively both simulations look similar but differences on both sides of the straits are also clearly seen the low sea level in the area of skagerrak is further reduced in the e 500 simulations furthermore the positive sss anomaly is more pronounced in the north sea in e 500 these changes are explained by larger mixing in the straits overturning of water during extreme situations bringing bottom water closer to the sea surface which further propagates in the direction of the north sea compare also figs s3a e and s5a e after the mbi the freshening trend in e 500 is stronger these results prove that the resolution in the straits can affect remote areas the differences between two models are more obvious in the baltic sea where the bottom salinity anomaly is much clearer in the cr in e 500 the signal almost does not reach the gotland basin this is seen from the comparison between fig 7h and fig 7i and the data fig 7g and supports the conclusions from analysis of fig 6 with more realistic bottom topography and better resolution of the narrow flows the penetration of saltier water in the straits simulated in the cr is larger and their accumulation in the arkona basin and bornholm deep reservoir provides enough source water to be pushed via the stolpe channel in the direction of the gotland basin under favorable conditions compare fig 10e and f this is in line with the analysis of janssen 2002 who stated that ventilation of the gotland basin is only possible when water mass characteristics in the arkona basin are beyond a critical value enabling sufficient salty water to reach the bornholm basin obviously the cr fulfilled these requirements more complete presentation of the agreement between the two models is shown in fig 11 sss and bottom salinity along section lines in fig 2 simulated in the two experiments fig 11b c agree with each other as was also the case with the larger scale analysis in fig 10 although sss patterns qualitatively agree and the bottom salinity shows similar appearances of salt intrusions the magnitude of the variability is different in the two models particularly in the sound at all analyzed stations the cr gives larger salinity values more detailed analysis shows larger differences e g in station viken where e 500 shows lower amplitudes of oscillations in this location the position of the salinity front shifts under different resolutions which explains the relatively larger salinity differences there d 0 73 this changing skill of schism in different areas depending upon the resolution in the straits figs 6 and 7 gives a motivation to further address the parameterizations used to more reasonably simulate the penetration of the mixed north sea water along its way from the kattegat down to the gotland basin obviously the problem with realistic propagation of bottom water could not be resolved with the increased resolution in the straits alone 9 conclusions one basic idea behind this research was to use results from numerical modelling to address different issues of straits physics and dynamics of interconnected basins this approach is justified by the fact that observations are not available over large areas and for sufficiently long periods with the needed resolution an unstructured grid model was presented which overcame some deficiencies in past studies caused by the coarse resolution of the two layer exchange in the straits and or not using two way coupling between the general circulation of interconnected basins and straits physics analyses gave a closer look at the impact of ultra fine resolution scales e g between 100 and 500 m the extensive validation against available observations demonstrated a very good model skill giving sufficient credibility to simulations as 4d representation of dominant processes we used these synthetic data to explain the key and different role of individual baltic sea straits and the temporal and spatial variability of their dynamics the realism of the model was first demonstrated with respect to the transport in the straits and the variability of sea levels at two ends of the straits the volumetric transport showed a very good skill revealing the leading role of the balance between along strait pressure gradient and bottom friction furthermore the consistency between basin scale and strait scale dynamics appeared crucial for the quality of the simulated gravity flows and basin scale baroclinic dynamics the model appeared capable of capturing the change of thermohaline characteristics of the north sea waters penetrating into the baltic sea during the mbi along their way over the sills and in the small regional sub basins the timing of arrival of mixed north sea water at several observational locations was accurately forecasted the penetration of the bottom salinity signal into the gotland basin matched the observed one particularly well up to stolpe channel there are number of geophysical specificities which have been revealed from the simulations the sound appeared as an area where extreme vertical mixing changes vertical stratification and strongly affects the propagation properties of gravity currents in the baltic sea and surface plume in the north sea while the former can be expected the fate of the surface plume in the north sea was not so trivial this plume was seen as alternating positive and negative anomalies which propagated to the west it was demonstrated that the drogden sill played the role of the generator of large salinity anomalies mixer because of shallow depths these anomalies propagated in either direction depending on the alteration of the straits transport as surface plumes in the north sea and bottom plumes in the baltic sea substantial differences between short term variability during inflow and outflow situations were identified the inflows were characterized by multiple pulses and large oscillations in transport and salinity while the outflows showed smoother changes during periods of strong currents the flow in the straits was unidirectional decreasing the magnitude of the net transport below some critical value caused the transport to become two directional however the appearance of two layer transport was quite diverse which was seen by the different pairs of surface and bottom flows corresponding to the same net transport the magnitude of net flow beyond which one of the two way currents was blocked was also not unique this ambiguity was different in different straits and at different locations in the straits in the interior of the straits the two layer transport tended to the canonical one known from theory oguz et al 1990 north and south of the straits the scatter of transport pairs surface and bottom ones increased because these areas were exposed to oceanographic conditions furthermore the two layer exchange was not symmetric for inflow and outflow conditions non canonical behavior under the inflow situation the three individual straits revealed very different dynamics saltier mixed north sea water showed much longer excursions in the great belt both in the surface and bottom layers than in the surface layers of the sound nevertheless during the mbi of 2014 2015 the salinity signal in the bornholm basin reflected water originating from the sound although there are concepts about the causality of inflow events svansson 1959 jakobsen et al 2010 schimanke et al 2014 the contribution of the sea level changes in the baltic sea and north sea for transports in the straits have not been previously quantified the model simulations were reminiscent of similar results for the black sea mediterranean sea system volkov et al 2016 i e the major driver was the forcing from the outside basin however inflows were strongly dependent on the sea level in the central baltic sea which supported the existing concepts lass and matthäus 1996 the correlation between net straits transport and sea level revealed an overall anti symmetric pattern the transition from positive to negative values made it possible to identify the natural physical boundaries between the north sea and baltic sea the interdependence of the exchange in the individual straits does not fully conform to the simple idea that transports in the straits are linearly proportional the coefficient being the ratio between the smallest cross sectional areas in fact the transport in the sound is smaller which reveals the stronger frictional control there we demonstrated that there are very complex relationships between transports in the two straits partially manifested by the large magnitudes of oscillations comparable to the mean values the coefficient of linear regression between transports in the sound and great belt increased during the mbi dominated cases demonstrating the role of the sound as a pathway for north sea waters associated with extreme events furthermore the transport in the great belt lags the one in the sound which was explained as a result of the sound being closer to the inflowing waters following the eastern coast of kattegat the changes in the model resolutions from fine to ultra fine affected the strait exchange the almost gaussian type histograms in the coarser simulation e 500 can be interpreted as a trend to lower asymmetry between strait exchanges in the case of coarser resolution of straits in the sound the position of the salinity front shifts under different resolutions overall the fine resolution model cr overestimated slightly bottom salinity in the arkona basin however in the stolpe channel and further down to the gotland basin the cr simulations were superior comparisons between the cr and e 500 proved that the resolution in the straits affects remote locations in both inter connected basins the improvements due to using ultra fine resolution appeared fundamental in the baltic sea allowing more realistic simulation of the propagation of the salinity signal down to the gotland basin this was due to the fact that in the cr the penetration of saltier water in the straits was larger and its accumulation in the bornholm deep reservoir provided enough source water for the deep ocean ventilation it is questionable whether the increased resolution in the straits alone could fully solve the problem with realistic propagation of bottom water some further improvement of model skill could be achieved after a closer look at the physical parameterizations contributing to more

24078,we present an analysis of two recent efforts aimed at quantifying the uncertainties in a 30 day hybrid coordinate ocean model forecast of the circulation in the gulf of mexico with particular emphasis on the separation of loop current eddy franklin using polynomial chaos methods the analysis herein explores whether the model perturbations lead to realistic representation of the uncertainty in the gulf circulation comparisons of model output with sea surface height and current mooring data show that the observational data generally falls within the envelope of the ensemble and that the modal decomposition delivers realistic perturbations in the loop current region we use information theory metrics to quantify the information gain and the computational trade offs between different wind and initial conditions perturbation modes the relative entropy measures indicate that two modes for initial condition perturbations are enough in our model configuration to represent the uncertainty in the loop current region while two modes for wind forcing perturbations are necessary in order to estimate the uncertainty in the coastal zone the ensemble statistics are then explored using the polynomial chaos surrogate and the newly developed contour boxplot methods keywords uncertainty quantification polynomial chaos relative entropy ocean modeling data depth 1 introduction the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill underscored the need for reliable oceanic and atmospheric forecasts in order to predict the trajectory and evolution of the oil spill forecasting systems are however inherently uncertain because of uncertainties in among other things the input data used to produce these forecasts such as initial conditions boundary conditions and subgrid parametrization useful forecasts need to quantify the uncertainties in their predictions so that the reliability of the forecast can be assessed the present article analyzes the performance of two recent efforts iskandarani et al 2016a li et al 2016 that have relied on polynomial chaos pc methods ghanem and spanos 1991 xiu and karniadakis 2002 le maître and knio 2010 iskandarani et al 2016b to quantify the uncertainties in forecasting the circulation in the gulf of mexico stemming from uncertainties in the initial conditions alone iskandarani et al 2016a or in combination with wind forcing uncertainties li et al 2016 the forecast timeline covers the oil spill period from may 1 30 2010 and coincides with an extended loop current lc that threatened to spread the oil along the south florida coast and eventually the eastern seaboard of the united states fortunately a lc detachment lc eddy franklin occured and confined the oil to the northern and central parts of the gulf of mexico the uncertainty analysis explores primarily whether the uncertainty in the lc location can be quantified given the uncertainties in the forecast model s data the studies in iskandarani et al 2016a and li et al 2016 were based on perturbing the model fields initial conditions and wind forcing with space time patterns obtained from an empirical orthogonal function eof decomposition where the amplitudes of these patterns were considered uncertain parameters the pc formalism was then applied to propagate the uncertainties forward efficiently by first running an ensemble of simulations using the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom to sample the uncertain parameter space second constructing polynomial based model surrogates that accurately represent the changes in model outputs caused by changes in model inputs and third using these surrogates to perform a reliable and efficient statistical analysis once the validity of the surrogates was established the choices made during the course of the uncertainty analysis in those two articles and which will be detailed in later sections have raised a number of issues that we wish to address here concerning the realism of the uncertainty analysis the computational and information trade offs in choosing different uncertain inputs and the exploration of the statistical information conveyed by the pc approach specifically in the present study we 1 assess the performance of the eof perturbed pc ensemble by comparing it to observational data both at the surface and at depth to verify whether the measurement data falls within the envelope of the pc ensemble 2 leverage the ability of pc methods to deliver output probability density function pdf to quantify using information theoretical measures the uncertainty lost by omitting some uncertain inputs or by limiting their variability a second aim of this paper is to explore the statistics of the ensemble in order to obtain the most representative ensemble member and to identify the outliers contour boxplot whitaker et al 2013 a generalization of the conventional boxplot is applied to the ensemble furthermore the output pdfs delivered by the pc method are used to explore the non gaussian statistics in the vicinity of the lc region in summary the present article is a follow on to iskandarani et al 2016a li et al 2016 and iskandarani et al 2016a identified the two leading eof modes whose amplitudes represented the uncertainties in the strength of an lc frontal eddy these modes were subsequently used to perturb the initial conditions of a control forecast iskandarani et al 2016a relied on a 49 member ensemble to build surrogates of model outputs validated their accuracy and used them for the statistical analysis li et al 2016 expanded the previous study by including additional eofs modes in the initial conditions perturbations as well as perturbations to the surface wind forcing their parameter space was eight dimensional and required a compressed sensing based procedure to construct model surrogates using a 798 member ensemble a variance based sensitivity analysis showed that uncertainties in the initial conditions dominated the forecast uncertainties in the deep parts of the gulf of mexico while wind forcing uncertainties were the dominant contributors on the continental shelves the present study compares the ensembles simulations to observations to assess whether the eof perturbations were adequate at representing the uncertainties in the forecast performs a cost benefit analysis regarding the enlargement of the uncertain parameter space and perform additional analysis regarding the statistical distribution of sea surface height at the end of the forecast no additional experiments were performed in the present study the layout of this paper is as follows section 2 provides a quick overview of the lc dynamics in the gulf of mexico summarizes the experimental setup of the two uncertainty experiments provides a brief description of the pc methodology and describes the specification of the input uncertainties section 3 compares the ensemble results against observational data the information trade offs between the different choices of the sources and variability of the input uncertainties are shown in section 4 section 5 presents the contour boxplot of the lc edge and the sea surface height ssh pdfs finally we conclude with a summary section 2 model and ensemble prediction the gulf of mexico where the deepwater horizon oil spill took place is a suitable test bed for uncertainty studies it is a well observed regional sea that presents many dynamical features typical of the deep ocean such as currents and eddying jets as shown in fig 1 the lc is a particularly dominant feature of the circulation in the gulf of mexico as it flows from the yucatan channel between mexico and cuba to the straits of florida between cuba and the southeastern u s the lc presents a time varying extension from a retracted path at the south of the basin to an extended one reaching the edge of the continental shelf in the northeastern gulf when it is extended the lc sheds a large anticyclonic eddy called lc eddy indicated by the anticyclonic arrow in black in the western gulf which then drifts westward and the lc retracts to the south this shedding sequence often implies temporary detachments of the lc eddy from the current before final separation small cyclonic eddies also called lc frontal eddies shown in white arrows at the edge of the lc play an active role in necking down and chopping the extended lc leading to the lc eddy detachments or separation zavala hidalgo et al 2003 schmitz 2005 athié et al 2012 le hénaff et al 2012a 2014 the deepwater horizon oil spill took place during such a lc eddy shedding sequence and the fate of the spilled oil was partly influenced by the lc evolution and its frontal dynamics walker et al 2011 the model setup described below was configured primarily to investigate the uncertainties in this eddy shedding scenario 2 1 hycom setup the forecast model is the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom the model configuration is the same as goml0 04 expt 20 1 run by the navy research laboratory nrl for the near real time system in the period 2003 2010 the details of this configuration can be found on the hycom website 1 1 https hycom org data goml0pt04 expt 20pt1 last access on july 3rd 2018 the model has a horizontal grid resolution of 1 25 and 20 vertical layers since the vertical layers in hycom are hybrid their thickness changes at each time step in this configuration there are more vertical layers toward the surface with their depth in the eastern gulf ranging from 1 5m to about 2700 m in the eastern gulf the computational domain is open along portions of its southern eastern and northern boundaries where values are provided by a lower resolution 1 12 north atlantic hycom simulation chassignet et al 2007 this model configuration has been used extensively in the literature especially in studies of the deepwater horizon oil spill e g mezić et al 2010 valentine et al 2012 le hénaff et al 2012b paris et al 2012 the model is forced by the 27 km resolution coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps atmospheric products the initial condition for the model is from the expt 20 1 mcdonald 2006 near real time simulation run at nrl which includes data assimilation the model assimilates available satellite altimeter observations along track data altimetry obtained via the navoceano altimeter data fusion center satellite and in situ sea surface temperature sst as well as available in situ vertical temperature and salinity profiles from xbts argo floats and moored buoys the model is then integrated forward in time without data assimilation in forecast mode for 30 days from may 1 2010 to may 30 2010 2 2 pc surrogates we give a brief overview of pc methods in order to set the stage for the subsequent analysis more background information can be found in le maître and knio 2010 and iskandarani et al 2016b and references therein the pc paradigm is based on describing the dependence of a specific model output say m x t ξ where ξ represents the vector of uncertain inputs and x and t refer to space and time by a spectral series mp of the form 1 m x t ξ m p x t ξ k 0 p m k x t ψ k ξ where the ψm ξ are the user specified multi dimensional basis functions usually tensorized orthogonal polynomials from the askey family xiu and karniadakis 2002 and the m k x t are p 1 coefficients these coefficients are determined by sampling the parameter space ξ and minimizing the error m m p different versions of pc methods can be derived by choosing different error norms and sampling strategies for example the traditional galerkin approach uses the so called l 2 norm 2 m m p 2 2 m m p 2 ρ ξ d ξ where ρ ξ is the probability density function of the uncertain inputs ξ this approach takes advantage of the orthogonal basis and uses quadrature rules to calculate the coefficients as 3 m k q 1 q ψ k ξ q m ξ q ω q q 1 q ψ k ξ q ψ k ξ q ω q where ξ q and ωq are multi dimensional quadrature points and weights le maître and knio 2010 iskandarani et al 2016b other approaches to determining the coefficients include spectral collocation and regression useful when the model output m is noisy see iskandarani et al 2016b for a comparison of these different techniques regardless of the specific approach to calculate the coefficients the pc series requires sampling of the parameter space to compute m ξ q and this constitutes the most expensive portion of the calculation as each sample requires a model run with the uncertain input set to ξq in general the cost increases exponentially with the dimension of the uncertain input ξ and must be mitigated by resorting to either sparse quadrature rules or sparse series construction once the coefficients m k are available and the series approximation errors have been verified to be small the spectral series in eq 1 often referred to as a surrogate or emulator can be used in lieu of the model to estimate the response of the model mp to changes in the uncertain input data ξ the pc approach provides an efficient way to propagate model uncertainties quantify principal contributors to the model output uncertainties and infer the posterior distributions of uncertain inputs given observational data pc methods have been successfully applied to many different uncertainty quantification tasks for oceanic and atmospheric simulations thacker et al 2012 li et al 2016 iskandarani et al 2016a winokur et al 2013 wang et al 2015 alexanderian et al 2012 sraj et al 2013 2 3 pc input uncertainties the two hycom ensembles in iskandarani et al 2016a and li et al 2016 relied on a reduced state space approach kleeman 2011 to characterize the input uncertainties so that the variance of the uncertain inputs was maximized while retaining as few uncertain inputs as possible more specifically eof decompositions were used to identify modes of variability in the initial conditions and wind forcing the spatial patterns of the perturbation were thus provided by the eofs while the time series were associated with their principal components the eof modes used to perturb the initial conditions were obtained from a multivariate eof analysis of two weeks of daily outputs of the operational and data assimilated simulation prior to our experiment lc processes and their frontal instabilities are the dominant contributors to variability during this 14 day time period and contamination of the eof modes by other longer time scale processes is thus minimized iskandarani et al 2016a analyzed the first two of these eof modes and showed that their addition to the initial condition of the unperturbed run led to a stronger frontal eddy in the northeast corner of the extended lc and an early separation of a lc eddy whereas their subtraction had the opposite effect the wind forcing eof modes were calculated from a 2 month time series may and june 2010 of a 27 km resolution coamps simulation the eof analysis was performed on the wind velocity vectors u wind and v wind and then projected onto the wind speed and the wind stress vectors which are the actual components of the hycom wind forcing inputs fig 2 shows the cumulative variance of each mode identified in the 2 week eof decomposition of daily operational hycom outputs left panel and in the 60 day eof decomposition of the coamps winds the initial conditions and wind forcing fields can now be constructed as the sum of products of spatial patterns and time series as follows 4 u x t 0 ξ u 0 x α i c k 1 k i c ξ k i c u k x 5 f x t ξ f 0 x t α w k 1 k w ξ k w λ k w t f k x where u x t 0 ξ is the perturbed initial condition field u 0 is the unperturbed initial field αic is a coefficient that controls the size of the perturbation u k x are the eofs obtained from the decomposition of the two week hycom daily output 1 ξ k i c 1 are standardized uncertain input random variables controlling the amplitude of the eofs modes and kic refers to the number of eof modes retained the terms f f 0 αw f k and kw are the analogous quantities for the wind forcing field the λ k w in the wind forcing perturbations refer to the principal components of the two month wind time series the exploratory study in iskandarani et al 2016a included only the first two initial condition eof modes in order to keep the computational cost tractable the vector of uncertain input was ξ ξ 1 i c ξ 2 i c with k i c 2 and k w 0 li et al 2016 increased the number of initial conditions modes to four to explore the impact of additional variability on the forecast uncertainty and included four wind forcing modes to account for additional sources of uncertainties the uncertain input vector consisted thus of ξ ξ 1 i c ξ 2 i c ξ 3 i c ξ 4 i c ξ 1 w ξ 2 w ξ 3 w ξ 4 w with k i c 4 and k w 4 note that li et al 2016 decreased the size of their perturbation by setting α i c 0 8 and α w 0 04 in order to avoid repeated crashes of the forward model when the full perturbation was applied the pc approach treats the perturbation amplitudes as independent and continuous random variables characterized by their pdfs which were assumed to be uniform 2 2 specifying these pdfs can be difficult in practice due to the scarcity of observational data the availability of the surrogate however allows the user to explore the effect of different input pdfs at little extra cost the focus on initial conditions and wind forcing uncertainties in the studies of iskandarani et al 2016a and li et al 2016 is largely a compromise between computational cost 3 3 the sampling cost increases quickly exponentially in fact for conventional gauss quadratures with the number of uncertain inputs and the desire to account for most of the uncertain processes influencing lc dynamics for example uncertainty in boundary conditions was omitted since the domain boundaries were too remote to influence the lc within a 30 day time frame 4 4 roughly 60 days are needed for a perturbation in the boundary condition to reach the lc region thacker et al 2012 uncertainty in the wind field was deemed the second most important contributor to lc dynamics which was then included in li et al 2016 additional sources of uncertainty such as surface heat flux could be included at the expense of increasing the dimension of the uncertain space and the sampling cost the pc surrogate in iskandarani et al 2016a relied on a galerkin projection with sampling on the gauss legendre quadrature points to determine the coefficients and was shown to be valid for a period of 40 days when validated against independent model simulations the eight dimensional space of li et al 2016 required a different surrogate construction approach and the latter was built using a basis pursuit denoising 5 5 the basis pursuit denoising algorithm seeks to find the shortest series possible whose coefficients minimize the square of the surrogate error it mitigates the cost of sampling an 8 dimensional space to compute the m k s a gauss quadrature procedure as in iskandarani et al 2016a would have required 7 8 5 764 801 samples algorithm the validity of the surrogates was also established by comparing their estimates to those of an independent validation ensemble the analyses herein focus on the first 30 days of the simulation when both surrogates delivered accurate representation of the model output table 1 lists the settings for the two uncertainty quantification analyses in iskandarani et al 2016a and li et al 2016 the reader is referred to these articles for more details on the surrogate construction and their validation the goals of the present study is to evaluate the perturbation strategy used to generate these ensembles and to compare the evolution of the individual members in relation to the evolution of the observed lc system and to assess whether the increase in the number of uncertain parameters and the associated increase in the sampling requirements yield to a better estimate of the output uncertainties furthermore the output pdfs of the ensembles are computed and compared to those of the climatological observations 3 model data comparison for a good ensemble prediction the forecast uncertainties should be properly represented slingo and palmer 2011 such that the true evolution appears to be a plausible realization in the ensemble in order to assess whether the eof perturbations satisfy this requirement we compare the envelop of the model ensembles against observational data both at the surface and at depth 3 1 comparison against satellite ssh for the surface model data comparison we use the aviso gridded satellite ssh data optimally interpolated to a 1 4 1 4 grid le traon et al 1998 specifically we compare the edges of the lc and the lc eddies which are defined by the contours of the 17 cm ssh anomaly with respect to the basin mean value leben 2005 introduced this 17 cm anomaly as a reliable indicator of the loop current edge s position and validated its reliability against other criteria that were traditionally used before it is now a commonly used metric to identify the edge of the lc e g le hénaff et al 2012a dukhovskoy et al 2015 fig 3 shows time snapshots of the lc edge every 10 days starting from may 1 2010 for both hycom ensembles the background color is the gridded satellite ssh data the lc edges from the hycom ensemble members black contours are compared to gridded satellite ssh data white contours a basic observation for both ensembles is that the lc contour derived from satellite data shown in white contours in fig 3 generally fall within the envelope of the hycom ensemble contours shown in black near the lc region this indicates a good ensemble since the observational data appears to be a plausible realization of the model ensemble on day 30 it is clear that the lc eddy shedding process is affected by the ensemble perturbation in which several ensemble members have already shed an eddy while others have not the difference between these two hycom ensembles is visually small which is a first indication that the additional uncertainty in the initial conditions and in the wind forcing do not contribute much to the uncertainty in the lc edge position both ensembles however deviate from the observational data in the vicinity of a detached lc eddy in the western part of the gulf of mexico moreover the deviation increases with time this is not too surprising as each ensemble member is a free run without data assimilation the eof perturbations in both the initial conditions and the wind forcing seem to have missed the local uncertainty in the vicinity of the western lc eddy we speculate that the reason for this is first mainly concerned with initial conditions uncertainties and second that the eof decomposition of the initial conditions picked up the largest variability in the eastern side of the basin namely the one associated with lc dynamics as a result local variability away from the most dynamic region might not have been captured in the first four eof modes the pc paradigm with its focus on establishing a functional relationship between the uncertain inputs and the model output requires that modelers be careful and deliberate in selecting their input perturbations it also suggests that a more tailored decomposition or model reduction method would be useful if the user is interested in quantifying the uncertainties in multiple regions simultaneously 3 2 comparison against mooring data in order to compare the model with observational data at depth we compare both hycom ensembles against 9 full depth mooring observations deployed by the bureau of ocean energy management boem science applications international corporation saic hamilton et al 2016 during the mutual hycom simulation period may 1 2010 may 30 2010 here we compare the mean and standard deviation ellipses of the point velocity for the entire 30 days like in xu et al 2013 fig 4 shows the comparison of the mean and standard deviation ellipses between the hycom ensemble members and the mooring data at different depths in each subfigure the mean velocity vectors of the ensemble members are shown in black and the standard deviation ellipses of the ensemble members are represented in red the mean and standard deviation ellipses of the mooring observations are in blue the mooring data falls in general within the envelope of the hycom ensembles at different depths this indicates that the two ensembles at depth capture reasonably well the observations the 49 member pc ensemble with only two initial conditions eof perturbations underestimates the variability observed in the two most northeastern moorings at the 100m and 300m depths whereas it seems to be well represented in the 798 member ensemble both at the surface and at depth the ensembles are realistic as evidenced by the model data comparison the ensembles captured the observed evolution especially in the targeted lc region regarding the lc edge the small ensemble can capture similar amount of variability compared with the large ensemble at the surface and at depth 4 relative entropy the uncertainty experiment in li et al 2016 was largely motivated by two considerations first to explore the impact of including additional eof modes and second to include other sources of input uncertainties specifically wind forcing uncertainties other sources of uncertainty such as surface heat flux river runoff or open boundary conditions were deemed to be less important or too remote for short term forecasting and were thus not considered the enlargement of the uncertain parameter space increases the sampling requirement substantially and the natural question is whether the variability gained in the output alternatively the missed uncertainties justifies the increased sampling cost to address this question we attempt to quantify this variability loss by considering various scenarios where the dimension of the uncertain input space is reduced note that the reduction can be achieved either by discarding high order eof modes and retaining only the leading order ones or by supressing independent initial conditions or wind forcing sources of input uncertainty we leverage the ability of pc methods to deliver output pdfs to quantify the variability loss using an information theoretic measure relative entropy kullback and leibler 1951 which measures the distance between two probability density functions p and q relative entropy can be defined in discrete form as follows kleeman 2002 6 d p q i 1 k p i log p i q i where p and q denote the pdfs of two distributions i is the discrete bin index and k is the total number of bins the relative entropy is a measure of distance between the reference pdf q and the pdf p it is zero when p and q are identical and increases as they grow apart in what follows q refers to the output pdf that is obtained by including all uncertain parameters whereas p refers to the output pdf that is obtained by restricting the number of uncertain inputs the relative entropy d p q thus quantifies the amount of variability lost by restricting the input uncertainty space the discrete pdfs are calculated as follows a large number of samples is drawn from the pc surrogate the range of a model variable ssh for example is then divided into bins and the probability of a specific bin is set to the number of samples in this bin divided by the total number of samples i e 7 p i n i i 1 k n i where ni represents the number of samples in bin i and k is the number of bins we use a large number of samples 100 000 and set k 20 for all relative entropy calculations 6 6 experimentation has shown that our results are not sensitive to k when k 20 the pc surrogate used here is the one constructed from the large ensemble since it has already been built and validated li et al 2016 and since it encompasses the largest uncertain input space table 2 displays several scenarios of restricting the uncertain input space 4 1 results for sea surface height we first investigate the variability loss caused by retaining two eof modes only instead of four scenario 1 in table 2 for both sources of uncertainty fig 5 a shows the time evolution of the relative entropy between the reference scenario that perturbs all eight eof modes and the scenario that perturbs only the first two leading eof modes of each uncertain source the results show that for the time span considered little variability is lost by ignoring the uncertainty due to higher eof modes modes three and four of each uncertain source and that there is very little gain in expanding the uncertainty space to include these higher order modes next we investigate the variability loss caused by omitting uncertainty in the wind forcing since fig 5a shows that the high order eof modes contribute little to the information content of the ssh pdf we focus only on the low order eof modes here fig 5b shows the variability loss by omitting uncertainty in the wind forcing scenario 2 in table 2 in which the ensemble that perturbs only the first two initial condition eof modes is compared with the fully perturbed ensemble the impact of omitting the wind forcing eof modes is mainly in the coastal region and little influence can be found in the lc region and the western gulf of mexico at day 30 the variability loss by omitting the initial condition eof modes is shown in fig 5c scenario 3 in table 2 the coastal signal disappears in this case which indicates that the first 2 wind forcing eof modes dominate ssh signal in the coastal region instead a strong signal is observed in the lc region and its magnitude grows as time evolves which indicates that the initial condition uncertainty is the dominant contributor to uncertainty in the lc region these results are consistent with the analysis of variance in li et al 2016 in which the ssh in the lc region is more sensitive to the initial condition eof perturbation modes while in the coastal region the ssh is more sensitive to the wind forcing eof modes since the first two initial condition eof modes contribute the most to the ssh variability in the deep gulf of mexico we further investigate the influence of each individual initial condition eof mode fig 5d shows the ssh variability loss by retaining only the 1st initial condition eof mode and fig 5e shows the ssh variability loss by retaining only the 2nd initial condition eof mode without the 2nd initial condition eof mode shown in fig 5d the ssh variability loss is localized in the north side of the lc especially at day 30 without the 1st initial condition eof mode shown in fig 5e the ssh variability loss is substantial in a localized region along the lc and its amplitude grows with time in the deep gulf of mexico two initial condition eof modes are necessary in order to capture most of the ssh variability in summary for ssh the variability loss caused by retaining only the two leading eof modes for initial condition and wind forcing uncertainties is rather negligible additionally the variability loss by omitting wind forcing input uncertainty is small in the lc region but is quite large in the coastal zone thus this posterior analysis suggests that a more optimal ensemble could have been designed by retaining only the first two leading eof modes of initial conditions and wind forcing uncertainties these results also indicate that the small hycom ensemble used in iskandarani et al 2016a that perturbs only the first two initial condition eof modes is a suitable choice for studying the ensemble statistics in the lc region as we do in the following section it should be noted that the relative entropy approach here could be generalized to any ensemble simulations to investigate the balance between the size of the ensemble and the information content contained in the ensemble 5 ensemble statistics 5 1 ensemble visualization ensemble simulations provide us with a way to derive statistics of the model which leads to an estimate of the confidence of the model prediction however mining useful information from the ensemble can be challenging since ensemble simulations usually involve a large number of single model runs the recently developed contour boxplot whitaker et al 2013 built on the notion of data depth enables us to extract valuable information from an ensemble here we are particularly interested in answering 1 what is the most representative ensemble member 2 what are the outliers of the ensemble simply speaking the contour boxplot can be considered as a generalization of the conventional boxplot both of these methods are designed for order statistics which requires an ordering of the data the difference between conventional boxplot and contour boxplot is that the former can only be applied to scalar quantities while the latter can be applied to functions and contours at the heart of the contour boxplot a measure of centrality is defined by the concept of data depth proposed from the statistics community whitaker et al 2013 the gist of data depth concept is to quantify the centrality or depth of a data sample with respect to an ensemble of data samples in practice the centrality or depth can be measured by how many times a function or contour falls within the band formed by an arbitrary set of other functions or contours fig 6 adopted from whitaker et al 2013 shows an example of how to measure the centrality or depth in the left subfigure three different blue curves form a grey band and three red curves are tested against the band the solid red curve falls completely within the grey band while the two dashed red curves partially fall within the grey band therefore the data depth of the solid red curve is larger than that of the dashed red curves for contours in the right subfigure the same logic applies we refer the reader to whitaker et al 2013 mirzargar et al 2014 for more descriptions of the methodology as well as an application in meteorology we apply the contour boxplot concept to the lc edges obtained from the 49 member hycom ensemble the key effort of the contour boxplot is to sort the 49 ensemble contours by their data depth defined in whitaker et al 2013 the deeper data sample is considered to be more representative than the shallower data sample the deepest data sample can be considered as the most representative ensemble member and the shallowest data samples can be considered as outliers fig 7 shows the contour boxplot for the edges of the lc and lc eddies as defined by the 17 cm ssh contours at day 30 the satellite ssh observation is shown in black for reference the satellite observations show that a lc eddy has separated from the lc at that date while in the mean of the ensemble simulations indicated by the green line the lc is still in its extended position on the other hand the most representative ensemble member identified by the median of the ensemble in yellow shows a similar lc eddy shedding stage compared with the satellite observations we mark the shallowest three ensemble members shown in red as outliers it is clear that these outliers are still in their early stage for lc eddy shedding process which is somewhat slow compared with other ensemble members in the uncertain parameter space these outliers are the ensemble members with extreme negative perturbations in both modes as seen in the inserted box in fig 7 next we connect the normalized uncertain perturbation to the estimated initial condition perturbation pattern fig 8 shows the initial perturbation approximated by the ssh difference between the perturbed and unperturbed runs one day after the start of the simulation the initial perturbations are shown according to their normalized random variables shown in the middle of the figure the bottom left subfigure represents the most negative perturbations for both eof modes the top right subfigure represents the most positive perturbations for both eof modes the dynamical process associated with eof mode1 the ξ 1 direction can be explained by the strengthening or weakening of the lc frontal eddies the signature of eof mode2 the ξ 2 direction is associated with variability along the edge of the lc as well as in the western gulf of mexico these signals strongly affect the intensity of the lc frontal eddies which play an important role in the lc eddy shedding process le hénaff et al 2012a 2014 the outliers identified by the data depth concept in fig 7 are located at the most negative perturbation of eof mode1 which is consistent with the related dynamical processes negative perturbation of eof mode1 is associated with the weakening of the lc frontal eddies which delays the lc eddy shedding event 5 2 an exploration of ssh pdf the estimate of the full pdf usually requires a large sample size sometimes only the low order statistical moments are calculated on the assumption that the underlying pdf can be approximated by a normal distribution the pc method provides us with an efficient way to estimate the full pdf of a model output we thus investigate whether the underlying distribution of the ssh field in the gulf of mexico is normal using the pc surrogate constructed by the 49 member hycom ensemble we first explore the pointwise ssh pdf at different locations in the gulf of mexico in fig 9 the location of four selected points a1 a4 and the lc edges are shown on the right subfigure on the left subfigure the ssh pdf from the four different locations are presented clearly the ssh pdf is not always normally distributed for example the ssh pdf at point a3 along the lc edge shows a bimodal distribution whereas the pdf at a2 shows a bias towards higher values next we investigate where in the gulf of mexico the ssh are normally distributed we reuse the relative entropy metric to quantify the distance between the pc surrogate pdf and its gaussian counterpart this gaussian counterpart is obtained by specifying the mean and variance as calculated from the pc surrogate fig 10 shows the relative entropy map between the ssh pdf in each grid cell and its gaussian counterpart we only plot the regions where the associated relative entropy is larger than or equal to 0 4 and the lc edges are also shown in the figure for reference it is clear that the strongest non gaussian signal appears in the lc region indicated by red color especially in regions where the variation in the lc edge is high this is not surprising as the lc is a highly nonlinear dynamical feature oey et al 2005 so the lc region is expected to show non gaussian statistic the relative entropy is an efficient tool to identify the locations of highly nonlinear features in an ensemble of simulations 6 summary and discussion this paper analyzes two ensembles designed to quantify using a polynomial chaos approach the uncertainties in forecasting the circulation in the gulf of mexico during the deep water horizon period of may 1 to may 30 2010 the two ensembles differed in the sources of uncertainty initial conditions and wind forcing uncertainties and in the amount of variability number of perturbation modes accounted for both ensembles relied on eof decomposition to perturb the initial conditions and wind forcing fields and considered the amplitude of these modes as the uncertain input parameters the eof based perturbations served to maximize the amount of input uncertainty using the smallest number of uncertain inputs so that the size of the ensemble required to sample the uncertain space remains manageable the model data comparison reveals that in general the observations fall within the envelope of uncertainty generated by the eof perturbations during the 30 day forecast period this is particularly true in the target area of the lc region where two eof modes used to perturb the initial conditions are enough to capture the variability in the system on the other hand the altimetry data shows the remnant of a lc eddy in the western side of the basin evolving outside the envelope predicted by the two ensembles this could be explained by an inability of our basin wide eof modes to capture simultaneously localized uncertainty on the western side of the basin and in the lc region and that the local uncertainty in the western side did not project on the first four eof modes one remedy is to compute separate eof modes in the eastern and western sides of the basin so that the variability in the former would not dominate the variability in the latter other approaches would involve abandoning the eof decomposition and resorting to perturbing the system using either singular modes buizza and palmer 1995 or bred vectors toth and kalnay 1997 however the computations of the singular vectors would require the availability of the tangent linear model and its adjoint and would incur additional computational costs likewise identifying the bred vectors would require running an ensemble of simulations prior to obtaining the pc ensemble itself the relative entropy metric was used to quantify the variability loss gain caused by accounting for different uncertainty sources and by including different amounts of input variability it shows that the variability loss caused by omitting higher eof modes in the input uncertainty is small at least for the 30 day period considered this result suggests that adding additional input uncertainty sources is more useful than adding high order eof modes of the same uncertainty source the uncertainty in forecasting the ssh field in the shelf regions for example is primarily caused by uncertainties in the wind forcing while the initial conditions uncertainty plays a secondary role the wind forcing uncertainty adds little to the ssh forecast uncertainty in the deep parts of the gulf where two eof modes used to perturb the initial conditions are enough to account for the forecast uncertainty in these regions the conclusions obtained here using the relative entropy metric are consistent with the variance based sensitivity analysis in li et al 2016 the analysis of the ssh pdfs shows a strong non gaussian signal in the lc region which is reflective of the bifurcation in the state of the lc caused by the eddy detachment furthermore the contour boxplot allowed us to identify the most representative ensemble member and the ensemble outliers the application of uncertainty quantification techniques in ocean modeling is in its early stages the most challenging part is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to minimize the sampling cost of the uncertain input space while capturing the largest amount of input uncertainty the pc paradigm emphasizes the link between the input and output uncertainties by explicit construction of a surrogate and allows forecasters to identify the dominant contributors to the output uncertainties the efficiency of this uncertainty quantification implementation can be applied for model calibration to guide the selection of model parameters the availability of the full output pdf will open the door for data assimilation and predictability study in a non gaussian paradigm acknowledgments this research was

24078,we present an analysis of two recent efforts aimed at quantifying the uncertainties in a 30 day hybrid coordinate ocean model forecast of the circulation in the gulf of mexico with particular emphasis on the separation of loop current eddy franklin using polynomial chaos methods the analysis herein explores whether the model perturbations lead to realistic representation of the uncertainty in the gulf circulation comparisons of model output with sea surface height and current mooring data show that the observational data generally falls within the envelope of the ensemble and that the modal decomposition delivers realistic perturbations in the loop current region we use information theory metrics to quantify the information gain and the computational trade offs between different wind and initial conditions perturbation modes the relative entropy measures indicate that two modes for initial condition perturbations are enough in our model configuration to represent the uncertainty in the loop current region while two modes for wind forcing perturbations are necessary in order to estimate the uncertainty in the coastal zone the ensemble statistics are then explored using the polynomial chaos surrogate and the newly developed contour boxplot methods keywords uncertainty quantification polynomial chaos relative entropy ocean modeling data depth 1 introduction the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill underscored the need for reliable oceanic and atmospheric forecasts in order to predict the trajectory and evolution of the oil spill forecasting systems are however inherently uncertain because of uncertainties in among other things the input data used to produce these forecasts such as initial conditions boundary conditions and subgrid parametrization useful forecasts need to quantify the uncertainties in their predictions so that the reliability of the forecast can be assessed the present article analyzes the performance of two recent efforts iskandarani et al 2016a li et al 2016 that have relied on polynomial chaos pc methods ghanem and spanos 1991 xiu and karniadakis 2002 le maître and knio 2010 iskandarani et al 2016b to quantify the uncertainties in forecasting the circulation in the gulf of mexico stemming from uncertainties in the initial conditions alone iskandarani et al 2016a or in combination with wind forcing uncertainties li et al 2016 the forecast timeline covers the oil spill period from may 1 30 2010 and coincides with an extended loop current lc that threatened to spread the oil along the south florida coast and eventually the eastern seaboard of the united states fortunately a lc detachment lc eddy franklin occured and confined the oil to the northern and central parts of the gulf of mexico the uncertainty analysis explores primarily whether the uncertainty in the lc location can be quantified given the uncertainties in the forecast model s data the studies in iskandarani et al 2016a and li et al 2016 were based on perturbing the model fields initial conditions and wind forcing with space time patterns obtained from an empirical orthogonal function eof decomposition where the amplitudes of these patterns were considered uncertain parameters the pc formalism was then applied to propagate the uncertainties forward efficiently by first running an ensemble of simulations using the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom to sample the uncertain parameter space second constructing polynomial based model surrogates that accurately represent the changes in model outputs caused by changes in model inputs and third using these surrogates to perform a reliable and efficient statistical analysis once the validity of the surrogates was established the choices made during the course of the uncertainty analysis in those two articles and which will be detailed in later sections have raised a number of issues that we wish to address here concerning the realism of the uncertainty analysis the computational and information trade offs in choosing different uncertain inputs and the exploration of the statistical information conveyed by the pc approach specifically in the present study we 1 assess the performance of the eof perturbed pc ensemble by comparing it to observational data both at the surface and at depth to verify whether the measurement data falls within the envelope of the pc ensemble 2 leverage the ability of pc methods to deliver output probability density function pdf to quantify using information theoretical measures the uncertainty lost by omitting some uncertain inputs or by limiting their variability a second aim of this paper is to explore the statistics of the ensemble in order to obtain the most representative ensemble member and to identify the outliers contour boxplot whitaker et al 2013 a generalization of the conventional boxplot is applied to the ensemble furthermore the output pdfs delivered by the pc method are used to explore the non gaussian statistics in the vicinity of the lc region in summary the present article is a follow on to iskandarani et al 2016a li et al 2016 and iskandarani et al 2016a identified the two leading eof modes whose amplitudes represented the uncertainties in the strength of an lc frontal eddy these modes were subsequently used to perturb the initial conditions of a control forecast iskandarani et al 2016a relied on a 49 member ensemble to build surrogates of model outputs validated their accuracy and used them for the statistical analysis li et al 2016 expanded the previous study by including additional eofs modes in the initial conditions perturbations as well as perturbations to the surface wind forcing their parameter space was eight dimensional and required a compressed sensing based procedure to construct model surrogates using a 798 member ensemble a variance based sensitivity analysis showed that uncertainties in the initial conditions dominated the forecast uncertainties in the deep parts of the gulf of mexico while wind forcing uncertainties were the dominant contributors on the continental shelves the present study compares the ensembles simulations to observations to assess whether the eof perturbations were adequate at representing the uncertainties in the forecast performs a cost benefit analysis regarding the enlargement of the uncertain parameter space and perform additional analysis regarding the statistical distribution of sea surface height at the end of the forecast no additional experiments were performed in the present study the layout of this paper is as follows section 2 provides a quick overview of the lc dynamics in the gulf of mexico summarizes the experimental setup of the two uncertainty experiments provides a brief description of the pc methodology and describes the specification of the input uncertainties section 3 compares the ensemble results against observational data the information trade offs between the different choices of the sources and variability of the input uncertainties are shown in section 4 section 5 presents the contour boxplot of the lc edge and the sea surface height ssh pdfs finally we conclude with a summary section 2 model and ensemble prediction the gulf of mexico where the deepwater horizon oil spill took place is a suitable test bed for uncertainty studies it is a well observed regional sea that presents many dynamical features typical of the deep ocean such as currents and eddying jets as shown in fig 1 the lc is a particularly dominant feature of the circulation in the gulf of mexico as it flows from the yucatan channel between mexico and cuba to the straits of florida between cuba and the southeastern u s the lc presents a time varying extension from a retracted path at the south of the basin to an extended one reaching the edge of the continental shelf in the northeastern gulf when it is extended the lc sheds a large anticyclonic eddy called lc eddy indicated by the anticyclonic arrow in black in the western gulf which then drifts westward and the lc retracts to the south this shedding sequence often implies temporary detachments of the lc eddy from the current before final separation small cyclonic eddies also called lc frontal eddies shown in white arrows at the edge of the lc play an active role in necking down and chopping the extended lc leading to the lc eddy detachments or separation zavala hidalgo et al 2003 schmitz 2005 athié et al 2012 le hénaff et al 2012a 2014 the deepwater horizon oil spill took place during such a lc eddy shedding sequence and the fate of the spilled oil was partly influenced by the lc evolution and its frontal dynamics walker et al 2011 the model setup described below was configured primarily to investigate the uncertainties in this eddy shedding scenario 2 1 hycom setup the forecast model is the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom the model configuration is the same as goml0 04 expt 20 1 run by the navy research laboratory nrl for the near real time system in the period 2003 2010 the details of this configuration can be found on the hycom website 1 1 https hycom org data goml0pt04 expt 20pt1 last access on july 3rd 2018 the model has a horizontal grid resolution of 1 25 and 20 vertical layers since the vertical layers in hycom are hybrid their thickness changes at each time step in this configuration there are more vertical layers toward the surface with their depth in the eastern gulf ranging from 1 5m to about 2700 m in the eastern gulf the computational domain is open along portions of its southern eastern and northern boundaries where values are provided by a lower resolution 1 12 north atlantic hycom simulation chassignet et al 2007 this model configuration has been used extensively in the literature especially in studies of the deepwater horizon oil spill e g mezić et al 2010 valentine et al 2012 le hénaff et al 2012b paris et al 2012 the model is forced by the 27 km resolution coupled ocean atmosphere mesoscale prediction system coamps atmospheric products the initial condition for the model is from the expt 20 1 mcdonald 2006 near real time simulation run at nrl which includes data assimilation the model assimilates available satellite altimeter observations along track data altimetry obtained via the navoceano altimeter data fusion center satellite and in situ sea surface temperature sst as well as available in situ vertical temperature and salinity profiles from xbts argo floats and moored buoys the model is then integrated forward in time without data assimilation in forecast mode for 30 days from may 1 2010 to may 30 2010 2 2 pc surrogates we give a brief overview of pc methods in order to set the stage for the subsequent analysis more background information can be found in le maître and knio 2010 and iskandarani et al 2016b and references therein the pc paradigm is based on describing the dependence of a specific model output say m x t ξ where ξ represents the vector of uncertain inputs and x and t refer to space and time by a spectral series mp of the form 1 m x t ξ m p x t ξ k 0 p m k x t ψ k ξ where the ψm ξ are the user specified multi dimensional basis functions usually tensorized orthogonal polynomials from the askey family xiu and karniadakis 2002 and the m k x t are p 1 coefficients these coefficients are determined by sampling the parameter space ξ and minimizing the error m m p different versions of pc methods can be derived by choosing different error norms and sampling strategies for example the traditional galerkin approach uses the so called l 2 norm 2 m m p 2 2 m m p 2 ρ ξ d ξ where ρ ξ is the probability density function of the uncertain inputs ξ this approach takes advantage of the orthogonal basis and uses quadrature rules to calculate the coefficients as 3 m k q 1 q ψ k ξ q m ξ q ω q q 1 q ψ k ξ q ψ k ξ q ω q where ξ q and ωq are multi dimensional quadrature points and weights le maître and knio 2010 iskandarani et al 2016b other approaches to determining the coefficients include spectral collocation and regression useful when the model output m is noisy see iskandarani et al 2016b for a comparison of these different techniques regardless of the specific approach to calculate the coefficients the pc series requires sampling of the parameter space to compute m ξ q and this constitutes the most expensive portion of the calculation as each sample requires a model run with the uncertain input set to ξq in general the cost increases exponentially with the dimension of the uncertain input ξ and must be mitigated by resorting to either sparse quadrature rules or sparse series construction once the coefficients m k are available and the series approximation errors have been verified to be small the spectral series in eq 1 often referred to as a surrogate or emulator can be used in lieu of the model to estimate the response of the model mp to changes in the uncertain input data ξ the pc approach provides an efficient way to propagate model uncertainties quantify principal contributors to the model output uncertainties and infer the posterior distributions of uncertain inputs given observational data pc methods have been successfully applied to many different uncertainty quantification tasks for oceanic and atmospheric simulations thacker et al 2012 li et al 2016 iskandarani et al 2016a winokur et al 2013 wang et al 2015 alexanderian et al 2012 sraj et al 2013 2 3 pc input uncertainties the two hycom ensembles in iskandarani et al 2016a and li et al 2016 relied on a reduced state space approach kleeman 2011 to characterize the input uncertainties so that the variance of the uncertain inputs was maximized while retaining as few uncertain inputs as possible more specifically eof decompositions were used to identify modes of variability in the initial conditions and wind forcing the spatial patterns of the perturbation were thus provided by the eofs while the time series were associated with their principal components the eof modes used to perturb the initial conditions were obtained from a multivariate eof analysis of two weeks of daily outputs of the operational and data assimilated simulation prior to our experiment lc processes and their frontal instabilities are the dominant contributors to variability during this 14 day time period and contamination of the eof modes by other longer time scale processes is thus minimized iskandarani et al 2016a analyzed the first two of these eof modes and showed that their addition to the initial condition of the unperturbed run led to a stronger frontal eddy in the northeast corner of the extended lc and an early separation of a lc eddy whereas their subtraction had the opposite effect the wind forcing eof modes were calculated from a 2 month time series may and june 2010 of a 27 km resolution coamps simulation the eof analysis was performed on the wind velocity vectors u wind and v wind and then projected onto the wind speed and the wind stress vectors which are the actual components of the hycom wind forcing inputs fig 2 shows the cumulative variance of each mode identified in the 2 week eof decomposition of daily operational hycom outputs left panel and in the 60 day eof decomposition of the coamps winds the initial conditions and wind forcing fields can now be constructed as the sum of products of spatial patterns and time series as follows 4 u x t 0 ξ u 0 x α i c k 1 k i c ξ k i c u k x 5 f x t ξ f 0 x t α w k 1 k w ξ k w λ k w t f k x where u x t 0 ξ is the perturbed initial condition field u 0 is the unperturbed initial field αic is a coefficient that controls the size of the perturbation u k x are the eofs obtained from the decomposition of the two week hycom daily output 1 ξ k i c 1 are standardized uncertain input random variables controlling the amplitude of the eofs modes and kic refers to the number of eof modes retained the terms f f 0 αw f k and kw are the analogous quantities for the wind forcing field the λ k w in the wind forcing perturbations refer to the principal components of the two month wind time series the exploratory study in iskandarani et al 2016a included only the first two initial condition eof modes in order to keep the computational cost tractable the vector of uncertain input was ξ ξ 1 i c ξ 2 i c with k i c 2 and k w 0 li et al 2016 increased the number of initial conditions modes to four to explore the impact of additional variability on the forecast uncertainty and included four wind forcing modes to account for additional sources of uncertainties the uncertain input vector consisted thus of ξ ξ 1 i c ξ 2 i c ξ 3 i c ξ 4 i c ξ 1 w ξ 2 w ξ 3 w ξ 4 w with k i c 4 and k w 4 note that li et al 2016 decreased the size of their perturbation by setting α i c 0 8 and α w 0 04 in order to avoid repeated crashes of the forward model when the full perturbation was applied the pc approach treats the perturbation amplitudes as independent and continuous random variables characterized by their pdfs which were assumed to be uniform 2 2 specifying these pdfs can be difficult in practice due to the scarcity of observational data the availability of the surrogate however allows the user to explore the effect of different input pdfs at little extra cost the focus on initial conditions and wind forcing uncertainties in the studies of iskandarani et al 2016a and li et al 2016 is largely a compromise between computational cost 3 3 the sampling cost increases quickly exponentially in fact for conventional gauss quadratures with the number of uncertain inputs and the desire to account for most of the uncertain processes influencing lc dynamics for example uncertainty in boundary conditions was omitted since the domain boundaries were too remote to influence the lc within a 30 day time frame 4 4 roughly 60 days are needed for a perturbation in the boundary condition to reach the lc region thacker et al 2012 uncertainty in the wind field was deemed the second most important contributor to lc dynamics which was then included in li et al 2016 additional sources of uncertainty such as surface heat flux could be included at the expense of increasing the dimension of the uncertain space and the sampling cost the pc surrogate in iskandarani et al 2016a relied on a galerkin projection with sampling on the gauss legendre quadrature points to determine the coefficients and was shown to be valid for a period of 40 days when validated against independent model simulations the eight dimensional space of li et al 2016 required a different surrogate construction approach and the latter was built using a basis pursuit denoising 5 5 the basis pursuit denoising algorithm seeks to find the shortest series possible whose coefficients minimize the square of the surrogate error it mitigates the cost of sampling an 8 dimensional space to compute the m k s a gauss quadrature procedure as in iskandarani et al 2016a would have required 7 8 5 764 801 samples algorithm the validity of the surrogates was also established by comparing their estimates to those of an independent validation ensemble the analyses herein focus on the first 30 days of the simulation when both surrogates delivered accurate representation of the model output table 1 lists the settings for the two uncertainty quantification analyses in iskandarani et al 2016a and li et al 2016 the reader is referred to these articles for more details on the surrogate construction and their validation the goals of the present study is to evaluate the perturbation strategy used to generate these ensembles and to compare the evolution of the individual members in relation to the evolution of the observed lc system and to assess whether the increase in the number of uncertain parameters and the associated increase in the sampling requirements yield to a better estimate of the output uncertainties furthermore the output pdfs of the ensembles are computed and compared to those of the climatological observations 3 model data comparison for a good ensemble prediction the forecast uncertainties should be properly represented slingo and palmer 2011 such that the true evolution appears to be a plausible realization in the ensemble in order to assess whether the eof perturbations satisfy this requirement we compare the envelop of the model ensembles against observational data both at the surface and at depth 3 1 comparison against satellite ssh for the surface model data comparison we use the aviso gridded satellite ssh data optimally interpolated to a 1 4 1 4 grid le traon et al 1998 specifically we compare the edges of the lc and the lc eddies which are defined by the contours of the 17 cm ssh anomaly with respect to the basin mean value leben 2005 introduced this 17 cm anomaly as a reliable indicator of the loop current edge s position and validated its reliability against other criteria that were traditionally used before it is now a commonly used metric to identify the edge of the lc e g le hénaff et al 2012a dukhovskoy et al 2015 fig 3 shows time snapshots of the lc edge every 10 days starting from may 1 2010 for both hycom ensembles the background color is the gridded satellite ssh data the lc edges from the hycom ensemble members black contours are compared to gridded satellite ssh data white contours a basic observation for both ensembles is that the lc contour derived from satellite data shown in white contours in fig 3 generally fall within the envelope of the hycom ensemble contours shown in black near the lc region this indicates a good ensemble since the observational data appears to be a plausible realization of the model ensemble on day 30 it is clear that the lc eddy shedding process is affected by the ensemble perturbation in which several ensemble members have already shed an eddy while others have not the difference between these two hycom ensembles is visually small which is a first indication that the additional uncertainty in the initial conditions and in the wind forcing do not contribute much to the uncertainty in the lc edge position both ensembles however deviate from the observational data in the vicinity of a detached lc eddy in the western part of the gulf of mexico moreover the deviation increases with time this is not too surprising as each ensemble member is a free run without data assimilation the eof perturbations in both the initial conditions and the wind forcing seem to have missed the local uncertainty in the vicinity of the western lc eddy we speculate that the reason for this is first mainly concerned with initial conditions uncertainties and second that the eof decomposition of the initial conditions picked up the largest variability in the eastern side of the basin namely the one associated with lc dynamics as a result local variability away from the most dynamic region might not have been captured in the first four eof modes the pc paradigm with its focus on establishing a functional relationship between the uncertain inputs and the model output requires that modelers be careful and deliberate in selecting their input perturbations it also suggests that a more tailored decomposition or model reduction method would be useful if the user is interested in quantifying the uncertainties in multiple regions simultaneously 3 2 comparison against mooring data in order to compare the model with observational data at depth we compare both hycom ensembles against 9 full depth mooring observations deployed by the bureau of ocean energy management boem science applications international corporation saic hamilton et al 2016 during the mutual hycom simulation period may 1 2010 may 30 2010 here we compare the mean and standard deviation ellipses of the point velocity for the entire 30 days like in xu et al 2013 fig 4 shows the comparison of the mean and standard deviation ellipses between the hycom ensemble members and the mooring data at different depths in each subfigure the mean velocity vectors of the ensemble members are shown in black and the standard deviation ellipses of the ensemble members are represented in red the mean and standard deviation ellipses of the mooring observations are in blue the mooring data falls in general within the envelope of the hycom ensembles at different depths this indicates that the two ensembles at depth capture reasonably well the observations the 49 member pc ensemble with only two initial conditions eof perturbations underestimates the variability observed in the two most northeastern moorings at the 100m and 300m depths whereas it seems to be well represented in the 798 member ensemble both at the surface and at depth the ensembles are realistic as evidenced by the model data comparison the ensembles captured the observed evolution especially in the targeted lc region regarding the lc edge the small ensemble can capture similar amount of variability compared with the large ensemble at the surface and at depth 4 relative entropy the uncertainty experiment in li et al 2016 was largely motivated by two considerations first to explore the impact of including additional eof modes and second to include other sources of input uncertainties specifically wind forcing uncertainties other sources of uncertainty such as surface heat flux river runoff or open boundary conditions were deemed to be less important or too remote for short term forecasting and were thus not considered the enlargement of the uncertain parameter space increases the sampling requirement substantially and the natural question is whether the variability gained in the output alternatively the missed uncertainties justifies the increased sampling cost to address this question we attempt to quantify this variability loss by considering various scenarios where the dimension of the uncertain input space is reduced note that the reduction can be achieved either by discarding high order eof modes and retaining only the leading order ones or by supressing independent initial conditions or wind forcing sources of input uncertainty we leverage the ability of pc methods to deliver output pdfs to quantify the variability loss using an information theoretic measure relative entropy kullback and leibler 1951 which measures the distance between two probability density functions p and q relative entropy can be defined in discrete form as follows kleeman 2002 6 d p q i 1 k p i log p i q i where p and q denote the pdfs of two distributions i is the discrete bin index and k is the total number of bins the relative entropy is a measure of distance between the reference pdf q and the pdf p it is zero when p and q are identical and increases as they grow apart in what follows q refers to the output pdf that is obtained by including all uncertain parameters whereas p refers to the output pdf that is obtained by restricting the number of uncertain inputs the relative entropy d p q thus quantifies the amount of variability lost by restricting the input uncertainty space the discrete pdfs are calculated as follows a large number of samples is drawn from the pc surrogate the range of a model variable ssh for example is then divided into bins and the probability of a specific bin is set to the number of samples in this bin divided by the total number of samples i e 7 p i n i i 1 k n i where ni represents the number of samples in bin i and k is the number of bins we use a large number of samples 100 000 and set k 20 for all relative entropy calculations 6 6 experimentation has shown that our results are not sensitive to k when k 20 the pc surrogate used here is the one constructed from the large ensemble since it has already been built and validated li et al 2016 and since it encompasses the largest uncertain input space table 2 displays several scenarios of restricting the uncertain input space 4 1 results for sea surface height we first investigate the variability loss caused by retaining two eof modes only instead of four scenario 1 in table 2 for both sources of uncertainty fig 5 a shows the time evolution of the relative entropy between the reference scenario that perturbs all eight eof modes and the scenario that perturbs only the first two leading eof modes of each uncertain source the results show that for the time span considered little variability is lost by ignoring the uncertainty due to higher eof modes modes three and four of each uncertain source and that there is very little gain in expanding the uncertainty space to include these higher order modes next we investigate the variability loss caused by omitting uncertainty in the wind forcing since fig 5a shows that the high order eof modes contribute little to the information content of the ssh pdf we focus only on the low order eof modes here fig 5b shows the variability loss by omitting uncertainty in the wind forcing scenario 2 in table 2 in which the ensemble that perturbs only the first two initial condition eof modes is compared with the fully perturbed ensemble the impact of omitting the wind forcing eof modes is mainly in the coastal region and little influence can be found in the lc region and the western gulf of mexico at day 30 the variability loss by omitting the initial condition eof modes is shown in fig 5c scenario 3 in table 2 the coastal signal disappears in this case which indicates that the first 2 wind forcing eof modes dominate ssh signal in the coastal region instead a strong signal is observed in the lc region and its magnitude grows as time evolves which indicates that the initial condition uncertainty is the dominant contributor to uncertainty in the lc region these results are consistent with the analysis of variance in li et al 2016 in which the ssh in the lc region is more sensitive to the initial condition eof perturbation modes while in the coastal region the ssh is more sensitive to the wind forcing eof modes since the first two initial condition eof modes contribute the most to the ssh variability in the deep gulf of mexico we further investigate the influence of each individual initial condition eof mode fig 5d shows the ssh variability loss by retaining only the 1st initial condition eof mode and fig 5e shows the ssh variability loss by retaining only the 2nd initial condition eof mode without the 2nd initial condition eof mode shown in fig 5d the ssh variability loss is localized in the north side of the lc especially at day 30 without the 1st initial condition eof mode shown in fig 5e the ssh variability loss is substantial in a localized region along the lc and its amplitude grows with time in the deep gulf of mexico two initial condition eof modes are necessary in order to capture most of the ssh variability in summary for ssh the variability loss caused by retaining only the two leading eof modes for initial condition and wind forcing uncertainties is rather negligible additionally the variability loss by omitting wind forcing input uncertainty is small in the lc region but is quite large in the coastal zone thus this posterior analysis suggests that a more optimal ensemble could have been designed by retaining only the first two leading eof modes of initial conditions and wind forcing uncertainties these results also indicate that the small hycom ensemble used in iskandarani et al 2016a that perturbs only the first two initial condition eof modes is a suitable choice for studying the ensemble statistics in the lc region as we do in the following section it should be noted that the relative entropy approach here could be generalized to any ensemble simulations to investigate the balance between the size of the ensemble and the information content contained in the ensemble 5 ensemble statistics 5 1 ensemble visualization ensemble simulations provide us with a way to derive statistics of the model which leads to an estimate of the confidence of the model prediction however mining useful information from the ensemble can be challenging since ensemble simulations usually involve a large number of single model runs the recently developed contour boxplot whitaker et al 2013 built on the notion of data depth enables us to extract valuable information from an ensemble here we are particularly interested in answering 1 what is the most representative ensemble member 2 what are the outliers of the ensemble simply speaking the contour boxplot can be considered as a generalization of the conventional boxplot both of these methods are designed for order statistics which requires an ordering of the data the difference between conventional boxplot and contour boxplot is that the former can only be applied to scalar quantities while the latter can be applied to functions and contours at the heart of the contour boxplot a measure of centrality is defined by the concept of data depth proposed from the statistics community whitaker et al 2013 the gist of data depth concept is to quantify the centrality or depth of a data sample with respect to an ensemble of data samples in practice the centrality or depth can be measured by how many times a function or contour falls within the band formed by an arbitrary set of other functions or contours fig 6 adopted from whitaker et al 2013 shows an example of how to measure the centrality or depth in the left subfigure three different blue curves form a grey band and three red curves are tested against the band the solid red curve falls completely within the grey band while the two dashed red curves partially fall within the grey band therefore the data depth of the solid red curve is larger than that of the dashed red curves for contours in the right subfigure the same logic applies we refer the reader to whitaker et al 2013 mirzargar et al 2014 for more descriptions of the methodology as well as an application in meteorology we apply the contour boxplot concept to the lc edges obtained from the 49 member hycom ensemble the key effort of the contour boxplot is to sort the 49 ensemble contours by their data depth defined in whitaker et al 2013 the deeper data sample is considered to be more representative than the shallower data sample the deepest data sample can be considered as the most representative ensemble member and the shallowest data samples can be considered as outliers fig 7 shows the contour boxplot for the edges of the lc and lc eddies as defined by the 17 cm ssh contours at day 30 the satellite ssh observation is shown in black for reference the satellite observations show that a lc eddy has separated from the lc at that date while in the mean of the ensemble simulations indicated by the green line the lc is still in its extended position on the other hand the most representative ensemble member identified by the median of the ensemble in yellow shows a similar lc eddy shedding stage compared with the satellite observations we mark the shallowest three ensemble members shown in red as outliers it is clear that these outliers are still in their early stage for lc eddy shedding process which is somewhat slow compared with other ensemble members in the uncertain parameter space these outliers are the ensemble members with extreme negative perturbations in both modes as seen in the inserted box in fig 7 next we connect the normalized uncertain perturbation to the estimated initial condition perturbation pattern fig 8 shows the initial perturbation approximated by the ssh difference between the perturbed and unperturbed runs one day after the start of the simulation the initial perturbations are shown according to their normalized random variables shown in the middle of the figure the bottom left subfigure represents the most negative perturbations for both eof modes the top right subfigure represents the most positive perturbations for both eof modes the dynamical process associated with eof mode1 the ξ 1 direction can be explained by the strengthening or weakening of the lc frontal eddies the signature of eof mode2 the ξ 2 direction is associated with variability along the edge of the lc as well as in the western gulf of mexico these signals strongly affect the intensity of the lc frontal eddies which play an important role in the lc eddy shedding process le hénaff et al 2012a 2014 the outliers identified by the data depth concept in fig 7 are located at the most negative perturbation of eof mode1 which is consistent with the related dynamical processes negative perturbation of eof mode1 is associated with the weakening of the lc frontal eddies which delays the lc eddy shedding event 5 2 an exploration of ssh pdf the estimate of the full pdf usually requires a large sample size sometimes only the low order statistical moments are calculated on the assumption that the underlying pdf can be approximated by a normal distribution the pc method provides us with an efficient way to estimate the full pdf of a model output we thus investigate whether the underlying distribution of the ssh field in the gulf of mexico is normal using the pc surrogate constructed by the 49 member hycom ensemble we first explore the pointwise ssh pdf at different locations in the gulf of mexico in fig 9 the location of four selected points a1 a4 and the lc edges are shown on the right subfigure on the left subfigure the ssh pdf from the four different locations are presented clearly the ssh pdf is not always normally distributed for example the ssh pdf at point a3 along the lc edge shows a bimodal distribution whereas the pdf at a2 shows a bias towards higher values next we investigate where in the gulf of mexico the ssh are normally distributed we reuse the relative entropy metric to quantify the distance between the pc surrogate pdf and its gaussian counterpart this gaussian counterpart is obtained by specifying the mean and variance as calculated from the pc surrogate fig 10 shows the relative entropy map between the ssh pdf in each grid cell and its gaussian counterpart we only plot the regions where the associated relative entropy is larger than or equal to 0 4 and the lc edges are also shown in the figure for reference it is clear that the strongest non gaussian signal appears in the lc region indicated by red color especially in regions where the variation in the lc edge is high this is not surprising as the lc is a highly nonlinear dynamical feature oey et al 2005 so the lc region is expected to show non gaussian statistic the relative entropy is an efficient tool to identify the locations of highly nonlinear features in an ensemble of simulations 6 summary and discussion this paper analyzes two ensembles designed to quantify using a polynomial chaos approach the uncertainties in forecasting the circulation in the gulf of mexico during the deep water horizon period of may 1 to may 30 2010 the two ensembles differed in the sources of uncertainty initial conditions and wind forcing uncertainties and in the amount of variability number of perturbation modes accounted for both ensembles relied on eof decomposition to perturb the initial conditions and wind forcing fields and considered the amplitude of these modes as the uncertain input parameters the eof based perturbations served to maximize the amount of input uncertainty using the smallest number of uncertain inputs so that the size of the ensemble required to sample the uncertain space remains manageable the model data comparison reveals that in general the observations fall within the envelope of uncertainty generated by the eof perturbations during the 30 day forecast period this is particularly true in the target area of the lc region where two eof modes used to perturb the initial conditions are enough to capture the variability in the system on the other hand the altimetry data shows the remnant of a lc eddy in the western side of the basin evolving outside the envelope predicted by the two ensembles this could be explained by an inability of our basin wide eof modes to capture simultaneously localized uncertainty on the western side of the basin and in the lc region and that the local uncertainty in the western side did not project on the first four eof modes one remedy is to compute separate eof modes in the eastern and western sides of the basin so that the variability in the former would not dominate the variability in the latter other approaches would involve abandoning the eof decomposition and resorting to perturbing the system using either singular modes buizza and palmer 1995 or bred vectors toth and kalnay 1997 however the computations of the singular vectors would require the availability of the tangent linear model and its adjoint and would incur additional computational costs likewise identifying the bred vectors would require running an ensemble of simulations prior to obtaining the pc ensemble itself the relative entropy metric was used to quantify the variability loss gain caused by accounting for different uncertainty sources and by including different amounts of input variability it shows that the variability loss caused by omitting higher eof modes in the input uncertainty is small at least for the 30 day period considered this result suggests that adding additional input uncertainty sources is more useful than adding high order eof modes of the same uncertainty source the uncertainty in forecasting the ssh field in the shelf regions for example is primarily caused by uncertainties in the wind forcing while the initial conditions uncertainty plays a secondary role the wind forcing uncertainty adds little to the ssh forecast uncertainty in the deep parts of the gulf where two eof modes used to perturb the initial conditions are enough to account for the forecast uncertainty in these regions the conclusions obtained here using the relative entropy metric are consistent with the variance based sensitivity analysis in li et al 2016 the analysis of the ssh pdfs shows a strong non gaussian signal in the lc region which is reflective of the bifurcation in the state of the lc caused by the eddy detachment furthermore the contour boxplot allowed us to identify the most representative ensemble member and the ensemble outliers the application of uncertainty quantification techniques in ocean modeling is in its early stages the most challenging part is to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to minimize the sampling cost of the uncertain input space while capturing the largest amount of input uncertainty the pc paradigm emphasizes the link between the input and output uncertainties by explicit construction of a surrogate and allows forecasters to identify the dominant contributors to the output uncertainties the efficiency of this uncertainty quantification implementation can be applied for model calibration to guide the selection of model parameters the availability of the full output pdf will open the door for data assimilation and predictability study in a non gaussian paradigm acknowledgments this research was

24079,it is expected that the assimilation of data in an ocean model disrupts the model s dynamical balance this disruption occurs because the analysis fields are not a precise solution to the equations of the model therefore the model adjusts to the applied increments with this limitation in mind we assess the impact of sequential data assimilation da on vertical velocity chosen because of its sensitivity to model dynamical balances we investigate vertical velocity within mesoscale eddies in the tasman sea and off tasmania australia in an ocean reanalysis that assimilates observations every four days in a free running model with no da ocean eddies often show a coherent pattern of alternating upward and downward cells these cells are induced by eddy distortion i e the eddy becoming more or less isotropic in this study we aim to first determine if a data assimilating model can reproduce these alternating upward and downward cells and then to investigate how the cells are affected by sequential da we view this study as a step towards better understanding the suitability of data assimilating ocean models for detailed analysis of ocean circulation and ocean dynamics we show that the vertical velocities are typically two times larger in magnitude on the day after assimilation compared to subsequent days despite the model adjustment the alternating upward and downward cells are present in the data assimilating model in fact we find that the model adjustment acts like an artificial eddy distortion on the first day after assimilation when the model is adjusting to the applied increments amplifying the vertical velocities within the eddies this artificial distortion impacts temperature and salinity through vertical advection the vertical advection terms are about 1 5 times higher on the day after assimilation compared to other days the temperature and salinity changes resulting from the stronger vertical advection are mostly 2 10 times smaller than the increments of these properties applied during assimilation our findings suggest that a data assimilating model may be useful for investigating the detailed dynamics of the ocean but care should be taken when interpreting results moreover we suggest that it is prudent to disregard the model s fields within the first day after assimilation particularly in analyses of dynamical balances keywords data assimilation initialisation eddies 1 introduction most eddy resolving ocean reanalysis and forecast systems assimilate ocean observations using some form of sequential data assimilation da this includes ensemble based methods e g oke et al 2002 2005 2008 sakov et al 2012 some implementations of variational methods i e incremental 4d var e g powell et al 2009 moore et al 2011 martin et al 2015 and other commonly used methods e g cooper and haines 1996 chassignet et al 2007 sequential da involves an explicit update of the model state at regular intervals e g daily or every few days these updates are typically applied to the model either in a single time step e g sakov et al 2012 or over multiple time steps e g oke et al 2008 moreover the updates to the model state are in most situations not dynamically consistent that is they are generally not precise solutions to the model equations updates to a model state are usually applied to all model variables i e temperature salinity sea level and horizontal velocity and can be regarded as a non physical forcing term in the model equations after a model is initialised it undergoes an adjustment where its dynamical balance is restored this typically involves inertial oscillations unrealistic mixing and some sort of artificial baroclinic and barotropic adjustment this process of adjustment of the model to da is widely regarded as undesirable in an early study of this issue daley 1981 referring to problems associated with these model adjustments says that they are at best a nuisance and at worst can seriously compromise the forecast procedure many efforts are made to limit the negative impacts of this adjustment after assimilation in a reanalysis system developed under bluelink a partnership between csiro the bureau of meteorology and the royal australian navy there have been attempts to reduce the problems associated with the model adjustment to da these attempts include the use of nudging oke et al 2005 incremental updating oke et al 2008 and careful generation of the underpinning ensemble oke et al 2013b despite these efforts models with da are often considered to be inappropriate for detailed dynamical studies with few exceptions e g oke and griffin 2011 schiller and oke 2015 although this perception is widespread very few studies have actually assessed the integrity of the model s dynamical processes in a model run with da one way to gain insight into this issue is to look at the behaviour of an unobserved variable in the data assimilating model free running models without da have been widely used to study many different aspects of eddy dynamics e g van sebille et al 2010 cetina heredia et al 2014 rykova et al 2017 however free running models are generally not able to reliably forecast eddies at the correct time and location this is because eddy formation and evolution is chaotic and models do not capture all relevant physics of the ocean at all scales if a study seeks to understand the dynamics of a particular eddy event a data assimilating model is probably needed the question we wish to answer here is whether a data assimilating model is suitable for a detailed dynamical analysis of ocean eddies to gain insight into this question we look at the vertical velocity within eddies simulated in a data assimilating model we choose vertical velocity because it is not observed and is sensitive to disruptions to a model s dynamical balance e g ageostrophic flow in a free running model eddies often have alternating upward and downward cells pilo et al 2018 fig 1a and d these cells are coherent over depth with maximum vertical velocities between 500 and 1000 m depth fig 1 b c e and f these cells are associated with eddy distortion i e the change in eddy isotropy as an eddy distorts changes in the balance between the relative vorticity and the stratification within the eddy induce vertical motion an outward distortion is associated with a downward motion within the eddy and an inward distortion is associated with an upward motion within the eddy the alternating cells have been analysed in idealised modelling studies martin and richards 2001 in vertical velocity fields derived from synthetic temperature and salinity data nardelli 2013 and in a realistic free running ocean general circulation model pilo et al 2018 in this study we aim to first determine if a data assimilating model can reproduce these cells of alternating upward and downward motion and then to investigate how these cells are affected by sequential da we view this study as a step towards better understanding the suitability of data assimilating ocean models for detailed analysis of ocean circulation and ocean dynamics this paper is organised with a description of the data and methods in section 2 results in section 3 a discussion in section 4 and conclusions in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 bluelink reanalysis bran bran version 3 5 hereafter bran3p5 is a model with data assimilation the free running model used to produce bran3p5 is version 2 of the ocean forecasting australian model oke et al 2013a ofam ofam2 is a near global model with 1 10 horizontal resolution around australia and 47 vertical levels the grid z has 5 m spacing near the surface 10 m spacing at 200 m depth 120 m spacing at 1000 m depth and coarser grid spacing below that the model is run for 36 years with a 14 year spin up and forced with 3 hourly surface heat freshwater and momentum fluxes from era interim dee and uppala 2009 with restoring to monthly sea surface

and salinity below 2000 m depth restoring time scale of 180 days for this study we use daily mean fields from bran3p5 bran3p5 is a multi year model integration of ofam with sequential da once every 4 days oke et al 2008 briefly the data assimilation system for bran3p5 uses ensemble optimal interpolation enoi oke et al 2002 evensen 2003 with 144 ensemble members the ensemble is comprised of anomalies computed from each month of the last 12 years of an 18 year model run of ofam with each member constructed by subtracting a 3 day mean from a 3 month mean with means centered on the centre of each month yielding an ensemble of intra seasonal anomalies observations that are assimilated include sea level anomaly from the radar altimeter database rads obtained in august 2012 from all available altimeters except navy s geosat follow on gfo satellite sea surface temperature from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr using a composite of 4 km resolution data from pathfinder and the naval oceanographic office navo and in situ temperature and salinity from argo floats the tropical atmosphere ocean tao array the world ocean circulation experiment woce hydrographic program the world ocean database 2005 boyer et al 2006 and the quality controlled ocean temperature archive gronell and wijffels 2008 containing expendable bathythermograph xbt and ctd data bran3p5 runs from january 1993 to july 2012 because of the climatological restoring below 2000 m and coarse vertical resolution we only consider the top 2000 m of bran3p5 throughout this study the technical process of sequential da for bran3p5 involves the following steps and is depicted in fig 2 the model background field denoted in fig 2 as xbackground is comprised of daily mean fields of temperature t salinity s sea level and the horizontal components of velocity u v four days after the previous assimilation step for each assimilation step the background field is compared to observations not represented in fig 2 using the enoi system described by oke et al 2008 2013b the background field is combined with observations yielding an analysis field represented in fig 2 as xanalysis calculated every 4 days the analysis field is intended to better match the assimilated observations and is simply the background field plus an increment denoted as xincrement that is 1 x a n

adaptive nudging is provided by sandery et al 2011 for the interested reader because the calculated analyses are not a precise solution to the model equations the model fields undergo a model adjustment denoted as adjustment in fig 2 sometimes referred to as the model shock e g waters et al 2017 in this study we seek to better understand the details of the model adjustment to da and specifically how this adjustment affects the modelled velocities t and s within eddies bran3p5 realistically reproduces the vertical structure of the studied region as shown in a comparison of the anomaly of the 15 c isotherm depth between sydney australia and wellington new zealand figs 3 a c blue line in f for this comparison the temperature collected by xbts along this line was assimilated into bran between 1993 and 2003 green in fig 3c and withheld between 2003 and 2006 magenta in fig 3c fig 3c shows that bran3p5 reproduces a realistic vertical structure relative to both assimilated green box and independent magenta box observations with the difference between the observations and the model being smaller than the signal bran3p5 unsurprisingly agrees better with the assimilated observation between 1993 and 2003 i e when assimilation occurred during this period bran3p5 realistically reproduces all of the large amplitude events evident in the observations this indicates that the assimilation used for bran3p5 is good at fitting these observations the surface structure of the studied region is also realistically reproduced by bran3p5 fig 3c f we compare surface velocities from bran3p5 with assimilated velocities derived from satellite altimetry and non assimilated velocities derived from drifting buoys the comparison between bran3p5 and the satellite altimetry data shows again good agreement with differences close to measurement errors of gridded altimetry 2 6 cm indicating that bran3p5 is tightly constrained to the assimilated observations the comparison between bran3p5 and the non assimilated drifter velocities also show in general good agreement with the location of eddies matching the reanalysis therefore despite localised differences between bran3p5 and observations the regional circulation and variability in the reanalysis are consistent with observations the examples of bran3p5 assessment shown in fig 3 represent a small sub set of comparisons presented by oke et al 2013b many other aspects of bran3p5 have been assessed by comparison with both assimilated and unassimilated observations in the published literature e g oke et al 2008 oke and griffin 2011 oke et al 2013b regarding the self consistency of the assumed errors in the data assimilation system bennet 1992 sakov and sandery 2015 show that the enoi system used here produces errors that are of the same order as the errors assumed in the ensemble despite the extensive assessment the vertical velocities of bran3p5 or any other model or reanalysis remain unvalidated owing to the paucity of reliable observation based estimates because of this limitation we do not seek to show that vertical velocities in bran3p5 are correct but instead we aim to assess the extent to which the vertical velocities in bran3p5 are consistent with the vertical velocities of a free running version of the underpinning model that is we seek to determine the extent to which da impacts the vertical velocities in an eddy resolving ocean model as a starting point we plan to assess whether bran3p5 reproduces the patterns of vertical velocities in eddies that are described in pilo et al 2018 2 2 eddy tracking we focus on eddies propagating in the tasman sea between tasmania and new zealand and in eddies propagating off eastern tasmania these eddies have a mean radius of 150 km mean depth of 1500 m they can live up to 5 years and mostly originate in the east australian current pilo et al 2015 tracking an eddy in the tasman sea in a data assimilating model is challenging first we find that after each update the position shape and amplitude of each eddy tends to change second because the tasman sea is a highly energetic region the recurrent eddy eddy and eddy bathymetry interactions also change each eddy s shape third there are observation gaps e g diamonds of missing data between altimetry tracks that sometimes lead to the apparent disappearance of an eddy for one or sometimes two assimilation cycles all of these factors complicate the process of automatically or even manually tracking eddies pilo et al 2015 to ensure that the eddy tracking is as accurate as possible we choose to track the eddies manually using the approach described by pilo et al 2015 we track the selected eddy by locating closed 0 1 m sea level anomaly sla contours in daily mean sla fields we track eddies on consecutive days until the eddy is no longer evident with a tolerance of two assimilation cycles 8 days we regard the eddy as no longer evident when the maximum absolute sla associated with the eddy becomes smaller than 0 1 m or until it can no longer be identified as a closed contour feature with the centre of an eddy approximately identified for each day during bran3p5 we refine the location of the eddy centre by objectively calculating the position of the sla extrema we then extract a 4 4 2000 m data cube centred on the eddy centre each data cube includes all relevant model variables and is used to analyse the eddy s properties as the eddy propagates as described in detail by pilo et al 2015 we regard manual eddy tracking as more appropriate than automated tracking particularly for detailed analyses of eddy case studies this is because a researcher can carefully consider the existence continuity and evolution of an eddy paying close attention to eddy eddy interactions for example because the number of eddies we intend to analyse in this study is small the overhead of manual tracking is warranted by contrast in a study that requires tracking of a large number of eddies for example a global analysis as in chaigneau et al 2008 chelton et al 2011 faghmous et al 2015 manual tracking is too time consuming and an automated approach is the only feasible option we note however that even in these global analyses manual eddy tracking is often considered as the truth and used for assessing the efficacy of automated eddy tracking see further discussion in pilo et al 2015 2 3 empirical orthogonal functions to isolate the coherent components of the vertical velocity fields within the eddies we perform an empirical orthogonal function eof analysis for this analysis we use 4 4 maps of depth averaged vertical velocity 0 2000 m using the above mentioned data cubes for each day of the eddy lifetime for the eof analysis we first de trend each time series in time for each grid point then we compute a singular value decomposition of the anomaly field we perform five separate eof analyses of daily time series of depth averaged vertical velocities for the eddies considered here the time series span between 184 and 344 days in a first analysis we consider all daily fields of vertical velocity for the lifetime of each eddy in the other analyses we sub sample each time series and perform the eof analysis on fields from day 1 2 3 and 4 of each assimilation cycle separately that is we use one field every four days representing different days of each assimilation cycle recall that bran3p5 assimilates data every four days these time series are hereafter referred to as da1 da2 da3 and da4 so da1 includes model fields on the day immediately after each assimilation da2 includes model fields two days after each assimilation and so on 3 results we first assess the extent to which the model velocities both horizontal and vertical artificially adjust to the changes introduced during the model update for this assessment we calculate the root mean square rms of depth averaged eddy kinetic energy eke computed as u 2 v 2 2 and the depth averaged vertical velocity considering da1 da2 da3 and da4 separately fig 4 a and b respectively we also calculate the volume averaged eke and the volume averaged absolute vertical velocity contained within the 4 o 4 o 2000 m data cubes fig 4c and d respectively to demonstrate the features of interest for this study we first show results for one cyclonic eddy in the tasman sea fig 4 results in fig 4 are typical of other examples of reanalysed eddies in bran3p5 in the tasman sea there is no obvious systematic adjustment in horizontal velocity immediately following the da fig 4a and c the difference between the rms of eke in da1 and da2 4 is the order of 10 4 m2s 2 two orders of magnitude smaller than the rms of total eke itself the vertical velocity however shows a significant increase in rms immediately after assimilation da1 in fig 4b additionally there is a clear spike in absolute vertical velocity on the first day after the update da1 denoted by the red stars in fig 4d the difference between the rms of vertical velocity in da1 and da2 4 is the order of 10 m d 1 the same order of magnitude as the rms of total vertical velocity itself this indicates that the vertical velocities are sensitive to the introduced changes during the assimilation step we wish to better understand this adjustment to further examine the impact of the sequential da on the vertical velocity within eddies we select three case studies to analyse in detail fig 5 a the first case study is an anticyclonic eddy propagating westwards south of australia fig 5b and 10 the second case study is an anticyclonic eddy propagating southwards in the tasman sea figs 5c and 11 the third case study is a cyclonic eddy propagating eastwards also in the tasman sea figs 5d and 12 we calculate the rossby number ro given by the relationship between the eddy maximum absolute relative vorticity and the planetary vorticity at each time step of the eddy lifetime fig 6 the southward propagating anticyclonic eddy and the cyclonic eddy are highly non linear ro 0 3 and have a strong ageostrophic component the westward propagating anticyclonic eddy is weaker than the other two eddies and its ro varies between 0 15 and 0 27 we select these eddies because they propagate through different oceanographic regimes the chosen eddy that is south of australia propagates through deep quiescent waters and the eddies in the tasman sea repeatedly interact with other mesoscale features and are influenced by bathymetry we note that eddies similar to these considered here show a coherent signal of the alternating upward and downward cells in ofam the free running model with no da see fig 1 pilo et al 2018 fields of vertical velocity for the three case studies considered here show evidence of the upward and downward cells fig 5 consistent with those described by pilo et al 2018 this indicates that the process of eddy distortion is present in bran3p5 indeed analysis of the vertical velocities in these eddies show that these cells are coherent in depth with maxima at sub surface 1000 1500 m in addition the vertical velocities within eddies in bran3p5 fig 5 are the same order of magnitude as the vertical velocity within eddies in ofam with no da fig 1 these results confirm that the data assimilating model does reproduce the alternating upward and downward cells both qualitatively and quantitatively when compared to the free running model consistent with pilo et al 2018 we find the patterns of vertical velocity associated with eddy distortion dominate the leading modes of variability fig 7 the signal of this pattern is typically partitioned across several eof modes the partitioning of the signal occurs because the cells rotate as the eddy propagates in the same sense of the eddy rotation e g cells rotate anticlockwise in an anticyclonic eddy in the southern hemisphere in the southward anticyclonic eddy the variance attributed to the alternating cells pattern in modes 2 3 and 4 sums up to 55 of the total variance for vertical velocity fig 7 table 1 in the other case studies the combined variance is lower 30 and 34 but within the range evident in the eddies of the free running model table 1 the time series of the eof eigenvectors show fluctuations that are clearly related to the assimilation cycle showing higher amplitude values on the day after each assimilation da1 this is quantified in fig 8 showing the rms of the time series of the eof eigenvectors as a function of the assimilation cycle gathering amplitudes for da1 da2 da3 and da4 together fig 7 we plot the values for the first 10 eofs for each of the three eddy case studies the westward anticyclonic the southward anticyclonic and the eastward cyclonic fig 8 the results indicate that the amplitude of the time series of the eof eigenvectors of the dominant modes showing the upward and downward cells are typically 2 times greater in da1 fig 8 and sometimes with opposite sign to the amplitudes in da2 da3 and da4 time series of the eof amplitudes in fig 7 therefore the amplitude of the vertical velocities that we associate with eddy distortion is actually larger on the day after each assimilation this suggests that the model s response to the introduced changes i e the applied increments is like an artificial eddy distortion by artificial we mean that an eddy does not realistically distort i e change its isotropy to induce the vertical velocity but the shape of the newly assimilated eddy is different from the original modelled eddy and therefore a new shape with a different level isotropy is assimilated to further explore the nature of the increments applied to the model during each assimilation cycle we perform an eof analysis on the calculated increments for sea level fig 9 because the eofs are statistical modes they do not correspond directly to physical processes however we interpret the dominant eofs to represent changes in an eddy s amplitude position or shape we interpret modes with one local extrema close to the eddy centre to correspond to changes in eddy amplitude e g fig 9h and 9m modes with two local extrema and approximately zero amplitude close to the eddy centre to correspond to changes in eddy position e g fig 9g and 9j and modes with multiple local extrema with approximately zero amplitude close to the eddy centre to correspond to changes in eddy shape e g fig 9p and 9q the results in fig 9 indicate that about half the variance of the sea level increments is related to changes in eddy amplitude or position however all of the higher modes a sub set of which are included in fig 9 have multiple local extrema and are apparently related to changes in eddy shape i e artificial eddy distortion the structures of these higher modes are not as clean as the patterns seen in the eofs of depth averaged vertical velocity in fig 7 this is because the artificial distortion associated with the da is non conservative i e it doesn t conserve volume unlike a dynamically consistent eddy distortion in a dynamically balanced ocean to examine the effect of this artificial eddy distortion in the model and to determine whether these patterns are dominant immediately after assimilation we compute eofs of vertical velocity using fields from the first second third and fourth day after the update i e da1 da2 da3 and da4 separately that is for each of the case studies we subset the time series using only da1 fields and re calculate the eofs and the time series of the eof amplitudes as previously described in section 2 the results figs 10 11 and 12 indicate that for all three eddies the dominate eof modes of vertical velocity is the alternating cell pattern on da2 da3 and da4 this pattern however is less clear immediately after assimilation i e da1 we attribute the amplified vertical velocities of the upward and downward cells pattern in da1 to the fact that the eddy distortion introduced is artificial and corresponds to changes in the eddy amplitude position and shape at the same time as shown in fig 9 despite this amplified vertical velocity the patterns that we associate with eddy distortion are present explaining about 13 27 of the total variance in da1 and 31 47 of the variance in da4 table 1 from our analysis of vertical velocity in the data assimilating model we conclude that the model s response to da is consistent with an artificial eddy distortion the timescales on which eddies distort in a free running model and in the ocean from altimetry for example are about a week pilo et al 2018 brassington 2010 his fig 9 but in the case of a data assimilating model the changes are introduced on shorter time scales that is the changes are imposed artificially over one day this may explain why the amplitude of the dominant modes of vertical velocity are often greater and the alternating cells pattern is less clear in da1 compared to da2 da3 and da4 next we wish to quantify the degree to which the vertical velocities associated with the artificial eddy distortion alter the model s t and s fields recall that during the da process the model s t s u and v are updated with an analysis the analysis is constructed by combining the model fields before assimilation and the observations at their relevant time and location ideally for a data assimilating model the model dynamically evolves the ocean state seamlessly integrating forward in time from the analysed initial conditions in practice owing to dynamical imbalances of the analyses i e the analyses are not a precise solution to the model equations the model undergoes a period of adjustment the analyses above show that this adjustment for vertical velocity is rather significant this must impact t and s through vertical advection this advection is larger than it should be because of the model adjustment to da previously described in section 2 and shown in fig 2 if we conservatively assume that vertical velocity on da1 is entirely associated with the artificial eddy distortion we can estimate the impacts of this artificial change on t and s with this investigation we seek to estimate how much the vertical velocity caused by model adjustment takes the model s t and s fields away from the calculated analyses meant to best match observations we analyse fields of the vertical advection of t using the term w d t d z and vertical advection of s using w d s d z fig 13 here we show typical examples of the relevant terms for da1 day 264 and da4 day 267 for the case study south of australia the pattern of depth averaged w d t d z has the same spatial distribution as the pattern of depth averaged vertical velocity fig 13a and b left and centre this pattern is coherent and typically of the same sign throughout the water column fig 13d by contrast the pattern of depth averaged w d s d z is less clear fig 13a and b right this is because the sign of w d s d z changes at mid depth fig 13e owing to the presence of intermediate water which has a subsurface salinity minima these results are similar to examples of other days of this same eddy and to examples of the other two case studies considered here additionally we convert the vertical advection terms with units of c d and psu d into t and s changes over a day by simply multiplying w d t d z and w d s d z by time giving us units of c and psu this allows us to directly compare the changes associated with vertical advection given by the model adjustment with the increments applied to the model during the assimilation step that is we can determine whether the artificial changes due to the model adjustment are bigger or smaller than the changes due to assimilation for this comparison we calculate the rms of volume averaged t and s changes over a day associated with the model adjustment fig 14 solid lines and with the increments applied to the model fig 14 dashed lines for the three case studies the rms of δt and δs due to the model adjustment clearly spikes on the first days of each assimilation cycle solid lines in fig 14 on average the magnitude of the rms of these properties in da1 is 1 5 times larger than in da2 da4 for all eddies this high rms amplitude in da1 above the da2 da4 time series is attributable to an amplified vertical advection associated with the model adjustment to da this adjustment is largest in the southward propagating anticyclonic eddy fig 14b in this eddy the amplified vertical advection after da is about the same amplitude as the vertical advection in between da cycles despite the effect of the da in da1 the rms of the model adjustment is still 2 to 10 times smaller than the rms of the increment dashed lines in fig 14 sometimes however the model adjustment and the increments may have the same rms magnitude e g around day 20 in fig 14b therefore even with the impact of da on the vertical velocity within eddies in da1 the model adjustment of both t and s is still smaller than the increments of t and s applied during update this analysis indicates that the changes to t and s during the period of model adjustment is small compared to the changes to t and s during the model update when the increments are applied in each assimilation step 4 discussion we expect that the horizontal velocity in a data assimilating model adjusts on time scales of one inertial period or longer in our study region between 18 and 20 h the time scales for the adjustment of vertical velocity is less clear we show that to a large extent the vertical velocity appears to adjust within one day therefore our results indicate that vertical velocity in the model adjusts at a similar time scale of the horizontal velocities the upward and downward cells associated with eddy distortion develop in time scales of about a week brassington 2010 pilo et al 2018 which is much longer that the time scales of model adjustments after da this suggests that analyses of vertical velocity in data assimilating models may provide meaningful insights in ocean dynamics provided the adjustment periods are disregarded that is care should be taken when using vertical velocities immediately i e one day after assimilation the upward and downward cells are seen in all dominant modes of the depth averaged vertical velocity eofs sometimes however this pattern is less evident in eofs considering only the first days after the update i e da1 this is because in da1 the eddy distorts artificially while in da2 da3 and da4 the eddy distorts in a way that is more dynamically consistent in a dynamically consistent ocean the eddy often distorts inwards in one axis and outwards in the other axis e g inwards in latitude and outwards in longitude pilo et al 2018 consequently the loss of volume caused by the inwards distortion is mostly compensated by the gain of volume in the outwards distortion an artificial eddy distortion caused by an artificial update to the model is more complicated than a natural distortion during the update the eddy shape may change completely with large imbalances introduced resulting in an adjustment of the model with large changes in amplitude this artificial eddy distortion may induce a different number of vertical velocity cells at each update and suddenly change the eddy amplitude and position therefore an artificial eddy distortion seems to add a lot of noise to the upward and downward cells disrupting these patterns on the day after the update the alternated cell pattern is less clear in the southward propagating anticyclonic eddy fig 11 than in the other two eddies chosen as case studies figs 10 and 12 the southward propagating eddy interacts with the continental shelf break and with several seamounts as it propagates this interaction with the bottom impacts the vertical velocity pattern associated with eddy distortion this is why the alternating cell pattern in this eddy is unclear in eof mode 1 fig 11c being possibly hindered by vertical velocities induced by eddy bottom interaction the pattern is however evident in eof mode 2 fig 11d further suggesting that other mechanisms besides eddy distortion impact the vertical velocity within this eddy we show that because of the stronger vertical velocities in da1 the vertical advection of t and s is 1 5 times greater than in da2 da3 and da4 we attribute these higher values in da1 to the impact of eddy artificial distortion only this is however an over estimate of the impact of eddy artificial distortion on da1 the vertical velocity is comprised of two components one due to the model s artificial adjustment that we associate with artificial eddy distortion and one due to the model s dynamical variability it is not straightforward to separate these components however we can conclude that the larger amplitude vertical advection after each assimilation step is attributable to the artificial adjustment of the model this artificial adjustment causes the model s t and s fields to depart from the imposed analysed t and s fields thereby impacting the reanalysis to determine how significant this adjustment is we compare these changes to the changes explicitly imposed during the assimilation step the increments we find that the increments of t applied to the data assimilating model during the update are up to 5 times larger than the values associated with the model adjustment in the case of s the increments are up to 16 times larger than the model adjustment this indicates that although the t and s fields are impacted after each assimilation step and undergo model adjustement this impact is not particularly significant relative to the increments as techniques of da continue to improve and as methods for constructing analyses that are more dynamically consistent are developed we might expect this impact after the assimilation step to decrease 5 conclusion in the version of bran that we analyse here bran3p5 oke et al 2008 we find that the response of horizontal velocities to da are relatively small with no clear change to time series of eke for example by contrast we find that the amplitudes of the vertical velocities on the day immediately after assimilation are typically 2 times greater than the vertical velocities at 2 3 or 4 days after assimilation we find that the data assimilating model reproduces patterns of vertical velocity associated with eddy distortion that are comparable to the patterns generated by a free running model with no da furthermore we find that the amplitude of modes of vertical velocity showing the eddy distortion patterns are often greater immediately after assimilation this leads us to conclude that the model adjustment to the introduced changes at the time of assimilation is consistent with an artificial eddy distortion analyses of the vertical velocities of the model indicate that the impact of this artificial eddy distortion on the model s t and s fields are typically smaller than the increments applied during the assimilation process itself for this work we chose to analyse three case studies of eddies that are representative of the study region this allowed us to examine each case study in detail the results shown here would benefit from analysis of a larger sample of case studies in addition the results relative to the model adjustment shown here would be different for different da system here we only looked at the update s imbalance in bran3p5 in the limit that a data assimilation produces dynamically balanced analyses the model adjustment becomes zero so for a linear model where dynamically balanced analyses can be calculated precisely the model adjustment is not an issue for more sophisticated data assimilation systems e g 4dvar and enkf applied to non linear models depending on how these systems are implemented we expect the model adjustment to be less than those reported here for an enoi system similarly if the amplitudes of the increments are less if for example data assimilation is applied more often e g daily or sub daily or nudging periods are longer then we also expect the model adjustments to be less we were motivated to determine whether a data assimilating model could reliably be used to examine dynamical processes noting the artificial response of the vertical velocity immediately after assimilation we conclude that such analyses should be undertaken with caution indeed unlike free running models data assimilating models generally reproduce more realistic variability with ocean features in approximately the right place and time but they also are plagued with the problem of dynamical imbalance these factors should be carefully considered before employing results from a data assimilating model to understand dynamical processes of the ocean furthermore we hope that the results of this study motivate the ocean da community to continue developing dynamically consistent methods for da acknowledgements

24079,it is expected that the assimilation of data in an ocean model disrupts the model s dynamical balance this disruption occurs because the analysis fields are not a precise solution to the equations of the model therefore the model adjusts to the applied increments with this limitation in mind we assess the impact of sequential data assimilation da on vertical velocity chosen because of its sensitivity to model dynamical balances we investigate vertical velocity within mesoscale eddies in the tasman sea and off tasmania australia in an ocean reanalysis that assimilates observations every four days in a free running model with no da ocean eddies often show a coherent pattern of alternating upward and downward cells these cells are induced by eddy distortion i e the eddy becoming more or less isotropic in this study we aim to first determine if a data assimilating model can reproduce these alternating upward and downward cells and then to investigate how the cells are affected by sequential da we view this study as a step towards better understanding the suitability of data assimilating ocean models for detailed analysis of ocean circulation and ocean dynamics we show that the vertical velocities are typically two times larger in magnitude on the day after assimilation compared to subsequent days despite the model adjustment the alternating upward and downward cells are present in the data assimilating model in fact we find that the model adjustment acts like an artificial eddy distortion on the first day after assimilation when the model is adjusting to the applied increments amplifying the vertical velocities within the eddies this artificial distortion impacts temperature and salinity through vertical advection the vertical advection terms are about 1 5 times higher on the day after assimilation compared to other days the temperature and salinity changes resulting from the stronger vertical advection are mostly 2 10 times smaller than the increments of these properties applied during assimilation our findings suggest that a data assimilating model may be useful for investigating the detailed dynamics of the ocean but care should be taken when interpreting results moreover we suggest that it is prudent to disregard the model s fields within the first day after assimilation particularly in analyses of dynamical balances keywords data

2015 and other commonly used methods e g cooper and haines 1996 chassignet et al 2007 sequential da involves an explicit update of the model state at regular intervals e g daily or every few days these updates are typically applied to the model either in a single time step e g sakov et al 2012 or over multiple time steps e g oke et al 2008 moreover the updates to the model state are in most situations not dynamically consistent that is they are generally not precise solutions to the model equations updates to a model state are usually applied to all model variables i e temperature salinity sea level and horizontal velocity and can be regarded as a non physical forcing term in the model equations after a model is initialised it undergoes an adjustment where its dynamical balance is restored this typically involves inertial oscillations unrealistic mixing and some sort of artificial baroclinic and barotropic adjustment this process of adjustment of the model to da is widely regarded as undesirable in an early study of this issue daley 1981 referring to problems associated with these model adjustments says that they are at best a nuisance and at worst can seriously compromise the forecast procedure many efforts are made to limit the negative impacts of this adjustment after assimilation in a reanalysis system developed under bluelink a partnership between csiro the bureau of meteorology and the royal australian navy there have been attempts to reduce the problems associated with the model adjustment to da these attempts include the use of nudging oke et al 2005 incremental updating oke et al 2008 and careful generation of the underpinning ensemble oke et al 2013b despite these efforts models with da are often considered to be inappropriate for detailed dynamical studies with few exceptions e g oke and griffin 2011 schiller and oke 2015 although this perception is widespread very few studies have actually assessed the integrity of the model s dynamical processes in a model run with da one way to gain insight into this issue is to look at the behaviour of an unobserved variable in the data assimilating model free running models without da have been widely used to study many different aspects of eddy dynamics e g van sebille et al 2010 cetina heredia et al 2014 rykova et al 2017 however free running models are generally not able to reliably forecast eddies at the correct time and location this is because eddy formation and evolution is chaotic and models do not capture all relevant physics of the ocean at all scales if a study seeks to understand the dynamics of a particular eddy event a data assimilating model is probably needed the question we wish to answer here is whether a data assimilating model is suitable for a detailed dynamical analysis of ocean eddies to gain insight into this question we look at the vertical velocity within eddies simulated in a data assimilating model we choose vertical velocity because it is not observed and is sensitive to disruptions to a model s dynamical balance e g ageostrophic flow in a free running model eddies often have alternating upward and downward cells pilo et al 2018 fig 1a and d these cells are coherent over depth with maximum vertical velocities between 500 and 1000 m depth fig 1 b c e and f these cells are associated with eddy distortion i e the change in eddy isotropy as an eddy distorts changes in the balance between the relative vorticity and the stratification within the eddy induce vertical motion an outward distortion is associated with a downward motion within the eddy and an inward distortion is associated with an upward motion within the eddy the alternating cells have been analysed in idealised modelling studies martin and richards 2001 in vertical velocity fields derived from synthetic temperature and salinity data nardelli 2013 and in a realistic free running ocean general circulation model pilo et al 2018 in this study we aim to first determine if a data assimilating model can reproduce these cells of alternating upward and downward motion and then to investigate how these cells are affected by sequential da we view this study as a step towards better understanding the suitability of data assimilating ocean models for detailed analysis of ocean circulation and ocean dynamics this paper is organised with a description of the data and methods in section 2 results in section 3 a discussion in section 4 and conclusions in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 bluelink reanalysis bran bran version 3 5 hereafter bran3p5 is a model with data assimilation the free running model used to produce bran3p5 is version 2 of the ocean forecasting australian model oke et al 2013a ofam ofam2 is a near global model with 1 10 horizontal resolution around australia and 47 vertical levels the grid z has 5 m spacing near the surface 10 m spacing at 200 m depth 120 m spacing at 1000 m depth and coarser grid spacing below that the model is run for 36 years with a 14 year spin up and forced with 3 hourly surface heat freshwater and momentum fluxes from era interim dee and uppala 2009 with restoring to monthly sea surface

and salinity below 2000 m depth restoring time scale of 180 days for this study we use daily mean fields from bran3p5 bran3p5 is a multi year model integration of ofam with sequential da once every 4 days oke et al 2008 briefly the data assimilation system for bran3p5 uses ensemble optimal interpolation enoi oke et al 2002 evensen 2003 with 144 ensemble members the ensemble is comprised of anomalies computed from each month of the last 12 years of an 18 year model run of ofam with each member constructed by subtracting a 3 day mean from a 3 month mean with means centered on the centre of each month yielding an ensemble of intra seasonal anomalies observations that are assimilated include sea level anomaly from the radar altimeter database rads obtained in august 2012 from all available altimeters except navy s geosat follow on gfo satellite sea surface temperature from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr using a composite of 4 km resolution data from pathfinder and the naval oceanographic office navo and in situ temperature and salinity from argo floats the tropical atmosphere ocean tao array the world ocean circulation experiment woce hydrographic program the world ocean database 2005 boyer et al 2006 and the quality controlled ocean temperature archive gronell and wijffels 2008 containing expendable bathythermograph xbt and ctd data bran3p5 runs from january 1993 to july 2012 because of the climatological restoring below 2000 m and coarse vertical resolution we only consider the top 2000 m of bran3p5 throughout this study the technical process of sequential da for bran3p5 involves the following steps and is depicted in fig 2 the model background field denoted in fig 2 as xbackground is comprised of daily mean fields of temperature t salinity s sea level and the horizontal components of velocity u v four days after the previous assimilation step for each assimilation step the background field is compared to observations not represented in fig 2 using the enoi system described by oke et al 2008 2013b the background field is combined with observations yielding an analysis field represented in fig 2 as xanalysis calculated every 4 days the analysis field is intended to better match the assimilated observations and is simply the background field plus an increment denoted as xincrement that is 1 x a n

adaptive nudging is provided by sandery et al 2011 for the interested reader because the calculated analyses are not a precise solution to the model equations the model fields undergo a model adjustment denoted as adjustment in fig 2 sometimes referred to as the model shock e g waters et al 2017 in this study we seek to better understand the details of the model adjustment to da and specifically how this adjustment affects the modelled velocities t and s within eddies bran3p5 realistically reproduces the vertical structure of the studied region as shown in a comparison of the anomaly of the 15 c isotherm depth between sydney australia and wellington new zealand figs 3 a c blue line in f for this comparison the temperature collected by xbts along this line was assimilated into bran between 1993 and 2003 green in fig 3c and withheld between 2003 and 2006 magenta in fig 3c fig 3c shows that bran3p5 reproduces a realistic vertical structure relative to both assimilated green box and independent magenta box observations with the difference between the observations and the model being smaller than the signal bran3p5 unsurprisingly agrees better with the assimilated observation between 1993 and 2003 i e when assimilation occurred during this period bran3p5 realistically reproduces all of the large amplitude events evident in the observations this indicates that the assimilation used for bran3p5 is good at fitting these observations the surface structure of the studied region is also realistically reproduced by bran3p5 fig 3c f we compare surface velocities from bran3p5 with assimilated velocities derived from satellite altimetry and non assimilated velocities derived from drifting buoys the comparison between bran3p5 and the satellite altimetry data shows again good agreement with differences close to measurement errors of gridded altimetry 2 6 cm indicating that bran3p5 is tightly constrained to the assimilated observations the comparison between bran3p5 and the non assimilated drifter velocities also show in general good agreement with the location of eddies matching the reanalysis therefore despite localised differences between bran3p5 and observations the regional circulation and variability in the reanalysis are consistent with observations the examples of bran3p5 assessment shown in fig 3 represent a small sub set of comparisons presented by oke et al 2013b many other aspects of bran3p5 have been assessed by comparison with both assimilated and unassimilated observations in the published literature e g oke et al 2008 oke and griffin 2011 oke et al 2013b regarding the self consistency of the assumed errors in the data assimilation system bennet 1992 sakov and sandery 2015 show that the enoi system used here produces errors that are of the same order as the errors assumed in the ensemble despite the extensive assessment the vertical velocities of bran3p5 or any other model or reanalysis remain unvalidated owing to the paucity of reliable observation based estimates because of this limitation we do not seek to show that vertical velocities in bran3p5 are correct but instead we aim to assess the extent to which the vertical velocities in bran3p5 are consistent with the vertical velocities of a free running version of the underpinning model that is we seek to determine the extent to which da impacts the vertical velocities in an eddy resolving ocean model as a starting point we plan to assess whether bran3p5 reproduces the patterns of vertical velocities in eddies that are described in pilo et al 2018 2 2 eddy tracking we focus on eddies propagating in the tasman sea between tasmania and new zealand and in eddies propagating off eastern tasmania these eddies have a mean radius of 150 km mean depth of 1500 m they can live up to 5 years and mostly originate in the east australian current pilo et al 2015 tracking an eddy in the tasman sea in a data assimilating model is challenging first we find that after each update the position shape and amplitude of each eddy tends to change second because the tasman sea is a highly energetic region the recurrent eddy eddy and eddy bathymetry interactions also change each eddy s shape third there are observation gaps e g diamonds of missing data between altimetry tracks that sometimes lead to the apparent disappearance of an eddy for one or sometimes two assimilation cycles all of these factors complicate the process of automatically or even manually tracking eddies pilo et al 2015 to ensure that the eddy tracking is as accurate as possible we choose to track the eddies manually using the approach described by pilo et al 2015 we track the selected eddy by locating closed 0 1 m sea level anomaly sla contours in daily mean sla fields we track eddies on consecutive days until the eddy is no longer evident with a tolerance of two assimilation cycles 8 days we regard the eddy as no longer evident when the maximum absolute sla associated with the eddy becomes smaller than 0 1 m or until it can no longer be identified as a closed contour feature with the centre of an eddy approximately identified for each day during bran3p5 we refine the location of the eddy centre by objectively calculating the position of the sla extrema we then extract a 4 4 2000 m data cube centred on the eddy centre each data cube includes all relevant model variables and is used to analyse the eddy s properties as the eddy propagates as described in detail by pilo et al 2015 we regard manual eddy tracking as more appropriate than automated tracking particularly for detailed analyses of eddy case studies this is because a researcher can carefully consider the existence continuity and evolution of an eddy paying close attention to eddy eddy interactions for example because the number of eddies we intend to analyse in this study is small the overhead of manual tracking is warranted by contrast in a study that requires tracking of a large number of eddies for example a global analysis as in chaigneau et al 2008 chelton et al 2011 faghmous et al 2015 manual tracking is too time consuming and an automated approach is the only feasible option we note however that even in these global analyses manual eddy tracking is often considered as the truth and used for assessing the efficacy of automated eddy tracking see further discussion in pilo et al 2015 2 3 empirical orthogonal functions to isolate the coherent components of the vertical velocity fields within the eddies we perform an empirical orthogonal function eof analysis for this analysis we use 4 4 maps of depth averaged vertical velocity 0 2000 m using the above mentioned data cubes for each day of the eddy lifetime for the eof analysis we first de trend each time series in time for each grid point then we compute a singular value decomposition of the anomaly field we perform five separate eof analyses of daily time series of depth averaged vertical velocities for the eddies considered here the time series span between 184 and 344 days in a first analysis we consider all daily fields of vertical velocity for the lifetime of each eddy in the other analyses we sub sample each time series and perform the eof analysis on fields from day 1 2 3 and 4 of each assimilation cycle separately that is we use one field every four days representing different days of each assimilation cycle recall that bran3p5 assimilates data every four days these time series are hereafter referred to as da1 da2 da3 and da4 so da1 includes model fields on the day immediately after each assimilation da2 includes model fields two days after each assimilation and so on 3 results we first assess the extent to which the model velocities both horizontal and vertical artificially adjust to the changes introduced during the model update for this assessment we calculate the root mean square rms of depth averaged eddy kinetic energy eke computed as u 2 v 2 2 and the depth averaged vertical velocity considering da1 da2 da3 and da4 separately fig 4 a and b respectively we also calculate the volume averaged eke and the volume averaged absolute vertical velocity contained within the 4 o 4 o 2000 m data cubes fig 4c and d respectively to demonstrate the features of interest for this study we first show results for one cyclonic eddy in the tasman sea fig 4 results in fig 4 are typical of other examples of reanalysed eddies in bran3p5 in the tasman sea there is no obvious systematic adjustment in horizontal velocity immediately following the da fig 4a and c the difference between the rms of eke in da1 and da2 4 is the order of 10 4 m2s 2 two orders of magnitude smaller than the rms of total eke itself the vertical velocity however shows a significant increase in rms immediately after assimilation da1 in fig 4b additionally there is a clear spike in absolute vertical velocity on the first day after the update da1 denoted by the red stars in fig 4d the difference between the rms of vertical velocity in da1 and da2 4 is the order of 10 m d 1 the same order of magnitude as the rms of total vertical velocity itself this indicates that the vertical velocities are sensitive to the introduced changes during the assimilation step we wish to better understand this adjustment to further examine the impact of the sequential da on the vertical velocity within eddies we select three case studies to analyse in detail fig 5 a the first case study is an anticyclonic eddy propagating westwards south of australia fig 5b and 10 the second case study is an anticyclonic eddy propagating southwards in the tasman sea figs 5c and 11 the third case study is a cyclonic eddy propagating eastwards also in the tasman sea figs 5d and 12 we calculate the rossby number ro given by the relationship between the eddy maximum absolute relative vorticity and the planetary vorticity at each time step of the eddy lifetime fig 6 the southward propagating anticyclonic eddy and the cyclonic eddy are highly non linear ro 0 3 and have a strong ageostrophic component the westward propagating anticyclonic eddy is weaker than the other two eddies and its ro varies between 0 15 and 0 27 we select these eddies because they propagate through different oceanographic regimes the chosen eddy that is south of australia propagates through deep quiescent waters and the eddies in the tasman sea repeatedly interact with other mesoscale features and are influenced by bathymetry we note that eddies similar to these considered here show a coherent signal of the alternating upward and downward cells in ofam the free running model with no da see fig 1 pilo et al 2018 fields of vertical velocity for the three case studies considered here show evidence of the upward and downward cells fig 5 consistent with those described by pilo et al 2018 this indicates that the process of eddy distortion is present in bran3p5 indeed analysis of the vertical velocities in these eddies show that these cells are coherent in depth with maxima at sub surface 1000 1500 m in addition the vertical velocities within eddies in bran3p5 fig 5 are the same order of magnitude as the vertical velocity within eddies in ofam with no da fig 1 these results confirm that the data assimilating model does reproduce the alternating upward and downward cells both qualitatively and quantitatively when compared to the free running model consistent with pilo et al 2018 we find the patterns of vertical velocity associated with eddy distortion dominate the leading modes of variability fig 7 the signal of this pattern is typically partitioned across several eof modes the partitioning of the signal occurs because the cells rotate as the eddy propagates in the same sense of the eddy rotation e g cells rotate anticlockwise in an anticyclonic eddy in the southern hemisphere in the southward anticyclonic eddy the variance attributed to the alternating cells pattern in modes 2 3 and 4 sums up to 55 of the total variance for vertical velocity fig 7 table 1 in the other case studies the combined variance is lower 30 and 34 but within the range evident in the eddies of the free running model table 1 the time series of the eof eigenvectors show fluctuations that are clearly related to the assimilation cycle showing higher amplitude values on the day after each assimilation da1 this is quantified in fig 8 showing the rms of the time series of the eof eigenvectors as a function of the assimilation cycle gathering amplitudes for da1 da2 da3 and da4 together fig 7 we plot the values for the first 10 eofs for each of the three eddy case studies the westward anticyclonic the southward anticyclonic and the eastward cyclonic fig 8 the results indicate that the amplitude of the time series of the eof eigenvectors of the dominant modes showing the upward and downward cells are typically 2 times greater in da1 fig 8 and sometimes with opposite sign to the amplitudes in da2 da3 and da4 time series of the eof amplitudes in fig 7 therefore the amplitude of the vertical velocities that we associate with eddy distortion is actually larger on the day after each assimilation this suggests that the model s response to the introduced changes i e the applied increments is like an artificial eddy distortion by artificial we mean that an eddy does not realistically distort i e change its isotropy to induce the vertical velocity but the shape of the newly assimilated eddy is different from the original modelled eddy and therefore a new shape with a different level isotropy is assimilated to further explore the nature of the increments applied to the model during each assimilation cycle we perform an eof analysis on the calculated increments for sea level fig 9 because the eofs are statistical modes they do not correspond directly to physical processes however we interpret the dominant eofs to represent changes in an eddy s amplitude position or shape we interpret modes with one local extrema close to the eddy centre to correspond to changes in eddy amplitude e g fig 9h and 9m modes with two local extrema and approximately zero amplitude close to the eddy centre to correspond to changes in eddy position e g fig 9g and 9j and modes with multiple local extrema with approximately zero amplitude close to the eddy centre to correspond to changes in eddy shape e g fig 9p and 9q the results in fig 9 indicate that about half the variance of the sea level increments is related to changes in eddy amplitude or position however all of the higher modes a sub set of which are included in fig 9 have multiple local extrema and are apparently related to changes in eddy shape i e artificial eddy distortion the structures of these higher modes are not as clean as the patterns seen in the eofs of depth averaged vertical velocity in fig 7 this is because the artificial distortion associated with the da is non conservative i e it doesn t conserve volume unlike a dynamically consistent eddy distortion in a dynamically balanced ocean to examine the effect of this artificial eddy distortion in the model and to determine whether these patterns are dominant immediately after assimilation we compute eofs of vertical velocity using fields from the first second third and fourth day after the update i e da1 da2 da3 and da4 separately that is for each of the case studies we subset the time series using only da1 fields and re calculate the eofs and the time series of the eof amplitudes as previously described in section 2 the results figs 10 11 and 12 indicate that for all three eddies the dominate eof modes of vertical velocity is the alternating cell pattern on da2 da3 and da4 this pattern however is less clear immediately after assimilation i e da1 we attribute the amplified vertical velocities of the upward and downward cells pattern in da1 to the fact that the eddy distortion introduced is artificial and corresponds to changes in the eddy amplitude position and shape at the same time as shown in fig 9 despite this amplified vertical velocity the patterns that we associate with eddy distortion are present explaining about 13 27 of the total variance in da1 and 31 47 of the variance in da4 table 1 from our analysis of vertical velocity in the data assimilating model we conclude that the model s response to da is consistent with an artificial eddy distortion the timescales on which eddies distort in a free running model and in the ocean from altimetry for example are about a week pilo et al 2018 brassington 2010 his fig 9 but in the case of a data assimilating model the changes are introduced on shorter time scales that is the changes are imposed artificially over one day this may explain why the amplitude of the dominant modes of vertical velocity are often greater and the alternating cells pattern is less clear in da1 compared to da2 da3 and da4 next we wish to quantify the degree to which the vertical velocities associated with the artificial eddy distortion alter the model s t and s fields recall that during the da process the model s t s u and v are updated with an analysis the analysis is constructed by combining the model fields before assimilation and the observations at their relevant time and location ideally for a data assimilating model the model dynamically evolves the ocean state seamlessly integrating forward in time from the analysed initial conditions in practice owing to dynamical imbalances of the analyses i e the analyses are not a precise solution to the model equations the model undergoes a period of adjustment the analyses above show that this adjustment for vertical velocity is rather significant this must impact t and s through vertical advection this advection is larger than it should be because of the model adjustment to da previously described in section 2 and shown in fig 2 if we conservatively assume that vertical velocity on da1 is entirely associated with the artificial eddy distortion we can estimate the impacts of this artificial change on t and s with this investigation we seek to estimate how much the vertical velocity caused by model adjustment takes the model s t and s fields away from the calculated analyses meant to best match observations we analyse fields of the vertical advection of t using the term w d t d z and vertical advection of s using w d s d z fig 13 here we show typical examples of the relevant terms for da1 day 264 and da4 day 267 for the case study south of australia the pattern of depth averaged w d t d z has the same spatial distribution as the pattern of depth averaged vertical velocity fig 13a and b left and centre this pattern is coherent and typically of the same sign throughout the water column fig 13d by contrast the pattern of depth averaged w d s d z is less clear fig 13a and b right this is because the sign of w d s d z changes at mid depth fig 13e owing to the presence of intermediate water which has a subsurface salinity minima these results are similar to examples of other days of this same eddy and to examples of the other two case studies considered here additionally we convert the vertical advection terms with units of c d and psu d into t and s changes over a day by simply multiplying w d t d z and w d s d z by time giving us units of c and psu this allows us to directly compare the changes associated with vertical advection given by the model adjustment with the increments applied to the model during the assimilation step that is we can determine whether the artificial changes due to the model adjustment are bigger or smaller than the changes due to assimilation for this comparison we calculate the rms of volume averaged t and s changes over a day associated with the model adjustment fig 14 solid lines and with the increments applied to the model fig 14 dashed lines for the three case studies the rms of δt and δs due to the model adjustment clearly spikes on the first days of each assimilation cycle solid lines in fig 14 on average the magnitude of the rms of these properties in da1 is 1 5 times larger than in da2 da4 for all eddies this high rms amplitude in da1 above the da2 da4 time series is attributable to an amplified vertical advection associated with the model adjustment to da this adjustment is largest in the southward propagating anticyclonic eddy fig 14b in this eddy the amplified vertical advection after da is about the same amplitude as the vertical advection in between da cycles despite the effect of the da in da1 the rms of the model adjustment is still 2 to 10 times smaller than the rms of the increment dashed lines in fig 14 sometimes however the model adjustment and the increments may have the same rms magnitude e g around day 20 in fig 14b therefore even with the impact of da on the vertical velocity within eddies in da1 the model adjustment of both t and s is still smaller than the increments of t and s applied during update this analysis indicates that the changes to t and s during the period of model adjustment is small compared to the changes to t and s during the model update when the increments are applied in each assimilation step 4 discussion we expect that the horizontal velocity in a data assimilating model adjusts on time scales of one inertial period or longer in our study region between 18 and 20 h the time scales for the adjustment of vertical velocity is less clear we show that to a large extent the vertical velocity appears to adjust within one day therefore our results indicate that vertical velocity in the model adjusts at a similar time scale of the horizontal velocities the upward and downward cells associated with eddy distortion develop in time scales of about a week brassington 2010 pilo et al 2018 which is much longer that the time scales of model adjustments after da this suggests that analyses of vertical velocity in data assimilating models may provide meaningful insights in ocean dynamics provided the adjustment periods are disregarded that is care should be taken when using vertical velocities immediately i e one day after assimilation the upward and downward cells are seen in all dominant modes of the depth averaged vertical velocity eofs sometimes however this pattern is less evident in eofs considering only the first days after the update i e da1 this is because in da1 the eddy distorts artificially while in da2 da3 and da4 the eddy distorts in a way that is more dynamically consistent in a dynamically consistent ocean the eddy often distorts inwards in one axis and outwards in the other axis e g inwards in latitude and outwards in longitude pilo et al 2018 consequently the loss of volume caused by the inwards distortion is mostly compensated by the gain of volume in the outwards distortion an artificial eddy distortion caused by an artificial update to the model is more complicated than a natural distortion during the update the eddy shape may change completely with large imbalances introduced resulting in an adjustment of the model with large changes in amplitude this artificial eddy distortion may induce a different number of vertical velocity cells at each update and suddenly change the eddy amplitude and position therefore an artificial eddy distortion seems to add a lot of noise to the upward and downward cells disrupting these patterns on the day after the update the alternated cell pattern is less clear in the southward propagating anticyclonic eddy fig 11 than in the other two eddies chosen as case studies figs 10 and 12 the southward propagating eddy interacts with the continental shelf break and with several seamounts as it propagates this interaction with the bottom impacts the vertical velocity pattern associated with eddy distortion this is why the alternating cell pattern in this eddy is unclear in eof mode 1 fig 11c being possibly hindered by vertical velocities induced by eddy bottom interaction the pattern is however evident in eof mode 2 fig 11d further suggesting that other mechanisms besides eddy distortion impact the vertical velocity within this eddy we show that because of the stronger vertical velocities in da1 the vertical advection of t and s is 1 5 times greater than in da2 da3 and da4 we attribute these higher values in da1 to the impact of eddy artificial distortion only this is however an over estimate of the impact of eddy artificial distortion on da1 the vertical velocity is comprised of two components one due to the model s artificial adjustment that we associate with artificial eddy distortion and one due to the model s dynamical variability it is not straightforward to separate these components however we can conclude that the larger amplitude vertical advection after each assimilation step is attributable to the artificial adjustment of the model this artificial adjustment causes the model s t and s fields to depart from the imposed analysed t and s fields thereby impacting the reanalysis to determine how significant this adjustment is we compare these changes to the changes explicitly imposed during the assimilation step the increments we find that the increments of t applied to the data assimilating model during the update are up to 5 times larger than the values associated with the model adjustment in the case of s the increments are up to 16 times larger than the model adjustment this indicates that although the t and s fields are impacted after each assimilation step and undergo model adjustement this impact is not particularly significant relative to the increments as techniques of da continue to improve and as methods for constructing analyses that are more dynamically consistent are developed we might expect this impact after the assimilation step to decrease 5 conclusion in the version of bran that we analyse here bran3p5 oke et al 2008 we find that the response of horizontal velocities to da are relatively small with no clear change to time series of eke for example by contrast we find that the amplitudes of the vertical velocities on the day immediately after assimilation are typically 2 times greater than the vertical velocities at 2 3 or 4 days after assimilation we find that the data assimilating model reproduces patterns of vertical velocity associated with eddy distortion that are comparable to the patterns generated by a free running model with no da furthermore we find that the amplitude of modes of vertical velocity showing the eddy distortion patterns are often greater immediately after assimilation this leads us to conclude that the model adjustment to the introduced changes at the time of assimilation is consistent with an artificial eddy distortion analyses of the vertical velocities of the model indicate that the impact of this artificial eddy distortion on the model s t and s fields are typically smaller than the increments applied during the assimilation process itself for this work we chose to analyse three case studies of eddies that are representative of the study region this allowed us to examine each case study in detail the results shown here would benefit from analysis of a larger sample of case studies in addition the results relative to the model adjustment shown here would be different for different da system here we only looked at the update s imbalance in bran3p5 in the limit that a data assimilation produces dynamically balanced analyses the model adjustment becomes zero so for a linear model where dynamically balanced analyses can be calculated precisely the model adjustment is not an issue for more sophisticated data assimilation systems e g 4dvar and enkf applied to non linear models depending on how these systems are implemented we expect the model adjustment to be less than those reported here for an enoi system similarly if the amplitudes of the increments are less if for example data assimilation is applied more often e g daily or sub daily or nudging periods are longer then we also expect the model adjustments to be less we were motivated to determine whether a data assimilating model could reliably be used to examine dynamical processes noting the artificial response of the vertical velocity immediately after assimilation we conclude that such analyses should be undertaken with caution indeed unlike free running models data assimilating models generally reproduce more realistic variability with ocean features in approximately the right place and time but they also are plagued with the problem of dynamical imbalance these factors should be carefully considered before employing results from a data assimilating model to understand dynamical processes of the ocean furthermore we hope that the results of this study motivate the ocean da community to continue developing dynamically consistent methods for da acknowledgements
