16400,increased nitrogen n deposition rates over the past century have affected both north american and european mountain lake ecosystems ecological sensitivity of mountain lakes to n deposition varies however because chemical and biological responses are modulated by local watershed and lake properties we evaluated predictors of mountain lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition across north american and european mountain ranges and included as response variables dissolved inorganic n din nnh4 nno3 concentrations and phytoplankton biomass predictors of these responses were evaluated at three different spatial scales hemispheric regional subregional using regression tree random forest and generalized additive model gam analysis analyses agreed that northern hemisphere mountain lake din was related to n deposition rates and smaller scale spatial variability e g regional variability between north american and european lakes and subregional variability between mountain ranges analyses suggested that din n deposition and subregional variability were important for northern hemisphere mountain lake phytoplankton biomass together these findings highlight the need for finer scale subregional analyses by mountain range of lake sensitivity to n deposition subregional analyses revealed differences in predictor variables of lake sensitivity in addition to n deposition rates lake and watershed features such as land cover bedrock geology maximum lake depth zmax and elevation were common modulators of lake din subregional phytoplankton biomass was consistently positively related with total phosphorus tp in europe while north american locations showed variable relationships with n or p this study reveals scale dependent watershed and lake characteristics modulate

atmospheric deposition due to high elevation williams and tonnessen 2000 slow weathering bedrock steep topography absent or poorly developed watershed soils sparse watershed vegetation cover and low nutrient concentrations psenner et al 1999 nanus et al 2005 clow et al 2010 high elevation exposes alpine lakes to greater rates of n deposition than low elevation lakes williams and tonnessen 2000 enhanced atmospheric n deposition has shifted many lakes in north america and europe from n limitation to n and p co limitation or p limitation bergström and jansson 2006 elser et al 2009 other ecological effects on lakes include acidification nanus et al 2009 increased primary productivity goldman 1988 jassby et al 1994 nydick et al 2004 increased phytoplankton biomass sickman et al 2003 nydick et al 2004 decreased lake clarity goldman 1988 jassby et al 1994 and phytoplankton community changes caused by increased relative abundances of diatom taxa indicative of moderate nutrient enrichment wolfe et al 2001 2003 saros et al 2005 hundey et al 2014 williams et al 2016 a critical load is a threshold value above which deleterious ecological effects of n deposition can be detected burns et al 2008 in mountain lakes phytoplankton growth and diversity are sensitive to nutrient enrichment and respond to even small increases in din concentrations 3 43 µg l 1 arnett et al 2012 nanus et al 2012 hence critical loads of n deposition that characterize phytoplankton responses are commonly low for high elevation lake systems 1 0 1 5 kg n ha 1 year 1 saros et al 2011 baron et al 2011 a complicating factor when applying critical loads as a management tool unece icp 2004 porter et al 2005 ouimet et al 2006 jeffries et al 2010 is that aquatic ecosystem responses to n deposition rates are likely to vary depending on watershed features processes lake nutrient status and biological nutrient limitation thus n deposition rate alone is not always a good predictor of lake ecological sensitivity and response to enrichment environmental variables and lake watershed features are important in determining lake din and phytoplankton biomass responses to atmospheric n deposition for instance in bioassay experiments mountain lake phytoplankton sensitivity to nutrient additions was modulated by lake watershed vegetation which influence lake nitrate and phosphate concentrations nydick et al 2003 clow et al 2010 evaluated watershed factors that characterize sensitivity of lakes to atmospheric n deposition in the sierra nevada of california us lakes with low acid neutralizing capacity anc were more vulnerable to n enrichment from atmospheric deposition nanus et al 2009 determined that lake anc and sensitivity to acidic deposition was predicted by watershed topography bedrock and vegetation type inclusion of lake watershed features at the subregional scale i e within mountain ranges or across geographically close mountain ranges may be important in explaining lake ecological responses to n deposition nanus et al 2012 modeled critical load exceedance of lakes across the rocky mountains of the us including n deposition and important watershed features as predictor variables this model predicted that lakes in areas such as the grand teton mountains wy and glacier national park mt may be impacted by excess n deposition but paleolimnological evidence from these areas indicates minimal changes in planktonic diatom communities inconsistent sensitivity of planktonic taxa to n deposition through time among grand teton mountain lakes may be due to shallow basins and ultraviolet radiation inhibition vinebrooke and leavitt 1999 spaulding et al 2015 in glacier national park lack of directional change in diatom communities to n deposition was attributed to lake p limitation saros et al 2011 since subregional predictors of lake sensitivity likely differ among mountain ranges they are important for water and wildlife managers to identify and include in their evaluation in target areas of concern determining factors that affect lake ecological sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition is a critical management priority with the potential to inform policy and management planning there are locations that seem to deviate from predicted trends of lake ecological impact and factors that have not been assessed in previous lake sensitivity models such as lake depth clarity and nutrient limitation which may control lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition to improve understanding of spatial variability of lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition we evaluated lake and watershed factors across multiple spatial scales ranging from the northern hemisphere to subregional mountain ranges we used a combination of statistical approaches to assess the relationships between deposition rates watershed properties lake characteristics and lake ecological sensitivity finally we compared broad and local scale analyses to highlight the complexity and variation of lake sensitivity to n deposition 2 material and methods to evaluate lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition we analyzed 339 alpine and subalpine lakes located in western north america and europe fig 1 tables 1 s1 lake sensitivity is qualitatively defined here as the susceptibility of a lake to exhibit an ecological response to atmospheric n deposition we used measurements of din a metric of n enrichment and chlorophyll a chl a concentration a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as ecological response variables to evaluate lake sensitivity lake sensitivity to n deposition was interpreted from the response of din or phytoplankton biomass to predictor variables in our statistical models predictor variables of lake sensitivity included a suite of physical chemical and biological variables table 1 these included elevation landcover type unvegetated watershed to lake area and nutrient din and total phosphorus tp concentrations all of which have been demonstrated to affect lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition in previous smaller scale studies nydick et al 2003 clow et al 2010 additionally we included maximum lake depth zmax nutrient limitation status din tp bergström 2010 and bedrock geology as we hypothesized these factors would be important at subregional scales saros et al 2011 spaulding et al 2015 dates of lake observations ranged from 1985 to 2017 and were limited to summer and autumn sampling to avoid spring snowmelt inputs and under ice conditions not all data variables were available for all sites table 1 many lakes had repeated observations from multiple years and seasons 1029 observations total 128 lakes with multiple observations every sampling instance for each lake was assigned an n deposition rate according to the year sampled and location of the lake measurements for each individual lake were then averaged if they were collected at different depths and at multiple times since the availability of land cover data was variable across sites vegetation cover categories i e forests meadow and shrub cover and bare watershed categories i e talus scree and bedrock were combined into a unvegetated watershed variable as n p and p modulating metals al and fe can vary with geological formation norton et al 2011 holloway and dahlgren 2002 we assessed bedrock geological formation type this allowed us to broadly categorize bedrock geology and capture limnologically relevant geochemical variation across space while maintaining simplicity within the models bedrock geology formation data for us lake locations were obtained from the state geologic map compilation sgmc horton et al 2017 canadian bedrock geological data were from the database of the geologic map of north america garrity and soller 2009 european bedrock geology data were from the international geological map of europe igme 5000 asch 2005 atmospheric deposition data for lake locations was obtained for the us

nrsp 3 2020 canadian total annual n wet dry deposition data were obtained from the north american climate integration and diagnostics model nacid hember 2018 as the nacid model only had data to 2013 that year s deposition data was applied to lake sampling instances that occurred after 2013 this was done before overall mean values were calculated from multiple sampling instances for inclusion in the predictive models european nox and nred wet deposition data were obtained from the european monitoring and evaluation programme emep model provided by the norwegian meteorological institute met norway european dry deposition was not included as wet deposition contains the majority of n compared to dry deposition in most alpine areas clow et al 2015 and the spatial distribution of dry deposition can be uncertain nanus et al 2012 all n deposition datasets were gridded and resolutions varied across models nadp 4 12 km nacid 1 km emep 11 1 km or 0 1 longitude and latitude to determine the spatial variability of lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition data were evaluated at three different spatial scales hemispheric which included the whole dataset regional which split the data between north america and europe and subregional which split the data according to areas of collection fig 1 lake sensitivity was assessed at each scale using three statistical techniques including regression tree analysis de ath and fabricius 2000 random forest analysis breiman 2001 and generalized additive models gams wood 2017 regression tree and random forest analysis were used in an exploratory analysis to provide descriptive results gams were applied for their predictive utility using watershed and lake features and excluded subregional and regional spatial variability these analyses were used in tandem due to the different strengths each offered regression tree analysis describes relationships between a dependent variable and its predictor variables but can be sensitive to small changes in the dataset random forest analysis is more robust than regression tree analysis but is not as descriptive in its summarization of relationships among variables based on these analyses response variables can be selected and evaluated by gams to determine the strength of a response to its predictor variables together these models provide great explanatory power and predictive utility which is especially true when agreement was demonstrated across model types subregional data availability sometimes made some or all of these analyses impossible particularly in the sierra nevada mountains see table 1 to assess the relationships between response variables and their multiple predictor variables regression tree analyses were done using the r packages rpart therneau 2019 and rpart plot milborrow 2019 to determine the relative importance of predictor variables in explaining response variable variation random forest analysis was performed using the r packages randomforest liaw and wiener 2018 and caret kuhn et al 2020 variables with insufficient data coverage were dropped from the analysis at subregional scales each random forest analysis was constructed using 1000 random trees with 3 random variables sampled at each split percent increase in mean square error incmse was calculated for each variable and reported as weighted variable importance incmse indicates the increase of mse in the predictive model that occurs when a given factor is permuted thus larger incmse values indicate greater statistical importance for a variable to assess the ability of predictor variables to explain variation of lake sensitivity gam analyses were used to construct models of northern hemisphere lake responses i e phytoplankton biomass or din concentration to predictor variables identified in the regression tree and random forest analyses gams of lake sensitivity were constructed from the predictors that regression tree and random forest analysis identified as important excluding subregional and regional spatial variation these models were then evaluated for best performance determined by the sample size n variance explained r2 minimized generalized cross validation gcv scores and minimized akaike information criterion aic scores gam analyses were conducted using the mgcv r package wood 2019 generalized linear models were used in conjunction with the gams to confirm whether overall correlation between variable pairs was positive or negative 3 results 3 1 northern hemisphere scale regression tree analysis of the full suite of

gam explained 30 of the variance across 122 lakes table 2 3 2 regional scale regression tree analysis at the regional scale indicated that drivers of din concentrations differ between european and north american lakes european lake din concentration was related to n deposition rates and lake depth fig 2c din was lowest in shallow low deposition areas slightly higher in deep 10 m lakes in low deposition areas and highest in high deposition areas regardless of lake depth several factors explained north american lake din mean 91 µg din l 1 n 216 observations fig 2e north american lakes were

lakes din concentrations in these locations were further modified by elevation mountain lakes located in the southern and canadian rocky mountains had a mean din concentration of 137 µg l 1 53 of north american lakes this group of lakes was also modified by elevation and n deposition rates random forest analysis showed that n deposition rates elevation and unvegetated watershed coverage were important predictor variables of european lake din followed by subregional variation and lake depth n 34 fig 3b however the best performing gam included unvegetated watershed p 0 02 as the sole din predictor variable r2 0 11 n 34 table 2 random forest analysis indicated subregional spatial variation and unvegetated watershed were the most important predictor variables of lake din in north

north american lakes n 126 table 2 regression trees indicated different predictor variables of chl a between european lakes mean chl a 3 7 µg l 1 n 28 observations fig 2d and north american lakes mean chl a 1 9 µg l 1 n 190 observations fig 2f tp was the most important predictor variable for european lake phytoplankton biomass north american predictors of chl a concentration were more complicated for lakes situated between 1024 and 3094 m in elevation mean chl a concentration was 1 2 µg l 1 81 of sample lakes and was split by din concentration above 148 µg din l 1 chl a averaged 1 9 µg l 1 24

elevation were split into three terminal groups according to n deposition rates and din tp with mean chl a ranging 2 2 11 ug l 1 random forest analysis for european lakes suggested tp n deposition

while lakes with greater deposition rates had an average concentration of 140 µg din l 1 71 bedrock geology n deposition rates and zmax further modified lake din concentrations random forest analysis

table 2 3 3 4 pacific northwest mountains united states regression tree analysis indicated that elevation was related to din concentration in lakes located in alpine areas of the pacific northwest fig

regression tree model with tp and elevation further modulating chl a fig 5f for lakes that had din below the threshold concentration of 148 µg l 1 58 of sample lakes the average chl a concentration

table 2 3 3 7 alps italy austria and germany regression tree analysis was not appropriate given the amount of data available for lake din in the alps random forest analysis identified n deposition

identified as the two primary predictor variables of lake chl a fig 4h the best performing gam used tp as the only predictor variable for chl a p 0 01 r2 0 82 n 8 table 2 4 discussion while research unequivocally shows that n deposition increases din concentrations in remote lakes bergström and jansson 2006 elser et al 2009 our results suggest that determinants of lake ecological sensitivity depended on the spatial scale considered this highlights the importance of watershed context and the necessity of local scale analyses for understanding and predicting lake ecological sensitivity specifically predictors of din or chl a sensitivity at the northern hemisphere scale were not necessarily identified at the regional or subregional scales by investigating n sensitivity at multiple spatial scales we demonstrate that lake and watershed features can influence ecological responses of lakes to n deposition these results have at least two important implications 1 predictive methods of ecosystem sensitivity that rely on a single or small number of predictor variables may yield limited predictions of ecosystem sensitivity especially when deployed at different scales or locations and 2 as different predictor variables are effective at different scales scale appropriate variable selection should be of primary concern to management agencies attempting to predict lake ecological sensitivity across the entire northern hemisphere north america and europe subregional spatial variability consistently ranked as an important predictor of din and phytoplankton biomass at large spatial scales i e northern hemisphere and regional this highlights the importance of site specific variables that operate at small scales and the necessity of subregional variables and analyses for understanding and predicting lake ecological sensitivity for instance gam models were able to explain 41 87 of din variation across subregional european lake clusters according to gams n deposition rate was only important in the alps wa la in the tatras and elevation and lake depth in the bohemian forest these differences in predictor variables likely reflect differences in subregional watershed features that modulate atmospheric n deposition delivery to surface waters such as vegetation cover vegetation type and soil development thus when a gam was constructed to predict regional scale european lake din some locally important variables were excluded from the model and its predictive power was low explaining 11 of variation of din across european lakes din was negatively related to the percentage of unvegetated watershed cover in the european lake gam inclusion of bohemian forest lakes with high din and forested catchments was likely responsible for this relationship this could indicate din saturation of the environment resulting in din leaching fenn et al 1998 and increased rates of nutrient cycling in the relatively lower elevation bohemian forest landscape clow and sueker 2000 in the tatras and alps however din was positively related with unvegetated watershed area due to facilitation of atmospheric n delivery to surface waters through watersheds consistent with observations from north america clow et al 2010 facilitation of atmospheric n transport through unvegetated watersheds is likely due to short water residence time in undeveloped soils sickman et al 2002 clow et al 2003 coupled with limited biological uptake and assimilation that would be associated with microbially rich organic soils and vegetation clow and sueker 2000 clow et al 2010 thus the direction of effect of a watershed feature on lake sensitivity could change according to spatial scale the direction of an effect could also depend on location zmax was an important predictor of lake din that exhibited positive and negative effects between european and north american regions and subregions respectively zmax can be related to water residence time as well as watershed slope topography hollister et al 2011 but this is not always the case additionally other watershed features such as elevation soil type geology and land cover could modulate the relationship between zmax and lake din though opposite effects of a variable between different scales or locations raise fundamental questions about the validity of applying models across lake regions the object of this study was to identify differences between scales and geographic areas using scale and location specific models these findings therefore provide valuable insight and justification for an empirically based approach to complement other types of remote lake management like critical load analysis drivers of din concentrations varied substantially among mountain ranges in north america for instance the southern and canadian rocky mountains had higher average din concentration than other mountain ranges this subregional variation likely limits the usefulness of predictive gams to assess regional din variation but surprisingly the north american gam was able to explain more variation of lake din 28 than the european gam 11 predictive gams of individual north american mountain ranges exhibited variable performance explaining 8 61 of din variation indicative of variability between mountain ranges and unmeasured variables that are known to account for more variation such as glacier influence watershed slope steepness soil composition vegetation type and hydrology nydick et al 2003 nanus et al 2005 clow et al 2010 saros et al 2010 in addition to the scale dependency of lake ecological sensitivity this study highlights and contrasts two metrics din and phytoplankton biomass that are commonly used to monitor lake n enrichment din allows the detection of lake n enrichment and is therefore useful in determining how watershed features interact to modulate n deposition given multiple extrinsic factors that may determine the magnitude of n deposition how deposited n moves through a watershed and the role of within lake processes that alter din concentrations it is not surprising that our ability to predict din in mountain lakes was variably successful phytoplankton biomass is a key biological metric that informs us of how a lake responds to n enrichment based on intrinsic factors such as nutrient limitation at regional and subregional scales phytoplankton biomass was more easily explained than din and had more consistent nutrient related predictors din and tp were commonly included in phytoplankton biomass predictive gams along with factors affecting nutrient loading to lakes such as n deposition rates and unvegetated catchment together our findings suggest that both metrics din and phytoplankton biomass are informative of different processes and aspects of lake sensitivity that is lake sensitivity to n enrichment vs biological lake sensitivity respectively thus management agencies may wish to evaluate one or both metrics based on specific management goals directional change in phytoplankton communities in response to n enrichment from atmospheric deposition is a biological metric that could be of interest to lake managers but we were not able of evaluating this metric with our dataset in alpine lakes this type of community response is commonly characterized by an increase in relative abundance of opportunistic diatom species such as fragilaria crotonensis asterionella formosa and discostella stelligera baron et al 1986 wolfe et al 2001 2003 sickman et al 2003 saros et al 2005 köster and pienitz 2006 saros et al 2012 spaulding et al 2015 our findings suggest north american lakes are currently more ecologically sensitive to atmospheric n deposition than the european lakes included in our analyses lake phytoplankton biomass was tightly coupled with lake nutrient status at all scales but there were regional differences between north america and europe in nutrient importance that reflect historical atmospheric deposition trends current lake sensitivity to n deposition and future ecological trajectories in contrast to north america regional and subregional european lake phytoplankton biomass which was limited to three localities was related to tp across analyses suggesting p limitation and reduced sensitivity to n enrichment caution is recommended when interpreting positive relationships between tp and phytoplankton biomass however as these factors covary since phytoplankton biomass contributes to the tp pool stow and cha 2013 still the relationship of p to phytoplankton biomass likely reflects that several european lakes are now p limited after prolonged n enrichment kopáček et al 2005b bergström 2006 elser et al 2009 though this pattern can vary based on changing p deposition patterns camarero and catalan 2012 even though subregional lake phytoplankton biomass predictor variables in north america were more complex compared to europe random forest analysis determined that subregional spatial variability was less important in predicting north american and european lake phytoplankton biomass compared to nutrients din in north america and tp in europe this finding suggests regional consistency of phytoplankton biomass predictor variables across mountain ranges for instance north american phytoplankton biomass was related to n associated factors i e n deposition din din tp and lake elevation in the three analyses the relationship of n related factors to the north american lake phytoplankton biomass suggests that in this region high elevation lakes are generally n limited and expected to continue to respond to elevated n deposition or factors that can enhance n availability such as cryosphere thaw or reductions in snowpack oleksy et al 2020 southern rocky mountain lakes central rocky mountain lakes and pacific northwest mountain lakes appeared to be primarily n limited according to a combination of regression tree random forest and gam analyses n limitation in the southern rocky mountains which were mostly grouped within colorado is consistent with other work morris and lewis 1988 ballantyne et al 2011 though there is likely some spatial variation within this group that our analyses are not assessing for instance the colorado front range has been a site of historically high and increasing n deposition rates lewis and grant 1980 lewis et al 1984 baron et al 2000 burns 2003 and may be less sensitive to further n deposition williams et al 1996 gardner et al 2008 central rocky mountain phytoplankton biomass sensitivity to n is consistent with research in the uinta mountain range demonstrating n or n and p co limitation hundey et al 2014 our results suggest that northern rocky mountain lakes were p limited reducing their sensitivity to n deposition this is consistent with interpretations of lake sediment diatom records from the northern rocky mountains showing little to no response of algae communities to relatively high rates of n deposition in glacier national park mt saros et al 2011 phytoplankton predictor variables for canadian rocky mountains included din and tp suggesting n and p co limitation or variable nutrient limitation across lakes of this subregion research has demonstrated p limitation and insensitivity to n enrichment in many canadian rocky mountain lakes though 14 of remote lakes and ponds n 29 were n limited and several exhibited co limitation murphy et al 2010 see also brahney et al 2014 2015 cook et al 2020 thus our findings of general n insensitivity for northern rocky mountains and variable nutrient limitation in canadian rocky mountain ranges are in agreement with other studies our findings provide a detailed evaluation of lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition that complements the critical load framework already in place and commonly implemented in north america and europe unece icp 2004 porter et al 2005 ouimet et al 2006 jeffries et al 2010 while critical loads depend on a threshold rate of n deposition to determine ecological vulnerability of watersheds our approach provides strong justification for evaluating additional factors that can influence lake ecosystem sensitivity especially at subregional scales where n deposition gradients may become less variable in addition to identifying sensitive ecosystems for management and conservation purposes the approach in this study may also be used to identify sentinel lakes that will likely manifest ecological change early in response to changes in atmospheric deposition williamson et al 2009 trends that were identified at different scales have important policy and management implications and can be used in a coupled approach to improve ecosystem management for instance gams determined that at hemispheric and regional scales n deposition is an important predictor variable of lake din and phytoplankton biomass in other words our large scale analyses identified large scale processes that influence broad geographic areas thus environmental policy implemented at international and national scales would benefit from focus on reductions of n deposition by regulating agricultural industrial and fossil fuel emissions deciphering regional and subregional spatial variability owing to factors such as vegetation cover elevation bedrock geology lake depth and nutrient status will be important in identifying target lakes to prioritize for monitoring and protection from atmospheric deposition of din these analyses employed many existing datasets that were collected by various investigators for various purposes though most had the aim of identifying n deposition effects on high elevation lakes a coordinated standardized effort across multiple regions in the future would improve our ability to identify subregional factors in each of the investigated regions quantification of uncertainty associated with modeled n deposition rate estimates is beyond the scope of this research but has been conducted and discussed in other studies williams et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 walker et al 2019a 2019b sources of uncertainty include estimates of dry and organic n deposition and gradients of emissions in urban and agricultural areas topographical variability across alpine areas likely contributed to a higher degree of uncertainty associated with the modeled n deposition rates in this study national atmospheric deposition program nrsp 3 2020 n deposition data were collected from different sources with different scales of resolution n deposition can be variable even at small scales for instance clow et al 2015 measured sharp east west gradients of n deposition across rocky mountain national park determined by the n emission source location to the east and the natural boundary formed by the continental divide that divides the east and west halves of the park rocky mountain national park summer 2007 din deposition ranged from nearly 2 5 kg ha 1 on the east side of the divide to 0 5 kg ha 1 on the west side as our smallest scale approach still covered relatively large geographical areas i e entire mountain ranges with multiple lake systems small scale variability associated with individual watersheds unlikely affected the quality of n deposition interpretations some subregional locations had too few datapoints to conduct certain analyses at these scales especially regression tree and random forest analyses for instance there were only 8 lakes within the bohemian forest despite being limited at the subregional scale these instances would have been included in larger scale analyses the extension of atmospheric n deposition data to timeframes outside of the dataset range for instance extending the canadian n deposition dataset forward in time and the european dataset backward should also not adversely affect the accuracy of our models as n deposition rates did not substantially change over short term time frames in these areas 5 conclusion we demonstrate that predictive factors of mountain lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition are variable and distinct among locations and scales we provide evidence that large scale processes such as n deposition are important at hemispheric and regional scales and that at subregional scales lake and watershed characteristics determine lake sensitivity and vary across locations very often ecological sensitivity is contingent upon multiple environmental factors thus our empirically based approach that is capable of evaluating multiple environmental factors at multiple scales is proposed as an effective complementary method to the use of critical load analysis which relies on a threshold value of atmospheric deposition to identify vulnerable ecosystems this research may increase predictive capabilities of wilderness and freshwater resource management agencies and simultaneously provide a flexible method to evaluate predictors of ecological sensitivity that can meet diverse

16400,increased nitrogen n deposition rates over the past century have affected both north american and european mountain lake ecosystems ecological sensitivity of mountain lakes to n deposition varies however because chemical and biological responses are modulated by local watershed and lake properties we evaluated predictors of mountain lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition across north american and european mountain ranges and included as response variables dissolved inorganic n din nnh4 nno3 concentrations and phytoplankton biomass predictors of these responses were evaluated at three different spatial scales hemispheric regional subregional using regression tree random forest and generalized additive model gam analysis analyses agreed that northern hemisphere mountain lake din was related to n deposition rates and smaller scale spatial variability e g regional variability between north american and european lakes and subregional variability between mountain ranges analyses suggested that din n deposition and subregional variability were important for northern hemisphere mountain lake phytoplankton biomass together these findings highlight the need for finer scale subregional analyses by mountain range of lake sensitivity to n deposition subregional analyses revealed differences in predictor variables of lake sensitivity in addition to n deposition rates lake and watershed features such as land cover bedrock geology maximum lake depth zmax and elevation were common modulators of lake din subregional phytoplankton biomass was consistently positively related with total phosphorus tp in europe while north american locations showed variable relationships with n or p this study reveals scale dependent watershed and lake characteristics modulate

ecological effects on lakes include acidification nanus et al 2009 increased primary productivity goldman 1988 jassby et al 1994 nydick et al 2004 increased phytoplankton biomass sickman et al 2003 nydick et al 2004 decreased lake clarity goldman 1988 jassby et al 1994 and phytoplankton community changes caused by increased relative abundances of diatom taxa indicative of moderate nutrient enrichment wolfe et al 2001 2003 saros et al 2005 hundey et al 2014 williams et al 2016 a critical load is a threshold value above which deleterious ecological effects of n deposition can be detected burns et al 2008 in mountain lakes phytoplankton growth and diversity are sensitive to nutrient enrichment and respond to even small increases in din concentrations 3 43 µg l 1 arnett et al 2012 nanus et al 2012 hence critical loads of n deposition that characterize phytoplankton responses are commonly low for high elevation lake systems 1 0 1 5 kg n ha 1 year 1 saros et al 2011 baron et al 2011 a complicating factor when applying critical loads as a management tool unece icp 2004 porter et al 2005 ouimet et al 2006 jeffries et al 2010 is that aquatic ecosystem responses to n deposition rates are likely to vary depending on watershed features processes lake nutrient status and biological nutrient limitation thus n deposition rate alone is not always a good predictor of lake ecological sensitivity and response to enrichment environmental variables and lake watershed features are important in determining lake din and phytoplankton biomass responses to atmospheric n deposition for instance in bioassay experiments mountain lake phytoplankton sensitivity to nutrient additions was modulated by lake watershed vegetation which influence lake nitrate and phosphate concentrations nydick et al 2003 clow et al 2010 evaluated watershed factors that characterize sensitivity of lakes to atmospheric n deposition in the sierra nevada of california us lakes with low acid neutralizing capacity anc were more vulnerable to n enrichment from atmospheric deposition nanus et al 2009 determined that lake anc and sensitivity to acidic deposition was predicted by watershed topography bedrock and vegetation type inclusion of lake watershed features at the subregional scale i e within mountain ranges or across geographically close mountain ranges may be important in explaining lake ecological responses to n deposition nanus et al 2012 modeled critical load exceedance of lakes across the rocky mountains of the us including n deposition and important watershed features as predictor variables this model predicted that lakes in areas such as the grand teton mountains wy and glacier national park mt may be impacted by excess n deposition but paleolimnological evidence from these areas indicates minimal changes in planktonic diatom communities inconsistent sensitivity of planktonic taxa to n deposition through time among grand teton mountain lakes may be due to shallow basins and ultraviolet radiation inhibition vinebrooke and leavitt 1999 spaulding et al 2015 in glacier national park lack of directional change in diatom communities to n deposition was attributed to lake p limitation saros et al 2011 since subregional predictors of lake sensitivity likely differ among mountain ranges they are important for water and wildlife managers to identify and include in their evaluation in target areas of concern determining factors that affect lake ecological sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition is a critical management priority with the potential to inform policy and management planning there are locations that seem to deviate from predicted trends of lake ecological impact and factors that have not been assessed in previous lake sensitivity models such as lake depth clarity and nutrient limitation which may control lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition to improve understanding of spatial variability of lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition we evaluated lake and watershed factors across multiple spatial scales ranging from the northern hemisphere to subregional mountain ranges we used a combination of statistical approaches to assess the relationships between deposition rates watershed properties lake characteristics and lake ecological sensitivity finally we compared broad and local scale analyses to highlight the complexity and variation of lake sensitivity to n deposition 2 material and methods to evaluate lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition we analyzed 339 alpine and subalpine lakes located in western north america and europe fig 1 tables 1 s1 lake sensitivity is qualitatively defined here as the susceptibility of a lake to exhibit an ecological response to atmospheric n deposition we used measurements of din a metric of n enrichment and chlorophyll a chl a concentration a proxy for phytoplankton biomass as ecological response variables to evaluate lake sensitivity lake sensitivity to n deposition was interpreted from the response of din or phytoplankton biomass to predictor variables in our statistical models predictor variables of lake sensitivity included a suite of physical chemical and biological variables table 1 these included elevation landcover type unvegetated watershed to lake area and nutrient din and total phosphorus tp concentrations all of which have been demonstrated to affect lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition in previous smaller scale studies nydick et al 2003 clow et al 2010 additionally we included maximum lake depth zmax nutrient limitation status din tp bergström 2010 and bedrock geology as we hypothesized these factors would be important at subregional scales saros et al 2011 spaulding et al 2015 dates of lake observations ranged from 1985 to 2017 and were limited to summer and autumn sampling to avoid spring snowmelt inputs and under ice conditions not all data variables were available for all sites table 1 many lakes had repeated observations from multiple years and seasons 1029 observations total 128 lakes with multiple observations every sampling instance for each lake was assigned an n deposition rate according to the year sampled and location of the lake measurements for each individual lake were then averaged if they were collected at different depths and at multiple times since the availability of land cover data was variable across sites vegetation cover categories i e forests meadow and shrub cover and bare watershed categories i e talus scree and bedrock were combined into a unvegetated watershed variable as n p and p modulating metals al and fe can vary with geological formation norton et al 2011 holloway and dahlgren 2002 we assessed bedrock geological formation type this allowed us to broadly categorize bedrock geology and capture limnologically relevant geochemical variation across space while maintaining simplicity within the models bedrock geology formation

norway european dry deposition was not included as wet deposition contains the majority of n compared to dry deposition in most alpine areas clow et al 2015 and the spatial distribution of dry

the spatial variability of lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition data were evaluated at three different spatial scales hemispheric which included the whole dataset regional which split the data between north america and europe and subregional which split the data according to areas of collection fig 1 lake sensitivity was assessed at each scale using three statistical techniques including regression tree analysis de ath and fabricius 2000 random forest analysis breiman 2001 and generalized additive models gams wood 2017 regression tree and random forest analysis were used in an exploratory analysis to provide descriptive results gams were applied for their predictive utility using watershed and lake features and excluded subregional and regional spatial variability these analyses were used in tandem due to the different strengths each offered regression tree analysis describes relationships between a dependent variable and its predictor variables but can be sensitive to small changes in the dataset random forest analysis is more robust than regression tree analysis but is not as descriptive in its summarization of relationships among variables based on these analyses response variables can be selected and evaluated by gams to determine the strength of a response to its predictor variables together these models provide great explanatory power and predictive utility which is especially true when agreement was demonstrated across model types subregional data availability sometimes made some or all of these analyses impossible particularly in the sierra nevada mountains see table 1 to assess the relationships between response variables and their multiple predictor variables regression tree analyses were done using the r packages rpart therneau 2019 and rpart plot milborrow 2019 to determine the relative importance of predictor variables in explaining response variable variation random forest analysis was performed using the r packages randomforest liaw and wiener 2018 and caret kuhn et al 2020 variables with insufficient data coverage were dropped from the analysis at subregional scales each random forest analysis was constructed using 1000 random trees with 3 random variables sampled at each split percent increase in mean square error incmse was calculated for each variable and reported as weighted variable importance incmse indicates the increase of mse in the predictive model that occurs when a given factor is permuted thus larger incmse values indicate greater statistical importance for a variable to assess the ability of predictor variables to explain variation of lake sensitivity gam analyses were used to construct models of northern hemisphere lake responses i e phytoplankton biomass or din concentration to predictor variables identified in the regression tree and random forest analyses gams of lake sensitivity were constructed from the predictors that regression tree and random forest analysis identified as important excluding subregional and regional spatial variation these models were then evaluated for best performance determined by the sample size n variance explained r2 minimized generalized cross validation gcv scores and minimized akaike information criterion aic scores gam analyses were conducted using the mgcv r package wood 2019 generalized linear models were used in conjunction with the gams to confirm whether overall correlation between variable pairs was positive or negative 3 results 3 1 northern hemisphere scale regression tree analysis of the full suite of

north american lakes this group of lakes was also modified by elevation and n deposition rates random forest analysis showed that n deposition rates elevation and unvegetated watershed coverage were important predictor variables of european lake din followed by subregional variation and lake depth n 34 fig 3b however the best performing gam included unvegetated watershed p 0 02 as the sole din predictor variable r2 0 11 n 34 table 2 random forest analysis indicated subregional spatial variation and unvegetated watershed were the most important predictor variables of lake din in north

unequivocally shows that n deposition increases din concentrations in remote lakes bergström and jansson 2006 elser et al 2009 our results suggest that determinants of lake ecological sensitivity depended on the spatial scale considered this highlights the importance of watershed context and the necessity of local scale analyses for understanding and predicting lake ecological sensitivity specifically predictors of din or chl a sensitivity at the northern hemisphere scale were not necessarily identified at the regional or subregional scales by investigating n sensitivity at multiple spatial scales we demonstrate that lake and watershed features can influence ecological responses of lakes to n deposition these results have at least two important implications 1 predictive methods of ecosystem sensitivity that rely on a single or small number of predictor variables may yield limited predictions of ecosystem sensitivity especially when deployed at different scales or locations and 2 as different predictor variables are effective at different scales scale appropriate variable selection should be of primary concern to management agencies attempting to predict lake ecological sensitivity across the entire northern hemisphere north america and europe subregional spatial variability consistently ranked as an important predictor of din and phytoplankton biomass at large spatial scales i e northern hemisphere and regional this highlights the importance of site specific variables that operate at small scales and the necessity of subregional variables and analyses for understanding and predicting lake ecological sensitivity for instance gam models were able to explain 41 87 of din variation across subregional european lake clusters according to gams n deposition rate was only important in the alps wa la in the tatras and elevation and lake depth in the bohemian forest these differences in predictor variables likely reflect differences in subregional watershed features that modulate atmospheric n deposition delivery to surface waters such as vegetation cover vegetation type and soil development thus when a gam was constructed to predict regional scale european lake din some locally important variables were excluded from the model and its predictive power was low explaining 11 of variation of din across european lakes din was negatively related to the percentage of unvegetated watershed cover in the european lake gam inclusion of bohemian forest lakes with high din and forested catchments was likely responsible for this relationship this could indicate din saturation of the environment resulting in din leaching fenn et al 1998 and increased rates of nutrient cycling in the relatively lower elevation bohemian forest landscape clow and sueker 2000 in the tatras and alps however din was positively related with unvegetated watershed area due to facilitation of atmospheric n delivery to surface waters through watersheds consistent with observations from north america clow et al 2010 facilitation of atmospheric n transport through unvegetated watersheds is likely due to short water residence time in undeveloped soils sickman et al 2002 clow et al 2003 coupled with limited biological uptake and assimilation that would be associated with microbially rich organic soils and vegetation clow and sueker 2000 clow et al 2010 thus the direction of effect of a watershed feature on lake sensitivity could change according to spatial scale the direction of an effect could also depend on location zmax was an important predictor of lake din that exhibited positive and negative effects between european and north american regions and subregions respectively zmax can be related to water residence time as well as watershed slope topography hollister et al 2011 but this is not always the case additionally other watershed features such as elevation soil type geology and land cover could modulate the relationship between zmax and lake din though opposite effects of a variable between different scales or locations raise fundamental questions about the validity of applying models across lake regions the object of this study was to identify differences between scales and geographic areas using scale and location specific models these findings therefore provide valuable insight and justification for an empirically based approach to complement other types of remote lake management like critical load analysis drivers of din concentrations varied substantially among mountain ranges in north america for instance the southern and canadian rocky mountains had higher average din concentration than other mountain ranges this subregional variation likely limits the usefulness of predictive gams to assess regional din variation but surprisingly the north american gam was able to explain more variation of lake din 28 than the european gam 11 predictive gams of individual north american mountain ranges exhibited variable performance explaining 8 61 of din variation indicative of variability between mountain ranges and unmeasured variables that are known to account for more variation such as glacier influence watershed slope steepness soil composition vegetation type and hydrology nydick et al 2003 nanus et al 2005 clow et al 2010 saros et al 2010 in addition to the scale dependency of lake ecological sensitivity this study highlights and contrasts two metrics din and phytoplankton biomass that are commonly used to monitor lake n enrichment din allows the detection of lake n enrichment and is therefore useful in determining how watershed features interact to modulate n deposition given multiple extrinsic factors that may determine the magnitude of n deposition how deposited n moves through a watershed and the role of within lake processes that alter din concentrations it is not surprising that our ability to predict din in mountain lakes was variably successful phytoplankton biomass is a key biological metric that informs us of how a lake responds to n enrichment based on intrinsic factors such as nutrient limitation at regional and subregional scales phytoplankton biomass was more easily explained than din and had more consistent nutrient related predictors din and tp were commonly included in phytoplankton biomass predictive gams along with factors affecting nutrient loading to lakes such as n deposition rates and unvegetated catchment together our findings suggest that both metrics din and phytoplankton biomass are informative of different processes and aspects of lake sensitivity that is lake sensitivity to n enrichment vs biological lake sensitivity respectively thus management agencies may wish to evaluate one or both metrics based on specific management goals directional change in phytoplankton communities in response to n enrichment from atmospheric deposition is a biological metric that could be of interest to lake managers but we were not able of evaluating this metric with our dataset in alpine lakes this type of community response is commonly characterized by an increase in relative abundance of opportunistic diatom species such as fragilaria crotonensis asterionella formosa and discostella stelligera baron et al 1986 wolfe et al 2001 2003 sickman et al 2003 saros et al 2005 köster and pienitz 2006 saros et al 2012 spaulding et al 2015 our findings suggest north american lakes are currently more ecologically sensitive to atmospheric n deposition than the european lakes included in our analyses lake phytoplankton biomass was tightly coupled with lake nutrient status at all scales but there were regional differences between north america and europe in nutrient importance that reflect historical atmospheric deposition trends current lake sensitivity to n deposition and future ecological trajectories in contrast to north america regional and subregional european lake phytoplankton biomass which was limited to three localities was related to tp across analyses suggesting p limitation and reduced sensitivity to n enrichment caution is recommended when interpreting positive relationships between tp and phytoplankton biomass however as these factors covary since phytoplankton biomass contributes to the tp pool stow and cha 2013 still the relationship of p to phytoplankton biomass likely reflects that several european lakes are now p limited after prolonged n enrichment kopáček et al 2005b bergström 2006 elser et al 2009 though this pattern can vary based on changing p deposition patterns camarero and catalan 2012 even though subregional lake phytoplankton biomass predictor variables in north america were more complex compared to europe random forest analysis determined that subregional spatial variability was less important in predicting north american and european lake phytoplankton biomass compared to nutrients din in north america and tp in europe this finding suggests regional consistency of phytoplankton biomass predictor variables across mountain ranges for instance north american phytoplankton biomass was related to n associated factors i e n deposition din din tp and lake elevation in the three analyses the relationship of n related factors to the north american lake phytoplankton biomass suggests that in this region high elevation lakes are generally n limited and expected to continue to respond to elevated n deposition or factors that can enhance n availability such as cryosphere thaw or reductions in snowpack oleksy et al 2020 southern rocky mountain lakes central rocky mountain lakes and pacific northwest mountain lakes appeared to be primarily n limited according to a combination of regression tree random forest and gam analyses n limitation in the southern rocky mountains which were mostly grouped within colorado is consistent with other work morris and lewis 1988 ballantyne et al 2011 though there is likely some spatial variation within this group that our analyses are not assessing for instance the colorado front range has been a site of historically high and increasing n deposition rates lewis and grant 1980 lewis et al 1984 baron et al 2000 burns 2003 and may be less sensitive to further n deposition williams et al 1996 gardner et al 2008 central rocky mountain phytoplankton biomass sensitivity to n is consistent with research in the uinta mountain range demonstrating n or n and p co limitation hundey et al 2014 our results suggest that northern rocky mountain lakes were p limited reducing their sensitivity to n deposition this is consistent with interpretations of lake sediment diatom records from the northern rocky mountains showing little to no response of algae communities to relatively high rates of n deposition in glacier national park mt saros et al 2011 phytoplankton predictor variables for canadian rocky mountains included din and tp suggesting n and p co limitation or variable nutrient limitation across lakes of this subregion research has demonstrated p limitation and insensitivity to n enrichment in many canadian rocky mountain lakes though 14 of remote lakes and ponds n 29 were n limited and several exhibited co limitation murphy et al 2010 see also brahney et al 2014 2015 cook et al 2020 thus our findings of general n insensitivity for northern rocky mountains and variable nutrient limitation in canadian rocky mountain ranges are in agreement with other studies our findings provide a detailed evaluation of lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition that complements the critical load framework already in place and commonly implemented in north america and europe unece icp 2004 porter et al 2005 ouimet et al 2006 jeffries et al 2010 while critical loads depend on a threshold rate of n deposition to determine ecological vulnerability of watersheds our approach provides strong justification for evaluating additional factors that can influence lake ecosystem sensitivity especially at subregional scales where n deposition gradients may become less variable in addition to identifying sensitive ecosystems for management and conservation purposes the approach in this study may also be used to identify sentinel lakes that will likely manifest ecological change early in response to changes in atmospheric deposition williamson et al 2009 trends that were identified at different scales have important policy and management implications and can be used in a coupled approach to improve ecosystem management for instance gams determined that at hemispheric and regional scales n deposition is an important predictor variable of lake din and phytoplankton biomass in other words our large scale analyses identified large scale processes that influence broad geographic areas thus environmental policy implemented at international and national scales would benefit from focus on reductions of n deposition by regulating agricultural industrial and fossil fuel emissions deciphering regional and subregional spatial variability owing to factors such as vegetation cover elevation bedrock geology lake depth and nutrient status will be important in identifying target lakes to prioritize for monitoring and protection from atmospheric deposition of din these analyses employed many existing datasets that were collected by various investigators for various purposes though most had the aim of identifying n deposition effects on high elevation lakes a coordinated standardized effort across multiple regions in the future would improve our ability to identify subregional factors in each of the investigated regions quantification of uncertainty associated with modeled n deposition rate estimates is beyond the scope of this research but has been conducted and discussed in other studies williams et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 walker et al 2019a 2019b sources of uncertainty include estimates of dry and organic n deposition and gradients of emissions in urban and agricultural areas topographical variability across alpine areas likely contributed to a higher degree of uncertainty associated with the modeled n deposition rates in this study national atmospheric deposition program nrsp 3 2020 n deposition data were collected from different sources with different scales of resolution n deposition can be variable even at small scales for instance clow et al 2015 measured sharp east west gradients of n deposition across rocky mountain national park determined by the n emission source location to the east and the natural boundary formed by the continental divide that divides the east and west halves of the park rocky mountain national park summer 2007 din deposition ranged from nearly 2 5 kg ha 1 on the east side of the divide to 0 5 kg ha 1 on the west side as our smallest scale approach still covered relatively large geographical areas i e entire mountain ranges with multiple lake systems small scale variability associated with individual watersheds unlikely affected the quality of n deposition interpretations some subregional locations had too few datapoints to conduct certain analyses at these scales especially regression tree and random forest analyses for instance there were only 8 lakes within the bohemian forest despite being limited at the subregional scale these instances would have been included in larger scale analyses the extension of atmospheric n deposition data to timeframes outside of the dataset range for instance extending the canadian n deposition dataset forward in time and the european dataset backward should also not adversely affect the accuracy of our models as n deposition rates did not substantially change over short term time frames in these areas 5 conclusion we demonstrate that predictive factors of mountain lake sensitivity to atmospheric n deposition are variable and distinct among locations and scales we provide evidence that large scale processes such as n deposition are important at hemispheric and regional scales and that at subregional scales lake and watershed characteristics determine lake sensitivity and vary across locations very often ecological sensitivity is contingent upon multiple environmental factors thus our empirically based approach that is capable of evaluating multiple environmental factors at multiple scales is proposed as an effective complementary method to the use of critical load analysis which relies on a threshold value of atmospheric deposition to identify vulnerable ecosystems this research may increase predictive capabilities of wilderness and freshwater resource management agencies and simultaneously provide a flexible method to evaluate predictors of ecological sensitivity that can meet diverse

16401,the acceleration of nitrate removal in wastewater treatment by redox mediator rm is greatly weakened due to wash out loss and mass transfer resistance low hydrophilia of rm during operation in this study an rm reactor with the fixed 1 amino 4 hydroxyanthraquinone ahaq and three core strains was established and achieved high nitrate removal efficiency nre under low carbon to nitrogen ratio c n and short hydraulic retention time hrt conditions with the maximum efficiency of 99 41 14 00 mg l 1 h 1 and average improvement by 11 97 1 41 mg l 1 h 1 this acceleration led to more proportion of carbon consumption by denitrifying bacteria and improved their competitiveness against others in carbon deficiency although resulting in nitrite accumulation nia in lower c n the rm reactor induced the decorrelation tendencies between nre and active extracellular organics and more sensitive denitrification toward c n which favored the stability of effluent organics and biological activities the increase of oxidative phosphorylation and ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis pathway suggested electron transport activity was potentially enhanced by ahaq although the lower c n deteriorated the reactor nre the abundances of amino acids fatty acids and carbohydrate related metabolisms 45 of the total up regulating pathways were enhanced to utilize carbon source effectively meanwhile the enhanced phosphotransferase system facilitated the balance between carbon and nitrogen metabolism these indicated the changes in biological strategy to grow better and resist the adverse

treatment for recycling and reuse has attracted extensive attention owing to its great alleviation toward the water shortage liao et al 2021 however the treatment is overwhelmingly limited by the low carbon to nitrogen ratio c n in most municipal wastewater leading to nearly 25 mg l 1 nitrate no3 n residue in effluent from the final sedimentation tank gao et al 2020 this adversely affected the efficient water purification in the advanced sewage treatments and reclaimed water utilization biological denitrification is the main process of nitrate removal in wastewater treatment plants wwpts zhang et al 2021b consequently the enhancement of nitrate removal efficiency nre has been a question of great interest in wastewater treatment emerging technologies such as solid phase denitrification hu et al 2019 endogenous denitrification wang et al 2019 and the supplement of sludge internal carbon source guo et al 2018 have been applied and achieved a promising performance in nitrate removal particularly short cut nitrification and denitrification and anammox provide another energy efficient way for nitrogen removal however as reported direct application of them in the mainstream wwpts is not feasible due to numerous practical issues that ultimately leads to the disruption of biological community structure li et al 2020 for anammox technology coupling partial nitrification or denitrification with anammox is a promising solution in the mainstream wwpts gao et al 2022 li et al 2020 though it needs many endeavors in real treatment process recently immobilizing optimal microbes has attracted researchers due to its reinforced function with specialization in low c n and low nitrate concentration environment zhang et al 2021a however the cell washout bacterial contamination from the influent and following interspecific competition may lead to the crash of biological reactors sakarya et al 2021 the latter studies indicated that the interspecies collaboration could enhance the viability and competitive capacity of target microbes in wastewater treatment tang et al 2018 which implies that the combination of multiple microbes seems to be a better solution furthermore limited by the electron transfer and intense competition for energy in various biological reactions the nitrate removal rate is prospectively improved by redox mediator rm yang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 rm performed well in the bioremediation of dyes and thus attracted the researcher s attention for nitrate removal castañon et al 2019 to accelerate biological process rm is capable of shuttling electrons between the microbes and the target substances with reversibility of oxidation and reduction states dos santos et al 2004 compared to endogenous rm exogenous rm is more applicable and reliable in nitrate removal mainly belonging to quinone compounds zhang et al 2021c however most of rm related studies for nitrate removal were conducted in pure culture environment castañon et al 2019 while the applications of rm in reactors are rare according to the performance of rm in dye bioremediation reactor gradual loss of rm and the disruption of immobilized carriers are inevitable during operation yang et al 2018 traditional immobilized carriers such as calcium alginate activated carbon hydrogel agar etc seem to be unsuitable novel and effective immobilized methods are urgently needed to solve this issue additionally the hydrophobicity of rm and synthetic carrier could aggravate the mass transfer resistance alvarez et al 2010 and is thereby viewed as an important indicator for the performance of rm reactor the effects of rm on microbes are extensively studied the detailed changes such as nitrate reductase activity electron transport system activity extracellular polymeric substances epss and cell membrane permeability are likely to happen in response to rm he et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c however few studies have explored the adaptation of biological communities and corresponding potential functions to the rm reactor the rm likely improves the nitrate removal via multiple ways not only as ever thought to accelerate removal rate therefore combined with the inefficient nitrate removal under low c n and nitrate concentration conditions it is worthy to investigate the feasibility of an immobilized rm reactor with multiple superior microbes additionally soluble microbial products smps are produced during the cell growth and could benefit the stability of biological community and reactor performance against environmental pressure zhou et al 2021 therefore the relationship between effluent smps and nitrate removal potentially reflects the reactor performance which provides an effective method for the comparison of different reactors in the present study the 1 amino 4 hydroxyanthraquinone ahaq known as disperse red 15 miryala et al 2020 was firstly employed onto polyurethane modified hydrophilic gel carrier pumhgc high hydrophilia without silicone oil process during production via conh formed in a dehydration condensation reaction ahaq is an important intermediate product industrially produced and widely applied in dyes synthesis and analytical determination fain et al 2010 three microbes comamonas sp ysf15 pseudomonas stutzeri sp gf2 and pseudomonas stutzeri sp gf3 were used to form strong biofilm on the surface of pumhgc ahaq carrier which all performed high nitrate removal performance in a pure culture environment therefore the enhanced rm reactor was established to explore its sustainability and operational feasibility for nitrate removal in low c n and low nitrate environment from the perspective of reactor performance effluent organics and biological community the changes in potential functions of the community were further clarified to determine the promotional mechanism of rm reactor and strategies of the community in response to low c n ratio 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism and culture as the previous studies reported comamonas sp ysf15 su et al 2020 pseudomonas stutzeri sp gf2 chen et al 2021 and pseudomonas stutzeri sp gf3 zheng et al 2021 exhibited effective denitrification capacity under low c n conditions therefore used in this study the basic medium bm for their cultivation was sterilized at 121 0 c for 30 0 min and consisted of following elements per liter ch3coona 0

polyurethane modified hydrophilic gel carrier pumhgc zhejiang biocarriers environmental technologies co ltd china specific surface area 4000 m2 m3 density 1 02 g cm3 and porosity 98 were cleaned with ultrapure water three times and then sterilized at 121 0 c for 30 0 min following this treatment the carrier was added to the above solution stirred every 8 0 h for 7 times at 30 c which was beneficial to the self assembly of ahaq to pumhgc and reduce the interference of the side reaction finally the synthetic pumhgc ahaq was washed several times and soaked in ultrapure water for 24 0 h the prepared pumhgc ahaq and the control group pumhgc were added to the bm with three target bacteria after 2 day anaerobic cultivation at 30 c and ph 6 8 7 2 the nutrients were used up and new bm was added into the system this operation was repeated five times for better bacterial immobilization 2 3 rm reactor setup and operation after immobilization the pumhgc and pumhgc ahaq were transferred to the parallel reactors with 20 filling ratio marked as control and rm reactor respectively the cylindrical laboratory scale bioreactor was standardized with 60 mm inner diameter 500 mm height and 1 0 l operating volume the synthetic wastewater was pumped into each reactor with an exchange ratio of 80 via a micro submersible pump which consisted of ch3coona the content changed according to operating

parameters c n hydraulic retention time hrt and influent nitrate concentration were investigated at 30 c in this study and the detailed information of operational periods are shown in table 1 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of no3 n nitrite no2 n and ammonium nh4 n nitrogen were measured according to the standard methods zhang et al 2021c via uv spectrophotometer uv 2802 unico china according to the previous study su et al 2020 the soluble microbial products smps were extracted and the two main components polysaccharide ps and protein pn were quantified the gas composition in the rm reactor during phase 2 3 was detected using gas chromatograph 6890 agilent japan according to zhang et al 2020 the reactive functional groups on the surface of pumhgc and pumhgc ahaq were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir is50 nicolet usa with a resolution of 4 cm 1 meanwhile the morphologies of the two carriers before and after bacteria immobilization were characterized with scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6510lv jeol japan briefly 7 effluent samples were collected from each subphase and filtered via 0 22 μm syringe membrane for characterization of three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan the range of the excitation emission wavelengths ex em was 200 400 250 500 nm furthermore the efc software version 1 2 china was used to remove the rayleigh and raman scatterings construct the parallel factor analysis parafac model and define the parafac components according to previous studies to ensure the high similarity over 0 95 he and hur 2015 murphy et al 2010 additionally the method of fluorescence regional integration fri was introduced to further explore the difference between the two reactors zhang et al 2021b the region division is shown in table s1 the calculated fri results were tested and the bad values were deleted using boxplot 2 5 biological analysis the carbon source deficiency is an important factor that limits the biological activity and growth to improve nre and explore the microbial community response to low c n samples were collected at the end of subphase 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 in the rm reactor and 2 3 in the control marked as rm25 rm20 rm15 and c20 respectively the subsequent analyses were completed by shanghai

biological information was analyzed through the online platform of personalbio genescloud https www genescloud cn home based on the illumina sequencing platform the abundance of metabolic pathways and predicted metagenomics was further analyzed via picrust2 software using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg 2 6 statistical analysis the results were presented in the form of mean value standard error correlations between the effluent indicators and removal performance were calculated as well as their correlation with c n using correlation plot application in origin pro 2021 software version 9 8 0 200 origin lab inc usa the analysis of significant differences was adopted for the comparison of results using ibm spss statistics software version 25 ibm inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and characterization of the carrier based on the sem micrographs the surface of pumhgc ahaq fig s1e was more slippery than pumhgc fig s1a indicating that ahaq successfully combined to the carrier surface the relatively rough surface of pumhgc benefited immobilization by numerous microbes fig s1d however there was an integral aggregated biofilm attaching to the pumhgc ahaq fig s1g quite different from pumhgc it was speculated that bacteria were stimulated to secrete more epss by ahaq which promoted microbial aggregation and enhanced biofilm stability he et al 2018 after 225 days operation pumhgc ahaq faded slightly and had the potential for long term application of wastewater treatment according to ftir spectra the two carriers possessed similar functional groups fig s2 bands at higher wavenumber 2800 cm 1 referred to the existence of functional groups like o h n h and c h peaks at 1729 1640 1598 1220 and 1088 cm 1 were coherent with active functional groups like c o n h c c c n and c o respectively liu et al 2022 which indicated the high hydrophilia and biocompatibility of the two carriers moreover the immobilized ahaq via nhco weakened the intramolecular hydrogen bond and thus improved its hydrophilic activity on the other hand after reaction with ahaq the weakened peaks at 2698 and 1374 cm 1 new peak at 1001 cm 1 and changes in fingerprint region all suggested the minor differences between the two carriers 3 2 nitrate removal performance the operational parameters of influent no3 n concentration hrt and c n were selected to explore the enhancing performance of rm reactor compared to the control group the no3 n removal and nitrite accumulation nia were shown in fig 1 the concentration of influent nitrate and effluent ammonium during operation were shown in fig s3 to avoid the dramatic change at the initial days of each subphase the average nre and nia were based on the data of the last 7 days the results of the independent sample t test indicated that there was a significant difference p 0 05 in nitrate removal performance between the control and rm reactor except for the nia in subphase 1 1 3 2 1 effect of hrt on the nitrate removal performance as shown in fig 1 the increasing hrt from subphase 1 1 to 1 3 significantly improved the average nre with 51 00 85 77 and 98 49 10 32 8 58 and 6 54 mg l 1 h 1 respectively in rm reactor and 45 44 78 22 and 94 31 9 19 7 83 and 6 26 mg l 1 h 1 respectively in the control reactor it indicated that rm reactor could significantly p 0 05 enhance the no3 n removal potential versus the control when the c n got lower this enhancement in rm reactor with same hrt was more obvious surpassing the control by 18 47 18 22 9 01 20 82 22 69 and 17 18 3 74 1 82 0 60 4 20 2 25 and 1 15 mg l 1 h 1 in subphase 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 respectively especially the highest no3 n removal rate 14 00 mg l 1 h 1 occurred in subphase 2 1 rm reactor higher than 2 9 mg l 1 h 1 in fungal pellets immobilized bacterial reactor c n 2 0 as reported by zheng et al 2021 for the synthesis of organic substances and growth of microbes the nh4 n was produced via the pathway of reducing no3 n to nh4 n according to the fig s3 the concentration of nh4 n was lower than 1 00 mg l 1 in subphase 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 indicating it hardly affected the reactor performance additionally the no2 n reduction fell behind no3 n possibly due to its toxic inhibition on biological activities and lower energy availability zhang et al 2020 when the hrt increased from 2 0 to 3 0 h subphase 1 2 to 1 3 the no2 n accumulation correspondingly decreased from 4 04 to 0 83 mg l 1 respectively a similar trend was also observed in subphase 2 2 2 3 and subphase 3 2 3 3 compared to the control reactor there was little acceleration by ahaq in the nitrite reduction irrespective of the changes in hrt which indicated that the facilitation of ahaq mainly took part in no3 n no2 n process in low c n environment 3 2 2 effect of influent nitrate on the nitrate removal performance rm reactor also improved the nre under each influent no3 n condition fig 1 although the nre in rm reactor decreased to 97 58 84 74 and 82 58 with the rising influent no3 n the corresponding removal rate in subphase 2 3 2 4 and 2 5 increased to 6 53 7 02 and 8 35 mg l 1 h 1 respectively higher no3 n concentration could improve the affinity between bacteria and no3 n and thus facilitated the biomass growth and no3 n removal rate luo et al 2021 however the no2 n accumulation also increased with this tendency which further confirmed the little facilitation of rm reactor on no2 n removal under such short hrt condition 3 2 3 effect of c n on the nitrate removal performance lower c n significantly p 0 001 limited the no3 n removal performance in the rm reactor fig 1 with the decreasing tendency from 98 49 to 84 91 6 54 and 5 67 mg l 1 h 1 in subphase 1 3 and 3 3 respectively and increasing no2 n accumulation from 0 83 to 3 81 mg l 1 notably the positive effect of ahaq on no3 n removal was promoted by the lower c n with a strong relationship between c n and accelerating nre by ahaq pearson s correlation r 0 827 p 0 01 n 15 lower c n likely stimulated microbes to remove no3 n rapidly with the help of ahaq on the other hand the high hydrophilicity of pumhgc ahaq carrier facilitated the contact with active molecules which could improve the electron transfer efficiency yang et al 2018 more no2 n accumulated in rm reactor and reached the maximum of 5 85 mg l 1 h in subphase 3 2 fortunately little nitrous oxide n2o was detected in the optimized operation fig s4 possibly due to the mild operation conditions for the single pollutant removal in the lab scale level the imbalance effects of rm on nitrate and nitrite reductase likely led to the no2 n accumulation yin et al 2014 however according to variations in nitrogen nutrients no3 n no2 n and nh4 n in batch tests fig s5 lower c n inhibited the no3 n removal and led to no2 n accumulation indicating that carbon source deficiency was the key factor in process inhibition this was also confirmed by the kinetics analysis in fig s6 compared to the control the rm reactor showed a superior activity to nitrate with a faster removal rate and higher efficiency this was helpful for denitrifying microbes because it facilitated their rapid utilization of carbon source and improved their competitiveness against other microbes beside there was little significance showing that nitrite inhibited the process more no2 n accumulation in the rm reactor was mostly ascribed to more no3 n reduction to no2 n by ahaq with limited carbon source in a way the effective and stable nitrate removal under such low c n condition confirmed that the three target microbes performed a high tolerance toward nitrite 3 3 characterization of the effluent smps 3 3 1 characterization of the effluent smps via parafac analysis based on the 3d eem spectra fig s7 during the reactor operation of 20 mg l 1 no3 n three component model for the effluent smps was defined as fig 2 c1 with ex em of 280 358 nm was dominated by intact tryptophan like proteins excellently coincident modified turker s congruence coefficient mtcc 0 982 with fellman et al 2009 c2 with ex em of 230 275 326 nm was generally assigned to the combination of tryptophan like and tyrosine like proteins with a great coherence mtcc 0 981 with yang et al 2013 c3 with ex em of 245 310 394 nm was identified as humic like substances highly coincident mtcc 0 974 with stedmon et al 2011 the fluorescent proteins in effluent occupied the largest percentage both in the rm and control reactors regardless of the changing hrt or c n according to the previous study fluorescent proteins reflected the active biological activities and were helpful to resist low c n environment he et al 2020 3 3 2 fri characterization of the effluent smps to acquire more information from 3d eem spectra the fri method with detailed components was employed fri method was helpful to avoid the influence of peak changes which at the same time performed satisfactory tolerance to the eem spectral subtraction he and hur 2015 as shown in fig 3 the significant difference p 0 05 in some fluorescent components was observed indicating the delicate difference between the two reactors it is reported that smps tended to be more degradable and could serve as carbon source under lower c n conditions zhang et al 2021b however this phenomenon only existed when the denitrification was nearly completed in the rm reactor during c n of 2 5 and hrt of 3 0 h suggesting that smps were not easily degraded the region iv stable soluble microbial byproduct like substances overlapped with the position of most fluorescent proteins which was also reported as an indicator of biological activities and tolerance to the adverse environment he et al 2018 it occupied nearly half of the total fri volume 3000 3500 ru nm2 and showed little correlation with the hrt and c n indicating that each reactor possessed a high biological activity on nitrate removal in lower c n environment for regions of i ii and iii the fri volumes tended to increase with the higher c n in the control reactor while it seemed to decrease in rm reactor after 2 0 h the variation of region v was more distinctly that fri volume significantly decreased from 863 29 c n 1 5 to 808 34 nm 1 c n 2 5 in hrt 2 0 h and from 892 c n 1 5 to 848 21 nm 1 c n 2 5 in hrt 3 0 h versus the control 710 44 849 36 nm 1 and 748 58 909 26 nm 1 respectively prior studies have confirmed the importance of region iii fulvic acid like and region v humic acid like for their abundant redox active molecules that actively participated in denitrification valenzuela et al 2019 zhang et al 2021c affected by ahaq the biological community was stimulated to produce more humic acid like matter within a short time potentially promoting the sensitive response and rapid denitrification in low c n and short hrt environment 3 3 3 smps quantification it is now well established from a variety of studies that smps mainly originated from epss and intracellular metabolism peker and cecen 2014 tang et al 2020 generally after the hydrolysis of bound epss by bacterial hydrolases the soluble epss are produced which are actually another name of smps in fact it s not contradictory according to the clarification of unified theory because smps related research aims to predict biological activity effluent quality or sludge production while research with epss mostly focuses on biofilm or floc laspidou and rittmann 2002 as shown in fig 4 the two main components i e pn and ps were quantified in each c n environment hrt 3 0 h the pn tended to yield more with the higher c n especially in rm reactor with the maximum of 53 77 mg l 1 additionally the ps also performed the opposite trend from 58 53 to 27 9 mg l 1 with increasing c n on the whole the rm reactor could facilitate the high production of ps and pn which helped to improve the stability of the biological system this was also confirmed in fig s1 that huge production of epss in the biofilm potentially released to supply smps laspidou and rittmann 2002 which implied the difference compared to fluorescent smps zhou et al 2021 also reported that the biological accelerant with shuttling electrons function could help the rapid increase in epss after treatment of high cr vi concentration 3 4 correlation analysis of effluent parameters according to the no3 n removal performance and the effluent smps the corresponding correlation analyses are shown in fig 5 after 3 0 h operation the positive relationship among fluorescent components was observed both in the control and rm reactor in detail a strong correlation r 0 86 between region i and ii indicated the high homology in rm reactor while the correlation was only 0 68 in the control suggesting the difference between the two reactors for the control reactor there were moderate or low positive correlations between pn and each fluorescent component indicating the wide distribution of fluorescent pn in each region however there was little relationship between ps pn and fluorescent components in rm reactor the nre in the control reactor positively correlated with region ii r 0 48 region iii r 0 55 and region v r 0 64 demonstrating the potential facilitation of redox active molecules for nre quite different from those in rm reactor it was supposed that complex interaction between ahaq and bacteria led to the decorrelation among parameters which included the limitation of fluorescent components production and replacement of some functions by ahaq such as shuttling electrons for no3 n removal yin et al 2014 as yang et al 2018 reported the immobilized neutral red dye could improve the oxidation reduction capabilities of the biological system in addition the nre negatively correlated r 0 70 and 0 96 in control and rm reactors respectively with ps the ps is viewed as a supplementary carbon source with high degradation zhang et al 2020 the lower c n tended to stimulate higher ps production to promote no3 n removal compared to control the nre nia and pn were more sensitive to c n in rm reactor which on the contrary exerted less effect on the characteristic of fluorescent smps from the perspective of reactor performance these results suggested the rm reactor possessed a more powerful effect on nitrate removal and could maintain the stable property of effluent organics and biological activities regardless of c n variation it is reasonably deduced that ahaq play an indispensable role in the extracellular process and improved the sensitive response to nitrate removal in rm reactor 3 5 bacterial community dynamics 3 5 1 bacterial richness and diversity for microbial richness and diversity the chao1 observed species shannon simpson pielou s evenness and coverage were adopted as shown in table 2 the coverage of each sample exceeded 0 99 and the sequencing results were reliable the experimental samples rm25 rm20 and rm15 possessed a relatively lower richness species diversity and evenness compared to the sample c20 suggesting the dominant functional species were enhanced in response to ahaq the rank abundance curves also reflected more evenness in sample c20 and rm15 fig s8a according to the venn diagram fig s8b the shared otus between c20 and rm20 accounted for 43 11 of total otus in rm20 sample which was higher than other samples in rm reactor in addition rm20 and rm15 samples shared 23 35 and 15 79 otus with rm25 sample respectively indicating the bacterial community was significantly affected by c n 3 5 2 bacterial community compositions based on the phylogenetic classification of microbial sequences the proteobacteria performed high adaptability to the environment and was the dominant phylum over 80 in all samples fig 6 a which has been reported to be the chief denitrifiers in many systems zhou et al 2021 for class level fig 6b the gammaproteobacteri overwhelmingly accounted for 69 08 69 17 64 38 and 73 51 in sample c20 rm25 rm20 and rm15 respectively indicating the target strain gf2 and gf3 could effectively retain in carriers generally the community structure maintained relative stability toward the c n change the relative abundances of the top 20 genera in all samples were compared in the form of heatmap fig 6c although the relative abundances of all listed genera in heatmap changed with the c n ratio pseudomonas including strain gf2 and gf3 acted as the core genus with the principal proportion of 63 37 65 46 60 38 and 55 88 in sample c20 rm25 rm20 and rm15 respectively which over competed other genera and likely helped to resist the adverse c n environment and possessed effective denitrification performance sakarya et al 2021 3 6 potential functions of the biological community 3 6 1 variation of potential functions in rm reactors compared to the control to further explore the changes in rm reactors compared to the control 23 different functions of the microorganisms in the third category are presented in fig 7 most of them were classified as metabolism in the first category which demonstrated that ahaq had a complex influence and mainly affected the intracellular metabolism over half of these functional abundances decreased fig 7 mainly connected with amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism amino acids are important cell components and participate in growth and numerous metabolisms su et al 2021 on the other hand the oxidative phosphorylation pathways associating with atp formation were enhanced from 0 566 to 0 570 in control and rm reactor respectively the ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis pathways also increased which favored higher electron transport activity in rm reactor ma et al 2021 ramakrishnan et al 2010 additionally the increasing abundances of xylene dioxin and bisphenol degradation pathways suggested that the biological community tended to degrade the ahaq and pumhgc further confirming the slight fading of pumhgc ahaq might result from biodegradation the second top function flagellar assembly pathway accounted for 2 499 of the total predicted abundance in rm reactor fig s1 which was conducive to the formation of biofilm serra et al 2013 tang et al 2018 another unanticipated finding was that the nitrogen metabolism showed a negligible difference indicating the communities in the two reactors possessed a high ability for nitrogen removal from the perspective of biological functions the superior performance in the rm reactor was likely ascribed to the regulation of specific pathways to better couple with nitrogen metabolism 3 6 2 effect of c n on potential functions generally biological activities could be restrained due to low c n in rm reactor the abundances of 23 potential functions tended to decrease in lower c n fig s9 the abundance of tricarboxylic acid tca cycle pathway decreased with the lower c n whereas the pentose phosphate pathway increased fig 8 potentially providing more substrates to compensate for this insufficiency corkins et al 2017 consequently the abundance of the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids increased from 0 524 to 0 537 in the lower c n environment as shown in fig 8 the abundances of amino acids fatty acids and carbohydrate related metabolisms in c n of 1 5 occupied 4 151 2 189 and 5 534 ahead of that in c n 2 5 with 3 975 2 142 and 5 276 respectively which suggested the community was stimulated to improve the utilization of carbon source for efficient nitrate removal to resist the adverse c n environment similarly the phosphotransferase system pts was higher in c n 1 5 0 082 than c n 2 5 0 069 which was beneficial to harmonize the balance between carbon and nitrogen when the nitrogen content is relatively high yoo et al 2016 furthermore the abc transporter function was potentially improved in lower c n in detail the branched chain amino acid transport system permease protein k01995 k01996 k01997 and k01998 and polar amino acid transport system permease protein k02028 and k02029 increased by 7 98 and 35 00 respectively this implied the transport activity for stated proteins was stimulated by lower c n which strengthened the intracellular and extracellular connection and likely resulted in high fluorescent intensity of smps mainly region iv in c n of 1 5 this further confirmed the previous study that low c n induced the dramatic variability and high utilization of fluorescent proteins zhang et al 2021b 3 6 3 analysis of nitrate removal mechanism although there was an unobvious difference in the abundance of nitrogen metabolism among samples the difference among specific genes existed as shown in fig 9 more genes that encode other functions similar functions but occupy negligible proportion are shown in data 3 file gene abundance related to no3 n no2 n transport increased with the lower c n on the other hand the abundance of genes encoding nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos increased in c n of 2 5 which controlled nitrogen reduction from no to gaseous nitrogen n2 zhao et al 2020 according to the reactor performance the reactors achieved nearly complete nitrate removal in c n 2 5 with sufficient carbon source therefore the two types reasonably increased to reduce residual no or n2o to n2 when the c n got lower the problem arose with insufficient carbon source that led to the considerable no2 n accumulation and the less norbc and nosz genes were needed in the denitrification process the genes encoding nitrate reduction to ammonium nirbd remained at a high level and were hardly affected by c n the pathway of reducing no2 to nh4 nir controlled happened in the cytoplasm and could catalyze both assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction pandey et al 2020 through the pathway of nar nir the nitrogen source could be transferred to ammonium assimilated via glutamate metabolism and then used to favor other nitrogen related metabolisms and bacterial growth moreover the discovery of the aerobic denitrifying gene periplasmic nitrate reductase napa indicated that nitrate reduction of the two reactors also occurred in micro aerobic conditions zhang et al 2021a to some extent the coexistence of narghi and napa in the biological community reduced the interference of oxygen in influent and guaranteed effective nitrate removal during the operation overall the community possessed complete denitrifying genes to realize efficient nitrate removal although there was little difference in genes encoding nar the nre was promoted by ahaq and maintained at a high level generally a complete electron transport chain etc in the denitrification process consists of nad nadh flavoproteins fp iron sulfur proteins fe s ubiquinone uq coenzyme q and cytochromes grady et al 2011 the rm is widely acknowledged with potential to build new routes of electron flow with lower reaction activation energy singh et al 2019 which is a crucial reason why indicators are promoted including various reductase activities and electron transport system activity nevertheless it only happens when standard redox potential of rmox red fell between electron donor and acceptor van der zee and cervantes 2009 considering the enhanced and stable performance in the rm reactor ahaq potentially exerted this role the microbe attachment onto the immobilized ahaq as well as the biodegradation tendency of ahaq section 3 6 1 implied to resolve the barrier and create an opportunity for integrating ahaq into denitrification location periplasm furthermore according to the rapid no3 n reduction and nia a new route within the electron flow of nadh fp fe s uq nar was likely created by ahaq however the inappropriate standard redox potential binding site or toxic effect likely interfered its promotion for no2 n removal in view of different binding sites of ahaq onto the carrier intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the standard redox potential of mediators in denitrification table s2 the redox potential of ahaq could be within a range of 320 350 mv vs she 4 conclusions in this study the rm reactor equipped with the immobilized ahaq and three core strains was well established to realize rapid maximum 14 00 mg l 1 h 1 and efficient nitrate removal maximum 99 41 under low c n conditions ahaq accelerated nitrate reduction to nitrite and promoted the consumption of more carbon source by denitrifying bacteria although the nia was hardly solved in lower c n due to carbon source deficiency rm reactor could maintain the stable property of effluent smps and biological activities in low c n environment the enhanced electron transport activity via predicting pathway further confirmed the rapid nitrate removal by ahaq additionally the abundances of some amino acids fatty acids carbohydrate related metabolisms and abc transporters pathway in rm reactor were higher in lower c n implying the superior performance in rm reactor likely resulted from the regulation of carbon source to better couple with nitrogen metabolism lower c n also enhanced the pts pathway which could harmonize the balance between carbon and nitrogen moreover the reversible state of ahaq between oxidation and reduction could create a novel route of electron flow to accelerate nitrate removal like the role of uq these findings made an important contribution to the application of rm and preponderant microbes for nitrate removal in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest existed in the submission of this manuscript and it is approved by all co authors for publication

16401,the acceleration of nitrate removal in wastewater treatment by redox mediator rm is greatly weakened due to wash out loss and mass transfer resistance low hydrophilia of rm during operation in this study an rm reactor with the fixed 1 amino 4 hydroxyanthraquinone ahaq and three core strains was established and achieved high nitrate removal efficiency nre under low carbon to nitrogen ratio c n and short hydraulic retention time hrt conditions with the maximum efficiency of 99 41 14 00 mg l 1 h 1 and average improvement by 11 97 1 41 mg l 1 h 1 this acceleration led to more proportion of carbon consumption by denitrifying bacteria and improved their competitiveness against others in carbon deficiency although resulting in nitrite accumulation nia in lower c n the rm reactor induced the decorrelation tendencies between nre and active extracellular organics and more sensitive denitrification toward c n which favored the stability of effluent organics and biological activities the increase of oxidative phosphorylation and ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis pathway suggested electron transport activity was potentially enhanced by ahaq although the lower c n deteriorated the reactor nre the abundances of amino acids fatty acids and carbohydrate related metabolisms 45 of the total up regulating pathways were enhanced to utilize carbon source effectively meanwhile the enhanced phosphotransferase system facilitated the balance between carbon and nitrogen metabolism these indicated the changes in biological strategy to grow better and resist the adverse condition this study highlighted the superior nre by ahaq in an immobilized reactor with core strains and more importantly extended the rm application in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image

3d eem three dimensional excitation and emission matrix uq ubiquinone wwpts wastewater treatment plants 1 introduction with the rapid growth of industrial activities and human population wastewater treatment for recycling and reuse has attracted extensive attention owing to its great alleviation toward the water shortage liao et al 2021 however the treatment is overwhelmingly limited by the low carbon to nitrogen ratio c n in most municipal wastewater leading to nearly 25 mg l 1 nitrate no3 n residue in effluent from the final sedimentation tank gao et al 2020 this adversely affected the efficient water purification in the advanced sewage treatments and reclaimed water utilization biological denitrification is the main process of nitrate removal in wastewater treatment plants wwpts zhang et al 2021b consequently the enhancement of nitrate removal efficiency nre has been a question of great interest in wastewater treatment emerging technologies such as solid phase denitrification hu et al 2019 endogenous denitrification wang et al 2019 and the supplement of sludge internal carbon source guo et al 2018 have been applied and achieved a promising performance in nitrate removal particularly short cut nitrification and denitrification and anammox provide another energy efficient way for nitrogen removal however as reported direct application of them in the mainstream wwpts is not feasible due to numerous practical issues that ultimately leads to the disruption of biological community structure li et al 2020 for anammox technology coupling partial nitrification or denitrification with anammox is a promising solution in the mainstream wwpts gao et al 2022 li et al 2020 though it needs many endeavors in real treatment process recently immobilizing optimal microbes has attracted researchers due to its reinforced function with specialization in low c n and low nitrate concentration environment zhang et al 2021a however the cell washout bacterial contamination from the influent and following interspecific competition may lead to the crash of biological reactors sakarya et al 2021 the latter studies indicated that the interspecies collaboration could enhance the viability and competitive capacity of target microbes in wastewater treatment tang et al 2018 which implies that the combination of multiple microbes seems to be a better solution furthermore limited by the electron transfer and intense competition for energy in various biological reactions the nitrate removal rate is prospectively improved by redox mediator rm yang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 rm performed well in the bioremediation of dyes and thus attracted the researcher s attention for nitrate removal castañon et al 2019 to accelerate biological process rm is capable of shuttling electrons between the microbes and the target substances with reversibility of oxidation and reduction states dos santos et al 2004 compared to endogenous rm exogenous rm is more applicable and reliable in nitrate removal mainly belonging to quinone compounds zhang et al 2021c however most of rm related studies for nitrate removal were conducted in pure culture environment castañon et al 2019 while the applications of rm in reactors are rare according to the performance of rm in dye bioremediation reactor gradual loss of rm and the disruption of immobilized carriers are inevitable during operation yang et al 2018 traditional immobilized carriers such as calcium alginate activated carbon hydrogel agar etc seem to be unsuitable novel and effective immobilized methods are urgently needed to solve this issue additionally the hydrophobicity of rm and synthetic carrier could aggravate the mass transfer resistance alvarez et al 2010 and is thereby viewed as an important indicator for the performance of rm reactor the effects of rm on microbes are extensively studied the detailed changes such as nitrate reductase activity electron transport system activity extracellular polymeric substances epss and cell membrane permeability are likely to happen in response to rm he et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c however few studies have explored the adaptation of biological communities and corresponding potential functions to the rm reactor the rm likely improves the nitrate removal via multiple ways not only as ever thought to accelerate removal rate therefore combined with the inefficient nitrate removal under low c n and nitrate concentration conditions it is worthy to investigate the feasibility of an immobilized rm reactor with multiple superior microbes additionally soluble microbial products smps are produced during the cell growth and could benefit the stability of biological community and reactor performance against environmental pressure zhou et al 2021 therefore the relationship between effluent smps and nitrate removal potentially reflects the reactor performance which provides an effective method for the comparison of different reactors in the present study the 1 amino 4 hydroxyanthraquinone ahaq known as disperse red 15 miryala et al 2020 was firstly employed onto polyurethane modified hydrophilic gel carrier pumhgc high hydrophilia without silicone oil process during production via conh formed in a dehydration condensation reaction ahaq is an important intermediate product industrially produced and widely applied in dyes synthesis and analytical determination fain et al 2010 three microbes comamonas sp ysf15 pseudomonas stutzeri sp gf2 and pseudomonas stutzeri sp gf3 were used to form strong biofilm on the surface of pumhgc ahaq carrier which all performed high nitrate removal performance in a pure culture environment therefore the enhanced rm reactor was established to explore its sustainability and operational feasibility for nitrate removal in low c n and low nitrate environment from the perspective of reactor performance effluent organics and biological community the changes in potential functions of the community were further clarified to determine the promotional mechanism of rm reactor and strategies of the community in response to low c n ratio 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism and culture as the previous studies reported comamonas sp ysf15 su et al 2020 pseudomonas stutzeri sp gf2 chen et al 2021 and pseudomonas stutzeri sp gf3 zheng et al 2021 exhibited effective denitrification capacity under low c n conditions therefore used in this study the basic medium bm for their cultivation was sterilized at 121 0 c for 30 0 min and consisted of following elements per liter ch3coona 0 15 g nano3 0 15 g k2hpo4 0 1 g mgcl2 0 05 g and 2 0 ml of trace elements su et al 2020 2 2 pumhgc ahaq preparation and bacteria immobilization purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd china 1 amino 4 hydroxyanthraquinone ahaq n hydroxysuccinimide nhs and 1 ethyl 3 3dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride edc hcl were dissolved in ultrapure water at 0 3 1 0 1 0 w w the polyurethane modified hydrophilic gel carrier pumhgc zhejiang biocarriers environmental technologies co ltd china specific surface area 4000 m2 m3 density 1 02 g cm3 and porosity 98 were cleaned with ultrapure water three times and then sterilized at 121 0 c for 30 0 min following this treatment the carrier was added to the above solution stirred every 8 0 h for 7 times at 30 c which was beneficial to the self assembly of ahaq to pumhgc and reduce the interference of the side reaction finally the synthetic pumhgc ahaq was washed several times and soaked in ultrapure water for 24 0 h the prepared pumhgc ahaq and the control group pumhgc were added to the bm with three target bacteria after 2 day anaerobic cultivation at 30 c and ph 6 8 7 2 the nutrients were used up and new bm was added into the system this operation was repeated five times for better bacterial immobilization 2 3 rm reactor setup and operation after immobilization the pumhgc and pumhgc ahaq were transferred to the parallel reactors with 20 filling ratio marked as control and rm reactor respectively the cylindrical laboratory scale bioreactor was standardized with 60 mm inner diameter 500 mm height and 1 0 l operating volume the synthetic wastewater was pumped into each reactor with an exchange ratio of 80 via a micro submersible pump which consisted of ch3coona the content changed according to operating conditions so was nano3 nano3 k2hpo4 0 10 g l mgso4 0 05 g l cacl2 0 05 g l and trace elements 2 0 ml l the initial ph was controlled within the range of 6 8 7 2 using 0 10 m naoh and hcl three major parameters c n hydraulic retention time hrt and influent nitrate concentration were investigated at 30 c in this study and the detailed information of operational periods are shown in table 1 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of no3 n nitrite no2 n and ammonium nh4 n nitrogen were measured according to the standard methods zhang et al 2021c via uv spectrophotometer uv 2802 unico china according to the previous study su et al 2020 the soluble microbial products smps were extracted and the two main components polysaccharide ps and protein pn were quantified the gas composition in the rm reactor during phase 2 3 was detected using gas chromatograph 6890 agilent japan according to zhang et al 2020 the reactive functional groups on the surface of pumhgc and pumhgc ahaq were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir is50 nicolet usa with a resolution of 4 cm 1 meanwhile the morphologies of the two carriers before and after bacteria immobilization were characterized with scanning electron microscope sem jsm 6510lv jeol japan briefly 7 effluent samples were collected from each subphase and filtered via 0 22 μm syringe membrane for characterization of three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan the range of the excitation emission wavelengths ex em was 200 400 250 500 nm furthermore the efc software version 1 2 china was used to remove the rayleigh and raman scatterings construct the parallel factor analysis parafac model and define the parafac components according to previous studies to ensure the high similarity over 0 95 he and hur 2015 murphy et al 2010 additionally the method of fluorescence regional integration fri was introduced to further explore the difference between the two reactors zhang et al 2021b the region division is shown in table s1 the calculated fri results were tested and the bad values were deleted using boxplot 2 5 biological analysis the carbon source deficiency is an important factor that limits the biological activity and growth to improve nre and explore the microbial community response to low c n samples were collected at the end of subphase 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 in the rm reactor and 2 3 in the control marked as rm25 rm20 rm15 and c20 respectively the subsequent analyses were completed by shanghai personal biotechnology co ltd china with pcr amplification v3v4 a region of the 16s rrna using the universal primer sets of 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagca 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the biological information was analyzed through the online platform of personalbio genescloud https www genescloud cn home based on the illumina sequencing platform the abundance of metabolic pathways and predicted metagenomics was further analyzed via picrust2 software using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg 2 6 statistical analysis the results were presented in the form of mean value standard error correlations between the effluent indicators and removal performance were calculated as well as their correlation with c n using correlation plot application in origin pro 2021 software version 9 8 0 200 origin lab inc usa the analysis of significant differences was adopted for the comparison of results using ibm spss statistics software version 25 ibm inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and characterization of the carrier based on the sem micrographs the surface of pumhgc ahaq fig s1e was more slippery than pumhgc fig s1a indicating that ahaq successfully combined to the carrier surface the relatively rough surface of pumhgc benefited immobilization by numerous microbes fig s1d however there was an integral aggregated biofilm attaching to the pumhgc ahaq fig s1g quite different from pumhgc it was speculated that bacteria were stimulated to secrete more epss by ahaq which promoted microbial aggregation and enhanced biofilm stability he et al 2018 after 225 days operation pumhgc ahaq faded slightly and had the potential for long term application of wastewater treatment according to ftir spectra the two carriers possessed similar functional groups fig s2 bands at higher wavenumber 2800 cm 1 referred to the existence of functional groups like o h n h and c h peaks at 1729 1640 1598 1220 and 1088 cm 1 were coherent with active functional groups like c o n h c c c n and c o respectively liu et al 2022 which indicated the high hydrophilia and biocompatibility of the two carriers moreover the immobilized ahaq via nhco weakened the intramolecular hydrogen bond and thus improved its hydrophilic activity on the other hand after reaction with ahaq the weakened peaks at 2698 and 1374 cm 1 new peak at 1001 cm 1 and changes in fingerprint region all suggested the minor differences between the two carriers 3 2 nitrate removal performance the operational parameters of influent no3 n concentration hrt and c n were selected to explore the enhancing performance of rm reactor compared to the control group the no3 n removal and nitrite accumulation nia were shown in fig 1 the concentration of influent nitrate and effluent ammonium during operation were shown in fig s3 to avoid the dramatic change at the initial days of each subphase the average nre and nia were based on the data of the last 7 days the results of the independent sample t test indicated that there was a significant difference p 0 05 in nitrate removal performance between the control and rm reactor except for the nia in subphase 1 1 3 2 1 effect of hrt on the nitrate removal performance as shown in fig 1 the increasing hrt from subphase 1 1 to 1 3 significantly improved the average nre with 51 00 85 77 and 98 49 10 32 8 58 and 6 54 mg l 1 h 1 respectively in rm reactor and 45 44 78 22 and 94 31 9 19 7 83 and 6 26 mg l 1 h 1 respectively in the control reactor it indicated that rm reactor could significantly p 0 05 enhance the no3 n removal potential versus the control when the c n got lower this enhancement in rm reactor with same hrt was more obvious surpassing the control by 18 47 18 22 9 01 20 82 22 69 and 17 18 3 74 1 82 0 60 4 20 2 25 and 1 15 mg l 1 h 1 in subphase 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 respectively especially the highest no3 n removal rate 14 00 mg l 1 h 1 occurred in subphase 2 1 rm reactor higher than 2 9 mg l 1 h 1 in fungal pellets immobilized bacterial reactor c n 2 0 as reported by zheng et al 2021 for the synthesis of organic substances and growth of microbes the nh4 n was produced via the pathway of reducing no3 n to nh4 n according to the fig s3 the concentration of nh4 n was lower than 1 00 mg l 1 in subphase 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 indicating it hardly affected the reactor performance additionally the no2 n reduction fell behind no3 n possibly due to its toxic inhibition on biological activities and lower energy availability zhang et al 2020 when the hrt increased from 2 0 to 3 0 h subphase 1 2 to 1 3 the no2 n accumulation correspondingly decreased from 4 04 to 0 83 mg l 1 respectively a similar trend was also observed in subphase 2 2 2 3 and subphase 3 2 3 3 compared to the control reactor there was little acceleration by ahaq in the nitrite reduction irrespective of the changes in hrt which indicated that the facilitation of ahaq mainly took part in no3 n no2 n process in low c n environment 3 2 2 effect of influent nitrate on the nitrate removal performance rm reactor also improved the nre under each influent no3 n condition fig 1 although the nre in rm reactor decreased to 97 58 84 74 and 82 58 with the rising influent no3 n the corresponding removal rate in subphase 2 3 2 4 and 2 5 increased to 6 53 7 02 and 8 35 mg l 1 h 1 respectively higher no3 n concentration could improve the affinity between bacteria and no3 n and thus facilitated the biomass growth and no3 n removal rate luo et al 2021 however the no2 n accumulation also increased with this tendency which further confirmed the little facilitation of rm reactor on no2 n removal under such short hrt condition 3 2 3 effect of c n on the nitrate removal performance lower c n significantly p 0 001 limited the no3 n removal performance in the rm reactor fig 1 with the decreasing tendency from 98 49 to 84 91 6 54 and 5 67 mg l 1 h 1 in subphase 1 3 and 3 3 respectively and increasing no2 n accumulation from 0 83 to 3 81 mg l 1 notably the positive effect of ahaq on no3 n removal was promoted by the lower c n with a strong relationship between c n and accelerating nre by ahaq pearson s correlation r 0 827 p 0 01 n 15 lower c n likely stimulated microbes to remove no3 n rapidly with the help of ahaq on the other hand the high hydrophilicity of pumhgc ahaq carrier facilitated the contact with active molecules which could improve the electron transfer efficiency yang et al 2018 more no2 n accumulated in rm reactor and reached the maximum of 5 85 mg l 1 h in subphase 3 2 fortunately little nitrous oxide n2o was detected in the optimized operation fig s4 possibly due to the mild operation conditions for the single pollutant removal in the lab scale level the imbalance effects of rm on nitrate and nitrite reductase likely led to the no2 n accumulation yin et al 2014 however according to variations in nitrogen nutrients no3 n no2 n and nh4 n in batch tests fig s5 lower c n inhibited the no3 n removal and led to no2 n accumulation indicating that carbon source deficiency was the key factor in process inhibition this was also confirmed by the kinetics analysis in fig s6 compared to the control the rm reactor showed a superior activity to nitrate with a faster removal rate and higher efficiency this was helpful for denitrifying microbes because it facilitated their rapid utilization of carbon source and improved their competitiveness against other microbes beside there was little significance showing that nitrite inhibited the process more no2 n accumulation in the rm reactor was mostly ascribed to more no3 n reduction to no2 n by ahaq with limited carbon source in a way the effective and stable nitrate removal under such low c n condition confirmed that the three target microbes performed a high tolerance toward nitrite 3 3 characterization of the effluent smps 3 3 1 characterization of the effluent smps via parafac analysis based on the 3d eem spectra fig s7 during the reactor operation of 20 mg l 1 no3 n three component model for the effluent smps was defined as fig 2 c1 with ex em of 280 358 nm was dominated by intact tryptophan like proteins excellently coincident modified turker s congruence coefficient mtcc 0 982 with fellman et al 2009 c2 with ex em of 230 275 326 nm was generally assigned to the combination of tryptophan like and tyrosine like proteins with a great coherence mtcc 0 981 with yang et al 2013 c3 with ex em of 245 310 394 nm was identified as humic like substances highly coincident mtcc 0 974 with stedmon et al 2011 the fluorescent proteins in effluent occupied the largest percentage both in the rm and control reactors regardless of the changing hrt or c n according to the previous study fluorescent proteins reflected the active biological activities and were helpful to resist low c n environment he et al 2020 3 3 2 fri characterization of the effluent smps to acquire more information from 3d eem spectra the fri method with detailed components was employed fri method was helpful to avoid the influence of peak changes which at the same time performed satisfactory tolerance to the eem spectral subtraction he and hur 2015 as shown in fig 3 the significant difference p 0 05 in some fluorescent components was observed indicating the delicate difference between the two reactors it is reported that smps tended to be more degradable and could serve as carbon source under lower c n conditions zhang et al 2021b however this phenomenon only existed when the denitrification was nearly completed in the rm reactor during c n of 2 5 and hrt of 3 0 h suggesting that smps were not easily degraded the region iv stable soluble microbial byproduct like substances overlapped with the position of most fluorescent proteins which was also reported as an indicator of biological activities and tolerance to the adverse environment he et al 2018 it occupied nearly half of the total fri volume 3000 3500 ru nm2 and showed little correlation with the hrt and c n indicating that each reactor possessed a high biological activity on nitrate removal in lower c n environment for regions of i ii and iii the fri volumes tended to increase with the higher c n in the control reactor while it seemed to decrease in rm reactor after 2 0 h the variation of region v was more distinctly that fri volume significantly decreased from 863 29 c n 1 5 to 808 34 nm 1 c n 2 5 in hrt 2 0 h and from 892 c n 1 5 to 848 21 nm 1 c n 2 5 in hrt 3 0 h versus the control 710 44 849 36 nm 1 and 748 58 909 26 nm 1 respectively prior studies have confirmed the importance of region iii fulvic acid like and region v humic acid like for their abundant redox active molecules that actively participated in denitrification valenzuela et al 2019 zhang et al 2021c affected by ahaq the biological community was stimulated to produce more humic acid like matter within a short time potentially promoting the sensitive response and rapid denitrification in low c n and short hrt environment 3 3 3 smps quantification it is now well established from a variety of studies that smps mainly originated from epss and intracellular metabolism peker and cecen 2014 tang et al 2020 generally after the hydrolysis of bound epss by bacterial hydrolases the soluble epss are produced which are actually another name of smps in fact it s not contradictory according to the clarification of unified theory because smps related research aims to predict biological activity effluent quality or sludge production while research with epss mostly focuses on biofilm or floc laspidou and rittmann 2002 as shown in fig 4 the two main components i e pn and ps were quantified in each c n environment hrt 3 0 h the pn tended to yield more with the higher c n especially in rm reactor with the maximum of 53 77 mg l 1 additionally the ps also performed the opposite trend from 58 53 to 27 9 mg l 1 with increasing c n on the whole the rm reactor could facilitate the high production of ps and pn which helped to improve the stability of the biological system this was also confirmed in fig s1 that huge production of epss in the biofilm potentially released to supply smps laspidou and rittmann 2002 which implied the difference compared to fluorescent smps zhou et al 2021 also reported that the biological accelerant with shuttling electrons function could help the rapid increase in epss after treatment of high cr vi concentration 3 4 correlation analysis of effluent parameters according to the no3 n removal performance and the effluent smps the corresponding correlation analyses are shown in fig 5 after 3 0 h operation the positive relationship among fluorescent components was observed both in the control and rm reactor in detail a strong correlation r 0 86 between region i and ii indicated the high homology in rm reactor while the correlation was only 0 68 in the control suggesting the difference between the two reactors for the control reactor there were moderate or low positive correlations between pn and each fluorescent component indicating the wide distribution of fluorescent pn in each region however there was little relationship between ps pn and fluorescent components in rm reactor the nre in the control reactor positively correlated with region ii r 0 48 region iii r 0 55 and region v r 0 64 demonstrating the potential facilitation of redox active molecules for nre quite different from those in rm reactor it was supposed that complex interaction between ahaq and bacteria led to the decorrelation among parameters which included the limitation of fluorescent components production and replacement of some functions by ahaq such as shuttling electrons for no3 n removal yin et al 2014 as yang et al 2018 reported the immobilized neutral red dye could improve the oxidation reduction capabilities of the biological system in addition the nre negatively correlated r 0 70 and 0 96 in control and rm reactors respectively with ps the ps is viewed as a supplementary carbon source with high degradation zhang et al 2020 the lower c n tended to stimulate higher ps production to promote no3 n removal compared to control the nre nia and pn were more sensitive to c n in rm reactor which on the contrary exerted less effect on the characteristic of fluorescent smps from the perspective of reactor performance these results suggested the rm reactor possessed a more powerful effect on nitrate removal and could maintain the stable property of effluent organics and biological activities regardless of c n variation it is reasonably deduced that ahaq play an indispensable role in the extracellular process and improved the sensitive response to nitrate removal in rm reactor 3 5 bacterial community dynamics 3 5 1 bacterial richness and diversity for microbial richness and diversity the chao1 observed species shannon simpson pielou s evenness and coverage were adopted as shown in table 2 the coverage of each sample exceeded 0 99 and the sequencing results were reliable the experimental samples rm25 rm20 and rm15 possessed a relatively lower richness species diversity and evenness compared to the sample c20 suggesting the dominant functional species were enhanced in response to ahaq the rank abundance curves also reflected more evenness in sample c20 and rm15 fig s8a according to the venn diagram fig s8b the shared otus between c20 and rm20 accounted for 43 11 of total otus in rm20 sample which was higher than other samples in rm reactor in addition rm20 and rm15 samples shared 23 35 and 15 79 otus with rm25 sample respectively indicating the bacterial community was significantly affected by c n 3 5 2 bacterial community compositions based on the phylogenetic classification of microbial sequences the proteobacteria performed high adaptability to the environment and was the dominant phylum over 80 in all samples fig 6 a which has been reported to be the chief denitrifiers in many systems zhou et al 2021 for class level fig 6b the gammaproteobacteri overwhelmingly accounted for 69 08 69 17 64 38 and 73 51 in sample c20 rm25 rm20 and rm15 respectively indicating the target strain gf2 and gf3 could effectively retain in carriers generally the community structure maintained relative stability toward the c n change the relative abundances of the top 20 genera in all samples were compared in the form of heatmap fig 6c although the relative abundances of all listed genera in heatmap changed with the c n ratio pseudomonas including strain gf2 and gf3 acted as the core genus with the principal proportion of 63 37 65 46 60 38 and 55 88 in sample c20 rm25 rm20 and rm15 respectively which over competed other genera and likely helped to resist the adverse c n environment and possessed effective denitrification performance sakarya et al 2021 3 6 potential functions of the biological community 3 6 1 variation of potential functions in rm reactors compared to the control to further explore the changes in rm reactors compared to the control 23 different functions of the microorganisms in the third category are presented in fig 7 most of them were classified as metabolism in the first category which demonstrated that ahaq had a complex influence and mainly affected the intracellular metabolism over half of these functional abundances decreased fig 7 mainly connected with amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism amino acids are important cell components and participate in growth and numerous metabolisms su et al 2021 on the other hand the oxidative phosphorylation pathways associating with atp formation were enhanced from 0 566 to 0 570 in control and rm reactor respectively the ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis pathways also increased which favored higher electron transport activity in rm reactor ma et al 2021 ramakrishnan et al 2010 additionally the increasing abundances of xylene dioxin and bisphenol degradation pathways suggested that the biological community tended to degrade the ahaq and pumhgc further confirming the slight fading of pumhgc ahaq might result from biodegradation the second top function flagellar assembly pathway accounted for 2 499 of the total predicted abundance in rm reactor fig s1 which was conducive to the formation of biofilm serra et al 2013 tang et al 2018 another unanticipated finding was that the nitrogen metabolism showed a negligible difference indicating the communities in the two reactors possessed a high ability for nitrogen removal from the perspective of biological functions the superior performance in the rm reactor was likely ascribed to the regulation of specific pathways to better couple with nitrogen metabolism 3 6 2 effect of c n on potential functions generally biological activities could be restrained due to low c n in rm reactor the abundances of 23 potential functions tended to decrease in lower c n fig s9 the abundance of tricarboxylic acid tca cycle pathway decreased with the lower c n whereas the pentose phosphate pathway increased fig 8 potentially providing more substrates to compensate for this insufficiency corkins et al 2017 consequently the abundance of the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids increased from 0 524 to 0 537 in the lower c n environment as shown in fig 8 the abundances of amino acids fatty acids and carbohydrate related metabolisms in c n of 1 5 occupied 4 151 2 189 and 5 534 ahead of that in c n 2 5 with 3 975 2 142 and 5 276 respectively which suggested the community was stimulated to improve the utilization of carbon source for efficient nitrate removal to resist the adverse c n environment similarly the phosphotransferase system pts was higher in c n 1 5 0 082 than c n 2 5 0 069 which was beneficial to harmonize the balance between carbon and nitrogen when the nitrogen content is relatively high yoo et al 2016 furthermore the abc transporter function was potentially improved in lower c n in detail the branched chain amino acid transport system permease protein k01995 k01996 k01997 and k01998 and polar amino acid transport system permease protein k02028 and k02029 increased by 7 98 and 35 00 respectively this implied the transport activity for stated proteins was stimulated by lower c n which strengthened the intracellular and extracellular connection and likely resulted in high fluorescent intensity of smps mainly region iv in c n of 1 5 this further confirmed the previous study that low c n induced the dramatic variability and high utilization of fluorescent proteins zhang et al 2021b 3 6 3 analysis of nitrate removal mechanism although there was an unobvious difference in the abundance of nitrogen metabolism among samples the difference among specific genes existed as shown in fig 9 more genes that encode other functions similar functions but occupy negligible proportion are shown in data 3 file gene abundance related to no3 n no2 n transport increased with the lower c n on the other hand the abundance of genes encoding nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos increased in c n of 2 5 which controlled nitrogen reduction from no to gaseous nitrogen n2 zhao et al 2020 according to the reactor performance the reactors achieved nearly complete nitrate removal in c n 2 5 with sufficient carbon source therefore the two types reasonably increased to reduce residual no or n2o to n2 when the c n got lower the problem arose with insufficient carbon source that led to the considerable no2 n accumulation and the less norbc and nosz genes were needed in the denitrification process the genes encoding nitrate reduction to ammonium nirbd remained at a high level and were hardly affected by c n the pathway of reducing no2 to nh4 nir controlled happened in the cytoplasm and could catalyze both assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction pandey et al 2020 through the pathway of nar nir the nitrogen source could be transferred to ammonium assimilated via glutamate metabolism and then used to favor other nitrogen related metabolisms and bacterial growth moreover the discovery of the aerobic denitrifying gene periplasmic nitrate reductase napa indicated that nitrate reduction of the two reactors also occurred in micro aerobic conditions zhang et al 2021a to some extent the coexistence of narghi and napa in the biological community reduced the interference of oxygen in influent and guaranteed effective nitrate removal during the operation overall the community possessed complete denitrifying genes to realize efficient nitrate removal although there was little difference in genes encoding nar the nre was promoted by ahaq and maintained at a high level generally a complete electron transport chain etc in the denitrification process consists of nad nadh flavoproteins fp iron sulfur proteins fe s ubiquinone uq coenzyme q and cytochromes grady et al 2011 the rm is widely acknowledged with potential to build new routes of electron flow with lower reaction activation energy singh et al 2019 which is a crucial reason why indicators are promoted including various reductase activities and electron transport system activity nevertheless it only happens when standard redox potential of rmox red fell between electron donor and acceptor van der zee and cervantes 2009 considering the enhanced and stable performance in the rm reactor ahaq potentially exerted this role the microbe attachment onto the immobilized ahaq as well as the biodegradation tendency of ahaq section 3 6 1 implied to resolve the barrier and create an opportunity for integrating ahaq into denitrification location periplasm furthermore according to the rapid no3 n reduction and nia a new route within the electron flow of nadh fp fe s uq nar was likely created by ahaq however the inappropriate standard redox potential binding site or toxic effect likely interfered its promotion for no2 n removal in view of different binding sites of ahaq onto the carrier intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the standard redox potential of mediators in denitrification table s2 the redox potential of ahaq could be within a range of 320 350 mv vs she 4 conclusions in this study the rm reactor equipped with the immobilized ahaq and three core strains was well established to realize rapid maximum 14 00 mg l 1 h 1 and efficient nitrate removal maximum 99 41 under low c n conditions ahaq accelerated nitrate reduction to nitrite and promoted the consumption of more carbon source by denitrifying bacteria although the nia was hardly solved in lower c n due to carbon source deficiency rm reactor could maintain the stable property of effluent smps and biological activities in low c n environment the enhanced electron transport activity via predicting pathway further confirmed the rapid nitrate removal by ahaq additionally the abundances of some amino acids fatty acids carbohydrate related metabolisms and abc transporters pathway in rm reactor were higher in lower c n implying the superior performance in rm reactor likely resulted from the regulation of carbon source to better couple with nitrogen metabolism lower c n also enhanced the pts pathway which could harmonize the balance between carbon and nitrogen moreover the reversible state of ahaq between oxidation and reduction could create a novel route of electron flow to accelerate nitrate removal like the role of uq these findings made an important contribution to the application of rm and preponderant microbes for nitrate removal in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest existed in the submission of this manuscript and it is approved by all co authors for publication

16402,the incomplete removal of n nitrosamines in water through current degraded techniques and the carcinogenicity of n nitrosamines call for alternative complete and safe removal approaches here we describe a cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption enabling n nitrosamines in water thoroughly and safely removed among them the immobilized tio2 ti photocatalyst degraded n nitrosamines into primary and secondary amines up to 100 by attacking on nitrosyl nitrogen via oh originated from its nanowire film morphology furthermore the affinity of hy zeolite to primary and secondary amines led to efficient adsorption through corresponding to lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order and then the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption realized complete and safe removal of n nitrosamines with various concentration ranging from 0 1 mm to 1 mm in water significantly higher than the existing reports on the removal rate of n nitrosamines and the formation potential of n nitrosamines this study will lead to new avenues for complete and safe eliminaton of hardly degradable hazardous substances in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords n nitrosamines photocatalysis adsorption n nitrosamines formation potential tio2 nanowire hy zeolite 1 introduction the nitrogenous micropollutants in water caused strong concerns over public health in recent years particularly for n nitrosamines a category of emerging carcinogenic nitrogenous micropollutants and disinfect byproducts krasner et al 2013 including n nitrosodimethylamine ndma the most commonly reported member of the n nitrosamine family and n nitrosodiethylamine ndea which is more carcinogenic than ndma and other long aliphatic chain n nitrosamines andrzejewski et al 2005 have been detected in certain surface waters qiu et al 2021 ma et al 2012 and tap water bei et al 2016 at the concentration range from 9 6 to 750 000 ng l hence it is very essential to remove n nitrosamines in water for maintaining public health and safety some researchers have tried to eliminate ndma in water by employing such approaches as adsorption zhang et al 2021 stripping mitch et al 2003 kong et al 2010a fleming et al 1996 kommineni et al 2003 biodegradation tate and alexander 1976 mallik and tesfai 1981 yang et al 2005 reverse osmosis fujioka et al 2013 photocatalytic degradation lee et al 2005a and so on delightedly photocatalytic degradation displayed efficient removal of ndma in water lee et al demonstrated that tio2 powder achieved more than 90 of photocatalysis degradation efficiency for ndma lee et al 2005a simultaneously photocatalysis degradation delayed a safer removal for ndma owing to transforming carcinogenic n nitrosamines to low toxic amines in comparison with other conventional techniques however it should be noted that its degradation product secondary amines posed new concerns on reformation regeneration of n nitrosamines zhou et al 2014 hinneh et al 2019 specifically the secondary amines such as dimethylamine dma diethylamine dea are commonly reformed regenerated to n nitrosamines through the nitrification after chlorination and ozone disinfection processes krasner et al 2013 chen et al 2016 which is called the formation potential fp of n nitrosamines resulting in incomplete and unsafe removal of n nitrosamines from water therefore it is indispensable to simultaneously remove n nitrosamines and their fp for obtaining complete safe elimination of n nitrosamines in water but no research in this respect has been reported interestingly our previous work demonstrated the one thing that the photocatalytic degradation made ndma in water eliminated more than 98 guo et al 2015 and the other thing that hy zeolite had superior adsorption affinity for low molecular weight amines guo et al 2017 which laid a solid foundation for simultaneously removing n nitrosamines and their fp from water by coupling photocatalysis and adsorption further for gaining completely safe removal of n nitrosamines in water cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption can be a better approach therefore in this study how to realize the cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely safe removal of n nitrosamines and their fp will be systematically investigated firstly the immobilized photocatalyst tio2 nanowire thin film on ti plate tio2 ti will be selected to eliminate n nitrosamines in water further their degraded efficiency and mechanisms will be dealt with then the cyclic stability of tio2 ti will be evaluated secondly the selectivity of adsorbents for secondary amines from the degradation products of n nitrosamines will be discussed besides the cyclic removal efficacies of n nitrosamines and their fp through coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption will be explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ndma 99 5 purity and ndea 99 purity were

in our previous work wu et al 2009 2 2 2 photocatalysis products and ros analyses photocatalytic degradation of ndma ndea 1 mm and production of reactive oxygen species ros on tio2 ti was performed in a 400 ml photocatalytic reactor consisting of two screwed cylindrical parts sealed by a gasket and placed horizontally in a constant temperature bath irradiated directly by a 500 w xenon arc lamp λ 290 1800 nm simulate sunlight 500 w m2 three pieces of as prepared tio2 ti were placed on a net bracket approximately 2 cm below the liquid surface the solution was stirred continuously by a magnetic stirrer the initial ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 with 1 mol l hclo4 or naoh and then kept in dark for 30 min to evaluate the impact of adsorption sample aliquots of 10 ml were withdrawn from the illuminated reactor with a syringe at regular time intervals filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and injected into a 10 ml glass vial a set of triplicate experiments was carried out and the average values and the standard deviations are presented a blank test of ndma photolysis without catalysts under the same illumination showed that after 240 min irradiation about 32 of ndma was converted at neutral ph mainly to dimethylamine dma and no2 this photolysis can be attributed to the weak absorption of ndma centered at 332 nm n π transition band plumlee and reinhard 2007 lee et al 2005b 2005c

25 mm and tert butyl alcohol 10 mm was as an effective quencher of singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical respectively which was added to the photocatalytic reaction system to observe its effect on the photocatalytic efficiency and products distribution of ndma and ndea over tio2 ti zhang et al 2009 2 2 3 selective adsorption kinetic experiments before initiating an adsorption experiment 0 1 g of hy zeolite was activated at 550 c for 2 h and was transferred to a 100 ml flask containing a certain mixed aqueous solution of n nitrosamine and low molecule amine with ph of 7 afterward the flask was shaken at 150 r min with a rotary shaker at 25 c sample aliquots of 10 ml were withdrawn from the flask with a syringe at regular time intervals filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and injected into a

adsorption efficiency is recommended the adsorbed effluent flowed into a tank if the effluent of the first cycle of the combined photocatalysis adsorption process did not meet the requirement it would be run in the second cycle of the combined photocatalysis adsorption process till satisfy the requirement of water quality 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic degradation of n nitrosamines in water by immobilized tio2 ti 3 1 1 the influence of immobilized tio2 ti morphology on photocatalytic degradation efficiency the time profiles of photocatalytic degradation of ndma and ndea on immobilized tio2 ti are presented in fig 2 a and b and the ones on ti plate and powdered anatase tio2 are also showed in fig 2 c f as control noticeably tio2 ti greatly improved the efficiency compared with direct photodegradation as shown in table s3 due to its enhanced photocatalytic activity so that ndma was almost completely degraded after 240 min of irradiation with an efficiency of about 100 and more than 90 ndea removal was obtained a slightly reduced degradation efficiency compared to ndma due to the fact that more alkyl groups led to a stronger induction making it difficult to degrade landsman et al 2007 whereas in the presence of the ti plate about 40 of ndma was reduced to convert mainly to dma and no2 after 240 min of irradiation the reduction of ndma can be understood via the effect of ndma photolysis under the same illumination lee et al 2005a similarly lower ndma degradation efficiency also appeared in the photocatalytic degradation results of anatase tio2 which may be due to the great reduction of catalytic activity caused by the particle aggregation and light scattering of the powdery structure of the difficult to separate tio2 particle landsman et al 2007 as detailed in our previous work wu et al 2009 sem and tem images show that the thin film on tio2 ti presents a compact porous nanowire structure with tio2 anatase phase proved by the xrd patterns the above excellent photocatalytic activity of tio2 ti must be attributed to its unique morphology with the hierarchical porous anatase structure li et al 2007 and the 1d nanowire shape yoon et al 2005 jang et al 2007 for nanowires with a 1d structure the high surface to volume ratio enabled a reduction in the hole electron recombination rate and superior interfacial charge carrier transfer rate meanwhile this hierarchical porous anatase structure was favorable to improve the photo responsible performance because the incident light entering the porous structure would prolong the interaction between light and tio2 resulting in an enhanced ability to adsorb organics which can be observed in other nanotube or photonic crystal structural tio2 films tan et al 2014 lin et al 2011 lu et al 2012 additionally it was responsible for that the several extra light adsorption bands greater than 400 nm on tio2 ti made it exhibit higher degradation efficiency of n nitrosamines than ti plate and tio2 powder except for their similar absorption peak at less than 400 nm in the uv visible wavelength range tan et al 2014 the last but not the least the immobilized morphology of tio2 ti is highly conductive to cyclic separation of photocatalyst 3 1 2 the influence of immobilized tio2 ti morphology on the distribution of degradation products for obtaining completely safe removal of n nitrosamines the photocatalytic degradation products distribution of immobilized tio2 ti were further investigated as also presented in fig 2 a and b and the ones of ti plate and powdered anatase tio2 are showed in fig 2 c f as control in comparison with the anatase tio2 powder fig 2e and f the total n balance in tio2 ti degradation process was satisfactory which indicates that the main organic components of the degradation products were primary amine ma and secondary amine dma rather than other kinds of organic nitrogen obviously dma was the most important product in the degradation of ndma by tio2 ti and the content of ma is much lower than dma similar for ndea the production of dea was slightly lower but still exceeded ea significantly it should be noted that the large accumulation of secondary amines can increase the opportunity of regeneration of n nitrosamine following the reaction showed in eq 1 chen and jafvert 2010 liang et al 2003 which will lead to a significant risk of completely safe removal of n nitrosamines h o c l n o 2 n o 2 c l o h n o 2 c l n o 2 n 2 o 4 c l n 2 o 4 o h n o 3 h c l 1 d m a n 2 o 4 n d m a in addition it was worth noting that secondary amines were accompanied by no2 and a small number of primary amines on tio2 ti while for ti plate almost no primary amine was produced except for secondary amines and no2 showed in fig 2 c and d indicating that the production activity of primary amines may be inhibited by no2 in contrast for the anatase tio2 powder in the case of almost no production of no2 a small number of primary amines is also produced while producing secondary amines these phenomena indicated that the immobilized tio2 ti may have certain influences on photocatalytic degradation products in any case the photocatalytic degradation products particularly for secondary amines regarded as fp of n nitrosamines should be further treated for completely and safely removing n nitrosamines in water 3 1 3 mechanisms on photocatalytic degradation of n nitrosamines by tio2 ti based on the above photocatalytic degradation performances and products analysis of n nitrosamines by immobilized tio2 ti the mechanisms on photocatalytic degradation of tio2 ti will be further clarified along with the determination of the time profiles of ros including oh and 1o2 generated from tio2 ti from the fig 3 a we can see that the concentration of ros on tio2 ti increases with the prolongation of the irradiation time and the concentration of 1o2 is significantly greater than oh after 240 min of irradiation to confirm the possible roles of oh and 1o2 in ndma and ndea degradation on tio2 ti the photocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out in the presence of excess nan3 as a 1o2 scavenger zhang et al 2009 and excess tert butyl alcohol tba as a oh scavenger respectively as the fig 3 b and c showed the addition of excess tba as a oh scavenger significantly inhibited the photocatalytic degradation of ndma and ndea rather than that of excess nan3 as a 1o2 scavenger which indicates that oh played a more important role in photocatalytic degradation moreover we can see that the ndma and ndea degradation efficiency and products are only slightly different when nan3 is added as a 1o2 scavenger which demonstrates that 1o2 contributes little to the photocatalytic degradation of ndma and ndea by tio2 ti it should be noted that the previous research reported that the straight tubular geometry of nanotubular tio2 favored for shorting the diffusion path of carrier 1o2 and reaction matter from the solution to the active surface site macak et al 2007 resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic activity on the nanotubular tio2 our previous work also indicated the tubular structures of tint and au tint had some influences on the diffusion path of intermediate products and products further resulting in the contact and reaction between the carrier 1o2 and intermediate product or product whereas our results inferred that the nanowire film morphology of tio2 ti was less prone to build a bridge between the reactant and 1o2 than the tubular morphology of tint but here is the interesting thing that the oh produced by tio2 ti favored to attack the nitrosyl nitrogen on ndma and ndea shown in fig 3 d which was subsequently converted into dma and dea as well as no2 just like the degradation of the ethyl violet dye through the attack of oh species on the reactants conducted by mai et al mai et al 2010 from the above analysis we can know the photocatalyst morphology have significant impacts on photocatalytic degradation mechanisms 3 1 4 the cyclic stability of immobilized tio2 ti the efficient photocatalytic degradation efficiency of immobilized tio2 ti presented in the above favorably supported the complete removal of n nitrosamines from water meanwhile the exploration on the cyclic stability of immobilized tio2 ti will further help to realize the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely safe of n nitrosamines as the fig 4 showed immobilized tio2 ti exhibited stable photocatalytic activity for ndma and ndea respectively with 100 and above 87 after 4 h irradiation in every test which indicated that immobilized tio2 ti was in possession of good durability and firmness based on its morphology and structure wu et al 2009 moreover the anatase nanowire film formed in situ on the ti plate can be more simply recycled than the suspended powder photocatalyst thereby it can be expected that the immobilized tio2 ti would be appropriately applied in cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely safe removal of n nitrosamines in water 3 2 adsorption of the formation potential of n nitrosamines in water by hy zeolite 3 2 1 adsorption selectivity of the formation potential of n nitrosamines from photocatalytic degradation products of n nitrosamines by hy zeolite according to the photocatalytic degradation products distribution of n nitrosamines described in the above and our previous work that zeolite had a good adsorption affinity for small molecular amines guo et al 2017 fig 5 gives the time profiles of adsorption selectivity efficacies for secondary amines fp of n nitrosamines on hy zeolite in presence of n nitrosamines and other amines with different concentrations and ratios from the fig 5 a d we can see that there were almost no obvious effects on the removal efficiencies of secondary amines when the adsorption reached in balance with all close to 100 whether the concentration ratio of n nitrosamines to secondary amines was 1 100 or 1 1 for the adsorption capacity a striking observation shown in fig 5 e h is that the time profiles of adsorbed dma and dea amounts to hy zeolite exhibited remarkably comparable trends whether there was the coexistence of the low or high concentration of ndma and ndea with dma and dea or not respectively in the first 5 h compared with the control group with only n nitrosamines or secondary amines the adsorption capacity and efficiency of secondary amines only increased sharply with time regardless of coexisting substances afterwards the adsorption rates gradually slowed down towards balance owing to the decrease of active sites for adsorption of dma and dea to hy zeolite although the coexistence of n nitrosamines had nothing to do with the adsorption capacity the initial concentration of dma and dea had a significant effect on their equilibrium adsorption capacity i e the equilibrium adsorption capacity of dma and dea increased with their initial concentration increasing based on that the higher initial concentration meant a stronger adsorption driving force resulting in a higher equilibrium adsorption capacity in addition it should be noted that the coexistence of ndma and ndea did not affect the adsorption of dma and dea because the electrostatic interaction between the positive ion of the secondary amine and the surface hydroxyl groups of the hy zeolite played a role in the adsorption of amines in an aqueous solution onto zeolites guo et al 2017 thus that hy zeolite had the selective adsorption capacity of secondary amines from the photocatalytic degradation products of n nitrosamines besides it was worth noting that the primary amines with similar physical chemical properties to secondary amines lee et al 2005a were also contained in the photocatalytic degradation products of n nitrosamines thereby having vital significances to investigate the influences of primary amines on the adsorption of secondary amines on hy zeolite as the fig 5 i j showed the existence of primary amines won t change the dynamic adsorptive trends for secondary amines compared to pure secondary amines owing to that both primary amine and secondary amines possessed excellent and similar adsorptive affinity based on that the pore size of hy zeolite was larger than small molecular amines which made hy zeolite have no specific adsorption property for primary amine and secondary amine guo et al 2017 however when primary amines coexist the adsorption capacity of hy zeolite for secondary amines decreased slightly and the equilibrium adsorption capacity followed the order of ma dma ea dea resulting from their different initial concentration nevertheless the primary amine and secondary amine were all major photocatalytic degradation products of n nitrosamines when secondary amine was effectively and selectively removed by hy zeolite co removal of primary amine would make the n nitrosamines photocatalytic degraded products be removed more completely what s more in the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely removing n nitrosamines the removal of primary and secondary amines will accelerate the photocatalytic degradation of n nitrosamines in the second cycle which keeps the highest photocatalytic efficiency thus favorably completely removing n nitrosamines 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics of the formation potential of n nitrosamines in water by hy zeolite to further understand the adsorption mechanisms of fp of n nitrosamines on hy zeolite the lagergren adsorption rate equations of the first order and second order otero et al 2003 presented in eq 2 and 3 were employed which were respectively analyzed for the experimental data on the time profiles of the adsorbed secondary amines amounts to hy zeolite with n nitrosamines or and primary amines coexisted accordingly the kinetic parameters obtained from the above equations are presented in table 1 2 lg q e q t lg q e k 1 t 2 303 where qt is the adsorbed amounts at adsorption time t mg g 1 k1 is the adsorption rate constant of first order h 1 qe is equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the adsorption rate constant of second order g mg 1 h 1 others are the same as to above mentioned an obvious observation is that the correlation coefficients obtained by using lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order are larger than that of lagergren adsorption rate equation of first order and the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe c calculated by lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order is very near to that obtained from experiments these results indicated that the adsorption of secondary amines on hy zeolite in these cases of coexisted n nitrosamines or and primary amines corresponded to lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order meantime the adsorption rate constants of second order fluctuated from 0 840 to 5 337 which was resulted from the change of the initial concentration of the secondary amine these results further confirmed that the initial concentration had a significant impact on the equilibrium adsorption capacity interestingly the adsorption rate constants reached the maximum when n nitrosamines and primary amines coexist which meant that the adsorption equilibrium would be reached in a relatively short period thus being more conducive to efficiently remove fp of n nitrosamines by hy zeolites 3 3 cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely safe removal of n nitrosamines in water based on the above work tio2 ti photocatalyst exhibited powerful ability to degrade n nitrosamines into secondary amines and primary amines etc and hy zeolites displayed excellent adsorption efficacies of small molecular amines thus supposing that photocatalysis and adsorption are coupled into a cyclic process with 4 h irradiation time simulate sunlight 500 w m2 and 4 h adsorption time were selected the completely safe removal of n nitrosamines will be expected fig 6 gives the degraded effectiveness of the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption for three various concentrations of ndma ndea aqueous solution during two continuous cycles it is obvious that for the feed water containing ndma of approximately 1 mm presented in fig 6 a1 more than 99 of ndma removal efficiency was obtained by photocatalysis process of tio2 ti during the first cycle meanwhile a large number of secondary amines with almost 10 times concentration of ma were produced further causing the high adsorption rate of hy zeolite to dma with about 80 as well as above 70 of removal efficiency for primary amine nevertheless the co adsorption removal of the first cycle photocatalytic process products effectively promoted the progress in the second cycle so that the remaining ndma and dma was degraded by photocatalysis again and eventually the hazardous substances are completely and safely removed by the latter adsorption process comparatively ndea had not been completely removed after the second cycle of the cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption due to the longer molecular chain but its removal efficiency was still more than 98 predictably the effluents of ndea will be completely safe after the third or more cycles of the cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption similarly for the feed water containing ndma and ndea of about 0 6 mm showed in fig 6 a2 some substances such as dma ea and ndea in the effluent can be detected out with very low concentration after running two cycles in the coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption however for the feed water containing ndma and ndea of about 0 1 mm demonstrated in fig 6 a3 it was striking that nothing hazardous substances was detected out in the final product after running the coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption for two cycles significantly higher than the existing reports on the removal rate of n nitrosamines qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 and their fp beita sandi et al 2016 sgroi et al 2018 in fact the concentration of ndma and ndea in drinking water wastewater and other environmental waters commonly was lower than 0 1 mm indicating that the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption is effective and convincing for completely and safely removing n nitrosamines hazardous substances from the environment however it should be noted that the possible influences of coexisted substances in actual water on cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption will be further systematically investigated in our future work 4 conclusion in brief we have demonstrated a convenient cyclic coupling process by integrating photocatalysis and adsorption functions which can completely and safely remove n nitrosamines and their fp driven by the great oxidation capacity of oh the tio2 ti showed excellent photocatalysis degradation ability of n nitrosamines with close to 100 much larger than that of anatase tio2 and ti plate meanwhile the hy zeolites exhibited good selective adsorption capacity for small molecule amines including fp of n nitrosamines from the photocatalysis degradation products of n nitrosamines and the adsorption of secondary amines by hy zeolite corresponded to lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order more importantly the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption exhibited good maneuverability for completely safe removal of n nitrosamines at a concentration of 0 1 mm in water which match well with the requirements for treating the real hazardous substances on a mass scale our cyclic coupling method is obviously forward looking and can be used as the first choice to explore the complete elimination of hardly degradable hazardous substances in water environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16402,the incomplete removal of n nitrosamines in water through current degraded techniques and the carcinogenicity of n nitrosamines call for alternative complete and safe removal approaches here we describe a cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption enabling n nitrosamines in water thoroughly and safely removed among them the immobilized tio2 ti photocatalyst degraded n nitrosamines into primary and secondary amines up to 100 by attacking on nitrosyl nitrogen via oh originated from its nanowire film morphology furthermore the affinity of hy zeolite to primary and secondary amines led to efficient adsorption through corresponding to lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order and then the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption realized complete and safe removal of n nitrosamines with various concentration ranging from 0 1 mm to 1 mm in water significantly higher than the existing reports on the removal rate of n nitrosamines and the formation potential of n nitrosamines this study will lead to new avenues for complete and safe eliminaton of hardly degradable hazardous substances in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords n nitrosamines photocatalysis adsorption n nitrosamines formation potential tio2 nanowire hy zeolite 1 introduction the nitrogenous micropollutants in water caused strong concerns over public health in recent years particularly for n nitrosamines a category of emerging carcinogenic nitrogenous micropollutants and disinfect byproducts krasner et al 2013 including n nitrosodimethylamine ndma the most commonly reported member of the n nitrosamine family and n nitrosodiethylamine ndea which is more carcinogenic than ndma and other long aliphatic chain n nitrosamines andrzejewski et al 2005 have been detected in certain surface waters qiu et al 2021 ma et al 2012 and tap water bei et al 2016 at the concentration range from 9 6 to 750 000 ng l hence it is very essential to remove n nitrosamines in water for maintaining public health and safety some researchers have tried to eliminate ndma in water by employing such approaches as adsorption zhang et al 2021 stripping mitch et al 2003 kong et al 2010a fleming et al 1996 kommineni et al 2003 biodegradation tate and alexander 1976 mallik and tesfai 1981 yang et al 2005 reverse osmosis fujioka et al 2013 photocatalytic degradation lee et al 2005a and so on delightedly photocatalytic degradation displayed efficient removal of ndma in water lee et al demonstrated that tio2 powder achieved more than 90 of photocatalysis degradation efficiency for ndma lee et al 2005a simultaneously photocatalysis degradation delayed a safer removal for ndma owing to transforming carcinogenic n nitrosamines to low toxic amines in comparison with other conventional techniques however it should be noted that its degradation product secondary amines posed new concerns on reformation regeneration of n nitrosamines zhou et al 2014 hinneh et al 2019 specifically the secondary amines such as dimethylamine dma diethylamine dea are commonly reformed regenerated to n nitrosamines through the nitrification after chlorination and ozone disinfection processes krasner et al 2013 chen et al 2016 which is called the formation potential fp of n nitrosamines resulting in incomplete and unsafe removal of n nitrosamines from water therefore it is indispensable to simultaneously remove n nitrosamines and their fp for obtaining complete safe elimination of n nitrosamines in water but no research in this respect has been reported interestingly our previous work demonstrated the one thing that the photocatalytic degradation made ndma in water eliminated more than 98 guo et al 2015 and the other thing that hy zeolite had superior adsorption affinity for low molecular weight amines guo et al 2017 which laid a solid foundation for simultaneously removing n nitrosamines and their fp from water by coupling photocatalysis and adsorption further for gaining completely safe removal of n nitrosamines in water cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption can be a better approach therefore in this study how to realize the cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely safe removal of n nitrosamines and their fp will be systematically investigated firstly the immobilized photocatalyst tio2 nanowire thin film on ti plate tio2 ti will be selected to eliminate n nitrosamines in water further their degraded efficiency and mechanisms will be dealt with then the cyclic stability of tio2 ti will be evaluated secondly the selectivity of adsorbents for secondary amines from the degradation products of n nitrosamines will be discussed besides the cyclic removal efficacies of n nitrosamines and their fp through coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption will be explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ndma 99 5 purity and ndea 99 purity were

290 1800 nm simulate sunlight 500 w m2 three pieces of as prepared tio2 ti were placed on a net bracket approximately 2 cm below the liquid surface the solution was stirred continuously by a magnetic stirrer the initial ph of the suspension was adjusted to 7 with 1 mol l hclo4 or naoh and then kept in dark for 30 min to evaluate the impact of adsorption sample aliquots of 10 ml were withdrawn from the illuminated reactor with a syringe at regular time intervals filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and injected into a 10 ml glass vial a set of triplicate experiments was carried out and the average values and the standard deviations are presented a blank test of ndma photolysis without catalysts under the same illumination showed that after 240 min irradiation about 32 of ndma was converted at neutral ph mainly to dimethylamine dma and no2 this photolysis can be attributed to the weak absorption of ndma centered at 332 nm n π transition band plumlee and reinhard 2007 lee et al 2005b 2005c

photocatalytic efficiency and products distribution of ndma and ndea over tio2 ti zhang et al 2009 2 2 3 selective adsorption kinetic experiments before initiating an adsorption experiment 0 1 g of hy zeolite was activated at 550 c for 2 h and was transferred to a 100 ml flask containing a certain mixed aqueous solution of n nitrosamine and low molecule amine with ph of 7 afterward the flask was shaken at 150 r min with a rotary shaker at 25 c sample aliquots of 10 ml were withdrawn from the flask with a syringe at regular time intervals filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and injected into a

the photocatalytic degradation effluent was collected in a tank and then entered into adsorption unit containing 0 1 g hy zeolite after a certain adsorption time the time corresponding to the highest adsorption efficiency is recommended the adsorbed effluent flowed into a tank if the effluent of the first cycle of the combined photocatalysis adsorption process did not meet the requirement it would be run in the second cycle of the combined photocatalysis adsorption process till satisfy the requirement of water quality 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalytic degradation of n nitrosamines in water by immobilized tio2 ti 3 1 1 the influence of immobilized tio2 ti morphology on photocatalytic degradation efficiency the time profiles of photocatalytic degradation of ndma and ndea on immobilized tio2 ti are presented in fig 2 a and b and the ones on ti plate and powdered anatase tio2 are also showed in fig 2 c f as control noticeably tio2 ti greatly improved the efficiency compared with direct photodegradation as shown in table s3 due to its enhanced photocatalytic activity so that ndma was almost completely degraded after 240 min of irradiation with an efficiency of about 100 and more than 90 ndea removal was obtained a slightly reduced degradation efficiency compared to ndma due to the fact that more alkyl groups led to a stronger induction making it difficult to degrade landsman et al 2007 whereas in the presence of the ti plate about 40 of ndma was reduced to convert mainly to dma and no2 after 240 min of irradiation the reduction of ndma can be understood via the effect of ndma photolysis under the same illumination lee et al 2005a similarly lower ndma degradation efficiency also appeared in the photocatalytic degradation results of anatase tio2 which may be due to the great reduction of catalytic activity caused by the particle aggregation and light scattering of the powdery structure of the difficult to separate tio2 particle landsman et al 2007 as detailed in our previous work wu et al 2009 sem and tem images show that the thin film on tio2 ti presents a compact porous nanowire structure with tio2 anatase phase proved by the xrd patterns the above excellent photocatalytic activity of tio2 ti must be attributed to its unique morphology with the hierarchical porous anatase structure li et al 2007 and the 1d nanowire shape yoon et al 2005 jang et al 2007 for nanowires with a 1d structure the high surface to volume ratio enabled a reduction in the hole electron recombination rate and superior interfacial charge carrier transfer rate meanwhile this hierarchical porous anatase structure was favorable to improve the photo responsible performance because the incident light entering the porous structure would prolong the interaction between light and tio2 resulting in an enhanced ability to adsorb organics which can be observed in other nanotube or photonic crystal structural tio2 films tan et al 2014 lin et al 2011 lu et al 2012 additionally it was responsible for that the several extra light adsorption bands greater than 400 nm on tio2 ti made it exhibit higher degradation efficiency of n nitrosamines than ti plate and tio2 powder except for their similar absorption peak at less than 400 nm in the uv visible wavelength range tan et al 2014 the last but not the least the immobilized morphology of tio2 ti is highly conductive to cyclic separation of photocatalyst 3 1 2 the influence of immobilized tio2 ti morphology on the distribution of degradation products for obtaining completely safe removal of n nitrosamines the photocatalytic degradation products distribution of immobilized tio2 ti were further investigated as also presented in fig 2 a and b and the ones of ti plate and powdered anatase tio2 are showed in fig 2 c f as control in comparison with the anatase tio2 powder fig 2e and f the total n balance in tio2 ti degradation process was satisfactory which indicates that the main organic components of the degradation products were primary amine ma and secondary amine dma rather than other kinds of organic nitrogen obviously dma was the most important product in the degradation of ndma by tio2 ti and the content of ma is much lower than dma similar for ndea the production of dea was slightly lower but still exceeded ea significantly it should be noted that the large accumulation of secondary amines can increase the opportunity of regeneration of n nitrosamine following the reaction showed in eq 1 chen and jafvert 2010 liang et al 2003 which will lead to a significant risk of completely safe removal of n nitrosamines h o c l n o 2 n o 2 c l o h n o 2 c l n o 2 n 2 o 4 c l n 2 o 4 o h n o 3 h c l 1 d m a n 2 o 4 n d m a in addition it was worth noting that secondary amines were accompanied by no2 and a small number of primary amines on tio2 ti while for ti plate almost no primary amine was produced except for secondary amines and no2 showed in fig 2 c and d indicating that the production activity of primary amines may be inhibited by no2 in contrast for the anatase tio2 powder in the case of almost no production of no2 a small number of primary amines is also produced while producing secondary amines these phenomena indicated that the immobilized tio2 ti may have certain influences on photocatalytic degradation products in any case the photocatalytic degradation products particularly for secondary amines regarded as fp of n nitrosamines should be further treated for completely and safely removing n nitrosamines in water 3 1 3 mechanisms on photocatalytic degradation of n nitrosamines by tio2 ti based on the above photocatalytic degradation performances and products analysis of n nitrosamines by immobilized tio2 ti the mechanisms on photocatalytic degradation of tio2 ti will be further clarified along with the determination of the time profiles of ros including oh and 1o2 generated from tio2 ti from the fig 3 a we can see that the concentration of ros on tio2 ti increases with the prolongation of the irradiation time and the concentration of 1o2 is significantly greater than oh after 240 min of irradiation to confirm the possible roles of oh and 1o2 in ndma and ndea degradation on tio2 ti the photocatalytic degradation experiments were carried out in the presence of excess nan3 as a 1o2 scavenger zhang et al 2009 and excess tert butyl alcohol tba as a oh scavenger respectively as the fig 3 b and c showed the addition of excess tba as a oh scavenger significantly inhibited the photocatalytic degradation of ndma and ndea rather than that of excess nan3 as a 1o2 scavenger which indicates that oh played a more important role in photocatalytic degradation moreover we can see that the ndma and ndea degradation efficiency and products are only slightly different when nan3 is added as a 1o2 scavenger which demonstrates that 1o2 contributes little to the photocatalytic degradation of ndma and ndea by tio2 ti it should be noted that the previous research reported that the straight tubular geometry of nanotubular tio2 favored for shorting the diffusion path of carrier 1o2 and reaction matter from the solution to the active surface site macak et al 2007 resulting in the enhanced photocatalytic activity on the nanotubular tio2 our previous work also indicated the tubular structures of tint and au tint had some influences on the diffusion path of intermediate products and products further resulting in the contact and reaction between the carrier 1o2 and intermediate product or product whereas our results inferred that the nanowire film morphology of tio2 ti was less prone to build a bridge between the reactant and 1o2 than the tubular morphology of tint but here is the interesting thing that the oh produced by tio2 ti favored to attack the nitrosyl nitrogen on ndma and ndea shown in fig 3 d which was subsequently converted into dma and dea as well as no2 just like the degradation of the ethyl violet dye through the attack of oh species on the reactants conducted by mai et al mai et al 2010 from the above analysis we can know the photocatalyst morphology have significant impacts on photocatalytic degradation mechanisms 3 1 4 the cyclic stability of immobilized tio2 ti the efficient photocatalytic degradation efficiency of immobilized tio2 ti presented in the above favorably supported the complete removal of n nitrosamines from water meanwhile the exploration on the cyclic stability of immobilized tio2 ti will further help to realize the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely safe of n nitrosamines as the fig 4 showed immobilized tio2 ti exhibited stable photocatalytic activity for ndma and ndea respectively with 100 and above 87 after 4 h irradiation in every test which indicated that immobilized tio2 ti was in possession of good durability and firmness based on its morphology and structure wu et al 2009 moreover the anatase nanowire film formed in situ on the ti plate can be more simply recycled than the suspended powder photocatalyst thereby it can be expected that the immobilized tio2 ti would be appropriately applied in cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely safe removal of n nitrosamines in water 3 2 adsorption of the formation potential of n nitrosamines in water by hy zeolite 3 2 1 adsorption selectivity of the formation potential of n nitrosamines from photocatalytic degradation products of n nitrosamines by hy zeolite according to the photocatalytic degradation products distribution of n nitrosamines described in the above and our previous work that zeolite had a good adsorption affinity for small molecular amines guo et al 2017 fig 5 gives the time profiles of adsorption selectivity efficacies for secondary amines fp of n nitrosamines on hy zeolite in presence of n nitrosamines and other amines with different concentrations and ratios from the fig 5 a d we can see that there were almost no obvious effects on the removal efficiencies of secondary amines when the adsorption reached in balance with all close to 100 whether the concentration ratio of n nitrosamines to secondary amines was 1 100 or 1 1 for the adsorption capacity a striking observation shown in fig 5 e h is that the time profiles of adsorbed dma and dea amounts to hy zeolite exhibited remarkably comparable trends whether there was the coexistence of the low or high concentration of ndma and ndea with dma and dea or not respectively in the first 5 h compared with the control group with only n nitrosamines or secondary amines the adsorption capacity and efficiency of secondary amines only increased sharply with time regardless of coexisting substances afterwards the adsorption rates gradually slowed down towards balance owing to the decrease of active sites for adsorption of dma and dea to hy zeolite although the coexistence of n nitrosamines had nothing to do with the adsorption capacity the initial concentration of dma and dea had a significant effect on their equilibrium adsorption capacity i e the equilibrium adsorption capacity of dma and dea increased with their initial concentration increasing based on that the higher initial concentration meant a stronger adsorption driving force resulting in a higher equilibrium adsorption capacity in addition it should be noted that the coexistence of ndma and ndea did not affect the adsorption of dma and dea because the electrostatic interaction between the positive ion of the secondary amine and the surface hydroxyl groups of the hy zeolite played a role in the adsorption of amines in an aqueous solution onto zeolites guo et al 2017 thus that hy zeolite had the selective adsorption capacity of secondary amines from the photocatalytic degradation products of n nitrosamines besides it was worth noting that the primary amines with similar physical chemical properties to secondary amines lee et al 2005a were also contained in the photocatalytic degradation products of n nitrosamines thereby having vital significances to investigate the influences of primary amines on the adsorption of secondary amines on hy zeolite as the fig 5 i j showed the existence of primary amines won t change the dynamic adsorptive trends for secondary amines compared to pure secondary amines owing to that both primary amine and secondary amines possessed excellent and similar adsorptive affinity based on that the pore size of hy zeolite was larger than small molecular amines which made hy zeolite have no specific adsorption property for primary amine and secondary amine guo et al 2017 however when primary amines coexist the adsorption capacity of hy zeolite for secondary amines decreased slightly and the equilibrium adsorption capacity followed the order of ma dma ea dea resulting from their different initial concentration nevertheless the primary amine and secondary amine were all major photocatalytic degradation products of n nitrosamines when secondary amine was effectively and selectively removed by hy zeolite co removal of primary amine would make the n nitrosamines photocatalytic degraded products be removed more completely what s more in the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely removing n nitrosamines the removal of primary and secondary amines will accelerate the photocatalytic degradation of n nitrosamines in the second cycle which keeps the highest photocatalytic efficiency thus favorably completely removing n nitrosamines 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics of the formation potential of n nitrosamines in water by hy zeolite to further understand the adsorption mechanisms of fp of n nitrosamines on hy zeolite the lagergren adsorption rate equations of the first order and second order otero et al 2003 presented in eq 2 and 3 were employed which were respectively analyzed for the experimental data on the time profiles of the adsorbed secondary amines amounts to hy zeolite with n nitrosamines or and primary amines coexisted accordingly the kinetic parameters obtained from the above equations are presented in table 1 2 lg q e q t lg q e k 1 t 2 303 where qt is the adsorbed amounts at adsorption time t mg g 1 k1 is the adsorption rate constant of first order h 1 qe is equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g 1 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the adsorption rate constant of second order g mg 1 h 1 others are the same as to above mentioned an obvious observation is that the correlation coefficients obtained by using lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order are larger than that of lagergren adsorption rate equation of first order and the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe c calculated by lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order is very near to that obtained from experiments these results indicated that the adsorption of secondary amines on hy zeolite in these cases of coexisted n nitrosamines or and primary amines corresponded to lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order meantime the adsorption rate constants of second order fluctuated from 0 840 to 5 337 which was resulted from the change of the initial concentration of the secondary amine these results further confirmed that the initial concentration had a significant impact on the equilibrium adsorption capacity interestingly the adsorption rate constants reached the maximum when n nitrosamines and primary amines coexist which meant that the adsorption equilibrium would be reached in a relatively short period thus being more conducive to efficiently remove fp of n nitrosamines by hy zeolites 3 3 cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption for completely safe removal of n nitrosamines in water based on the above work tio2 ti photocatalyst exhibited powerful ability to degrade n nitrosamines into secondary amines and primary amines etc and hy zeolites displayed excellent adsorption efficacies of small molecular amines thus supposing that photocatalysis and adsorption are coupled into a cyclic process with 4 h irradiation time simulate sunlight 500 w m2 and 4 h adsorption time were selected the completely safe removal of n nitrosamines will be expected fig 6 gives the degraded effectiveness of the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption for three various concentrations of ndma ndea aqueous solution during two continuous cycles it is obvious that for the feed water containing ndma of approximately 1 mm presented in fig 6 a1 more than 99 of ndma removal efficiency was obtained by photocatalysis process of tio2 ti during the first cycle meanwhile a large number of secondary amines with almost 10 times concentration of ma were produced further causing the high adsorption rate of hy zeolite to dma with about 80 as well as above 70 of removal efficiency for primary amine nevertheless the co adsorption removal of the first cycle photocatalytic process products effectively promoted the progress in the second cycle so that the remaining ndma and dma was degraded by photocatalysis again and eventually the hazardous substances are completely and safely removed by the latter adsorption process comparatively ndea had not been completely removed after the second cycle of the cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption due to the longer molecular chain but its removal efficiency was still more than 98 predictably the effluents of ndea will be completely safe after the third or more cycles of the cyclic coupling of photocatalysis and adsorption similarly for the feed water containing ndma and ndea of about 0 6 mm showed in fig 6 a2 some substances such as dma ea and ndea in the effluent can be detected out with very low concentration after running two cycles in the coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption however for the feed water containing ndma and ndea of about 0 1 mm demonstrated in fig 6 a3 it was striking that nothing hazardous substances was detected out in the final product after running the coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption for two cycles significantly higher than the existing reports on the removal rate of n nitrosamines qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 and their fp beita sandi et al 2016 sgroi et al 2018 in fact the concentration of ndma and ndea in drinking water wastewater and other environmental waters commonly was lower than 0 1 mm indicating that the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption is effective and convincing for completely and safely removing n nitrosamines hazardous substances from the environment however it should be noted that the possible influences of coexisted substances in actual water on cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption will be further systematically investigated in our future work 4 conclusion in brief we have demonstrated a convenient cyclic coupling process by integrating photocatalysis and adsorption functions which can completely and safely remove n nitrosamines and their fp driven by the great oxidation capacity of oh the tio2 ti showed excellent photocatalysis degradation ability of n nitrosamines with close to 100 much larger than that of anatase tio2 and ti plate meanwhile the hy zeolites exhibited good selective adsorption capacity for small molecule amines including fp of n nitrosamines from the photocatalysis degradation products of n nitrosamines and the adsorption of secondary amines by hy zeolite corresponded to lagergren adsorption rate equation of second order more importantly the cyclic coupling process of photocatalysis and adsorption exhibited good maneuverability for completely safe removal of n nitrosamines at a concentration of 0 1 mm in water which match well with the requirements for treating the real hazardous substances on a mass scale our cyclic coupling method is obviously forward looking and can be used as the first choice to explore the complete elimination of hardly degradable hazardous substances in water environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare

which were 1 4 orders of magnitude less abundant than mcr 5 in most samples fig 1e the relative abundance of tet x1 tet x5 ranged averaged 7 86 10 7 to 1 80 10 2 copies per 16s rrna gene in influents and 4 22 10 7 to 6 49 10 3 copies per 16s rrna gene in effluents fig 1f the effluent samples featured a significantly lower abundance of mcr 1 mcr 2 and tet x1 tet x5 compared with influent samples p 0 01 or p 0 05 most larg variants in influents exhibited significantly higher absolute abundance than those in effluents p 0 05 indicating that chlorine disinfection could effectively reduce the absolute abundance of largs in general the relative abundance of largs decreased in the effluent compared with the influent but this reduction was not significant p 0 05 antibiotics chlorine disinfectants and disinfection by products in hwts might promote the hgt of largs considering that these largs are transferable the hwts harbored abundant largs highlighting the fact that hospital wastewater can be a major conduit for transferring largs into the environment this finding might be an indication of the threat posed by hwts effluent on the dissemination of these args in the receiving water 3 2 phenotypes of larg borne bacteria the qpcr data revealed that largs are prevalent in both influents and effluents although they are reduced after chlorine disinfection many strains harboring these genes are still present in effluents a total of 989 isolates conferring resistance to last resort antibiotics were obtained from the effluents in hwts of these 126 isolates were determined to carry largs by pcr and sanger sequencing and six representative bacteria were selected for further inspection the mlst analysis revealed that these bacteria belonged to six distinct sts st 2 e coli hen st 11 k pneumonia hkn st 632 e coli hm001 st 649 e coli hm016 st 638 e coli hm019 and st 21 e coli ht001 table 1 this demonstrates that the isolates used in this study are not clonal it is noteworthy that bla ndm 1 positive k pneumonia hkn corresponds to the st11 type which was firstly found in severe patients in intensive care unit icu gu et al 2018 these strains have disseminated across various regions and are hypervirulent multidrug resistant highly transmissible and cause fatal pneumonia in patients gu et al 2018 the fact that this strain from icu is also found in effluents suggests that chlorination is not effective enough and it carried a high risk of spreading both in hospital settings and in the community isolates e coli hen and k pneumonia hkn from hospital wastewater exhibited high levels of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics with mics of imipenem at 1024 mg l and 512 mg l respectively mics of polymyxin b for e coli hm001 e coli hm016 and e coli hm019 were 16 8 and 32 mg l respectively the mics of tigecycline for e coli ht001 was 32 mg l fig 2 a bacteria that carry ndm mcr and tet x are resistant to high concentrations antibiotics therefore reliable detection surveillance and control are imperative the conjugative transfer frequency was used to evaluate the transferability of largs among bacteria the results showed that last resort antibiotic resistance could be successfully transferred from isolated strains into the laboratory strain e coli nk5449 the attained conjugative transfer frequencies of phen 3 phkn 2 phm1 5 phm16 1 phm16 3 pht1 1 were 3 38 10 5 3 04 10 6 8 79 10 6 2 41 10 6 and 4 00 10 5 respectively fig 2b given the high transferability the spread largs carrying plasmids had the potential to create truly pan drug or multi drug resistant strains leading to untreatable infections sun et al 2019 3 3 plasmids and chromosomal landscape of largs in isolated strains complete maps of seven representative larg carrying plasmids and one chromosomes were identified to dissect the genetic environment of bla ndm mcr and tet x in isolated strains table 1 the carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae cre mediated by ndm occurs widely in hospital and community infections therefore its high abundance in hwts was not unexpected two plasmids the bla ndm 5 carrying phen 3 and bla ndm 1 carrying phkn 2 were found in k pneumonia and e coli isolates respectively results show that the e coli hen contains three plasmids as shown in fig 3 a phen 3 carries bla ndm 5 and is 46 161 kb long with an average g c content of 46 65 numerous genes in this plasmid are associated with transfer parts such as mges iss transposases and type iv secretion system gene cluster vir the surrounding genetic environment of bla ndm 5 and bleomycin resistance gene ble mbl are successive mges upstream tn3 is3000 isaba125 is5 downstream is26 iskox3 these also indicate the high transferability of arg the k pneumonia hkn contains plasmids phkn 2 and phkn kpc which are 53 134 and 143 896 kb long respectively their genetic maps were visualized by snapgene fig 3b fig s1 larg bla ndm 1 is located on phkn 2 in addition to the type iv secretion system gene cluster vir sporadic other transfer genes like tra and pil were detected on phkn 2 there are 10 different mges on phkn 2 one of them inti1 is supposed to be a good proxy for pollution and associated with genes conferring resistance to antibiotics disinfectants and heavy metals gillings et al 2015 the plasmid phkn kpc has a gc content of 53 51 and is a hybrid of two plasmids it belongs to the incompatibility group incfii incr and further to the important carbapenem arg bla kpc 2 it carries other args such as bla tem 1 bla ctx m 65 cata2 rmtb1 and fosa3 table 1 fig s4 each arg is surrounded by a series of mges which indicates their high propagation potential an entire set of mercury resistance operon meracdptr was present in phkn kpc plasmids harboring antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes may ensure that bacteria survive under hostile environments he et al 2017 the backbones of phen 3 and phkn 2 are entirely different 9 query coverage and the surrounding mges of bla ndm are also dissimilar fig 3c the presence of three adjacent genes or elements is3000 δisaba125 δis5 upstream to bla ndm has been reported for phen 3 in e coli from chinese poultry wang et al 2017c as well as in k pneumoniae from an australian traveler espedido et al 2015 the core genetics of bla ndm on phkn 2 share no similarity with these reported plasmids wang et al 2017d it is also the case that mcr variants have been detected in animal human and natural environments overall the most prevalent among ten mobile colistin resistance genes was mcr 1 shen et al 2020 in this study three mcr 1 positive e coli strains were dissected in e coli hm001 the co existence of plasmids phm1 5 and phm1 3 is detected which harbor mcr 1 and bla ndm 1 respectively the plasmid mcr 1 carrying phm1 5 is much smaller than the other plasmids and has a simple backbone 34 643 kb fig 4 a as shown by plasmid replicon analysis it belongs to the incx4 group and has three mges two adjacent is2 and one is26 the mcr 1 gene is often associated with isapl1 but this is absent from phm1 5 notably the same e coli hm001 has an incn plasmid phm1 3 57 807 kb that contains bla ndm 1 and shares 100 query coverage and 99 sequence identity to phkn 2 of k pneumoniae hkn fig s2 this suggests the exchange of largs positive plasmids by intergenus transfer two mcr 1 harbouring plasmids phm16 1 and phm16 3 coexisted in an isolated e coli hm016 they have divergent length at 213 7 and 61 277 kb respectively compared with other mcr 1 harbouring plasmids phm16 1is a relatively large plasmid that belongs to the inchi2 group and has one completed isapl1 the plasmid phw16 3 is nearly identical to phz001 genbank accession no mn476093 isolated from a river by our research group zhu et al 2020b both characterized by a single truncated isapl1 δisapl1 the brig analysis shows that they only have two genes of difference the similarity between phw16 1 and phnshp45 from strains derived from livestock pig liu et al 2016 genbank accession no kp347127 was also been observed fig s3 intriguingly we also found mcr 1 in the chromosome of e coli hm019 despite having been reported as rare li et al 2018 the fact that this gene was identified both in chromosomes and plasmids in the same environment indicates that it may be transmitted to descendants or other bacteria surprisingly despite the low relative abundance of mcr 1 detected by qpcr four types of mcr 1 genetic arrangements were all identified in our strains these four types as shown by alignment analysis are mcr 1 pap2 mcr 1 pap2 isapl1 δisapl1 mcr 1 pap2 and δisapl1 mcr 1 pap2 δisapl1 δtn6330 in isolated strains which contained absent or truncated or complete isapl1 element flanking the mcr 1 gene fig 4d in one earlier study the mcr 1 positive contigs were classified into type a phnshp45 like plasmid b phnshp45 2 like plasmid c chromosome borne mcr 1 and d incx4 like plasmid wang et al 2017d all of these types were detected in our study all of the previously published genetic arrangements have been identified in the hwts effluent suggesting that these are important reservoirs of mcr 1 contributing to its acquisition and evolution indeed the element isapl1 and neighboring iss consist an efficient vehicle for mcr 1 propagation we established the coexistence of two mcr 1 harboring plasmids or one mcr 1 harboring plasmid and a bla ndm 1 harboring one in a single e coli strain the high co occurrence of largs positive plasmids may accelerate the dissemination of largs and elevate the risk both in the clinic and the environment in addition except for phm16 3 the above plasmids and chromosome carried several args therefore all identified strains were multidrug resistant tet x is an antibiotic inactivating monooxygenase that confers resistance against to clinically relevant tetracyclines including tigecycline eravacycline and omadacycline gasparrini et al 2020 in e coli ht001 the tet x4 harboring plasmid pht1 1 is 176 523 kb in size with an average g c content of 45 8 and contains two additional args adda2 and lnu g fig 5 a table 1 based on replicon analysis the plasmidfinder analysis revealed that pht1 1 is a novel inchi1a incfia inchi1b hybrid plasmid featuring three types of plasmid backbones this suggests the evolutionary modification of the tet x gene under special selective pressure which might have significantly contributed to a growing collection of tet x positive plasmids with known replicon sequences wang et al 2017a the linear comparison of the reported tet x4 carrying plasmids where tet x4 is adjacent to two copies of iscr2 in p47ec pig shandong he et al 2019 and plhm10 1 p6 pig jiangxi sun et al 2019 showed that tet x4 is adjacent to only one copy of iscr2 there are two copies of is1 located upstream of tet x4 on pht1 1 fig 5b although iscr2 was also found in pht1 1 there were significant disparities for p47ec and plhm10 1 p6 which came from other previously reported niches this implies the cross environment transfer and constant evolution of largs despite the fact that an alarmingly high number of tet x4 carrying e coli isolates have been identified in livestock the prevalence of tet x4 positive isolates in the clinic or related environments remains rare thus the identification of pht1 1 might become a harbinger for future findings 3 4 function of largs we further conducted in vivo in vitro assays using maldi tof and lc ms to determine how largs positive strains and the gene products ndm mcr 1 and tet x4 contribute to the resistance mechanism proteins ndm and tet x4 from largs positive strains were overexpressed in e coli bl21 and purified fig s4 the enzymatic activity of largs carrying isolates was characterized by the ms data incubation of imipenem for 1 h with purified ndm 1 enzyme fig 6 b or bla ndm 1 carrying k pneumoniae hkn fig s5b produced a hydrolyzed form of the antibiotic m z 256 607 in contrast no such corresponding product was observed in the absence of enzyme or bacteria fig 6a fig s5a the negative control e coli nk5449 produced a single lipid a peak m z 1796 700 however two unique peaks appeared in the conjugants mcr 1 harboring plasmid phm1 5 in e coli nk5449 a bis phosphorylated hexa acylated lipid a m z 1796 222 and ppea 4 or 1 lipid a m z 1919 851 a modified form with an additional pea m z 123 fig 6c 6d two similar peaks were observed in e coli hm016 and e coli hm019 that correspond to lipid a and its modified form ppea 4 or 1 lipid a fig s6 tigecycline produced a peak at 586 3 the addition of purified tet x4 protein its oxygenated form appeared at m z 602 3 fig 6e 6f a similar phenomenon was observed when tetracycline was degraded by e coli ht001 carrying the tet x4 gene fig s7 which confirmed that tet x4 is a monooxygenase the peaks of hydrolyzed and oxygenated products showed that ndm 1 and tet x4 can degrade imipenem and tigecycline respectively the peak m z 1919 in mcr 1 postive e coli suggests resistance to polymyxin via the acquisition of mcr 1 the latter mediates structural alterations of the lipid a moiety in the lps chain the modification of lipid a reduces cell surface negative charge decreasing the affinity between bacteria and cationic polymyxin zhu et al 2020b the in vivo strain and in vitro enzyme reactions revealed the mechanism by which largs mediate resistance 4 conclusion largs harboring clinical strains cause great concern for sanitation and their presence in hospital wastewaters is a major challenge for environmental and human health in summary comprehensive analysis of larg abundance isolates phenotype plasmid genotypes and largs function revealed that hwts is an important reservoir for largs bacteria and plasmids the high abundance co harboring and co transfer of largs are expected to contribute to the emergence of new superbugs research on largs can facilitate possible actions to mitigate their potential spread both in the clinic and in the environment our data highlight hospital wastewaters contain resistomes carrying largs and expand greatly the landscape of largs positive plasmids providing direct evidence of their evolution and transmission the assessment of antibiotic resistance in hospital wastewater especially for last resort antibiotics and largs necessitates setting targeted standards for waste discharge the importance of prudence and careful using and monitoring in this regard cannot be overstressed moreover these largs positive plasmids also need further dynamic tracking to better understand their fate and spread pathway in other niches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

ndm mobile colistin resistance gene mcr and tigecycline resistance gene tet x which confers resistance to carbapenems colistin and tigecycline the presence and significance of largs in hospital wastewater treatment systems hwts have not yet been systematically explored here larg variants were shown to be prevalent both influents and effluents of hwts a total of 989 enterobacteriaceae isolates that confer resistance to last resort antibiotics were collected from effluents and multiple genetic contexts of largs were analyzed largs carrying plasmids were confirmed to show high multidrug phenotypes and transferability we also discovered the co occurrence of plasmids harboring bla ndm 1 and mcr 1 in single escherichia coli as well as e coli hm016 containing two unique mcr 1 carrying plasmids this result might accelerate co dissemination of largs under environmental selection pressure different core genetic arrangements in these strains suggest several evolutionary pathways in hwts the resistance functions of largs were confirmed in vitro and in vivo by mass spectrometry this study provides novel insights into the diversity genetic context and function of critical args in hwts the results raise the concern that largs may further spread into the environment thus more stringent discharge standards and regulations for hospital wastewater are urgently

antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 hospital wastewater is usually discharged directly into urban sewage treatment systems after simple disinfection emmanuel et al 2004 i e what happens in hospitals does not stay in hospitals hocquet et al 2016 increasing awareness of amr pollution in aquatic environments have encouraged studies that assess the presence and coexistence of antibiotics args and arb in hospital wastewater treatment system hwts le et al 2016 paulshus et al 2019 varela et al 2014 wang et al 2017b however the bulk of reports have focused on a mere fraction of frequently detected genes in effluents wang et al 2017b lamba et al 2017 santoro et al 2015 research on untreated hospital wastewater influent and the efficiency of disinfection in hwts especially regarding the genetic content of arb has therefore been limited the world health organization who recently issued a priority list of arb within critical high and medium categories based on the level of threat to human health carbapenem resistant acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae are listed as important pathogens within the priority 1 or critical group willyard 2017 in terms of enterobacteriaceae the dominant carpabenem resistance mechanism observed in both humans and livestock is new delhi metallo β lactamase ndm wang et al 2017d this enzyme is present in a range of strains that infect humans lamba et al 2017 livestock wang et al 2017d and aquatic organisms wang et al 2019 clinical infections caused by ndm producing bacteria are associated with higher nosocomial mortality jager et al 2015 most bacteria resistant to carbapenems are only susceptible to polymyxin and tigecycline in vitro paterson and harris 2016 similarly polymyxin and tigecycline are included in reserve group antibiotics which also are treated as last resort options who 2019 nonetheless the clinical use of these antibiotics is considered to be reduced or even eliminated altogether due to the recent discoveries of two plasmid mediated resistance genes mobile colistin resistance gene mcr liu et al 2016 and mobile tigecycline resistance gene tet x he

have been referred to as last resort args largs mobile amr mechanisms including tet x mcr and ndm therefore a comprise a plasmid mediated antibiotic crisis sun et al 2019 the rapid emergence and increase in high risk bacteria breaking through the defense line of last resort antibiotics provide further evidence of the threat of antibiotic resistance to public health yang et al 2019 this may ultimately render last resort antibiotics therapeutically useless hwts links human activities with the ecological environment and may facilitate the spread of bla ndm mcr and tet x from clinic pathogens to environmental microorganisms the buck of investigations conducted on largs are limited to clinic and livestock liu et al 2016 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2017d integrated data on the pollution levels and genetics of these genes in hwts are still lacking this study indents to make up for shortfall of related research thus a comprehensive investigation of the presence profile and dynamics of largs in hwts is presented we detected 12 largs including 2 bla ndm 5 mcr and 5 tet x gene variants using quantitative real time pcr qpcr the feature and landscape of plasmid in last resort antibiotic resistant strains isolated from hwts effluents were characterized and the functional mechanisms of gene products ndm mcr and tet x were determined by mass spectrometry ms analysis this study assists with the identification of specific routes for crucial args and arb contamination and suggests that these are contained by public health interventions to prevent their diffusion 2

collected at three hospitals high level detection rates were observed for all of the detected genes specifically nearly 100 largs except for tet x5 were identified in all samples by qpcr within the detection limit frequent use of carbapenems in hospitals results in high bacterial selective pressure indeed 90 of the daily load of carbapenemase genes entering municipal wastewater treatment plants comes from clinical wastewater sib et al 2020 the absolute abundance of bla ndm1 15 bla ndm16 gene ranged from 3 13 107 to 1 72 1010 gene copies l in influents and 1 83 106 to 1 72 1010 gene copies l in effluents respectively fig 1 a the average relative abundance range of bla ndm1 15 bla ndm16 range was 1 38 10 2 to4 26 10 3 copies per 16s rrna gene in influents and 2 41 10 3 to 1 21 10 5 copies per 16s rrna gene in effluents fig 1b the detection and quantification of colistin resistance genes is crucial task because they are considered an emerging risk for public health poirel et al 2017 the absolute abundance of mcr 1 mcr 5 gene ranged from 2 03 106 to 1 32 109 gene copies l in influents and 2 56 105 to 9 97 107 gene copies l in effluents respectively the most abundant variant was mcr 5 followed by mcr 3 mcr 2 mcr 4 and mcr 1 which exhibited levels 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of mcr 5 in most samples fig 1c the statistically averaged relative abundance of mcr 1 mcr 5 gene ranged from 3 92 10 6 to 8 70 10 4 copies per 16s rrna gene in influents and 1 73 10 6 to 5 54 10 4 copies per 16s rrna gene in effluents fig 1d the absolute abundance of tet x1 tet x5 gene ranged from 5 62 105 to 3 69 109 gene copies l in influents and 4 77 105 to 8 31 108 gene copies l in effluents respectively the most abundant variant was tet x2 followed by tet x1 tet x4 tet x5 and tet x3 which were 1 4 orders of magnitude less abundant than mcr 5 in most samples fig 1e the relative abundance of tet x1 tet x5 ranged averaged 7 86 10 7 to 1 80 10 2 copies per 16s rrna gene in influents and 4 22 10 7 to 6 49 10 3 copies per 16s rrna gene in effluents fig 1f the effluent samples featured a significantly lower abundance of mcr 1 mcr 2 and tet x1 tet x5 compared with influent samples p 0 01 or p 0 05 most larg variants in influents exhibited significantly higher absolute abundance than those in effluents p 0 05 indicating that chlorine disinfection could effectively reduce the absolute abundance of largs in general the relative abundance of largs decreased in the effluent compared with the influent but this reduction was not significant p 0 05 antibiotics chlorine disinfectants and disinfection by products in hwts might promote the hgt of largs considering that these largs are transferable the hwts harbored abundant largs highlighting the fact that hospital wastewater can be a major conduit for transferring largs into the environment this finding might be an indication of the threat posed by hwts effluent on the dissemination of these args in the receiving water 3 2 phenotypes of larg borne bacteria the qpcr data revealed that largs are prevalent in both influents and effluents although they are reduced after chlorine disinfection many strains harboring these genes are still present in effluents a total of 989 isolates conferring resistance to last resort antibiotics were obtained from the effluents in hwts of these 126 isolates were determined to carry largs by pcr and sanger sequencing and six representative bacteria were selected for further inspection the mlst analysis revealed that these bacteria belonged to six distinct sts st 2 e coli hen st 11 k pneumonia hkn st 632 e coli hm001 st 649 e coli hm016 st 638 e coli hm019 and st 21 e coli ht001 table 1 this demonstrates that the isolates used in this study are not clonal it is noteworthy that bla ndm 1 positive k pneumonia hkn corresponds to the st11 type which was firstly found in severe patients in intensive care unit icu gu et al 2018 these strains have disseminated across various regions and are hypervirulent multidrug resistant highly transmissible and cause fatal pneumonia in patients gu et al 2018 the fact that this strain from icu is also found in effluents suggests that chlorination is not effective enough and it carried a high risk of spreading both in hospital settings and in the community isolates e coli hen and k pneumonia hkn from hospital wastewater exhibited high levels of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics with mics of imipenem at 1024 mg l and 512 mg l respectively mics of polymyxin b for e coli hm001 e coli hm016 and e coli hm019 were 16 8 and 32 mg l respectively the mics of tigecycline for e coli ht001 was 32 mg l fig 2 a bacteria that carry ndm mcr and tet x are resistant to high concentrations antibiotics therefore reliable detection surveillance and control are imperative the conjugative transfer frequency was used to evaluate the transferability of largs among bacteria the results showed that last resort antibiotic resistance could be successfully transferred from isolated strains into the laboratory strain e coli nk5449 the attained conjugative transfer frequencies of phen 3 phkn 2 phm1 5 phm16 1 phm16 3 pht1 1 were 3 38 10 5 3 04 10 6 8 79 10 6 2 41 10 6 and 4 00 10 5 respectively fig 2b given the high transferability the spread largs carrying plasmids had the potential to create truly pan drug or multi drug resistant strains leading to untreatable infections sun et al 2019 3 3 plasmids and chromosomal landscape of largs in isolated strains complete maps of seven representative larg carrying plasmids and one chromosomes were identified to dissect the genetic environment of bla ndm mcr and tet x in isolated strains table 1 the carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae cre mediated by ndm occurs widely in hospital and community infections therefore its high abundance in hwts was not unexpected two plasmids the bla ndm 5 carrying phen 3 and bla ndm 1 carrying phkn 2 were found in k pneumonia and e coli isolates respectively results show that the e coli hen contains three plasmids as shown in fig 3 a phen 3 carries bla ndm 5 and is 46 161 kb long with an average g c content of 46 65 numerous genes in this plasmid are associated with transfer parts such as mges iss transposases and type iv secretion system gene cluster vir the surrounding genetic environment of bla ndm 5 and bleomycin resistance gene ble mbl are successive mges upstream tn3 is3000 isaba125 is5 downstream is26 iskox3 these also indicate the high transferability of arg the k pneumonia hkn contains plasmids phkn 2 and phkn kpc which are 53 134 and 143 896 kb long respectively their genetic maps were visualized by snapgene fig 3b fig s1 larg bla ndm 1 is located on phkn 2 in addition to the type iv secretion system gene cluster vir sporadic other transfer genes like tra and pil were detected on phkn 2 there are 10 different mges on phkn 2 one of them inti1 is supposed to be a good proxy for pollution and associated with genes conferring resistance to antibiotics disinfectants and heavy metals gillings et al 2015 the plasmid phkn kpc has a gc content of 53 51 and is a hybrid of two plasmids it belongs to the incompatibility group incfii incr and further to the important carbapenem arg bla kpc 2 it carries other args such as bla tem 1 bla ctx m 65 cata2 rmtb1 and fosa3 table 1 fig s4 each arg is surrounded by a series of mges which indicates their high propagation potential an entire set of mercury resistance operon meracdptr was present in phkn kpc plasmids harboring antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes may ensure that bacteria survive under hostile environments he et al 2017 the backbones of phen 3 and phkn 2 are entirely different 9 query coverage and the surrounding mges of bla ndm are also dissimilar fig 3c the presence of three adjacent genes or elements is3000 δisaba125 δis5 upstream to bla ndm has been reported for phen 3 in e coli from chinese poultry wang et al 2017c as well as in k pneumoniae from an australian traveler espedido et al 2015 the core genetics of bla ndm on phkn 2 share no similarity with these reported plasmids wang et al 2017d it is also the case that mcr variants have been detected in animal human and natural environments overall the most prevalent among ten mobile colistin resistance genes was mcr 1 shen et al 2020 in this study three mcr 1 positive e coli strains were dissected in e coli hm001 the co existence of plasmids phm1 5 and phm1 3 is detected which harbor mcr 1 and bla ndm 1 respectively the plasmid mcr 1 carrying phm1 5 is much smaller than the other plasmids and has a simple backbone 34 643 kb fig 4 a as shown by plasmid replicon analysis it belongs to the incx4 group and has three mges two adjacent is2 and one is26 the mcr 1 gene is often associated with isapl1 but this is absent from phm1 5 notably the same e coli hm001 has an incn plasmid phm1 3 57 807 kb that contains bla ndm 1 and shares 100 query coverage and 99 sequence identity to phkn 2 of k pneumoniae hkn fig s2 this suggests the exchange of largs positive plasmids by intergenus transfer two mcr 1 harbouring plasmids phm16 1 and phm16 3 coexisted in an isolated e coli hm016 they have divergent length at 213 7 and 61 277 kb respectively compared with other mcr 1 harbouring plasmids phm16 1is a relatively large plasmid that belongs to the inchi2 group and has one completed isapl1 the plasmid phw16 3 is nearly identical to phz001 genbank accession no mn476093 isolated from a river by our research group zhu et al 2020b both characterized by a single truncated isapl1 δisapl1 the brig analysis shows that they only have two genes of difference the similarity between phw16 1 and phnshp45 from strains derived from livestock pig liu et al 2016 genbank accession no kp347127 was also been observed fig s3 intriguingly we also found mcr 1 in the chromosome of e coli hm019 despite having been reported as rare li et al 2018 the fact that this gene was identified both in chromosomes and plasmids in the same environment indicates that it may be transmitted to descendants or other bacteria surprisingly despite the low relative abundance of mcr 1 detected by qpcr four types of mcr 1 genetic arrangements were all identified in our strains these four types as shown by alignment analysis are mcr 1 pap2 mcr 1 pap2 isapl1 δisapl1 mcr 1 pap2 and δisapl1 mcr 1 pap2 δisapl1 δtn6330 in isolated strains which contained absent or truncated or complete isapl1 element flanking the mcr 1 gene fig 4d in one earlier study the mcr 1 positive contigs were classified into type a phnshp45 like plasmid b phnshp45 2 like plasmid c chromosome borne mcr 1 and d incx4 like plasmid wang et al 2017d all of these types were detected in our study all of the previously published genetic arrangements have been identified in the hwts effluent suggesting that these are important reservoirs of mcr 1 contributing to its acquisition and evolution indeed the element isapl1 and neighboring iss consist an efficient vehicle for mcr 1 propagation we established the coexistence of two mcr 1 harboring plasmids or one mcr 1 harboring plasmid and a bla ndm 1 harboring one in a single e coli strain the high co occurrence of largs positive plasmids may accelerate the dissemination of largs and elevate the risk both in the clinic and the environment in addition except for phm16 3 the above plasmids and chromosome carried several args therefore all identified strains were multidrug resistant tet x is an antibiotic inactivating monooxygenase that confers resistance against to clinically relevant tetracyclines including tigecycline eravacycline and omadacycline gasparrini et al 2020 in e coli ht001 the tet x4 harboring plasmid pht1 1 is 176 523 kb in size with an average g c content of 45 8 and contains two additional args adda2 and lnu g fig 5 a table 1 based on replicon analysis the plasmidfinder analysis revealed that pht1 1 is a novel inchi1a incfia inchi1b hybrid plasmid featuring three types of plasmid backbones this suggests the evolutionary modification of the tet x gene under special selective pressure which might have significantly contributed to a growing collection of tet x positive plasmids with known replicon sequences wang et al 2017a the linear comparison of the reported tet x4 carrying plasmids where tet x4 is adjacent to two copies of iscr2 in p47ec pig shandong he et al 2019 and plhm10 1 p6 pig jiangxi sun et al 2019 showed that tet x4 is adjacent to only one copy of iscr2 there are two copies of is1 located upstream of tet x4 on pht1 1 fig 5b although iscr2 was also found in pht1 1 there were significant disparities for p47ec and plhm10 1 p6 which came from other previously reported niches this implies the cross environment transfer and constant evolution of largs despite the fact that an alarmingly high number of tet x4 carrying e coli isolates have been identified in livestock the prevalence of tet x4 positive isolates in the clinic or related environments remains rare thus the identification of pht1 1 might become a harbinger for future findings 3 4 function of largs we further conducted in vivo in vitro assays using maldi tof and lc ms to determine how largs positive strains and the gene products ndm mcr 1 and tet x4 contribute to the resistance mechanism proteins ndm and tet x4 from largs positive strains were overexpressed in e coli bl21 and purified fig s4 the enzymatic activity of largs carrying isolates was characterized by the ms data incubation of imipenem for 1 h with purified ndm 1 enzyme fig 6 b or bla ndm 1 carrying k pneumoniae hkn fig s5b produced a hydrolyzed form of the antibiotic m z 256 607 in contrast no such corresponding product was observed in the absence of enzyme or bacteria fig 6a fig s5a the negative control e coli nk5449 produced a single lipid a peak m z 1796 700 however two unique peaks appeared in the conjugants mcr 1 harboring plasmid phm1 5 in e coli nk5449 a bis phosphorylated hexa acylated lipid a m z 1796 222 and ppea 4 or 1 lipid a m z 1919 851 a modified form with an additional pea m z 123 fig 6c 6d two similar peaks were observed in e coli hm016 and e coli hm019 that correspond to lipid a and its modified form ppea 4 or 1 lipid a fig s6 tigecycline produced a peak at 586 3 the addition of purified tet x4 protein its oxygenated form appeared at m z 602 3 fig 6e 6f a similar phenomenon was observed when tetracycline was degraded by e coli ht001 carrying the tet x4 gene fig s7 which confirmed that tet x4 is a monooxygenase the peaks of hydrolyzed and oxygenated products showed that ndm 1 and tet x4 can degrade imipenem and tigecycline respectively the peak m z 1919 in mcr 1 postive e coli suggests resistance to polymyxin via the acquisition of mcr 1 the latter mediates structural alterations of the lipid a moiety in the lps chain the modification of lipid a reduces cell surface negative charge decreasing the affinity between bacteria and cationic polymyxin zhu et al 2020b the in vivo strain and in vitro enzyme reactions revealed the mechanism by which largs mediate resistance 4 conclusion largs harboring clinical strains cause great concern for sanitation and their presence in hospital wastewaters is a major challenge for environmental and human health in summary comprehensive analysis of larg abundance isolates phenotype plasmid genotypes and largs function revealed that hwts is an important reservoir for largs bacteria and plasmids the high abundance co harboring and co transfer of largs are expected to contribute to the emergence of new superbugs research on largs can facilitate possible actions to mitigate their potential spread both in the clinic and in the environment our data highlight hospital wastewaters contain resistomes carrying largs and expand greatly the landscape of largs positive plasmids providing direct evidence of their evolution and transmission the assessment of antibiotic resistance in hospital wastewater especially for last resort antibiotics and largs necessitates setting targeted standards for waste discharge the importance of prudence and careful using and monitoring in this regard cannot be overstressed moreover these largs positive plasmids also need further dynamic tracking to better understand their fate and spread pathway in other niches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

science and engineering tongji university shanghai 200092 china state key laboratory of pollution control and resources reuse college of environmental science and engineering tongji university shanghai 200092 china corresponding author thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp can effectively remove the antibiotic resistance genes args from sewage sludge but the rebounding effects in the subsequent anaerobic fermentation are often observed the purpose of this study was to elucidate the distribution and fate of intracellular and extracellular args iargs and eargs in the sludge acidogenic fermentation process coupled with thp our results revealed that thp significantly reduced the absolute abundance of total args in raw sludge but increased eargs by 0 3 1 4 log units under practical conditions 140 c for 30 min there is no significant difference in the removal of total args between the two acidogenic fermenters receiving raw and hydrolyzed sludge with iargs prevailing in the produced biosolids the succession of bacterial community and the co occurrence relationships among arg type mobile genetic elements and bacterial taxa were observed suggesting a phylogenetic basis for the iargs patterns in fermented sludge however eargs were susceptible to biodegradation with a half life of 2 34 h and they contributed limitedly to the args propagation through transformation these findings suggest an emphasis on the mitigation of iargs during the acidogenic fermentation of sludge which would be achieved by lowering the richness and physicochemical destruction of potential hosts graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp acidogenic fermentation antibiotic resistance genes args bacterial community 1 introduction antibiotic resistance has become a global crisis and leads to higher medical costs prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality blaser 2016 meanwhile the increasing kinds of anthropogenic antibiotic resistance genes args are discovered in aquatic ecosystems su et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 as an essential link between human activities and the ecosystem wastewater treatment plants wwtps act as both a barrier and a hotspot for args dissemination guo et al 2017 as a result the args in the effluent can be effectively removed chen and zhang 2013 ju et al 2019 but the remaining args are finally concentrated in the waste activated sludge which is considered one of the most important reservoirs of args ju et al 2016 the final disposal of sludge e g land application may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance in indigenous organisms and the horizontal dissemination between non pathogenic and pathogenic organisms although the risk assessments of the public health remain unclear looft et al 2012 xie et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 therefore the effective treatment of sewage sludge for mitigating the spread of args is necessary and significant acidogenic fermentation of sludge has attracted increasing interest and become a promising technology for more valuable products such as volatile fatty acids vfas lee et al 2014 sludge derived vfas can be utilized on site as the external carbon source which accounts for 50 70 of the overall operating cost of the biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes in wwtps however the hydrolysis stage has been reported as the rate limiting step during fermentation because the particulate organics and flocculants are more resistant to hydrolysis thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp has been primarily utilized to increase waste solubilization and an increasing trend is towards its application for the enhanced acidogenic fermentation process hosseini koupaie et al 2021 on the other hand thp is effective for the elimination of args because the dna is susceptible to hydrolytic destruction especially under high temperature and pressure ma et al 2011 pei et al 2016 nevertheless the subsequent anaerobic fermentation is not satisfactory and the rebound of the total absolute abundance of args was observed in many studies ma et al 2011 wang et al 2019 this may result in the potential spread of args when the fermentation products i e vfas were directly used as a carbon source for biological processes in wwpts few literatures attributed the args rebounding to the bacterial community composition ma et al 2011 sun et al 2019 impelling us to further explore the reason behind in fact the sludge structure is very complex the fate of args is usually determined by the distribution of args i e being present as intracellular dna idna and extracellular dna edna during the anaerobic fermentation following thp thp can affect the fate of args through two aspects i the release of the intracellular args iargs and ii the hydrolytic degradation of both iargs and extracellular args eargs although the significant removal of total args can be obtained through thp the destruction of the cell wall and the release of intracellular genetic material always occur under practical conditions 140 160 c for 30 min pei et al 2016 resulting in the conversion of iargs to eargs therefore there may exist different fates of iargs and eargs during the subsequent anaerobic fermentation process the vertical transmission through specific lineages and the horizontal transfer through mobile genetic elements mges allows for iargs spread ju et al 2019 found that wwtp resistomes are shaped by bacterial composition and genetic exchange indicating the fate of iargs would be determined by the succession of the bacterial community on the other hand the released eargs would interact with colloidal sludge structure thus protecting them against biodegradation cai et al 2006 it has been reported that edna can often persist in soils and sediments for months mao et al 2014 zhu 2006 furthermore considering that the released eargs carriers would still possess biological activity it is hypothesized that a high density of microorganisms would enhance iargs abundance by promoting the uptake of eargs and genetic transformation across bacteria despite some important observations of the args fate in the anaerobic fermentation of thermally pretreated sludge sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019 xue et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 we are not aware of any studies that systematically investigated the distribution and fate of both iargs and eargs in the sludge fermentation process coupled with thp and that explored the relevant mechanisms explaining the performance of arg removal in the biological treatment system the aim of this study was to provide insights into the distribution and fate of iargs and eargs as well as the microbiome in the sludge fermentation process coupled with thp the release of typical args under different thp temperatures was characterized and the performance of iargs and eargs removal in the subsequent acidogenic fermentation process was evaluated the persistence and the potential transformation of eargs were further investigated we hypothesized that i thp would increase the release of eargs with temperature ii no significant improvement of args removal would be observed in the acidogenic fermentation following thp iii the succession of the bacterial community would determine the fate of iargs and iv the released eargs would persist and propagate through transformation under anaerobic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment and acidogenic fermentation of sludge the tested waste activated sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge from a municipal wwtp in shanghai china were collected and used as raw sludge rs and seed sludge respectively the physicochemical characteristics of rs and seed sludge are shown in table s1 the thp experiment was a completely randomized design with five treatments untreated control and thermal hydrolysis with different temperatures of 100 140 160 and 180 c each replicated three times the experimental unit was a 300 ml hydrolysis reactor consisting of an inner container and a stainless steel vessel cai et al 2020 a raw sludge sample of 150 g wet weight was transferred into each internal container the reactor was then carefully sealed and heated to the target temperature in an electric oven the reaction was thought to start when the oven reached the preset temperature and the reaction duration was 30 min after the reactors were cooled to room temperature taking 60 90 min depending on the reaction temperature the hydrolysate samples were collected for edna idna extraction and physicochemical properties analysis the acidogenic fermentation experiment was a repeated measures design with two treatments fermentation fed by rs and by hydrolyzed sludge hs each replicated three times the experimental unit was a 250 ml anaerobic bottle filled with 150 ml mixtures of seed sludge and two types of substrates rs and hs the hs was collected as the substrate after raw sludge was hydrolyzed at 140 c for 30 min the suggested condition in practice dwyer et al 2008 the ratio of substrates to inoculum was at two depending on volatile solid vs content the total solid ts of the resulting mixture for the fermentation process was adjusted to 1 5 using deionized water the ph value of each bottle was neutralized to 7 0 using hcl or naoh to improve the comparability of acidogenic performance 0 1 w w of 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes was added to the mixture for blocking the methane production process luo et al 2014 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2010 before the experiment nitrogen gas was used to replace the air from the headspace of the reactor for 5 min all the bottles were carefully capped and incubated in an air bath shaker 120 r min at 37 c each bottle was sampled five times during the incubation period at 1 2 4 10 15 d after the bottles were prepared each time edna and idna were extracted from a subsample 5 g taken from each bottle the remainder of idna was then used for 16s rrna gene sequencing representing the composition of the microbial community 2 2 extracellular arg persistence modeling under anaerobic conditions freshly collected fermented sludge approximately 1 1 of ts which was obtained from a batch experiment reactor at the mid term of the third generation stable operation was used to study the persistence of eargs we used plasmid rp4 as the indicator of eargs according to the reference jin et al 2020 the trag like gene products from rp4 are essential for conjugative dna transfer whereby trag protein is thought to couple the relaxosome to the dna transfer apparatus cabezón et al 1997 to further verify or quantify rp4 plasmid the rp4 specific trag like gene was selected according to the previous studies guo et al 2015 soda et al 2008 there are two main processes affecting the persistence of eargs the adsorption by fermented sludge flocs and the degradation by dnases zou et al 2020 to identify how the fermented sludge fraction affected the eargs degradation plasmid rp4 was spiked into fermented sludge i e solid containing samples and its filtrates with solid removed via centrifugation at 10 000 g at 4 c for 15 min followed by filtration through a 0 22 μm membrane solid removed filtrate to compare the adsorption effects two sample pretreatment methods were conducted using the solid containing samples fig s1 solid containing samples were centrifugated and filtered i e solid containing filtrate or freeze dried for dna extraction solid containing total phase the experimental design was presented in table s2 and all the treatments were replicated three times the reaction unit was a 1 5 ml sterile centrifuge tube containing 1 ml of solid removed or solid containing samples the plasmid rp4 was added to achieve the final concentration of 1011 copies g dw of sludge the microcosms were incubated in an air bath shaker 120 r min at 37 c and destructively sampled through 24 h table s2 two strategies were adopted for the trag quantification solid removed or solid containing filtrate was directly used as templates after 103 fold dilution zou et al 2020 while dna in solid containing samples total phase were extracted by a fastdna spin kit for soil 2 3 transformation modeling and transformation assays under anaerobic conditions a 15 day microcosm experiment was used to determine the potential of eargs to transform indigenous bacteria during the acidogenic fermentation based on both culture independent and culture dependent methods the fermented sludge and eargs indicator plasmid rp4 were used as described above two treatments containing antibiotics ampicillin kanamycin and tetracycline of 50 25 and 5 mg l or not were used for microcosms amended with the rp4 plasmid the microcosm unit was a 4 ml sterile tube filled with 2 ml fermented sludge the plasmid rp4 1011 copies g dw was then added into all but the control microcosms the air from the headspace of the tubes was replaced by nitrogen gas all the microcosms were immediately sealed and then incubated at 37 c and 120 r min the microcosms were destructively sampled at 1 3 7 and 15 d each microcosm unit was divided into two subsamples for the culture independent method bacterial idna was extracted from the periodic subsamples for detecting the trag gene copy number for the culture dependent method an aliquot of 100 μl obtained from properly diluted subsamples was spread on two types of solid medium both containing 100 mg l ampicillin 50 mg l kanamycin and 10 mg l tetracyclines luria bertani lb solid plates were prepared and incubated under aerobic condition at 37 c for 24 h while anaerobic culture plates constituents referring to table s3 were prepared and incubated under anaerobic condition at 37 c for 48 h using an anaerobic workstation electrotek uk after incubation the colonies on the antibiotic plates were counted and randomly selected for transformants verification and bacteria identification 2 4 edna idna extraction of sludge arg quantification and illumina sequencing the reported method was utilized to extract edna and idna from sludge dong et al 2019 mao et al 2014 with minor modification 2 5 g wet weight of sludge samples was added 0 2 g of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone pvpp aladdin co and washed three times using 4 ml of 0 12 m sodium phosphate buffer at ph 8 0 each time the mixture was shaken at 250 r min for 10 min at 25 c followed by centrifugation at 10 000 r min for 10 min at 4 c the merged supernatants were filtered through a sterile membrane 0 22 μm pvdf and the edna in the filtrate was extracted using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide ctab corinaldesi et al 2005 a validation experiment was conducted to test the occurrence of cell lysis during edna extraction pseudomonas putida kt2440 carrying mcherry that was not present in sludge was added to sludge in advance and subjected to the whole edna extraction process zou et al 2020 we found no detection of mcherry in extracted edna implying no cross contamination during extraction of edna and idna after the edna extraction the cell pellets were lyophilized for extracting idna using a fastdna spin kit for soil quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was conducted using lightcycler 96 roche basel switzerland to quantify nine representative args including genes conferring resistance to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 macrolides ermf erea and mefa aminoglycosides strb tetracyclines tetg and tetx and beta lactams blashv other genes including 16s rrna gene integrase gene of class i integron inti1 conjugative transposon gene tn916 and rp4 specific trag like gene were also determined the qpcr protocol conditions were performed as previously described ma et al 2011 each 10 μl qpcr reaction contained 5 μl of sybr green master mix 0 6 μl of forward and reverse primers 0 3 μl of each at 100 μm 0 2 μl of dna template or sterile water no template control and 4 2 μl of sterile ddh2o standard curves were conducted in triplicate it was noted that the amplification efficiency for the blashv gene was low 76 2 while the rest of the detected genes showed amplification efficiencies ranging from 87 8 to 111 3 all the results were shown to provide the real patterns the additional details on qpcr reactions are provided in table s4 and table s5 the diversity of intracellular microorganisms was determined using amplicon sequencing at the v3 v4 regions of 16s rrna gene the amplification was conducted according to the previous study cai et al 2019 and amplification products were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform lc bio co hangzhou china microbiome analysis was conducted through qiime 2 platform 2020 11 bolyen et al 2019 raw sequence data were demultiplexed and quality filtered using the q2 demux plugin followed by denoising with dada2 callahan et al 2016 via q2 dada2 microbial taxonomy was assigned to the non redundant features using a naïve bayes classifier against the greengenes 13 8 99 otus reference sequences mcdonald et al 2012 sequences were deposited in the china national gene bank database cngbdb https db cngb org under the project accession number cnp0002287 2 5 genomic dna extraction of colonies pcr gel electrophoresis and bacteria identification in order to verify that the colonies on the antibiotic plates carried the pr4 plasmid transformants were randomly selected at least eight colonies from each treatment condition genomes of the colonies extracted using e z n a bacterial dna kit omega bio tek usa the trag gene

sequencing for the pcr products of 16s rrna gene amplification was performed almost full length 16s rrna gene sequences were uploaded to ncbi for bacteria identification 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using rstudio software version 4 0 3 comparison of released eargs among different thermal hydrolysis temperatures as well as the transformation effects of eargs was analyzed by one way anova with tukey hsd post hoc test the absolute and relative abundance of args in the fermentation process was calculated with repeated measures analysis of variance ranova spearman s rank correlation test detected correlations between bacterial diversity and functional gene abundance the rate constants of the first order kinetic equation and half lives were calculated to compare the eargs persistence in the fermented sludge network analysis was conducted according to ju and zhang 2015 a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating all pairwise spearman s correlation coefficients using the absolute abundance of args and microbial features with false discovery rate control glickman et al 2014 the absolute abundance of each microbial feature was calculated by the relative abundance of microbial feature multiplied by the 16s rrna gene copy number determined by qpcr the robust correlations p value 0 01 and spearman s rho 0 80 were visualized in gephi version 0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal hydrolysis pretreatment increased the loading of extracellular args followed by sludge fermentation the effects of thp on dna distribution are shown in table 1 the concentration of idna decreased from 338 6 μg g of untreated sludge to 6 6 μg g of hydrolyzed sludge at 180 c while edna content showed the initial increase and subsequent decrease with the thp temperature for example compared with the edna of untreated sludge 12 4 μg g the highest amount of edna 29 2 μg g was obtained at the thp temperature of 140 c with the ratio of edna to total dna tdna reaching 61 6 much higher than that of the untreated sludge 3 5 pei et al similarly observed that thp at 170 c for 30 min increased the dna content in sludge supernatant by about three folds pei et al 2016 these results revealed that thp could break cell walls and release intracellular dna into the liquid phase pei et al 2016 yang et al 2020 additionally thp showed a good performance of dna degradation and the removal rate of tdna was 86 5 at the temperature of 140 c which is attributed to the susceptibility of dna to hydrolytic destruction ma et al 2011 when thp temperature exceeded 160 c no significant enhancement of tdna removal was observed which was likely a result of the protection of dna by the released organics in the supernatant table 1 xue et al 2021 typical args and mges were detected in both the idna and edna extracts from the untreated and hydrolyzed sludge samples fig 1 in untreated sludge samples the args and mges in idna were usually 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in the corresponding edna which coincided with previous studies dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 every gram of sludge dw contained from 4 0 105 to 7 4 107 copies of eargs and 6 9 106 to 2 4 1010 copies of iargs fig 1 thp significantly reduced the absolute abundance of iargs and imges p 0 05 with the range of reduction from 0 7 to 3 8 log units at the thp temperature of 140 c however the abundance of most of the extracellular genes was raised to the maximum by 0 3 1 4 log units at this thp condition showing an increase of eargs loadings in the subsequent fermentation process importantly the relative abundance of args args 16s rrna genes in idna and edna were comparable but the lowest points were mainly observed at the temperature of 140 c the decrease of the relative abundance was likely due to the differential degradation of various dna molecules no matter whether they were released from bacterial cells it was found that chromosomal dna is more adsorptive than plasmid dna poly et al 2000 and the organic matter could protect dna from degradation in the environment aardema et al 1983 cai et al 2006 romanowski et al 1991 suggesting that the chromosomal 16s rrna genes may be better preserved by the organic matter or particles in the sludge than usually plasmid borne args such as sul1 erea and inti1 for further raising the thp temperature the potential protection of chromosomal dna would be destroyed by the high pressure and temperature leading to the rebound of relative abundance 3 2 log removal of total args in sludge fermentation was not impacted by the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp condition at the temperature of 140 c was selected to investigate the subsequent fermentation process because it meets the temperature range usually used in practice dwyer et al 2008 and results in a maximum release of eargs in this study where any significant effects of sludge fermentation would be observed high production of vfas 221 mg g vsadded was observed in the fermenter receiving hydrolyzed sludge fig s2 and the performance of acidogenic fermentation was in line with the previous studies hosseini koupaie et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 indicating the acidogenic fermentation was well conducted it was also noted that the depressing ph was not observed at the final stage of the acidogenic fermentation process showing the good buffer capacity of the system fed by sludge thp significantly reduced the loadings of iargs at the initial phase of sludge fermentation p 0 05 fig 2 the advantage of loading differential in the hs feeding fermenter however faded away as the fermentation process which is consistent with the trend of intracellular 16s rrna gene fig s3 at the end of fermentation there was no significant difference in the absolute abundance of iargs between two produced biosolids p 0 05 indicating that the net changes in concentration of iargs in the biological treatment system were not impacted by thp wang et al 2019 however two fermenters fed by rs and hs performed variously according to the individual iarg type table s6 in both fermenters the intracellular sul1 erea tetg blashv and 16s rrna genes were significantly decreased p 0 05 at a similar level the representative exceptions were ermf and tn916 ermf enriched after fermentation much higher in hs feeding fermenter than that in the rs feeding fermenter ma et al 2011 similarly observed that the ermf gene in the effluent of the mesophilic digester with and without thp was both observed to rebound over that in the feed sludge studies attributed the rebound effect following a pretreatment to the fact that the microbial community composition in the biosystem dominates the behavior of args ma et al 2011 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019 seed culture likely drove the arg distribution and concentration when using hs as the substrate further support for the importance of bacterial community composition is the inverse impacts between two treatments tn916 was removed by 30 5 in rs feeding fermenter but increased by more than four folds in hs feeding fermenter table s6 in both fermenters the fermentation process significantly decreased the total eargs content p 0 05 ranova although thp increased the initial concentration of eargs by almost three folds fig 2 all the eargs in the produced biosolids were effectively removed in the range from 0 6 to 3 4 log units table s6 it was noted that the fermented sludge receiving rs had lower contents of eargs and 16s rrna gene than fermented sludge fed by hs p 0 05 ranova fig 2 and fig s3 suggesting that components in the sludge hydrolysate could provide stronger protection of eargs from degradation by dnase compared with untreated sludge generally the concentrations of total eargs at the final stage of fermentation were 1 0 105 and 4 6 105 copies g dw much lower than that of total iargs in the two fermenters indicating earg limitedly contributed to the total args in the fermented sludge when both iargs and eargs were normalized to 16s rrna genes the effects of two fermenters on args maintained a similar trend and no significant difference was observed p 0 05 ranova fig 2 suggesting that the thp did not increase or decrease the selective pressure of antibiotic resistance on the fermentative bacteria 3 3 functional bacterial phylogeny was the driver in shaping intracellular args studies have found that the resistomes are shaped by bacterial composition in the wastewater or sludge treatment system ju et al 2019 su et al 2015 sun et al 2019 but edna can induce bias of microbial community dynamic analysis when cell lysis is caused by thp yang et al 2020 here we used intracellular dna to improve the precision of microbial community analysis in response to sludge fermentation thp significantly affected the alpha diversity shannon index p 0 05 fig s4 and marked shifts in microbial composition community were observed fig s5 the bacterial phylum of proteobacteria decreased but firmicutes increased in the hs feeding fermenter compared with the fermenter receiving rs fig s5 which were in line with the previous reports wang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 it was also noted that some arg types significantly correlated to the bacterial diversity such as ermf spearman rho 0 83 p 0 01 and strb spearman rho 0 58 p 0 01 based on shannon index table s7 ju et al found that bacterial alpha diversity metrics shannon index explained 29 4 of variances in the effluent args ju et al 2019 indicating the importance of bacterial richness and evenness on args we further investigated the profiles of potential functional bacteria in fermented sludge fed by rs and hs thp significantly enriched the fermentative bacteria fig s6 e g blvii28 and longilinea accelerating the rate limiting step of hydrolysis of organic matter however the removal of potential pathogen did not perform better in the hs feeding fermenter fig s6 indicating these bacteria shared ecological niches with the fermentative bacteria rather than potential pathogenicity the co occurrence patterns among iargs and functional bacteria were explored using networking analysis which has been widely used to underline the interaction association among microbial entities forsberg et al 2014 ju et al 2016 ju and zhang 2015 as shown in fig 3 a 342 pairs i e edges of significant and strong correlations are identified among 55 bacterial features and 9 arg types the network modules eight major modules labeled from module i to viii are also described in fig 3b and an absolute abundance browse of microbial entities within each module reveals clusters i e enrichment e g module viii or demise i e decrease e g module vii during sludge fermentation here two associations of microbial entities are focused and predicted by the co occurrence network arg arg and arg bacteria in arg arg associations co occurrence patterns were displayed within or across arg types on the one hand the occurrence of the same arg type i e intra type conferring resistance to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 or macrolides ermf and mefa was observed this is due to the selective pressure exerted by the same antibiotics in the fermented sludge on the other hand the occurrence patterns of different arg types i e inter types were also observed for example aminoglycosides strb and tetracyclines tetx were the different arg types showing the co occurring event this may be explained by the co resistance mechanism for co selection i e different resistance determinants located together on the same genetic elements such as plasmid baker austin et al 2006 cross resistance can also occur when different antimicrobial agents attack the same target zhao et al found that cephalexin and kanamycin tended to co select mainly multidrug resistance genes zhao et al 2020 in arg bacteria associations we assume that the biological origin of an arg bacteria co occurring event in the intracellular environment is from a hosting relationship based on the network analysis it is speculated that the ermf gene was considered as a hub arg i e high degree nodes with a high number of connections with 13 connections to bacteria and one connection to args table s8 indicating a generalist arg with a wide range of potential bacterial hosts chung et al have found that the host range of the ermf gene is extended in bacteria of both human and animal origin chung et al 1999 compared with other erm genes ermf is easily transferred to a recipient by conjugation chung et al 1999 hu et al 2012 this justifies our results of co occurrence between ermf and tn916 conjugative transposon gene indicating the importance of horizontal gene transfer on the iargs dissemination during sludge fermentation furthermore the segregated modules v and vii fig 3b purple vs green are both connected to the ermf gene suggesting that the dissemination of ermf could be favored or inhibited across two distinct ecological niches two bacterial genera i e blvii28 and nitrospira were found to be the potential contributors of the ermf gene but their abundance showed an inverse trend fig 3 and fig s6 the remarkable enrichment of blvii28 a sludge group commonly found in anaerobic waste treatment systems lefevre et al 2019 was observed fig s6 while nitrospira a bacterial hub with 24 node degrees decreased in the hs feeding fermenter table s8 therefore they deserve the foremost research attention because of the capacity for the enrichment and widespread ecological associations during sludge fermentation 3 4 extracellular args were susceptible to degradation rather than propagation through transformation in fermented sludge as previously mentioned thp was capable of releasing eargs into the liquid phase and the subsequent fermentation process performed well for eargs reduction log removal however the complex sludge structure and the background abundances of args covered the underlying fate of eargs during the sludge fermentation here the stability and bacterial assimilation of exogenous eargs pr4 plasmid in fermented sludge were characterized as shown in fig s6a the abundances of the trag gene gradually dropped within 24 h but the first order degradation rate contents k of the three treatments were statistically different p 0 05 fig s6b resulting in different half lives t 1 2 table 2 it was noted that the k value 0 45 h 1 in the sludge filtrate with solid removed solid removed filtrate was higher than that 0 33 h 1 in raw fermented sludge solid containing total phase suggesting a protective role of sludge flocs studies found similar results in the sludge under anaerobic conditions and attributed these to the physical masking of active sites of dnases or target sites of eargs by solids zou et al 2020 moreover we observed the reduction rate 1 30 h 1 of the trag gene in the supernatant of fermented sludge solid containing filtrate was much higher than that in the solid removing filtrate table 2 indicating the occurrence of simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation of free eargs and higher efficiency of free eargs reduction by adsorption than biodegradation more interestingly the added plasmid i e eargs was sharply removed by 2 2 log units in the sludge supernatant at the beginning this is because the added plasmid 1 6 mg dna kg dw sludge is much lower than the adsorption capacities of fermented sludge e g the adsorption capacities of soil colloids reaching 3500 mg dna kg sheng et al 2019 dna molecules could instantaneously penetrate the macropores that spread across the sludge flocs louvet et al 2017 therefore degradation of adsorbed eargs contributed to most of the eargs removal although becoming less accessible to nuclease than free eargs cai et al 2006 the transformation of the extracellular plasmid to indigenous bacteria was observed based on both culture independent and culture dependent methods table 3 and fig 4 the resistant isolates were randomly picked and confirmed with positive detection of the trag gene in the treatments i e spiking pr4 plasmid except for the control however the absolute abundance of the trag gene in idna decreased over time and became undetectable in the fermented sludge table 3 there was no significant difference between the two treatments demonstrating that the presence of antibiotic selective pressure could not enhance the transformation and the following proliferation therefore our hypothesis stating that the released eargs would persist and propagate through transformation under anaerobic conditions was not confirmed as plasmid acquisition is only the first step of plasmid host association the achievement of long term adaption depends on genomic homogenization and subsequent cost amelioration norberg et al 2011 the transformation host range can be inferred including enterococcus colony 11 aciovorax colony 02 and 26 comamonas colony 06 and 17 escherichia colony 04 antinetobacter colony 19 and pseudomonas colony 20 fig 4 while rp4 was predicted to have been evolutionarily present in ralstonia slackia and pseudomonas norberg et al 2011 the succession of functional bacteria may be conducive to regulating arg dissemination when the occasional acquisition of antibiotic resistance occurs through horizontal gene transfer despite the presence of antibiotic selection pressure in the culture dependent experiment we found that antibiotic resistant bacteria from control appeared on the selection plates 6 1 103 cfu ml and the trag gene extracted from isolates was not detected indicating the presence of innate microorganisms conferring multiple resistance in the fermented sludge the sludge derived enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli shigella were confirmed with multiple resistance data not shown although the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria was significantly higher p 0 05 in antibiotic treatment groups than in the nonantibiotic treatment a decreasing trend was found in all the treatments under anaerobic conditions these results revealed that controlling the taxonomic succession in a system may be one way to limit the spread of antibiotic resistance rice et al 2020 4 environmental relevance acidogenic fermentation of sewage sludge for recovery of bioenergy has attracted increasing attention and the produced vfas are considered more valuable than biomethane or biohydrogen lee et al 2014 however most studies focused on maximizing resource recovery hosseini koupaie et al 2021 xu et al 2020 and the mitigation of args dissemination is often unaware the present study revealed the differential responses of iargs and eargs to sludge fermentation following thp although the thp leveled up the eargs loadings in the following fermentation system a high degradation rate and the limited transformation and propagation of eargs were observed these results indicated that an efficient separation process for recovering the fermentation products i e vfas would lower the risks of args dissemination but the remained biosolids need to be carefully considered one of the interesting points is how to mitigate the iargs during the biological fermentation process isolation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and co occurrence analysis preliminarily allowed us to obtain the iargs host range but more iargs host information could be helpful to develop targeted strategies for reducing the proliferation and transfer of iargs in the bioreactors as antibiotic resistance is an ancient and natural phenomenon d costa et al 2011 martínez 2008 it is unrealistic and unnecessary to completely eliminate antibiotic resistance in biological treatments based on the results of the present study the regulation of iargs can be achieved through the following entry points 1 reduction of iargs host range thermophilic fermentation often performed better in args removal than mesophilic fermentation due to the apparent limitations on microbial diversity miller et al 2016 2 physiochemical destruction of host cells post thermal hydrolysis would be an alternative strategy for a hybrid treatment system which can balance the bioenergy recovery and args mitigation cai et al 2021 hosseini koupaie et al 2021 apart from the above mentioned technical methods there is still a lack of relevant knowledge of assessing the risk of iargs and eargs in downstream environments and the link between environmental and clinical resistance 5 conclusions 1 thp significantly decreased the absolute abundance of iargs whereas it would lead to the release of eargs the relative abundance of args showed an initial decrease followed by the increase with the thp temperature indicating differential degradation of various dna molecules 2 although higher loadings of args were found in the fermenter fed by hydrolyzed sludge at the initial stage compared with the fermenter receiving raw sludge there was no significant difference in the absolute abundance of iargs between the two produced biosolids two fermenters showed a similar trend of the relative abundance of args and no significant difference was observed these results revealed that thp had a limited effect on resistance gene removal in the subsequent biological treatment system 3 thp significantly changed the bacterial community composition and enriched the fermentative bacteria co occurrence analysis showed that the ermf gene was considered as a hub iarg and the two functional bacterial genera blvii28 and nitrospira were found to be the potential contributors suggesting a phylogenetic basis for the iargs patterns in fermented sludge 4 after spiking exogenous eargs pr4 plasmid significant biodegradation was observed in the fermented sludge with a half life of 2 34 h despite the confirmation of the bacterial transformation of earg the transformation hosts would not stably propagate under anaerobic conditions these results revealed that eargs contributed limitedly to the resistance dissemination and the mitigation of iargs should be mainly concerned during the anaerobic fermentation of sludge

shanghai 200092 china corresponding author thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp can effectively remove the antibiotic resistance genes args from sewage sludge but the rebounding effects in the subsequent anaerobic fermentation are often observed the purpose of this study was to elucidate the distribution and fate of intracellular and extracellular args iargs and eargs in the sludge acidogenic fermentation process coupled with thp our results revealed that thp significantly reduced the absolute abundance of total args in raw sludge but increased eargs by 0 3 1 4 log units under practical conditions 140 c for 30 min there is no significant difference in the removal of total args between the two acidogenic fermenters receiving raw and hydrolyzed sludge with iargs prevailing in the produced biosolids the succession of bacterial community and the co occurrence relationships among arg type mobile genetic elements and bacterial taxa were observed suggesting a phylogenetic basis for the iargs patterns in fermented sludge however eargs were susceptible to biodegradation with a half life of 2 34 h and they contributed limitedly to the args propagation through transformation these findings suggest an emphasis on the mitigation of iargs during the acidogenic fermentation of sludge which would be achieved by lowering the richness and physicochemical destruction of potential hosts graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp acidogenic fermentation antibiotic resistance genes args bacterial community 1 introduction antibiotic resistance has become a global crisis and leads to higher medical costs prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality blaser 2016 meanwhile the increasing kinds of anthropogenic antibiotic resistance genes args are discovered in aquatic ecosystems su et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 as an essential link between human activities and the ecosystem wastewater treatment plants wwtps act as both a barrier and a hotspot for args dissemination guo et al 2017 as a result the args in the effluent can be effectively removed chen and zhang 2013 ju et al 2019 but the remaining args are finally concentrated in the waste activated sludge which is considered one of the most important reservoirs of args ju et al 2016 the final disposal of sludge e g land application may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance in indigenous organisms and the horizontal dissemination between non pathogenic and pathogenic organisms although the risk assessments of the public health remain unclear looft et al 2012 xie et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 therefore the effective treatment of sewage sludge for mitigating the spread of args is necessary and significant acidogenic fermentation of sludge has attracted increasing interest and become a promising technology for more valuable products such as volatile fatty acids vfas lee et al 2014 sludge derived vfas can be utilized on site as the external carbon source which accounts for 50 70 of the overall operating cost of the biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes in wwtps however the hydrolysis stage has been reported as the rate limiting step during fermentation because the particulate organics and flocculants are more resistant to hydrolysis thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp has been primarily utilized to increase waste solubilization and an increasing trend is towards its application for the enhanced acidogenic fermentation process hosseini koupaie et al 2021 on the other hand thp is effective for the elimination of args because the dna is susceptible to hydrolytic destruction especially under high temperature and pressure ma et al 2011 pei et al 2016 nevertheless the subsequent anaerobic fermentation is not satisfactory and the rebound of the total absolute abundance of args was observed in many studies ma et al 2011 wang et al 2019 this may result in the potential spread of args when the fermentation products i e vfas were directly used as a carbon source for biological processes in wwpts few literatures attributed the args rebounding to the bacterial community composition ma et al 2011 sun et al 2019 impelling us to further explore the reason behind in fact the sludge structure is very complex the fate of args is usually determined by the distribution of args i e being present as intracellular dna idna and extracellular dna edna during the anaerobic fermentation following thp thp can affect the fate of args through two aspects i the release of the intracellular args iargs and ii the hydrolytic degradation of both iargs and extracellular args eargs although the significant removal of total args can be obtained through thp the destruction of the cell wall and the release of intracellular genetic material always occur under practical conditions 140 160 c for 30 min pei et al 2016 resulting in the conversion of iargs to eargs therefore there may exist different fates of iargs and eargs during the subsequent anaerobic fermentation process the vertical transmission through specific lineages and the horizontal transfer through mobile genetic elements mges allows for iargs spread ju et al 2019 found that wwtp resistomes are shaped by bacterial composition and genetic exchange indicating the fate of iargs would be determined by the succession of the bacterial community on the other hand the released eargs would interact with colloidal sludge structure thus protecting them against biodegradation cai et al 2006 it has been reported that edna can often persist in soils and sediments for months mao et al 2014 zhu 2006 furthermore considering that the released eargs carriers would still possess biological activity it is hypothesized that a high density of microorganisms would enhance iargs abundance by promoting the uptake of eargs and genetic transformation across bacteria despite some important observations of the args fate in the anaerobic fermentation of thermally pretreated sludge sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019 xue et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 we are not aware of any studies that systematically investigated the distribution and fate of both iargs and eargs in the sludge fermentation process coupled with thp and that explored the relevant mechanisms explaining the performance of arg removal in the biological treatment system the aim of this study was to provide insights into the distribution and fate of iargs and eargs as well as the microbiome in the sludge fermentation process coupled with thp the release of typical args under different thp temperatures was characterized and the performance of iargs and eargs removal in the subsequent acidogenic fermentation process was evaluated the persistence and the potential transformation of eargs were further investigated we hypothesized that i thp would increase the release of eargs with temperature ii no significant improvement of args removal would be observed in the acidogenic fermentation following thp iii the succession of the bacterial community would determine the fate of iargs and iv the released eargs would persist and propagate through transformation under anaerobic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment and acidogenic fermentation of sludge the tested waste activated sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge from a municipal wwtp in shanghai china were collected and used as raw sludge rs and seed sludge respectively the physicochemical characteristics of rs and seed sludge are shown in table s1 the thp experiment was a completely randomized design with five treatments untreated control and thermal hydrolysis with different temperatures of 100 140 160 and 180 c each replicated three times the experimental unit was a 300 ml hydrolysis reactor consisting of an inner container and a stainless steel vessel cai et al 2020 a raw sludge sample of 150 g wet weight was transferred into each internal container the reactor was then carefully sealed and heated to the target temperature in an electric oven the reaction was thought to start when the oven reached the preset temperature and the reaction duration was 30 min after the reactors were cooled to room temperature taking 60 90 min depending on the reaction temperature the hydrolysate samples were collected for edna idna extraction and physicochemical properties analysis the acidogenic fermentation experiment was a repeated measures design with two treatments fermentation fed by rs and by hydrolyzed sludge hs each replicated three times the experimental unit was a 250 ml anaerobic bottle filled with 150 ml mixtures of seed sludge and two types of substrates rs and hs the hs was collected as the substrate after raw sludge was hydrolyzed at 140 c for 30 min the suggested condition in practice dwyer et al 2008 the ratio of substrates to inoculum was at two depending on volatile solid vs content the total solid ts of the resulting mixture for the fermentation process was adjusted to 1 5 using deionized water the ph value of each bottle was neutralized to 7 0 using hcl or naoh to improve the comparability of acidogenic performance 0 1 w w of 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes was added to the mixture for blocking the methane production process luo et al 2014 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2010 before the experiment nitrogen gas was used to replace the air from the headspace of the reactor for 5 min all the bottles were carefully capped and incubated in an air bath shaker 120 r min at 37 c each bottle was sampled five times during the incubation period at 1 2 4 10 15 d after the bottles were prepared each time edna and idna were extracted from a subsample 5 g taken from each bottle the remainder of idna was then used for 16s rrna gene sequencing representing the composition of the microbial community 2 2 extracellular arg persistence modeling under anaerobic conditions freshly collected fermented sludge approximately 1 1 of ts which was obtained from a batch experiment reactor at the mid term of the third generation stable operation was used to study the persistence of eargs we used plasmid rp4 as the indicator of eargs according to the reference jin et al 2020 the trag like gene products from rp4 are essential for conjugative dna transfer whereby trag protein is thought to couple the relaxosome to the dna transfer apparatus cabezón et al 1997 to further verify or quantify rp4 plasmid the rp4 specific trag like gene was selected according to the previous studies guo et al 2015 soda et al 2008 there are two main processes affecting the persistence of eargs the adsorption by fermented sludge flocs and the degradation by dnases zou et al 2020 to identify how the fermented sludge fraction affected the eargs degradation plasmid rp4 was spiked into fermented sludge i e solid containing samples and its filtrates with solid removed via centrifugation at 10 000 g at 4 c for 15 min followed by filtration through a 0 22 μm membrane solid removed filtrate to compare the adsorption effects two sample pretreatment methods were conducted using the solid containing samples fig s1 solid containing samples were centrifugated and filtered i e solid containing filtrate or freeze dried for dna extraction solid containing total phase the experimental design was presented in table s2 and all the treatments were replicated three times the reaction unit was a 1 5 ml sterile centrifuge tube containing 1 ml of solid removed or solid containing samples the plasmid rp4 was added to achieve the final concentration of 1011 copies g dw of sludge the microcosms were incubated in an air bath shaker 120 r min at 37 c and destructively sampled through 24 h table s2 two strategies were adopted for the trag quantification solid removed or solid containing filtrate was directly used as templates after 103 fold dilution zou et al 2020 while dna in solid containing samples total phase were extracted by a fastdna spin kit for soil 2 3 transformation modeling and transformation assays under anaerobic conditions a 15 day microcosm experiment was used to determine the potential of eargs to transform indigenous bacteria during the acidogenic fermentation based on both culture independent and culture dependent methods the fermented sludge and eargs indicator plasmid rp4 were used as described above two treatments containing antibiotics ampicillin kanamycin and tetracycline of 50 25 and 5 mg l or not were used for microcosms amended with the rp4 plasmid the microcosm unit was a 4 ml sterile tube filled with 2 ml fermented sludge the plasmid rp4 1011 copies g dw was then added into all but the control microcosms the air from the headspace of the tubes was replaced by nitrogen gas all the microcosms were immediately sealed and then incubated at 37 c and 120 r min the microcosms were destructively sampled at 1 3 7 and 15 d each microcosm unit was divided into two subsamples for the culture independent method bacterial idna was extracted from the periodic subsamples for detecting the trag gene copy number for the culture dependent method an aliquot of 100 μl obtained from properly diluted subsamples was spread on two types of solid medium both containing 100 mg l ampicillin 50 mg l kanamycin and 10 mg l tetracyclines luria bertani lb solid plates were prepared and incubated under aerobic condition at 37 c for 24 h while anaerobic culture plates constituents referring to table s3 were prepared and incubated under anaerobic condition at 37 c for 48 h using an anaerobic workstation electrotek uk after incubation the colonies on the antibiotic plates were counted and randomly selected for transformants verification and bacteria identification 2 4 edna idna extraction of sludge arg quantification and illumina sequencing the reported method was utilized to extract edna and idna from sludge dong et al 2019 mao et al 2014 with minor modification 2 5 g wet weight of sludge samples was added 0 2 g of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone pvpp aladdin co and washed three times using 4 ml of 0 12 m sodium phosphate buffer at ph 8 0 each time the mixture was shaken at 250 r min for 10 min at 25 c followed by centrifugation at 10 000 r min for 10 min at 4 c the merged supernatants were filtered through a sterile membrane 0 22 μm pvdf and the edna in the filtrate was extracted using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide ctab corinaldesi et al 2005 a validation experiment was conducted to test the occurrence of cell lysis during edna extraction pseudomonas putida kt2440 carrying mcherry that was not present in sludge was added to sludge in advance and subjected to the whole edna extraction process zou et al 2020 we found no detection of mcherry in extracted edna implying no cross contamination during extraction of edna and idna after the edna extraction the cell pellets were lyophilized for extracting idna using a fastdna spin kit for soil quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was conducted using lightcycler 96 roche basel switzerland to quantify nine representative args including genes conferring resistance to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 macrolides ermf erea and mefa aminoglycosides strb tetracyclines tetg and tetx and beta lactams blashv other genes including 16s rrna gene integrase gene of class i integron inti1 conjugative transposon gene tn916 and rp4 specific trag like gene were also determined the qpcr protocol conditions were performed as previously described ma et al 2011 each 10 μl qpcr reaction contained 5 μl of sybr green master mix 0 6 μl of forward and reverse primers 0 3 μl of each at 100 μm 0 2 μl of dna template or sterile water no template control and 4 2 μl of sterile ddh2o standard curves were conducted in triplicate it was noted that the amplification efficiency for the blashv gene was low 76 2 while the rest of the detected genes showed amplification efficiencies ranging from 87 8 to 111 3 all the results were shown to provide the real patterns the additional details on qpcr reactions are provided in table s4 and table s5 the diversity of intracellular microorganisms was determined using amplicon sequencing at the v3 v4 regions of 16s rrna gene the amplification was conducted according to the previous study cai et al 2019 and amplification products were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform lc bio co hangzhou china microbiome analysis was conducted through qiime 2 platform 2020 11 bolyen et al 2019 raw sequence data were demultiplexed and quality filtered using the q2 demux plugin followed by denoising with dada2 callahan et al 2016 via q2 dada2 microbial taxonomy was assigned to the non redundant features using a naïve bayes classifier against the greengenes 13 8 99 otus reference sequences mcdonald et al 2012 sequences were deposited in the china national gene bank database cngbdb https db cngb org under the project accession number cnp0002287 2 5 genomic dna extraction of colonies pcr gel electrophoresis and bacteria identification in order to verify that the colonies on the antibiotic plates carried the pr4 plasmid transformants were randomly selected at least eight colonies from each treatment condition genomes of the colonies extracted using e z n a bacterial dna kit omega bio tek usa the trag gene and full length 16s rrna gene strejcek et al 2018 were detected with pcr amplification bio rad c1000 touch usa each 25 μl pcr reaction contained 12 μl of master mix thermo fisher scientific usa 0 8 μl of forward and reverse primers 0 4 μl of 100 μm each 0 4 μl of dna templates and 11 8 μl of sterile ddh2o the extracted dna and pcr products were detected using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis sanger sequencing for the pcr products of 16s rrna gene amplification was performed almost full length 16s rrna gene sequences were uploaded to ncbi for bacteria identification 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out using rstudio software version 4 0 3 comparison of released eargs among different thermal hydrolysis temperatures as well as the transformation effects of eargs was analyzed by one way anova with tukey hsd post hoc test the absolute and relative abundance of args in the fermentation process was calculated with repeated measures analysis of variance ranova spearman s rank correlation test detected correlations between bacterial diversity and functional gene abundance the rate constants of the first order kinetic equation and half lives were calculated to compare the eargs persistence in the fermented sludge network analysis was conducted according to ju and zhang 2015 a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating all pairwise spearman s correlation coefficients using the absolute abundance of args and microbial features with false discovery rate control glickman et al 2014 the absolute abundance of each microbial feature was calculated by the relative abundance of microbial feature multiplied by the 16s rrna gene copy number determined by qpcr the robust correlations p value 0 01 and spearman s rho 0 80 were visualized in gephi version 0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal hydrolysis pretreatment increased the loading of extracellular args followed by sludge fermentation the effects of thp on dna distribution are shown in table 1 the concentration of idna decreased from 338 6 μg g of untreated sludge to 6 6 μg g of hydrolyzed sludge at 180 c while edna content showed the initial increase and subsequent decrease with the thp temperature for example compared with the edna of untreated sludge 12 4 μg g the highest amount of edna 29 2 μg g was obtained at the thp temperature of 140 c with the ratio of edna to total dna tdna reaching 61 6 much higher than that of the untreated sludge 3 5 pei et al similarly observed that thp at 170 c for 30 min increased the dna content in sludge supernatant by about three folds pei et al 2016 these results revealed that thp could break cell walls and release intracellular dna into the liquid phase pei et al 2016 yang et al 2020 additionally thp showed a good performance of dna degradation and the removal rate of tdna was 86 5 at the temperature of 140 c which is attributed to the susceptibility of dna to hydrolytic destruction ma et al 2011 when thp temperature exceeded 160 c no significant enhancement of tdna removal was observed which was likely a result of the protection of dna by the released organics in the supernatant table 1 xue et al 2021 typical args and mges were detected in both the idna and edna extracts from the untreated and hydrolyzed sludge samples fig 1 in untreated sludge samples the args and mges in idna were usually 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in the corresponding edna which coincided with previous studies dong et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 every gram of sludge dw contained from 4 0 105 to 7 4 107 copies of eargs and 6 9 106 to 2 4 1010 copies of iargs fig 1 thp significantly reduced the absolute abundance of iargs and imges p 0 05 with the range of reduction from 0 7 to 3 8 log units at the thp temperature of 140 c however the abundance of most of the extracellular genes was raised to the maximum by 0 3 1 4 log units at this thp condition showing an increase of eargs loadings in the subsequent fermentation process importantly the relative abundance of args args 16s rrna genes in idna and edna were comparable but the lowest points were mainly observed at the temperature of 140 c the decrease of the relative abundance was likely due to the differential degradation of various dna molecules no matter whether they were released from bacterial cells it was found that chromosomal dna is more adsorptive than plasmid dna poly et al 2000 and the organic matter could protect dna from degradation in the environment aardema et al 1983 cai et al 2006 romanowski et al 1991 suggesting that the chromosomal 16s rrna genes may be better preserved by the organic matter or particles in the sludge than usually plasmid borne args such as sul1 erea and inti1 for further raising the thp temperature the potential protection of chromosomal dna would be destroyed by the high pressure and temperature leading to the rebound of relative abundance 3 2 log removal of total args in sludge fermentation was not impacted by the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp condition at the temperature of 140 c was selected to investigate the subsequent fermentation process because it meets the temperature range usually used in practice dwyer et al 2008 and results in a maximum release of eargs in this study where any significant effects of sludge fermentation would be observed high production of vfas 221 mg g vsadded was observed in the fermenter receiving hydrolyzed sludge fig s2 and the performance of acidogenic fermentation was in line with the previous studies hosseini koupaie et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 indicating the acidogenic fermentation was well conducted it was also noted that the depressing ph was not observed at the final stage of the acidogenic fermentation process showing the good buffer capacity of the system fed by sludge thp significantly reduced the loadings of iargs at the initial phase of sludge fermentation p 0 05 fig 2 the advantage of loading differential in the hs feeding fermenter however faded away as the fermentation process which is consistent with the trend of intracellular 16s rrna gene fig s3 at the end of fermentation there was no significant difference in the absolute abundance of iargs between two produced biosolids p 0 05 indicating that the net changes in concentration of iargs in the biological treatment system were not impacted by thp wang et al 2019 however two fermenters fed by rs and hs performed variously according to the individual iarg type table s6 in both fermenters the intracellular sul1 erea tetg blashv and 16s rrna genes were significantly decreased p 0 05 at a similar level the representative exceptions were ermf and tn916 ermf enriched after fermentation much higher in hs feeding fermenter than that in the rs feeding fermenter ma et al 2011 similarly observed that the ermf gene in the effluent of the mesophilic digester with and without thp was both observed to rebound over that in the feed sludge studies attributed the rebound effect following a pretreatment to the fact that the microbial community composition in the biosystem dominates the behavior of args ma et al 2011 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2019 seed culture likely drove the arg distribution and concentration when using hs as the substrate further support for the importance of bacterial community composition is the inverse impacts between two treatments tn916 was removed by 30 5 in rs feeding fermenter but increased by more than four folds in hs feeding fermenter table s6 in both fermenters the fermentation process significantly decreased the total eargs content p 0 05 ranova although thp increased the initial concentration of eargs by almost three folds fig 2 all the eargs in the produced biosolids were effectively removed in the range from 0 6 to 3 4 log units table s6 it was noted that the fermented sludge receiving rs had lower contents of eargs and 16s rrna gene than fermented sludge fed by hs p 0 05 ranova fig 2 and fig s3 suggesting that components in the sludge hydrolysate could provide stronger protection of eargs from degradation by dnase compared with untreated sludge generally the concentrations of total eargs at the final stage of fermentation were 1 0 105 and 4 6 105 copies g dw much lower than that of total iargs in the two fermenters indicating earg limitedly contributed to the total args in the fermented sludge when both iargs and eargs were normalized to 16s rrna genes the effects of two fermenters on args maintained a similar trend and no significant difference was observed p 0 05 ranova fig 2 suggesting that the thp did not increase or decrease the selective pressure of antibiotic resistance on the fermentative bacteria 3 3 functional bacterial phylogeny was the driver in shaping intracellular args studies have found that the resistomes are shaped by bacterial composition in the wastewater or sludge treatment system ju et al 2019 su et al 2015 sun et al 2019 but edna can induce bias of microbial community dynamic analysis when cell lysis is caused by thp yang et al 2020 here we used intracellular dna to improve the precision of microbial community analysis in response to sludge fermentation thp significantly affected the alpha diversity shannon index p 0 05 fig s4 and marked shifts in microbial composition community were observed fig s5 the bacterial phylum of proteobacteria decreased but firmicutes increased in the hs feeding fermenter compared with the fermenter receiving rs fig s5 which were in line with the previous reports wang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 it was also noted that some arg types significantly correlated to the bacterial diversity such as ermf spearman rho 0 83 p 0 01 and strb spearman rho 0 58 p 0 01 based on shannon index table s7 ju et al found that bacterial alpha diversity metrics shannon index explained 29 4 of variances in the effluent args ju et al 2019 indicating the importance of bacterial richness and evenness on args we further investigated the profiles of potential functional bacteria in fermented sludge fed by rs and hs thp significantly enriched the fermentative bacteria fig s6 e g blvii28 and longilinea accelerating the rate limiting step of hydrolysis of organic matter however the removal of potential pathogen did not perform better in the hs feeding fermenter fig s6 indicating these bacteria shared ecological niches with the fermentative bacteria rather than potential pathogenicity the co occurrence patterns among iargs and functional bacteria were explored using networking analysis which has been widely used to underline the interaction association among microbial entities forsberg et al 2014 ju et al 2016 ju and zhang 2015 as shown in fig 3 a 342 pairs i e edges of significant and strong correlations are identified among 55 bacterial features and 9 arg types the network modules eight major modules labeled from module i to viii are also described in fig 3b and an absolute abundance browse of microbial entities within each module reveals clusters i e enrichment e g module viii or demise i e decrease e g module vii during sludge fermentation here two associations of microbial entities are focused and predicted by the co occurrence network arg arg and arg bacteria in arg arg associations co occurrence patterns were displayed within or across arg types on the one hand the occurrence of the same arg type i e intra type conferring resistance to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 or macrolides ermf and mefa was observed this is due to the selective pressure exerted by the same antibiotics in the fermented sludge on the other hand the occurrence patterns of different arg types i e inter types were also observed for example aminoglycosides strb and tetracyclines tetx were the different arg types showing the co occurring event this may be explained by the co resistance mechanism for co selection i e different resistance determinants located together on the same genetic elements such as plasmid baker austin et al 2006 cross resistance can also occur when different antimicrobial agents attack the same target zhao et al found that cephalexin and kanamycin tended to co select mainly multidrug resistance genes zhao et al 2020 in arg bacteria associations we assume that the biological origin of an arg bacteria co occurring event in the intracellular environment is from a hosting relationship based on the network analysis it is speculated that the ermf gene was considered as a hub arg i e high degree nodes with a high number of connections with 13 connections to bacteria and one connection to args table s8 indicating a generalist arg with a wide range of potential bacterial hosts chung et al have found that the host range of the ermf gene is extended in bacteria of both human and animal origin chung et al 1999 compared with other erm genes ermf is easily transferred to a recipient by conjugation chung et al 1999 hu et al 2012 this justifies our results of co occurrence between ermf and tn916 conjugative transposon gene indicating the importance of horizontal gene transfer on the iargs dissemination during sludge fermentation furthermore the segregated modules v and vii fig 3b purple vs green are both connected to the ermf gene suggesting that the dissemination of ermf could be favored or inhibited across two distinct ecological niches two bacterial genera i e blvii28 and nitrospira were found to be the potential contributors of the ermf gene but their abundance showed an inverse trend fig 3 and fig s6 the remarkable enrichment of blvii28 a sludge group commonly found in anaerobic waste treatment systems lefevre et al 2019 was observed fig s6 while nitrospira a bacterial hub with 24 node degrees decreased in the hs feeding fermenter table s8 therefore they deserve the foremost research attention because of the capacity for the enrichment and widespread ecological associations during sludge fermentation 3 4 extracellular args were susceptible to degradation rather than propagation through transformation in fermented sludge as previously mentioned thp was capable of releasing eargs into the liquid phase and the subsequent fermentation process performed well for eargs reduction log removal however the complex sludge structure and the background abundances of args covered the underlying fate of eargs during the sludge fermentation here the stability and bacterial assimilation of exogenous eargs pr4 plasmid in fermented sludge were characterized as shown in fig s6a the abundances of the trag gene gradually dropped within 24 h but the first order degradation rate contents k of the three treatments were statistically different p 0 05 fig s6b resulting in different half lives t 1 2 table 2 it was noted that the k value 0 45 h 1 in the sludge filtrate with solid removed solid removed filtrate was higher than that 0 33 h 1 in raw fermented sludge solid containing total phase suggesting a protective role of sludge flocs studies found similar results in the sludge under anaerobic conditions and attributed these to the physical masking of active sites of dnases or target sites of eargs by solids zou et al 2020 moreover we observed the reduction rate 1 30 h 1 of the trag gene in the supernatant of fermented sludge solid containing filtrate was much higher than that in the solid removing filtrate table 2 indicating the occurrence of simultaneous adsorption and biodegradation of free eargs and higher efficiency of free eargs reduction by adsorption than biodegradation more interestingly the added plasmid i e eargs was sharply removed by 2 2 log units in the sludge supernatant at the beginning this is because the added plasmid 1 6 mg dna kg dw sludge is much lower than the adsorption capacities of fermented sludge e g the adsorption capacities of soil colloids reaching 3500 mg dna kg sheng et al 2019 dna molecules could instantaneously penetrate the macropores that spread across the sludge flocs louvet et al 2017 therefore degradation of adsorbed eargs contributed to most of the eargs removal although becoming less accessible to nuclease than free eargs cai et al 2006 the transformation of the extracellular plasmid to indigenous bacteria was observed based on both culture independent and culture dependent methods table 3 and fig 4 the resistant isolates were randomly picked and confirmed with positive detection of the trag gene in the treatments i e spiking pr4 plasmid except for the control however the absolute abundance of the trag gene in idna decreased over time and became undetectable in the fermented sludge table 3 there was no significant difference between the two treatments demonstrating that the presence of antibiotic selective pressure could not enhance the transformation and the following proliferation therefore our hypothesis stating that the released eargs would persist and propagate through transformation under anaerobic conditions was not confirmed as plasmid acquisition is only the first step of plasmid host association the achievement of long term adaption depends on genomic homogenization and subsequent cost amelioration norberg et al 2011 the transformation host range can be inferred including enterococcus colony 11 aciovorax colony 02 and 26 comamonas colony 06 and 17 escherichia colony 04 antinetobacter colony 19 and pseudomonas colony 20 fig 4 while rp4 was predicted to have been evolutionarily present in ralstonia slackia and pseudomonas norberg et al 2011 the succession of functional bacteria may be conducive to regulating arg dissemination when the occasional acquisition of antibiotic resistance occurs through horizontal gene transfer despite the presence of antibiotic selection pressure in the culture dependent experiment we found that antibiotic resistant bacteria from control appeared on the selection plates 6 1 103 cfu ml and the trag gene extracted from isolates was not detected indicating the presence of innate microorganisms conferring multiple resistance in the fermented sludge the sludge derived enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli shigella were confirmed with multiple resistance data not shown although the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria was significantly higher p 0 05 in antibiotic treatment groups than in the nonantibiotic treatment a decreasing trend was found in all the treatments under anaerobic conditions these results revealed that controlling the taxonomic succession in a system may be one way to limit the spread of antibiotic resistance rice et al 2020 4 environmental relevance acidogenic fermentation of sewage sludge for recovery of bioenergy has attracted increasing attention and the produced vfas are considered more valuable than biomethane or biohydrogen lee et al 2014 however most studies focused on maximizing resource recovery hosseini koupaie et al 2021 xu et al 2020 and the mitigation of args dissemination is often unaware the present study revealed the differential responses of iargs and eargs to sludge fermentation following thp although the thp leveled up the eargs loadings in the following fermentation system a high degradation rate and the limited transformation and propagation of eargs were observed these results indicated that an efficient separation process for recovering the fermentation products i e vfas would lower the risks of args dissemination but the remained biosolids need to be carefully considered one of the interesting points is how to mitigate the iargs during the biological fermentation process isolation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and co occurrence analysis preliminarily allowed us to obtain the iargs host range but more iargs host information could be helpful to develop targeted strategies for reducing the proliferation and transfer of iargs in the bioreactors as antibiotic resistance is an ancient and natural phenomenon d costa et al 2011 martínez 2008 it is unrealistic and unnecessary to completely eliminate antibiotic resistance in biological treatments based on the results of the present study the regulation of iargs can be achieved through the following entry points 1 reduction of iargs host range thermophilic fermentation often performed better in args removal than mesophilic fermentation due to the apparent limitations on microbial diversity miller et al 2016 2 physiochemical destruction of host cells post thermal hydrolysis would be an alternative strategy for a hybrid treatment system which can balance the bioenergy recovery and args mitigation cai et al 2021 hosseini koupaie et al 2021 apart from the above mentioned technical methods there is still a lack of relevant knowledge of assessing the risk of iargs and eargs in downstream environments and the link between environmental and clinical resistance 5 conclusions 1 thp significantly decreased the absolute abundance of iargs whereas it would lead to the release of eargs the relative abundance of args showed an initial decrease followed by the increase with the thp temperature indicating differential degradation of various dna molecules 2 although higher loadings of args were found in the fermenter fed by hydrolyzed sludge at the initial stage compared with the fermenter receiving raw sludge there was no significant difference in the absolute abundance of iargs between the two produced biosolids two fermenters showed a similar trend of the relative abundance of args and no significant difference was observed these results revealed that thp had a limited effect on resistance gene removal in the subsequent biological treatment system 3 thp significantly changed the bacterial community composition and enriched the fermentative bacteria co occurrence analysis showed that the ermf gene was considered as a hub iarg and the two functional bacterial genera blvii28 and nitrospira were found to be the potential contributors suggesting a phylogenetic basis for the iargs patterns in fermented sludge 4 after spiking exogenous eargs pr4 plasmid significant biodegradation was observed in the fermented sludge with a half life of 2 34 h despite the confirmation of the bacterial transformation of earg the transformation hosts would not stably propagate under anaerobic conditions these results revealed that eargs contributed limitedly to the resistance dissemination and the mitigation of iargs should be mainly concerned during the anaerobic fermentation of sludge
