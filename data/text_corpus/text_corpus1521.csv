7605,a new technique for merging radar precipitation estimates and rain gauge data is developed and evaluated to improve multisensor quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in particular of heavy to extreme precipitation unlike the conventional cokriging methods which are susceptible to conditional bias cb the proposed technique referred to herein as conditional bias penalized cokriging cbpck explicitly minimizes type ii cb for improved quantitative estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation cbpck is a bivariate version of extended conditional bias penalized kriging ecbpk developed for gauge only analysis to evaluate cbpck cross validation and visual examination are carried out using multi year hourly radar and gauge data in the north central texas region in which cbpck is compared with the variant of the ordinary cokriging ock algorithm used operationally in the national weather service multisensor precipitation estimator the results show that cbpck significantly reduces type ii cb for estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation and that the margin of improvement over ock is larger in areas of higher fractional coverage fc of precipitation when fc 0 9 and hourly gauge precipitation is 60mm the reduction in root mean squared error rmse by cbpck over radar only ro is about 12mm while the reduction in rmse by ock over ro is about 7mm cbpck may be used in real time analysis or in reanalysis of multisensor precipitation for which accurate estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation is of particular importance keywords multisensor quantitative precipitation

serious natural disasters such as flash floods urban inundation river floods and landslides for high resolution precipitation estimation many techniques based on weather radar have been investigated and developed over the last 60years chandrasekar et al 2013 chen and chandrasekar 2015 gourley et al 2009 kitzmiller et al 2011 marshall et al 1955 nelson et al 2015 vasiloff et al 2007 westrick et al 1999 yamaguchi et al 2012 young et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 2011 examples of the most recent advances and challenges in hydrologic applications of weather radar can be found in seo et al 2015 and references therein radar quantitative precipitation estimation qpe however is subject to various error sources such as uncertain z r relationships lack of calibration attenuation anomalous propagation ap and nonuniform vertical profile of reflectivity vpr etc austin 1987 fang et al 2004 smith et al 1996 seo et al 2010 steiner et al 1999 villarini and krajewski 2009 wilson and brandes 1979 therefore radar qpe is often combined with rain gauge data to produce more accurate qpe rain gauges however are also subject to numerous sources of error such as the wind effects mechanical and or electronic malfunction biological contamination as well as systematic biases from wind and turbulence intensity profiles essery and wilcock 1990 fankhauser 1998 sevruk et al 1991 in addition due to the difference in spatiotemporal scale of sampling between rain gauges and radar the statistical properties of radar precipitation estimates may be significantly different from those of rain gauge measurements gires et al 2014 li et al 2013 westcott et al 2008 as such it is necessary to take into account possible biases in the mean and variance in the merging process as well as in evaluation seo and breidenbach 2002 rain gauge observations are nevertheless often considered as truth because they directly measure surface precipitation at points whereas radar precipitation estimates are based on sampling volumes often well above the ground surface in an attempt to utilize rain gauge observations in addition to radar data many linear and nonlinear merging techniques have been reported for multisensor qpe they may be grouped into linear creutin et al 1988 delrieu et al 2014 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 sinclair and pegram 2005 velasco forero et al 2009 and nonlinear azimi zonooz et al 1989 garcía pintado et al 2009 hong et al 2005 komma et al 2007 matsoukas et al 1999 seo 1996 types cokriging for example is one of the most widely used geostatistical merging techniques goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 haberlandt 2007 krajewski 1987 seo et al 1990 sideris et al 2014 its variants seo 1998a b are currently used for radar gauge analysis in the national weather service nws multisensor precipitation estimation mpe seo et al 2010 algorithm kriging cokriging and their variants are often considered the best linear unbiased estimators because they are unbiased and minimize error variance in the unconditional sense journel and huijbregts 1978 in the conditional sense however these optimal estimation techniques frequently underestimate large precipitation and overestimate small precipitation this is because to minimize error variance unconditionally the above estimators reduce errors primarily over the median range of precipitation amounts which occur far more frequently than those at the tail ends of the distribution ciach et al 2000 habib et al 2013 seo and breidenbach 2002 therefore given some large amount of true rainfall the conditional mean of its estimates may differ significantly the difference between the truth and the conditional mean is called conditional mean error or conditional bias cb ciach et al 2000 for accurate estimation specifically of large amounts it is at least as important to reduce cb in particular type ii cb type i and ii cbs emerge from type i and ii errors respectively a type i error is associated with a false alarm e g crying wolf without a wolf in sight whereas a type ii error is associated with failing to raise an alarm i e failing to see the wolf type i cb can be reduced by scaling up or down i e calibrating the predicted amounts for the events of interest until cb for the events is reduced e g if the false alarm rate is too high one may not cry wolf as often with type ii cb however such calibration is not possible because the analysis system has failed to detect the events at all seo et al 2014 as such reducing type ii cb addresses an important gap in multisensor qpe toward the above end conditional bias penalized kriging cbpk seo 2012 has been developed for gauge only analysis go which minimizes type ii cb herein denoted as cb for brevity in addition to unconditional error variance more recently extended cb penalized kriging ecbpk seo et al 2014 has been developed to address negative estimates in areas of light precipitation and to adjust positive estimates by multiplying a fractional coverage fc dependent scaling factor they showed that ecbpk significantly improves estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation over the variant of ordinary kriging ok currently used in the nws s mpe algorithm for go explicit minimization of cb in multisensor qpe however has not been investigated yet the main objective of this study is to improve multisensor estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation via conditional bias penalized cokriging cbpck unlike conventional ordinary cokriging ock or its variants which are susceptible to cb cbpck explicitly minimizes both unconditional error variance and cb thereby improving performance for estimation of precipitation at tail ends to evaluate cbpck cross validation experiments are designed and carried out over the north central texas area using 10years worth of hourly data for comparison the mpe algorithms for gauge only and radar gauge analyses are also run to assess performance under different conditions of biasedness in radar qpe ock and cbpck are evaluated with and without bias correcting radar qpe 2 data and methodology in this section we describe the data used quality control of the rain gauge data merging techniques used parameter estimation and evaluation metrics 2 1 data used the analysis domain is a 560 560km2 area in the north central texas region see fig 1 the climate of the domain is humid subtropical with hot summers and relatively mild winters mean annual precipitation varies considerably ranging from less than 500mm to the west to 1200mm to the east the rain gauge data used are from the hydrometeorological automated data system hads which is operated by the nws office of hydrologic development now the office of water prediction a total of 199 rain gauges out of 243 within the analysis domain are chosen following a set of quality control steps the radar data used are from multi radar multi sensor mrms reanalysis nelson et al 2010 zhang et al 2015a at the national centers for environmental information ncei formerly the national climatic data center for which the primary source is the next generation radar nexrad heiss et al 1990 the mrms qpe algorithms are largely based on the national mosaic and multisensor qpe nmq components zhang et al 2011 the mrms incorporates data from different observing systems to create high resolution national multisensor qpe for various applications such as flash flood and flood warnings and water resources management the mrms generates multiple products including radar only local bias corrected radar and gauge only qpes in this work hourly radar only qpe from mrms reanalysis carried out at ncei was used the reanalysis period is 10years 2002 2011 the mrms products were evaluated over the twelve river forecast center service areas in the contiguous us using rain gauge observations from the automated surface observing system wu et al 2012 the results indicated that the radar only qpe from mrms have higher correlation and lower bias compared to those from the weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler version wsr 88d precipitation processing subsystem fulton et al 1998 the radar data used in this work are on a 502 502 grid over the analysis domain with a spatial resolution of 0 01 0 01 the upper left corner of the analysis domain is 35 01 n and 99 00 w 2 2 data quality control qc rain gauge observations are subject to various sources of error such as wind mechanical malfunction electronic malfunction and biological contamination essery and wilcock 1990 fankhauser 1998 sevruk et al 1991 in this work the rain gauge data are quality controlled before being used in multisensor qpe a cap of 125mm is applied to hourly rain gauge observations based on the 100 year hourly precipitation in the analysis domain frederick et al 1977 stevenson and schumacher 2014 to quality control individual rain gauges the probability of precipitation pop and the conditional on positive precipitation coefficient of variation cv of hourly gauge precipitation are calculated for each gauge for the entire period of record seo and breidenbach 2002 the pop is calculated by the number of positive gauge reports divided by the total number of gauge reports based on the regional climatology represented by the general pattern of the statistics the minimum and maximum thresholds of pop and conditional cv are applied respectively if the pop of rain gauge is less than 0 02 or the conditional cv of the rain gauge precipitation is 3 2 the gauge is considered suspect and discarded each rain gauge observation is then compared with the neighboring gauge observations and if determined to be outliers e g fulton et al 1998 is filtered out gauge observations are also compared with radar data to screen out stuck or malfunctioning rain gauges because it is difficult to determine such gauges from hourly data the rain gauge data are accumulated monthly and visually inspected against monthly accumulated radar qpe visual examination of precipitation accumulations at scales smaller than a month is very labor intensive and is not considered in this work to retain as much data as possible only those data associated with suspicious months are excluded other statistics such as the unconditional and conditional mean of gauge and radar precipitation the ratio of the sum of gauge precipitation to the sum of radar precipitation and the indicator and conditional correlation coefficients between gauge and radar precipitation are also examined to aid data quality control not shown 2 3 merging techniques in this section we provide a summary description of the two different merging techniques 1 the variant of ock used in mpe seo et al 2010 algorithm in nws and 2 the bivariate version of ecbpk ecbpk seo et al 2014 or cbpck 2 3 1 ordinary cokriging ock ock estimates the precipitation amount at an ungauged location given the neighboring rain gauge observations and the radar qpe the ock estimator has the following form 1 g k u 0 i 1 n g λ gi g k u i j 1 n r λ rj r k u j 2 i 1 n g λ gi j 1 n r λ rj 1 where g k u 0 denotes the estimated precipitation at the ungauged bin centered at location u 0 in hour k g k u i and r k u j denote the gauge and radar precipitation at location u i in hour k respectively λ gi and λ rj denotes the weights given to the i th gauge and the j th radar data respectively n g and n r denote the number of gauge and radar data used respectively the constraint eq 2 renders the estimate g k u 0 in eq 1 unbiased in the mean sense the weights given to the nearest gauge and radar data λ gi and λ rj in eq 1 respectively are obtained by minimizing the error variance of g k u 0 see seo 1998a b for details note that the choice of the constraint eq 2 assumes that the radar precipitation estimates r k u j are unbiased the optimal weights λ gi and λ rj can be obtained by minimizing the error variance of the estimate j ock 3 j ock var g k u 0 g k u 0 e g k u 0 g k u 0 2 1 i 1 n g n r λ i ρ i 0 μ where μ denotes the lagrange multiplier journel and huijbregts 1978 the optimal weights are a function of the covariance among the gauge observations that among the radar data and the cross covariance among the gauge and radar precipitation the cross covariance is given by seo 1998a b 4 cov g u i r u j e g u i r u i e g u i e r u i e g u i r u i g u i 0 r u j 0 pr g u i 0 r u j 0 e g u i g u i 0 pr g u i 0 e r u j r u j 0 pr r u j 0 in the above the time index k is dropped for notational brevity eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 cov g u i r u j σ g σ r m ig 1 m ig 1 2 m ir 1 m ir 1 2 ρ c u i u j ρ ic u i u j m g m r m ig 1 m ig 1 2 m ir 1 m ir 1 2 ρ ic u i u j σ g σ r m ig m ir ρ c u i u j where σ g and σ r denote the standard deviation of gauge and radar precipitation respectively m ig and m ir denote the mean fractional coverage fc of gauge and radar precipitation respectively m g and m r denote the unconditional mean of gauge and radar precipitation respectively and ρ c u i u j and ρ ic u i u j denote the conditional and indicator cross correlation at a separation distance of u i u j respectively under the assumption of homogeneity the mean fc of precipitation is equivalent to the probability of precipitation pop seo and smith 1996 as in seo 1998b it is assumed in eq 5 that σ g is the same as σ r m ig is the same as m ir ρ c u i u j is the same as ρ ic u i u j and m g is the same as m r these assumptions reduce eq 5 to 6 cov g u i r u j σ r 2 m ir 1 m ir ρ c u i u j ρ ic u i u j m r 2 m ir 1 m ir ρ ic u i u j σ r 2 m ir 2 ρ c u i u j once the covariance terms are specified the optimal weights in eqs 1 and 2 are obtained by solving the so called kriging system journel and huijbregts 1978 7 c gg c gr 1 c rg c rr 1 1 1 0 λ i λ i j μ c 0 g c 0 r 1 where c gg c gr c rg t and c rr denote the n g n g n g n r n r n r cross covariance matrices whose entries are given by cov g u i g u i cov g u i r u j and cov r u j r u j respectively and c 0 g and c 0 r denote the 1 ng and 1 nr cross covariance vectors whose entries are given by cov g u 0 g u i and cov g u 0 r u j respectively i 1 n g j 1 n r if our interest is only in the estimate and not in the estimation of variance ock may be performed using correlation instead of covariance dividing eq 6 with the variance of radar precipitation var r u σ r 2 m ir m r 2 m ir 1 m ir results in the correlation between g u i and r u j being 8 corr g u i r u j cv r 2 1 m ir ρ c u i u j ρ ic u i u j 1 m ir ρ ic u i u j cv r 2 m ir ρ c u i u j cv r 2 1 m ir where cv r denotes the coefficient of variation cv of radar precipitation 2 3 2 conditional bias penalized cokriging cbpck here we describe cbpck which is the bivariate version of ecbpk seo et al 2014 in cbpck the cb penalty term e e g u 0 g u 0 g u 0 2 is added to the objective function where the time index k has also been dropped for notational brevity 9 j cbpck e g u 0 g u 0 2 α e e g u 0 g u 0 g u 0 2 where α denotes the positive weight given to the cb penalty term the weight α can be optimized to improve the balance between reducing error variance and reducing cb if α is zero j cbpck is equivalent to j ock described in section 2 3 1 to specify e g u 0 g u 0 in eq 9 the bayesian optimal estimator schweppe 1973 is used see eq 4 of seo et al 2014 the cbpck system then results from minimizing j cbpck in eq 9 with respect to the weights λ j s 10 j 1 n g n r λ j ρ ij α ρ i 0 ρ j 0 σ i σ j 1 α ρ i 0 σ i σ 0 i 1 n g n r 11 i 1 n g λ gi j 1 n r λ rj 1 where ρ ij denotes the cross correlation between the two variables at u i and u j as formulated above cbpck often produces negative estimates in the areas of light precipitation see seo 2012 seo et al 2014 as with ock cbpck is a second order estimator with no distribution assumptions as such if the variable of interest is non negative it is necessary to correct all negative estimates and reset them to zero such thresholding however necessarily impacts theoretical unbiasedness of cbpck negatively the introduction of γ removes the biases introduced by the thresholding because negative cbpck estimates are more likely to occur where precipitation occurs only in parts of the local estimation domain we condition γ on fc for further details and theoretical justification the reader is referred to seo et al 2015 12 g u 0 cbpck 0 if g u 0 cbpck 0 γ g u 0 cbpck otherwise where g u 0 cbpck denotes the bias corrected cbpck estimate and the scaling coefficient γ is empirically estimated as a function of fc of precipitation over the ungauged location by 13 γ e g u 0 cbpck e g u 0 cbpck g u 0 cbpck 0 where e g u 0 cbpck denotes the spatiotemporal mean of cbpck estimate g u 0 at location u 0 and e g u 0 cbpck g u 0 cbpck 0 denotes the spatiotemporal mean of positive cbpck estimate g u 0 the scaling coefficient γ is estimated for each subrange of fc of precipitation where fc is calculated by dividing the number of neighboring positive observations by the total number of neighboring observations if there are no gauge or radar data within the radius of influence fc is estimated by using the radar or gauge data only respectively if there exist both gauge and radar data within the radius of influence fc is estimated via arithmetic averaging of the two while cbpk is superior to ok over the tail ends of the precipitation distribution it is inferior over the mid ranges as shown for go seo 2012 as such we may choose between cbpck and ock based on the more skillful estimation available depending on the magnitude of the true precipitation in reality we of course do not know what the true precipitation amount is at the ungauged location given that the ock estimate reflects precipitation information in both rain gauge and radar data we consider the ock estimate at the ungauged location to be the most skillful estimate in this work because only the relative position of the ungauged precipitation in the distributional sense rather than the absolute accuracy matters in choosing ock vs cbpck the ock estimate is transformed into the standard normal deviate zock and the weight given to the cb term α is specified based on the zock through a simple functional relationship as a result in the mid ranges of the transformed normal distribution zock is close to zero i e α is very small and hence the final estimate is closer to the ock estimate whereas in the tails zock is large i e α is large and hence the final estimate is closer to the cbpck estimate due to the different quality in radar only qpe two different relationships between α and zock are used for two analysis periods the relationships used are α 0 5zock 2 for the analysis period of 2002 2008 and α 0 286zock 2 for the analysis period of 2008 2011 based on sensitivity analysis 2 4 parameter estimation the merging algorithms used in this work require modeling spatial covariance structures of intermittency and inner variability of precipitation seo 1998a b in this work the correlograms are estimated using the hourly radar qpe under the assumption that the correlogram structures of gauge precipitation are the same as those of radar precipitation seo 1998b ock requires specification of the following parameters the number of nearest neighbors conditional and indicator correlation models for warm and cool seasons and cv of point precipitation each correlation model requires specification of the model type exponential gaussian or spherical and correlation scale both of which are assumed to be common between radar and gauge precipitation and lag 0 correlation of radar and gauge precipitation and lag 0 cross correlation between radar and gauge precipitation the lag 0 cross correlation is assumed to be the same as the lag 0 cross correlation cbpck additionally requires the coefficient c in α c zock 2 in reality precipitation fields are generally anisotropic to determine anisotropy directional experimental correlograms are estimated along the angles of 0 26 6 45 63 4 90 116 6 135 and 153 4 counterclockwise from due east each experimental correlogram is then fitted with the exponential gaussian and spherical models with the nugget effect sill and range as the model parameters journel and huijbregts 1978 for both the conditional and indicator correlograms the exponential model provided the best fit for most cases as such we used the exponential model in all analyses using directional correlograms one may visualize 2 dimensional spatial correlation structure by contour plotting the correlation coefficients fig 2 presents the contour plots of the conditional and indicator correlograms for aug and nov the isotropic structure in aug is associated with convective precipitation in the warm season whereas the anisotropic structure in nov is associated with frontal precipitation in the cool season because the exponential model provides the best fit for all cases examined and the anisotropic correlation structures are not strong for most months averages of the parameter values associated with all directional correlation functions were used because it is impractical to estimate time varying covariance structures due to lack of data and large computing requirements climatological correlograms from the 7 year period of 2002 2008 in table 1 were used in this study the use of climatological warm vs cool season correlation structure as opposed to flow dependent structure that varies dynamically renders the ock and cbpck estimates less than optimal seo and smith 1996 zhang et al 2016 2015b the impact of such suboptimal modeling of correlation structure is generally much larger for unconstrained estimators such as simple kriging or simple cokriging whose weights are not constrained to sum to unity in practice time varying modeling of correlation structure is only feasible for radar precipitation estimates note that even with simplifying assumptions seo 1998 one still has to estimate time varying cross correlation coefficients between radar and rain gauge precipitation a tall order in most areas where rain gauges are sparse for comparison between ock and cbpck one may expect the impact of the above approximation to be small because the two techniques share the same climatological correlation structure additional research is needed however to quantify the marginal value of time varying correlation structure for ock or cbpck and to characterize the spatiotemporal structures of nonstationary rainfall fields see e g schleiss et al 2014 the radius of influence for the neighboring observations is specified by the indicator correlation scale the fc of precipitation within the radius of influence is specified dynamically from rain gauge and radar data at each analysis time by dividing the number of neighboring positive precipitation reporting observations by the total number of neighboring observations that include zero precipitation if both data sources are not available within the radius of influence fc is estimated by using only a single source the number of neighbors used in the estimation process is 30 as determined from sensitivity analysis the actual number of rain gauges used however may vary from hour to hour because only those rain gauges inside of the radius of influence are used in the estimation process 2 5 evaluation metrics to evaluate the proposed method cross validation was carried out for evaluation different performance metrics and plots such as scatter and quantile quantile qq plots were used the evaluation metrics used are root mean squared error rmse reduction and percent reduction in rmse conditional mean and multiplicative bias the rmse conditioned on the minimum threshold of gauge precipitation is used to measure the conditional performance of the estimators the rmse is defined as 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n g u i g u i 2 where g u i denotes the estimated precipitation at location u i g u i denotes the rain gauge precipitation at location u i and n denotes the total number of observations the percent reduction in rmse by cbpck over ock or prirmse cbpck is defined as 15 prirmse cbpck rmse ock rmse cbpck rmse ock 100 where rmse cbpck and rmse ock denote the rmses of cbpck and ock estimates respectively the multiplicative bias is defined as the ratio of the sum of the estimates to the sum of the verifying observations 16 multiplicative bias i 1 n g u i i 1 n g u i 3 results this section presents the evaluation results through cross validation and visual examination for the analysis period of 2002 2011 all results are based on hourly analysis merged fields of hourly precipitation are accumulated to daily to monthly fields as well for visual assessment before comparing results using various metrics we assess the impact of global and monthly bias correction 3 1 bias correction the purpose of this correction is to eliminate or reduce biases in radar qpe due to uncertain z r relationship lack of calibration and temporal changes in the raindrop size distribution smith and krajewski 1991 the ock and cbpck techniques as formulated in this work assume that the radar precipitation estimates are unbiased in reality however the radar qpe may be biased due to various error sources it is hence necessary to assess how the performance of cbpck may vary depending on the presence of bias in the radar only qpe in this work mean field bias correction anagnostou et al 1998 seo et al 1999 smith and krajewski 1991 zhang et al 2011 is applied separately by multiplying the bias correction factor to radar qpe before ock or cbpck is performed the bias correction factor β defined as 17 β i n g k u i g k u i 0 r k u i 0 i n r k u i g k u i 0 r k u i 0 the global bias correction factor is a single number calculated using all positive positive pairs of collocated hourly gauge and radar rainfall data at rain gauge locations at every hour k for the entire period of analysis because of the different quality of radar data two global bias correction factors are estimated for two analysis periods of 2002 2008 and 2008 2011 in the global sense the radar data tend to underestimate gauge precipitation for the period of 2002 2007 whereas they tend to overestimate for the period of 2009 2011 the radar data for 2008 show no significant bias and are included in both analysis periods the global bias correction factors estimated for two periods of 2002 2008 and 2008 2011 are 1 05 radar underestimate by 5 and 0 90 radar overestimate by 10 respectively for the entire period of 2002 2011 the global bias correction factor is close to unity the monthly bias correction factors are also calculated for two periods see fig 3 the figure shows that the monthly bias correction factors are generally larger for 2002 2008 than for 2008 2011 and that the radar qpe generally over and underestimate gauge precipitation during the warm and cool seasons respectively note that the global and monthly bias correction factors do not account for spatial variability of bias since a single value is used for the entire domain 3 2 cross validation to evaluate the proposed technique leave one gauge out cross validation is performed using hourly radar qpe and rain gauge observations the cokriging parameters are estimated using all available data in a dependent validation mode for the cokriging parameters we could have carried out true validation or leave one year out cross validation in which the parameter estimation and validation periods are separated our choice for dependent validation in this work is based on the observation that at multi annual scale the cokriging parameters do not vary significantly the above observation is not surprising in that the parameters are seasonal and reflect a rather large area the leave one gauge out cross validation process comprise the following steps 1 withhold hourly rain gauge observations one at a time and estimate precipitation at the withheld gauge location using all available data 2 compare the estimated amount with the revealed rain gauge observation 3 repeat the above steps for all rain gauge locations in the entire cross validation period cross validation is performed for ock cbpck and go fig 4 shows the percent reduction in rmse by ock red 1 1 for interpretation of color in figs 4 and 7 the reader is referred to the web version of this article over ro and by cbpck green over ro conditional on the verifying gauge precipitation greater than that shown on the x axis following monthly and global bias correction for the analysis period of 2002 2008 bias correction shows little impact in general positive reduction in rmse by cbpck and ock over ro can be seen regardless of the threshold for verifying gauge precipitation amount cbpck is superior to ock over thresholds 30mm but shows limited performance over thresholds less than 30mm for 2008 2011 the monthly and global bias correction before merging provide noticeable improvement in ock whereas the positive impact is only marginal for cbpck for this period ock is inferior to ro except at the tail ends whereas cbpck is superior or comparable to ro at all thresholds for large precipitation amounts significant reduction of up to 20 in rmse by cbpck over ro is seen overall compared to global bias correction monthly bias correction slightly improves the relative performance by ock over ro the relative performance by cbpck over ro on the other hand does not change much between the two bias correction methods given that the impact of bias correction is only marginal below we present the results without bias correction fig 5 shows the reduction in rmse by cbpck and ock over ro conditional on the verifying gauge precipitation greater than that shown on the x axis the reduction in rmse is conditioned also on fc the conditions fc 0 solid line and fc 0 9 dotted line indicate that the fractional coverage of precipitation over the ungauged location is 0 and 0 9 respectively a very high fc means that it is most likely to be precipitating over the ungauged location when fc 0 9 and hourly gauge precipitation is 60mm the reduction in rmse by cbpck over ro is about 12mm the results show that the larger the precipitation amount and fc are the larger the reduction in rmse by both cbpck and ock over ro is when fc is high the margin of improvement by cbpck is greater than that by ock when fc is high both cbpck and ock have smaller rmse than ro regardless of the minimum gauge precipitation note also that cbpck is superior to ock regardless of fc fig 6 shows the multiplicative bias of the ock and cbpck estimates relative to the verifying truth conditional on the verifying gauge precipitation exceeding the threshold shown on the x axis for fc 0 and fc 0 9 although large biases are observed in both the ock and cbpck estimate significant reduction in bias is seen when fc is large i e fc 0 9 the margin of reduction in multiplicative bias by cbpck over ock fig 6 also increases as the thresholding gauge precipitation increases the rather large multiplicative biases seen in the figure reinforce the need for improving estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation at point to small spatial scales for large catchments such large biases are not likely to exist in mean areal precipitation map estimates because in any given hour only a relatively small fraction of the catchment is likely to be receiving heavy to extreme precipitation fig 7 shows the scatter and qq in red plots of the go ro ock and cbpck estimates vs the verifying hourly gauge precipitation only for those data points for which the fc is 0 9 note that go upper left and ock lower left tend to significantly underestimate large precipitation amounts 50mm ro is reasonably conditionally unbiased in the global sense but generally has a larger scatter compared to ock and cbpck the generally positive impact of cbpck may be seen particularly for estimation of large precipitation for small precipitation amounts however the limitation of cbpck may also be seen the isolated cases of significant overestimation of smaller amounts by cbpck compared to ro is due to overestimation in the standard normal space by ock as explained below it is recalled that the weight α for the cb term in cbpck is specified by the standard normal transform of the ock estimate if ock incorrectly overestimates small amounts its estimates are associated with large standard normal deviates resulting in large values of α and hence assigning cbpck estimate rather than ock estimates because of the large analysis domain and multi year analysis period the scatter plots include a large number of large amounts of hourly precipitation as such the plots illustrate very well the large variability of precipitation in the study area and the challenges for accurate qpe lack of representativeness of point gauge precipitation for areal precipitation is an issue due to the often convective nature of the storms in the study area and is a contributing factor to the scatter the representativeness error however does not significantly impact second order error statistics such as root mean square error seo and breidenbach 2002 while the global analysis over the long analysis periods represented in fig 7 is useful for assessment of long term performance the relative performance among go ro ock and cbpck may depend greatly on specific rainfall events that produce very large to extreme amounts of precipitation to assess performance within specific time periods of heavy to extreme precipitation the scatter plots of hourly estimates were visually examined for a number of months that produced large amounts of precipitation fig 8 shows an example of the scatter and qq plots of the hourly estimates for apr 2008 note that cbpck significantly improves over both ro and ock particularly for estimation of large precipitation amounts fig 9 shows the percent reduction in rmse as a function of the minimum fc of precipitation over the ungauged location by cbpck over ock for hourly gauge precipitation greater than the amount shown on the x axis the figure shows that cbpck is superior to ock for precipitation amounts 30mm regardless of fc for fc 0 5 the reduction is positive when gauge precipitation exceeds approximately 15mm and for verifying precipitation exceeding 40mm the reduction is about 8 if the threshold gauge precipitation is less than 10mm however cbpck is inferior to ock regardless of fc the negative reduction in light precipitation arises from the fact that ock minimizes unconditional error variance and hence does better than cbpck for precipitation amounts around the median note that the larger the precipitation amount is the larger the percent reduction in rmse by cbpck is over ock and that the larger the fc is the larger the percent reduction in rmse is fig 10 shows the conditional mean of the gauge denoted as truth ro ock and cbpck estimates for hourly point precipitation amounts greater than that shown on the x axis for fc 0 9 the figure indicates that cbpck reduces conditional mean bias over ock for all ranges and over ro for precipitation amounts exceeding 50mm the margin of improvement by cbpck over ock increases as the threshold of verifying precipitation increases 3 3 precipitation maps the hourly multisensor analyses are accumulated up to a month for visual assessment of the performance of each technique fig 11 shows an example of the hourly analysis fields from go ro ock and cbpck valid at 9pm on mar 18 2008 the go field is generated using ecbpk seo et al 2014 the complementary nature of the multisensor analyses is readily seen note that compared to the ock analysis the cbpck analysis shows increased precipitation in the convective cores fig 12 shows an example of daily accumulation fields valid for mar 18 obtained by aggregating the hourly results similar observations to the hourly example above may be made fig 13 shows an example of monthly accumulation fields valid for mar 2008 obtained by aggregating the hourly results while it is not possible to verify the absolute accuracy of the analyses due to lack of ground truth the above figures suggest that cbpck is able to capture the variability better than ock fig 14 shows the differences in monthly precipitation maps shown in fig 13 ro tends to underestimate the large precipitation amounts seen in go the difference between the monthly ock and cbpck fields ranges from 25 to 70mm note that cbpck significantly increases estimates in areas of heavy precipitation while decreasing estimates over areas of light precipitation 4 conclusions and future research recommendations a new multisensor qpe technique for gauge radar analysis conditional bias penalized cokriging cbpck is developed to improve estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation unlike conventional ordinary cokriging ock or its variants which are susceptible to conditional bias cb cbpck explicitly minimizes both unconditional error variance and type ii cb thereby improving performance for estimation of precipitation at tail ends for evaluation multi year leave one gauge out cross validation was carried out for comparative evaluation of cbpck with the variant of ordinary cokriging ock seo 1998a b currently used in the nws s multisensor precipitation estimation mpe algorithm the analysis domain is a 560 560km2 area in the north central texas region the main findings and conclusions are as follows cbpck improves over ock for estimation of hourly precipitation exceeding 30mm the margin of improvement depends most significantly on fractional coverage fc of precipitation at the ungauged location if fc is 50 or higher cbpck reduces rmse over ock by approximately 8 for hourly precipitation 40mm if fc is 90 or higher i e it is very likely to be precipitating at the ungauged location the margin of improvement is approximately 15 for hourly precipitation 70mm bias correction of radar only qpe before merging tends to improve the performance of both ock and cbpck the improvement is noticeable for ock but marginal at best for cbpck only cbpck however is able to outperform bias corrected radar only ro consistently compared to global bias correction monthly bias correction is marginally more effective it is seen that the radar only qpe from mrms reanalysis is globally biased high by about 10 and over and underestimates gauge precipitation in the warm and cool seasons respectively for the data sets used in this work cbpck is seen to be capable of improving estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation with or without bias correction of ro quality control of rain gauge observations remains a large challenge for objective evaluation there exists a clear need for high quality hourly rain gauge data visual examination of the analysis results at hourly daily and monthly scales of accumulation indicates that compared to ock cbpck increases and decreases the estimated amounts in areas of heavy and light precipitation respectively because the quality of the weighting factor α is only as good as that of the ock estimates there are occasions when cbpck significantly overestimates light precipitation due to mis prognostication of the magnitude of precipitation at the ungauged location for more skillful determination of α it is necessary to incorporate additional sources of precipitation information such as satellite qpe lightning observations and numerical weather prediction nwp output acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no cybersees

7605,a new technique for merging radar precipitation estimates and rain gauge data is developed and evaluated to improve multisensor quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in particular of heavy to extreme precipitation unlike the conventional cokriging methods which are susceptible to conditional bias cb the proposed technique referred to herein as conditional bias penalized cokriging cbpck explicitly minimizes type ii cb for improved quantitative estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation cbpck is a bivariate version of extended conditional bias penalized kriging ecbpk developed for gauge only analysis to evaluate cbpck cross validation and visual examination are carried out using multi year hourly radar and gauge data in the north central texas region in which cbpck is compared with the variant of the ordinary cokriging ock algorithm used operationally in the national weather service multisensor precipitation estimator the results show that cbpck significantly reduces type ii cb for estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation and that the margin of improvement over ock is larger in areas of higher fractional coverage fc of precipitation when fc 0 9 and hourly gauge precipitation is 60mm the reduction in root mean squared error rmse by cbpck over radar only ro is about 12mm while the reduction in rmse by ock over ro is about 7mm cbpck may be used in real time analysis or in reanalysis of multisensor precipitation for which accurate estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation is of particular importance keywords multisensor quantitative precipitation

profile of reflectivity wsr 88d weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler 1 introduction heavy to extreme rainfall is a growing concern in many parts of the world since it is often a direct cause for serious natural disasters such as flash floods urban inundation river floods and landslides for high resolution precipitation estimation many techniques based on weather radar have been investigated and developed over the last 60years chandrasekar et al 2013 chen and chandrasekar 2015 gourley et al 2009 kitzmiller et al 2011 marshall et al 1955 nelson et al 2015 vasiloff et al 2007 westrick et al 1999 yamaguchi et al 2012 young et al 2000 zhang et al 2012 2011 examples of the most recent advances and challenges in hydrologic applications of weather radar can be found in seo et al 2015 and references therein radar quantitative precipitation estimation qpe however is subject to various error sources such as uncertain z r relationships lack of calibration attenuation anomalous propagation ap and nonuniform vertical profile of reflectivity vpr etc austin 1987 fang et al 2004 smith et al 1996 seo et al 2010 steiner et al 1999 villarini and krajewski 2009 wilson and brandes 1979 therefore radar qpe is often combined with rain gauge data to produce more accurate qpe rain gauges however are also subject to numerous sources of error such as the wind effects mechanical and or electronic malfunction biological contamination as well as systematic biases from wind and turbulence intensity profiles essery and wilcock 1990 fankhauser 1998 sevruk et al 1991 in addition due to the difference in spatiotemporal scale of sampling between rain gauges and radar the statistical properties of radar precipitation estimates may be significantly different from those of rain gauge measurements gires et al 2014 li et al 2013 westcott et al 2008 as such it is necessary to take into account possible biases in the mean and variance in the merging process as well as in evaluation seo and breidenbach 2002 rain gauge observations are nevertheless often considered as truth because they directly measure surface precipitation at points whereas radar precipitation estimates are based on sampling volumes often well above the ground surface in an attempt to utilize rain gauge observations in addition to radar data many linear and nonlinear merging techniques have been reported for multisensor qpe they may be grouped into linear creutin et al 1988 delrieu et al 2014 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 sinclair and pegram 2005 velasco forero et al 2009 and nonlinear azimi zonooz et al 1989 garcía pintado et al 2009 hong et al 2005 komma et al 2007 matsoukas et al 1999 seo 1996 types cokriging for example is one of the most widely used geostatistical merging techniques goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 haberlandt 2007 krajewski 1987 seo et al 1990 sideris et al 2014 its variants seo 1998a b are currently used for radar gauge analysis in the national weather service nws multisensor precipitation estimation mpe seo et al 2010 algorithm kriging cokriging and their variants are often considered the best linear unbiased estimators because they are unbiased and minimize error variance in the unconditional sense journel and huijbregts 1978 in the conditional sense however these optimal estimation techniques frequently underestimate large precipitation and overestimate small precipitation this is because to minimize error variance unconditionally the above estimators reduce errors primarily over the median range of precipitation amounts which occur far more frequently than those at the tail ends of the distribution ciach et al 2000 habib et al 2013 seo and breidenbach 2002 therefore given some large amount of true rainfall the conditional mean of its estimates may differ significantly the difference between the truth and the conditional mean is called conditional mean error or conditional bias cb ciach et al 2000 for accurate estimation specifically of large amounts it is at least as important to reduce cb in particular type ii cb type i and ii cbs emerge from type i and ii errors respectively a type i error is associated with a false alarm e g crying wolf without a wolf in sight whereas a type ii error is associated with failing to raise an alarm i e failing to see the wolf type i cb can be reduced by scaling up or down i e calibrating the predicted amounts for the events of interest until cb for the events is reduced e g if the false alarm rate is too high one may not cry wolf as often with type ii cb however such calibration is not possible because the analysis system has failed to detect the events at all seo et al 2014 as such reducing type ii cb addresses an important gap in multisensor qpe toward the above end conditional bias penalized kriging cbpk seo 2012 has been developed for gauge only analysis go which minimizes type ii cb herein denoted as cb for brevity in addition to unconditional error variance more recently extended cb penalized kriging ecbpk seo et al 2014 has been developed to address negative estimates in areas of light precipitation and to adjust positive estimates by multiplying a fractional coverage fc dependent scaling factor they showed that ecbpk significantly improves estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation over the variant of ordinary kriging ok currently used in the nws s mpe algorithm for go explicit minimization of cb in multisensor qpe however has not been investigated yet the main objective of this study is to improve multisensor estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation via conditional bias penalized cokriging cbpck unlike conventional ordinary cokriging ock or its variants which are susceptible to cb cbpck explicitly minimizes both unconditional error variance and cb thereby improving performance for estimation of precipitation at tail ends to evaluate cbpck cross validation experiments are designed and carried out over the north central texas area using 10years worth of hourly data for comparison the mpe algorithms for gauge only and radar gauge analyses are also run to assess performance under different conditions of biasedness in radar qpe ock and cbpck are evaluated with and without bias correcting radar qpe 2 data and methodology in this section we describe the data used quality control of the rain gauge data merging techniques used parameter estimation and evaluation metrics 2 1 data used the analysis domain is a 560 560km2 area in the north central texas region see fig 1 the climate of the domain is humid subtropical with hot summers and relatively mild winters mean annual precipitation varies considerably ranging from less than 500mm to the west to 1200mm to the east the rain gauge data used are from the hydrometeorological automated data system hads which is operated by the nws office of hydrologic development now the office of water prediction a total of 199 rain gauges out of 243 within the analysis domain are chosen following a set of quality control steps the radar data used are from multi radar multi sensor mrms reanalysis nelson et al 2010 zhang et al 2015a at the national centers for environmental information ncei formerly the national climatic data center for which the primary source is the next generation radar nexrad heiss et al 1990 the mrms qpe algorithms are largely based on the national mosaic and multisensor qpe nmq components zhang et al 2011 the mrms incorporates data from different observing systems to create high resolution national multisensor qpe for various applications such as flash flood and flood warnings and water resources management the mrms generates multiple products including radar only local bias corrected radar and gauge only qpes in this work hourly radar only qpe from mrms reanalysis carried out at ncei was used the reanalysis period is 10years 2002 2011 the mrms products were evaluated over the twelve river forecast center service areas in the contiguous us using rain gauge observations from the automated surface observing system wu et al 2012 the results indicated that the radar only qpe from mrms have higher correlation and lower bias compared to those from the weather surveillance radar 1988 doppler version wsr 88d precipitation processing subsystem fulton et al 1998 the radar data used in this work are on a 502 502 grid over the analysis domain with a spatial resolution of 0 01 0 01 the upper left corner of the analysis domain is 35 01 n and 99 00 w 2 2 data quality control qc rain gauge observations are subject to various sources of error such as wind mechanical malfunction electronic malfunction and biological contamination essery and wilcock 1990 fankhauser 1998 sevruk et al 1991 in this work the rain gauge data are quality controlled before being used in multisensor qpe a cap of 125mm is applied to hourly rain gauge observations based on the 100 year hourly precipitation in the analysis domain frederick et al 1977 stevenson and schumacher 2014 to quality control individual rain gauges the probability of precipitation pop and the conditional on positive precipitation coefficient of variation cv of hourly gauge precipitation are calculated for each gauge for the entire period of record seo and breidenbach 2002 the pop is calculated by the number of positive gauge reports divided by the total number of gauge reports based on the regional climatology represented by the general pattern of the statistics the minimum and maximum thresholds of pop and conditional cv are applied respectively if the pop of rain gauge is less than 0 02 or the conditional cv of the rain gauge precipitation is 3 2 the gauge is considered suspect and discarded each rain gauge observation is then compared with the neighboring gauge observations and if determined to be outliers e g fulton et al 1998 is filtered out gauge observations are also compared with radar data to screen out stuck or malfunctioning rain gauges because it is difficult to determine such gauges from hourly data the rain gauge data are accumulated monthly and visually inspected against monthly accumulated radar qpe visual examination of precipitation accumulations at scales smaller than a month is very labor intensive and is not considered in this work to retain as much data as possible only those data associated with suspicious months are excluded other statistics such as the unconditional and conditional mean of gauge and radar precipitation the ratio of the sum of gauge precipitation to the sum of radar precipitation and the indicator and conditional correlation coefficients between gauge and radar precipitation are also examined to aid data quality control not shown 2 3 merging techniques in this section we provide a summary description of the two different merging techniques 1 the variant of ock used in mpe seo et al 2010 algorithm in nws and 2 the bivariate version of ecbpk ecbpk seo et al 2014 or cbpck 2 3 1 ordinary cokriging ock ock estimates the precipitation amount at an ungauged location given the neighboring rain gauge observations and the radar qpe the ock estimator has the following form 1 g k u 0 i 1 n g λ gi g k u i j 1 n r λ rj r k u j 2 i 1 n g λ gi j 1 n r λ rj 1 where g k u 0 denotes the estimated precipitation at the ungauged bin centered at location u 0 in hour k g k u i and r k u j denote the gauge and radar precipitation at location u i in hour k respectively λ gi and λ rj denotes the weights given to the i th gauge and the j th radar data respectively n g and n r denote the number of gauge and radar data used respectively the constraint eq 2 renders the estimate g k u 0 in eq 1 unbiased in the mean sense the weights given to the nearest gauge and radar data λ gi and λ rj in eq 1 respectively are obtained by minimizing the error variance of g k u 0 see seo 1998a b for details note that the choice of the constraint eq 2 assumes that the radar precipitation estimates r k u j are unbiased the optimal weights λ gi and λ rj can be obtained by minimizing the error variance of the estimate j ock 3 j ock var g k u 0 g k u 0 e g k u 0 g k u 0 2 1 i 1 n g n r λ i ρ i 0 μ where μ denotes the lagrange multiplier journel and huijbregts 1978 the optimal weights are a function of the covariance among the gauge observations that among the radar data and the cross covariance among the gauge and radar precipitation the cross covariance is given by seo 1998a b 4 cov g u i r u j e g u i r u i e g u i e r u i e g u i r u i g u i 0 r u j 0 pr g u i 0 r u j 0 e g u i g u i 0 pr g u i 0 e r u j r u j 0 pr r u j 0 in the above the time index k is dropped for notational brevity eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 cov g u i r u j σ g σ r m ig 1 m ig 1 2 m ir 1 m ir 1 2 ρ c u i u j ρ ic u i u j m g m r m ig 1 m ig 1 2 m ir 1 m ir 1 2 ρ ic u i u j σ g σ r m ig m ir ρ c u i u j where σ g and σ r denote the standard deviation of gauge and radar precipitation respectively m ig and m ir denote the mean fractional coverage fc of gauge and radar precipitation respectively m g and m r denote the unconditional mean of gauge and radar precipitation respectively and ρ c u i u j and ρ ic u i u j denote the conditional and indicator cross correlation at a separation distance of u i u j respectively under the assumption of homogeneity the mean fc of precipitation is equivalent to the probability of precipitation pop seo and smith 1996 as in seo 1998b it is assumed in eq 5 that σ g is the same as σ r m ig is the same as m ir ρ c u i u j is the same as ρ ic u i u j and m g is the same as m r these assumptions reduce eq 5 to 6 cov g u i r u j σ r 2 m ir 1 m ir ρ c u i u j ρ ic u i u j m r 2 m ir 1 m ir ρ ic u i u j σ r 2 m ir 2 ρ c u i u j once the covariance terms are specified the optimal weights in eqs 1 and 2 are obtained by solving the so called kriging system journel and huijbregts 1978 7 c gg c gr 1 c rg c rr 1 1 1 0 λ i λ i j μ c 0 g c 0 r 1 where c gg c gr c rg t and c rr denote the n g n g n g n r n r n r cross covariance matrices whose entries are given by cov g u i g u i cov g u i r u j and cov r u j r u j respectively and c 0 g and c 0 r denote the 1 ng and 1 nr cross covariance vectors whose entries are given by cov g u 0 g u i and cov g u 0 r u j respectively i 1 n g j 1 n r if our interest is only in the estimate and not in the estimation of variance ock may be performed using correlation instead of covariance dividing eq 6 with the variance of radar precipitation var r u σ r 2 m ir m r 2 m ir 1 m ir results in the correlation between g u i and r u j being 8 corr g u i r u j cv r 2 1 m ir ρ c u i u j ρ ic u i u j 1 m ir ρ ic u i u j cv r 2 m ir ρ c u i u j cv r 2 1 m ir where cv r denotes the coefficient of variation cv of radar precipitation 2 3 2 conditional bias penalized cokriging cbpck here we describe cbpck which is the bivariate version of ecbpk seo et al 2014 in cbpck the cb penalty term e e g u 0 g u 0 g u 0 2 is added to the objective function where the time index k has also been dropped for notational brevity 9 j cbpck e g u 0 g u 0 2 α e e g u 0 g u 0 g u 0 2 where α denotes the positive weight given to the cb penalty term the weight α can be optimized to improve the balance between reducing error variance and reducing cb if α is zero j cbpck is equivalent to j ock described in section 2 3 1 to specify e g u 0 g u 0 in eq 9 the bayesian optimal estimator schweppe 1973 is used see eq 4 of seo et al 2014 the cbpck system then results from minimizing j cbpck in eq 9 with respect to the weights λ j s 10 j 1 n g n r λ j ρ ij α ρ i 0 ρ j 0 σ i σ j 1 α ρ i 0 σ i σ 0 i 1 n g n r 11 i 1 n g λ gi j 1 n r λ rj 1 where ρ ij denotes the cross correlation between the two variables at u i and u j as formulated above cbpck often produces negative estimates in the areas of light precipitation see seo 2012 seo et al 2014 as with ock cbpck is a second order estimator with no distribution assumptions as such if the variable of interest is non negative it is necessary to correct all negative estimates and reset them to zero such thresholding however necessarily impacts theoretical unbiasedness of cbpck negatively the introduction of γ removes the biases introduced by the thresholding because negative cbpck estimates are more likely to occur where precipitation occurs only in parts of the local estimation domain we condition γ on fc for further details and theoretical justification the reader is referred to seo et al 2015 12 g u 0 cbpck 0 if g u 0 cbpck 0 γ g u 0 cbpck otherwise where g u 0 cbpck denotes the bias corrected cbpck estimate and the scaling coefficient γ is empirically estimated as a function of fc of precipitation over the ungauged location by 13 γ e g u 0 cbpck e g u 0 cbpck g u 0 cbpck 0 where e g u 0 cbpck denotes the spatiotemporal mean of cbpck estimate g u 0 at location u 0 and e g u 0 cbpck g u 0 cbpck 0 denotes the spatiotemporal mean of positive cbpck estimate g u 0 the scaling coefficient γ is estimated for each subrange of fc of precipitation where fc is calculated by dividing the number of neighboring positive observations by the total number of neighboring observations if there are no gauge or radar data within the radius of influence fc is estimated by using the radar or gauge data only respectively if there exist both gauge and radar data within the radius of influence fc is estimated via arithmetic averaging of the two while cbpk is superior to ok over the tail ends of the precipitation distribution it is inferior over the mid ranges as shown for go seo 2012 as such we may choose between cbpck and ock based on the more skillful estimation available depending on the magnitude of the true precipitation in reality we of course do not know what the true precipitation amount is at the ungauged location given that the ock estimate reflects precipitation information in both rain gauge and radar data we consider the ock estimate at the ungauged location to be the most skillful estimate in this work because only the relative position of the ungauged precipitation in the distributional sense rather than the absolute accuracy matters in choosing ock vs cbpck the ock estimate is transformed into the standard normal deviate zock and the weight given to the cb term α is specified based on the zock through a simple functional relationship as a result in the mid ranges of the transformed normal distribution zock is close to zero i e α is very small and hence the final estimate is closer to the ock estimate whereas in the tails zock is large i e α is large and hence the final estimate is closer to the cbpck estimate due to the different quality in radar only qpe two different relationships between α and zock are used for two analysis periods the relationships used are α 0 5zock 2 for the analysis period of 2002 2008 and α 0 286zock 2 for the analysis period of 2008 2011 based on sensitivity analysis 2 4 parameter estimation the merging algorithms used in this work require modeling spatial covariance structures of intermittency and inner variability of precipitation seo 1998a b in this work the correlograms are estimated using the hourly radar qpe under the assumption that the correlogram structures of gauge precipitation are the same as those of radar precipitation seo 1998b ock requires specification of the following parameters the number of nearest neighbors conditional and indicator correlation models for warm and cool seasons and cv of point precipitation each correlation model requires specification of the model type exponential gaussian or spherical and correlation scale both of which are assumed to be common between radar and gauge precipitation and lag 0 correlation of radar and gauge precipitation and lag 0 cross correlation between radar and gauge precipitation the lag 0 cross correlation is assumed to be the same as the lag 0 cross correlation cbpck additionally requires the coefficient c in α c zock 2 in reality precipitation fields are generally anisotropic to determine anisotropy directional experimental correlograms are estimated along the angles of 0 26 6 45 63 4 90 116 6 135 and 153 4 counterclockwise from due east each experimental correlogram is then fitted with the exponential gaussian and spherical models with the nugget effect sill and range as the model parameters journel and huijbregts 1978 for both the conditional and indicator correlograms the exponential model provided the best fit for most cases as such we used the exponential model in all analyses using directional correlograms one may visualize 2 dimensional spatial correlation structure by contour plotting the correlation coefficients fig 2 presents the contour plots of the conditional and indicator correlograms for aug and nov the isotropic structure in aug is associated with convective precipitation in the warm season whereas the anisotropic structure in nov is associated with frontal precipitation in the cool season because the exponential model provides the best fit for all cases examined and the anisotropic correlation structures are not strong for most months averages of the parameter values associated with all directional correlation functions were used because it is impractical to estimate time varying covariance structures due to lack of data and large computing requirements climatological correlograms from the 7 year period of 2002 2008 in table 1 were used in this study the use of climatological warm vs cool season correlation structure as opposed to flow dependent structure that varies dynamically renders the ock and cbpck estimates less than optimal seo and smith 1996 zhang et al 2016 2015b the impact of such suboptimal modeling of correlation structure is generally much larger for unconstrained estimators such as simple kriging or simple cokriging whose weights are not constrained to sum to unity in practice time varying modeling of correlation structure is only feasible for radar precipitation estimates note that even with simplifying assumptions seo 1998 one still has to estimate time varying cross correlation coefficients between radar and rain gauge precipitation a tall order in most areas where rain gauges are sparse for comparison between ock and cbpck one may expect the impact of the above approximation to be small because the two techniques share the same climatological correlation structure additional research is needed however to quantify the marginal value of time varying correlation structure for ock or cbpck and to characterize the spatiotemporal structures of nonstationary rainfall fields see e g schleiss et al 2014 the radius of influence for the neighboring observations is specified by the indicator correlation scale the fc of precipitation within the radius of influence is specified dynamically from rain gauge and radar data at each analysis time by dividing the number of neighboring positive precipitation reporting observations by the total number of neighboring observations that include zero precipitation if both data sources are not available within the radius of influence fc is estimated by using only a single source the number of neighbors used in the estimation process is 30 as determined from sensitivity analysis the actual number of rain gauges used however may vary from hour to hour because only those rain gauges inside of the radius of influence are used in the estimation process 2 5 evaluation metrics to evaluate the proposed method cross validation was carried out for evaluation different performance metrics and plots such as scatter and quantile quantile qq plots were used the evaluation metrics used are root mean squared error rmse reduction and percent reduction in rmse conditional mean and multiplicative bias the rmse conditioned on the minimum threshold of gauge precipitation is used to measure the conditional performance of the estimators the rmse is defined as 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n g u i g u i 2 where g u i denotes the estimated precipitation at location u i g u i denotes the rain gauge precipitation at location u i and n denotes the total number of observations the percent reduction in rmse by cbpck over ock or prirmse cbpck is defined as 15 prirmse cbpck rmse ock rmse cbpck rmse ock 100 where rmse cbpck and rmse ock denote the rmses of cbpck and ock estimates respectively the multiplicative bias is defined as the ratio of the sum of the estimates to the sum of the verifying observations 16 multiplicative bias i 1 n g u i i 1 n g u i 3 results this section presents the evaluation results through cross validation and visual examination for the analysis period of 2002 2011 all results are based on hourly analysis merged fields of hourly precipitation are accumulated to daily to monthly fields as well for visual assessment before comparing results using various metrics we assess the impact of global and monthly bias correction 3 1 bias correction the purpose of this correction is to eliminate or reduce biases in radar qpe due to uncertain z r relationship lack of calibration and temporal changes in the raindrop size distribution smith and krajewski 1991 the ock and cbpck techniques as formulated in this work assume that the radar precipitation estimates are unbiased in reality however the radar qpe may be biased due to various error sources it is hence necessary to assess how the performance of cbpck may vary depending on the presence of bias in the radar only qpe in this work mean field bias correction anagnostou et al 1998 seo et al 1999 smith and krajewski 1991 zhang et al 2011 is applied separately by multiplying the bias correction factor to radar qpe before ock or cbpck is performed the bias correction factor β defined as 17 β i n g k u i g k u i 0 r k u i 0 i n r k u i g k u i 0 r k u i 0 the global bias correction factor is a single number calculated using all positive positive pairs of collocated hourly gauge and radar rainfall data at rain gauge locations at every hour k for the entire period of analysis because of the different quality of radar data two global bias correction factors are estimated for two analysis periods of 2002 2008 and 2008 2011 in the global sense the radar data tend to underestimate gauge precipitation for the period of 2002 2007 whereas they tend to overestimate for the period of 2009 2011 the radar data for 2008 show no significant bias and are included in both analysis periods the global bias correction factors estimated for two periods of 2002 2008 and 2008 2011 are 1 05 radar underestimate by 5 and 0 90 radar overestimate by 10 respectively for the entire period of 2002 2011 the global bias correction factor is close to unity the monthly bias correction factors are also calculated for two periods see fig 3 the figure shows that the monthly bias correction factors are generally larger for 2002 2008 than for 2008 2011 and that the radar qpe generally over and underestimate gauge precipitation during the warm and cool seasons respectively note that the global and monthly bias correction factors do not account for spatial variability of bias since a single value is used for the entire domain 3 2 cross validation to evaluate the proposed technique leave one gauge out cross validation is performed using hourly radar qpe and rain gauge observations the cokriging parameters are estimated using all available data in a dependent validation mode for the cokriging parameters we could have carried out true validation or leave one year out cross validation in which the parameter estimation and validation periods are separated our choice for dependent validation in this work is based on the observation that at multi annual scale the cokriging parameters do not vary significantly the above observation is not surprising in that the parameters are seasonal and reflect a rather large area the leave one gauge out cross validation process comprise the following steps 1 withhold hourly rain gauge observations one at a time and estimate precipitation at the withheld gauge location using all available data 2 compare the estimated amount with the revealed rain gauge observation 3 repeat the above steps for all rain gauge locations in the entire cross validation period cross validation is performed for ock cbpck and go fig 4 shows the percent reduction in rmse by ock red 1 1 for interpretation of color in figs 4 and 7 the reader is referred to the web version of this article over ro and by cbpck green over ro conditional on the verifying gauge precipitation greater than that shown on the x axis following monthly and global bias correction for the analysis period of 2002 2008 bias correction shows little impact in general positive reduction in rmse by cbpck and ock over ro can be seen regardless of the threshold for verifying gauge precipitation amount cbpck is superior to ock over thresholds 30mm but shows limited performance over thresholds less than 30mm for 2008 2011 the monthly and global bias correction before merging provide noticeable improvement in ock whereas the positive impact is only marginal for cbpck for this period ock is inferior to ro except at the tail ends whereas cbpck is superior or comparable to ro at all thresholds for large precipitation amounts significant reduction of up to 20 in rmse by cbpck over ro is seen overall compared to global bias correction monthly bias correction slightly improves the relative performance by ock over ro the relative performance by cbpck over ro on the other hand does not change much between the two bias correction methods given that the impact of bias correction is only marginal below we present the results without bias correction fig 5 shows the reduction in rmse by cbpck and ock over ro conditional on the verifying gauge precipitation greater than that shown on the x axis the reduction in rmse is conditioned also on fc the conditions fc 0 solid line and fc 0 9 dotted line indicate that the fractional coverage of precipitation over the ungauged location is 0 and 0 9 respectively a very high fc means that it is most likely to be precipitating over the ungauged location when fc 0 9 and hourly gauge precipitation is 60mm the reduction in rmse by cbpck over ro is about 12mm the results show that the larger the precipitation amount and fc are the larger the reduction in rmse by both cbpck and ock over ro is when fc is high the margin of improvement by cbpck is greater than that by ock when fc is high both cbpck and ock have smaller rmse than ro regardless of the minimum gauge precipitation note also that cbpck is superior to ock regardless of fc fig 6 shows the multiplicative bias of the ock and cbpck estimates relative to the verifying truth conditional on the verifying gauge precipitation exceeding the threshold shown on the x axis for fc 0 and fc 0 9 although large biases are observed in both the ock and cbpck estimate significant reduction in bias is seen when fc is large i e fc 0 9 the margin of reduction in multiplicative bias by cbpck over ock fig 6 also increases as the thresholding gauge precipitation increases the rather large multiplicative biases seen in the figure reinforce the need for improving estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation at point to small spatial scales for large catchments such large biases are not likely to exist in mean areal precipitation map estimates because in any given hour only a relatively small fraction of the catchment is likely to be receiving heavy to extreme precipitation fig 7 shows the scatter and qq in red plots of the go ro ock and cbpck estimates vs the verifying hourly gauge precipitation only for those data points for which the fc is 0 9 note that go upper left and ock lower left tend to significantly underestimate large precipitation amounts 50mm ro is reasonably conditionally unbiased in the global sense but generally has a larger scatter compared to ock and cbpck the generally positive impact of cbpck may be seen particularly for estimation of large precipitation for small precipitation amounts however the limitation of cbpck may also be seen the isolated cases of significant overestimation of smaller amounts by cbpck compared to ro is due to overestimation in the standard normal space by ock as explained below it is recalled that the weight α for the cb term in cbpck is specified by the standard normal transform of the ock estimate if ock incorrectly overestimates small amounts its estimates are associated with large standard normal deviates resulting in large values of α and hence assigning cbpck estimate rather than ock estimates because of the large analysis domain and multi year analysis period the scatter plots include a large number of large amounts of hourly precipitation as such the plots illustrate very well the large variability of precipitation in the study area and the challenges for accurate qpe lack of representativeness of point gauge precipitation for areal precipitation is an issue due to the often convective nature of the storms in the study area and is a contributing factor to the scatter the representativeness error however does not significantly impact second order error statistics such as root mean square error seo and breidenbach 2002 while the global analysis over the long analysis periods represented in fig 7 is useful for assessment of long term performance the relative performance among go ro ock and cbpck may depend greatly on specific rainfall events that produce very large to extreme amounts of precipitation to assess performance within specific time periods of heavy to extreme precipitation the scatter plots of hourly estimates were visually examined for a number of months that produced large amounts of precipitation fig 8 shows an example of the scatter and qq plots of the hourly estimates for apr 2008 note that cbpck significantly improves over both ro and ock particularly for estimation of large precipitation amounts fig 9 shows the percent reduction in rmse as a function of the minimum fc of precipitation over the ungauged location by cbpck over ock for hourly gauge precipitation greater than the amount shown on the x axis the figure shows that cbpck is superior to ock for precipitation amounts 30mm regardless of fc for fc 0 5 the reduction is positive when gauge precipitation exceeds approximately 15mm and for verifying precipitation exceeding 40mm the reduction is about 8 if the threshold gauge precipitation is less than 10mm however cbpck is inferior to ock regardless of fc the negative reduction in light precipitation arises from the fact that ock minimizes unconditional error variance and hence does better than cbpck for precipitation amounts around the median note that the larger the precipitation amount is the larger the percent reduction in rmse by cbpck is over ock and that the larger the fc is the larger the percent reduction in rmse is fig 10 shows the conditional mean of the gauge denoted as truth ro ock and cbpck estimates for hourly point precipitation amounts greater than that shown on the x axis for fc 0 9 the figure indicates that cbpck reduces conditional mean bias over ock for all ranges and over ro for precipitation amounts exceeding 50mm the margin of improvement by cbpck over ock increases as the threshold of verifying precipitation increases 3 3 precipitation maps the hourly multisensor analyses are accumulated up to a month for visual assessment of the performance of each technique fig 11 shows an example of the hourly analysis fields from go ro ock and cbpck valid at 9pm on mar 18 2008 the go field is generated using ecbpk seo et al 2014 the complementary nature of the multisensor analyses is readily seen note that compared to the ock analysis the cbpck analysis shows increased precipitation in the convective cores fig 12 shows an example of daily accumulation fields valid for mar 18 obtained by aggregating the hourly results similar observations to the hourly example above may be made fig 13 shows an example of monthly accumulation fields valid for mar 2008 obtained by aggregating the hourly results while it is not possible to verify the absolute accuracy of the analyses due to lack of ground truth the above figures suggest that cbpck is able to capture the variability better than ock fig 14 shows the differences in monthly precipitation maps shown in fig 13 ro tends to underestimate the large precipitation amounts seen in go the difference between the monthly ock and cbpck fields ranges from 25 to 70mm note that cbpck significantly increases estimates in areas of heavy precipitation while decreasing estimates over areas of light precipitation 4 conclusions and future research recommendations a new multisensor qpe technique for gauge radar analysis conditional bias penalized cokriging cbpck is developed to improve estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation unlike conventional ordinary cokriging ock or its variants which are susceptible to conditional bias cb cbpck explicitly minimizes both unconditional error variance and type ii cb thereby improving performance for estimation of precipitation at tail ends for evaluation multi year leave one gauge out cross validation was carried out for comparative evaluation of cbpck with the variant of ordinary cokriging ock seo 1998a b currently used in the nws s multisensor precipitation estimation mpe algorithm the analysis domain is a 560 560km2 area in the north central texas region the main findings and conclusions are as follows cbpck improves over ock for estimation of hourly precipitation exceeding 30mm the margin of improvement depends most significantly on fractional coverage fc of precipitation at the ungauged location if fc is 50 or higher cbpck reduces rmse over ock by approximately 8 for hourly precipitation 40mm if fc is 90 or higher i e it is very likely to be precipitating at the ungauged location the margin of improvement is approximately 15 for hourly precipitation 70mm bias correction of radar only qpe before merging tends to improve the performance of both ock and cbpck the improvement is noticeable for ock but marginal at best for cbpck only cbpck however is able to outperform bias corrected radar only ro consistently compared to global bias correction monthly bias correction is marginally more effective it is seen that the radar only qpe from mrms reanalysis is globally biased high by about 10 and over and underestimates gauge precipitation in the warm and cool seasons respectively for the data sets used in this work cbpck is seen to be capable of improving estimation of heavy to extreme precipitation with or without bias correction of ro quality control of rain gauge observations remains a large challenge for objective evaluation there exists a clear need for high quality hourly rain gauge data visual examination of the analysis results at hourly daily and monthly scales of accumulation indicates that compared to ock cbpck increases and decreases the estimated amounts in areas of heavy and light precipitation respectively because the quality of the weighting factor α is only as good as that of the ock estimates there are occasions when cbpck significantly overestimates light precipitation due to mis prognostication of the magnitude of precipitation at the ungauged location for more skillful determination of α it is necessary to incorporate additional sources of precipitation information such as satellite qpe lightning observations and numerical weather prediction nwp output acknowledgements this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no cybersees

7606,eight years of daily rainfall data from wegenernet were analyzed by comparison with data from austrian national weather stations wegenernet includes 153 ground level weather stations in an area of about 15km 20km in the feldbach region in southeast austria rainfall has been measured by tipping bucket gauges at 150 stations of the network since the beginning of 2007 since rain gauge measurements are considered close to true rainfall there are increasing needs for wegenernet data for the validation of rainfall data products such as remote sensing based estimates or model outputs serving these needs this paper aims at providing a clearer interpretation on wegenernet rainfall data for users in hydro meteorological communities five clusters a cluster consists of one national weather station and its four closest wegenernet stations allowed us close comparison of datasets between the stations linear regression analysis and error estimation with statistical indices were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the wegenernet daily rainfall data it was found that rainfall data between the stations show good linear relationships with an average correlation coefficient r of 0 97 while wegenernet sensors tend to underestimate rainfall according to the regression slope 0 87 for the five clusters investigated the bias and relative bias were 0 97 mmd 1 and 11 5 on average except data from new sensors the average of bias and relative bias however could be reduced by about 80 through a simple linear regression slope correction with the assumption that the underestimation in wegenernet data was caused by systematic errors the results from the study have been employed to improve wegenernet data for user applications so that a new version of the data v5 is now available at the wegenernet data portal www wegenernet org keywords precipitation rainfall measurements wegenernet rain gauges high resolution validation 1 introduction rainfall data are essential for a large number of applications the data provide direct inputs for understanding and modeling of heavy rainfall floods and landslides hong et al 2007 medlin et al 2007 offer information for relevant applications such as agriculture and urban drainage systems ines and hansen 2006 villarini et al 2010 and add insights across sectors for example health and insurance hellmuth et al 2009 kirschbaum 2016 such rainfall data can mainly be obtained from gauge measurements or remote sensing based observations e g radars and satellites although it is difficult to obtain the data without introducing systematic errors and other uncertainties sevruk 2005 aghakouchak et al 2012 kirstetter et al 2012 despite recent developments in rainfall estimations using remote sensing techniques to overcome spatial coverage limitations in rain gauge data such ground level gauges remain the true reference since they are the only instruments that give direct measurements of rainfall the data from rain gauges have been merged into radar or satellite algorithms to optimize their rainfall information adler et al 2000 sinclair and pegram 2005 vila et al 2009 nerini et al 2015 and have also been used to validate rainfall datasets produced from remote sensing observations bringi et al 2011 worqlul et al 2014 therefore the availability of proper ground networks is one of the key factors to obtain more accurate rainfall estimations for remote sensing communities habib and krajewski 2002 krajewski et al 2010 kneis et al 2014 sharifi et al 2016 for example the nasa precipitation measurement missions pmm project has operated a ground validation program gv for collecting rain gauge and radar gauge merged data to validate the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the global precipitation measurement gpm satellite products bidwell et al 2004 wolff et al 2005 a high density ground weather station network wegenernet was developed in 2006 to satisfy such requirements for long term high spatial and temporal resolution measurements the wegenernet feldbach region network includes 153 weather stations in an area of about 15km 20km in southeast austria designed to serve as a long term monitoring and validation facility for weather and climate research and applications kirchengast et al 2014 the region is in the alpine foreland shielded by the mountain crest so the climate is more heavily influenced by mediterranean climate systems this leads to mild winters hot summers and summer precipitation dominated by heavy rain from thunderstorms kabas et al 2011 strauss et al 2013 denk and berg 2014 after the beginning of regular measurements in 2007 precipitation data have been used for applications such as the study of small scale rainfall events kabas et al 2011 and for the evaluation of precipitation analyses of the austrian operational nowcasting system inca kann et al 2015 the latter system has also been evaluated for temperature humidity and wind speed using wegenernet measurements data kann et al 2011 however there has been little consideration given to quantitative assessment of the wegenernet precipitation data moreover the need for a careful performance evaluation of the wegenernet data is increasing as more communities request the data as a valuable ground validation reference as did the nasa pmm science team recently fuchsberger et al 2015 when precipitation data from rain gauges are used as reference data in research the main concern is related to uncertainties in the accuracy of areal estimates which stem from the limited spatial representativeness of the gauges villarini et al 2008 in this study however the investigation on agreements with operational gauges in sub areas is given priority over the study of the whole domain of the wegenernet network a spatially uniform and high resolution configuration of the wegenernet implies that it is less likely to suffer from uncertainties in terms of spatial resolution morrissey et al 1995 moreover we are operating our maintenance team not only for data quality control but also for on site routine tasks in the field to assure that the wegenernet can rather be used as a reference to evaluate the uncertainties in other rainfall data for the same domain additionally according to tokay et al 2010 who compared rainfall data between various types of gauges it is recommendable to report the findings from certain gauge networks so that users or network organizers can have the knowledge of a particular gauge type or a network the main objective of this study is to quantitatively evaluate wegenernet daily rainfall data through careful comparison with data from austrian national weather stations based on the results this study suggests a linear correction factor to decrease bias in the wegenernet data the datasets used in the study are introduced in section 2 section 3 describes the research setup including data preparation section 4 presents results and discussion of data analysis and correction finally we conclude by summarizing the main results and discussing considerations for the use of wegenernet data 2 data 2 1 wegenernet fig 1 shows the wegenernet feldbach region network with the 150 weather stations at which precipitation is measured with tipping bucket gauges sevruk 1996 pavlyukov 2007 the region is characterized by the river raab valley and a moderate hilly landscape ranging from 257m to 609m the network was developed in 2006 with the station locations carefully selected to be representative for their local area amongst the neighbor station areas and to be influenced by no or minor nearby obstacles and has been providing station and gridded datasets of temperature precipitation humidity and other parameters since january 2007 data are available at http www wegenernet org the wegenernet and its datasets have already been described in detail by kirchengast et al 2014 so we will only focus on explaining precipitation measurements as we use and evaluate them in the context of this study integrated precipitation amount is sampled every five minutes at each station raw measurements are checked for technical and physical plausibility through a quality control system qcs scheidl 2014 szeberenyi 2014 called level 1 data and are then interpolated and summed up to produce level 2 precipitation data products for a range of time scales from sub daily starting at 5min to annual level 2 daily data are used in this study wegenernet employs three different types of sensors a reference station employs all three sensors and 11 primary stations are equipped with a sensor with heating system so that they can measure solid precipitation see also appendix a for details currently the sensor type in use for these stations is kroneis meteoservis type mr3h hereafter referred to as meteo meteo 2016 note that the stations had r m young model 52202 gauges hereafter young young 2016 until october 2013 when they were all replaced by meteo sensors the majority of stations 138 are base stations which were equipped with a sensor of theodor friedrichs co model 7041 2000 until 2016 hereafter friedrichs friedrichs 2016 without a heating system since recently after a replacement project for the friedrichs sensors within 2016 all base stations are equipped with meteo sensors see section 5 2 2 reference stations precipitation data collected from weather stations operated by the central institute for meteorology and geodynamics zamg and by the austrian hydrographic service ahyd were selected as reference data because of their reliability zamg operates a network of semi automatic stations across the country and ahyd operates a hydrometeorological network both providing quality controlled precipitation data the data from these networks have been used for official records of austrian precipitation data and have enabled the operation of the inca system in austria rudel 2008 haiden et al 2009 2011 the geographic locations of two zamg and three ahyd stations in the study area are shown in fig 1 the zamg stations have tipping bucket gauges with a sensor of anton paar model ap 23 hereafter paar paar 2016 equipped with a heating system both 10 min and daily precipitation data are available ahyd stations provide precipitation data by manual measurement with a daily temporal resolution termed manual hereafter each station is named in this paper by its official number as annotated in fig 1 3 research setup 3 1 data preparation daily data for the eight year period from 2007 to 2014 were used in this study given that a gauge can represent rainfall measurements for a limited spatial extent only wegenernet stations near each reference were selected for comparison see fig 1 right panel five clusters each comprised of one reference station and the four closest wegenernet stations are defined the average distance between a wegenernet station and its reference station is around 1 02km ranging from 0 23 to 2 75km each cluster is labeled with the name of the reference station table 1 lists the selected stations along with information on their data note that for wegenernet stations level 2 data from version 4 were used we considered only pairs of daily rainfall amount data for which wegenernet and reference station values are both non zero and non missing additionally wegenernet data lower than 0 2mmd 1 and reference data lower than 0 1mmd 1 were deleted to avoid false alarms at very low intensities finally solid precipitation data were excluded this will be addressed later in section 4 1 note that the descriptive statistics in table 1 are calculated from the datasets after all data preparation steps 3 2 analyses we first compared data between wegenernet and reference stations using scatter plots with a regression line through the origin eisenhauer 2003 to determine the general behavior of the wegenernet stations let w i and r i be the data from wegenernet and the reference station respectively at the i th day the slope of the regression line can be expressed as 1 slope i 1 n w i r i i 1 n r i 2 where n is the number of available paired daily datasets the pearson correlation coefficient between the data is given by 2 r i 1 n w i 2 i 1 n w i 2 where w i is the i th fitted value of wegenernet data from the linear regression line fit considering the purpose of the study to provide information for wegenernet data users we selected widely used statistical indices for evaluating of the data bias bias and mean absolute error mae are computed according to eqs 3 and 4 relative bias rbias and relative mean absolute error rmae are similar to the bias and mae but they are relative values with respect to the reference values according to eqs 5 and 6 the root mean squared error rmse is defined per eq 7 3 bias i 1 n w i r i n 4 mae i 1 n w i r i n 5 rbias i 1 n w i r i i 1 n r i 100 6 rmae i 1 n w i r i i 1 n r i 100 7 rmse i 1 n w i r i 2 n 4 results and discussion 4 1 data availability after preliminary analyses of errors in the wegenernet data only data with a zero quality flag hereafter q0 were selected for the study the q0 flag means that the data passed the qcs without errors kabas et al 2011 kirchengast et al 2014 the upper part of table 2 shows the percentage of wegenernet precipitation data for each quality flag over the study period the lower availability of q0 data during the winter is caused by solid precipitation measurements since only 12 stations are heated all other stations get interpolated values for solid precipitation those data are marked by a quality flag of 3 or 4 which indicate data interpolated spatially from closest points in derived grid data and missing values due to a lack of sufficient data for the spatial interpolation respectively for further information on the quality flags see appendix a to avoid artificial errors by solid precipitation measurements we decided to focus on wegenernet data collected on days with a minimum temperature above 2 c therefore we will refer to the data used in this study as rainfall rather than more generally as precipitation as a result the availability of q0 data is calculated to be more than 95 for the five clusters as well as for the whole wegenernet network as summarized in the lower part of table 2 around 660 daily records the total amount of rainfall is 4747mm for the study period at each station could be used in the study after data preprocessing before the exclusion of solid precipitation the number of rainy day data was around 710 records the total amount of precipitation was 4961mm at each station the number of available data is larger from april to october around 96 it encompasses the rainy season of austria in which the high spatial resolution network is of special interest in addition it was found that data with a non zero quality flag have larger errors or exceptionally large errors under specific weather conditions such as heavy snowfall the details are addressed for background information in appendix a 4 2 data comparison fig 2 shows a direct comparison of the daily and accumulated rainfall data over the study period at three exemplary clusters h4100 z244 and z298 to give a first impression of the data characteristics the paired datasets follow a similar inter annual and annual variability and well describe an annual rainfall pattern in the recent past including the story of 2009 summer rainfall when southeast austria suffered from heavy rainfall events although there is a fair correspondence between datasets it can be seen from the accumulated rainfall and the peaks of daily rainfall that wegenernet generally depicts lower rainfall records than the reference stations the other two clusters not shown confirm a similar underestimation behavior in the wegenernet data fig 3 displays a linear regression through the origin along with the q q quantile quantile plots to quantify the underestimates the slope slope correlation coefficient r of the linear regression and the number of data used n are specified in each plot the rainfall data show a good correlation with the scattered data along the linear function but the wegenernet sensors tend to underestimate the rainfall in all the stations investigated the slope ranges from 0 81 to 0 98 except for station w145 0 70 which somehow yielded particularly poor agreement with its reference the average of the underestimation factor slope is 0 87 the analysis also indicates that the data from the friedrichs sensors are in closer agreement with the reference data compared to those from the young sensors although only three young sensor stations were included in the study the young sensors show an average slope of 0 82 while the friedrichs sensors show 0 88 the difference in the slope value could be attributed to a systematic error between different sensor types in fact young sensors feature the smallest catching area compared with the other sensors catching area of young sensor is 200cm2 while friedrichs and meteo sensor have 211 and 500cm2 respectively which likely contributes to the undercatch of actual rain amounts or it could be due to the fact that young sensors were partially blocked more often e g by leaves insects or pollen we assume however that such bad data were removed by selecting only the q0 data in section 4 1 the scatter plots reveal that the correlation between the wegenernet and reference data is strong for all clusters regardless of sensor type the correlation coefficient ranges from 0 93 to 0 99 averaging about 0 97 based on this high correlation coefficient between the datasets the underestimation can be regarded as a systematic error due to different gauge or sensor types in addition the q q plots which lie along regression lines show that the linear relationship remains the same in different rain intensity ranges the change in data agreement due to sensor replacements is represented in fig 4 stations w011 w082 and w135 which are currently equipped with meteo sensors had young sensors before october 2013 along with the other stations equipped with friedrichs sensors a linear regression was conducted for each station using data separately before and after the sensor replacements there has been considerable improvement in the data agreement between wegenernet and reference stations after the meteo sensors started reporting their measurements as the average slope jumped from 0 82 to 0 96 on the other hand the friedrichs stations do not show any significant improvement as expected we may need more sampling from the meteo sensors for a longer period to make a fairly firm conclusion nevertheless the result provides strong evidence of higher reliability of these new meteo sensors additionally the improvement in the agreement between the datasets after installing better sensors provided added confidence in the zamg and ahyd data as a reference while checking the outliers in the scatter plots we found cases such as the one shown in fig 5 which can highlight the advantage of the high spatial resolution of the network in spite of the underestimation behavior in the sensors on 8 may 2007 when daily rainfall was recorded as 7 6 mm and 16 4 mm by z244 and the wegenernet stations in the cluster respectively a short term rainfall event occurred during 20min z244 recorded missing values while the wegenernet stations recorded 5 0 mm and a maximum of 3 4 mm 5min 1 at station w134 during the event under normal circumstances we have to rely on the information from the zamg station on the other hand wegenernet can provide more reliable data in terms of spatial uncertainty first the high spatial resolution can overcome the under sampling issue as confirmed graphically in the figure second instantaneous errors at a station can be corrected through the consistency check between the stations therefore the wegenernet network will be particularly valuable to study the intensity and structure of small scale convective rainfall systems 4 3 error analysis the level of agreement between wegenernet and reference station data is measured for each month through bias rbias mae rmae and rmse as defined by eqs 3 7 after removing outliers as shown in fig 6 we removed the outliers based on rmae so as to eliminate errors which probably resulted from unusual cases such as sensor failure rather than systematic differences between the stations the distribution of rmae was calculated using all data from each sensor type e g data from three stations were combined to calculate rmae of young and then two criteria were considered to define outliers first a wegenernet station in a cluster showed rmae higher than the 95th percentile which was 100 0 for the friedrichs and 94 3 for the young sensor but the other three stations did not second rmae was higher than the 80th percentile at all four wegenernet stations in a cluster 41 7 for the friedrichs and 51 7 for the young sensor as expected the average bias shows a negative value amounting to 0 84 mmd 1 the rbias ranges from 6 9 in january to 12 1 in july averaging 10 1 which shows that monthly rbias lies within a certain limited range of values the averages of mae rmae and rmse are 1 37mmd 1 16 5 2 33 mmd 1 respectively the monthly averages mae rmae and rmse range from 0 72 to 2 17 mmd 1 from 11 9 to 19 9 and from 0 95 to 3 85 mmd 1 respectively large values for mae and rmse 1 75 mmd 1 and 3 19mmd 1 on average appear during may september during the summer season the dominant rainfall type in the region is often a convective system associated with high rain rates which can lead to higher mae and rmse during this season some high error values were investigated in detail first the data from december to february show a wider range of errors or a different behavior e g positive bias that is probably due to the small number of available records during the winter season sometimes less than 10 daily datasets at a station for a month next the w145 station has relatively high errors for example the outlier of strong negative bias in july and august was recorded at this station this somehow shows poorer performance than the others which is consistent with the results in section 4 2 4 4 bias correction according to wagner 2009 63 of surveyed research institutions across europe did not conduct precipitation correction and corrections mostly covered only the filling of data gaps wagner 2009 also studied several correction methods using wind speed or raindrop size data at the same time however the results indicated that it is difficult to recommend a specific method since error strongly depends on the site s surroundings moreover it would be ambiguous to define a new function between errors in wegenernet data and specific parameters for data correction it may be due to the fact that the correction equations were often defined under an ideal experimental environment while wegenernet data contain various and combined error sources caused by the different sensor types and their individual characteristics in section 4 2 we confirmed that wegenernet rainfall data show a high correlation with the references besides we further compared wegenernet and references data at sub daily time scales to check the robustness of the linear relationship differences in time scales did not result in significant variations in the slope values not shown note that the sub daily comparison was restricted to the clusters around zamg stations although we have limited data six friedrichs stations except w145 we found that the average slope is 0 85 for daily data and 0 84 for hourly data these analyses led to the decision that it is sufficient to use a simple linear correction factor derived from the regression line slopes to reliably reduce the bias in wegenernet rainfall data without overdoing the case the fundamental concept of the correction is to apply a correction factor a defined as the inverse of one common slope of the linear regression between datasets from all 19 wegenernet stations except w145 and the corresponding reference stations the linear regression function to predict correct toward true values was calculated for friedrichs and young separately as shown in table 3 meteo sensors were not included in the correction procedure since they had been found to have the same quality level as the reference stations without correction see fig 4 the form of the simple correction is as follows 8 x a x where a is the inverse of slope x is the rainfall intensity mmd 1 measured by wegenernet stations before the correction and x is the bias corrected rainfall intensity mmd 1 fig 7 shows bias rbias and slope before and after the correction at each station for all five clusters related average numbers are shown in table 4 before the correction the average of bias rbias and slope had values of 0 97 mmd 1 11 5 and 0 87 respectively station w027 is the only one having a positive bias of 0 28 mmd 1 which is the smallest bias in absolute terms this station also has the best agreement with its reference according to the scatter plot in the previous section fig 3 the average values of bias and rbias of meteo data no correction are 0 30 mmd 1 and 3 1 respectively after applying the correction factor the accuracy of wegenernet rainfall data improved in terms of both bias and rbias which decreased to 0 20 mmd 1 and to 2 5 on average respectively the average of the slope also improved by about 10 from 0 87 to 0 96 which is much closer to the one to one line on the other hand some stations like w027 and w006 were overcorrected but positive results clearly dominate 5 conclusions the main purpose of the study was to provide insight into wegenernet daily rainfall data regarding general data characteristics and their associated errors therefore we undertook to characterize wegenernet precipitation data through comparison and error analyses against precipitation data from national weather stations the comparison conducted in five station clusters of four wegenernet and one reference station each showed good agreement between the datasets but also that the wegenernet stations somewhat underestimate rainfall amounts the underestimates of wegenernet data contribute to a negative bias and relative bias which have values of 0 97 mmd 1 and 11 5 respectively such underestimation applies to the friedrichs and young sensor data in wegenernet the meteo sensor data are in good agreement with the reference stations along these lines we found a clear improvement in the data agreement with the reference stations after replacement of young by meteo sensors at some of wegenernet stations to mitigate the biases of around 12 from the friedrichs and young sensors we derived simple bias correction factors based on the regression line slope calculated by all data from each sensor type which were found to effectively reduce the biases by around 80 findings from the study raise several points firstly studies on wegenernet data under various weather conditions can be informative for the use of data for a specific purpose for example for validating other data e g from radar or model output fields further quantitative evaluations on the sub daily data or on the specific events such as extreme rainfall light rainfall and solid precipitation could provide more detailed information on the uncertainties in the data secondly an additional analysis on the whole wegenernet station network is required to assess uncertainties in the spatial sampling of the data that are of interest particularly for the use of wegenernet as a ground validation reference lastly the high spatial resolution of wegenernet data can be beneficial for addressing research questions that need rainfall data at different scales over the 1 km to 10 km scale range for example the sensitivity of small catchment models to rainfall data or the evaluation of rainfall under sampling during intense convective rainfall events could draw key advantages from wegenernet datasets as a consequence the results from this study have been reflected in the operation and maintenance of the wegenernet and in the improvement of the data for user applications for example the bias correction factors in this study for the friedrichs and young sensors were applied to all rainfall values in the new version v5 level 2 data all versions are available at the wegenernet data portal furthermore we concluded that there was a mechanical problem in the sensor of station w145 which showed strong underestimates rather than systematic errors so it has already been replaced in addition and as a fundamental long term improvement a major sensor replacement cycle during 2016 after about 10years of wegenernet operations was recently completed by august 2016 we installed the high quality meteo sensors also at all 138 base stations in the complete network during this cycle at these stations without a heating system at the same time we keep operating the wegenernet reference station with all the three different sensors for the purpose of continuing sensor intercomparison we therefore expect that wegenernet will be a unique high density precipitation measurement network for the hydro meteorological communities for many years to come acknowledgments we acknowledge the zentralanstalt für meteorologie und geodynamik zamg and the austrian hydrographical services ahyd for providing

information on team partners and sponsors is available online at www wegcenter at wegenernet appendix a quality flags and errors in wegenernet daily precipitation data this appendix addresses errors in wegenernet daily precipitation data 2007 2014 for all quality flag levels of the data see table 2 for the brief description of quality flags and kirchengast et al 2014 for details note that the quality flag for daily data is an average of all flags on native resolution 5min data figs a 1 and a 2 present bias and rmse of wegenernet data compared to the reference stations respectively similar to fig 6 but for all quality flag levels the errors were obtained for each month since table 2 indicated that the number of quality flags is seasonally dependent there are more non zero quality flagged data during winter which is related to solid precipitation the wegenernet quality control system qcs assumes that the station measures solid precipitation if the mean measured temperature during the last five hours is lower than 2 c then the stations with friedrichs sensors get spatially interpolated values of the measurement at the 12 heated stations instead of their own measurements those data are flagged by a quality flag of 3 interpolation from grid or 4 no interpolation possible e g if some of the heated stations have malfunctions from may to september the temperature is mostly above 2 c so there are always enough unheated stations for direct interpolation q2 flag this is why there are no errors from q3 and q4 data during this period as depicted in the figures generally figs a 1 and a 2 show that q0 data cause the smallest errors for bias and rmse relatively high errors are observed from the q1 data around summer from may to september while the high errors for q3 or q4 data are detected during the months from october to april to illustrate the source of the errors one case of q1 data in august and one of q4 data in april were further investigated using 10 min data of the wegenernet and zamg stations during a short duration rainfall event in the cluster of z298 on 2 august 2008 only the w060 station data were flagged by q1 and the rainfall recorded at the station was 6 8 mmd 1 which is much less than other wegenernet stations 11 5 mmd 1 on average and the reference 19 1 mmd 1 raw measurements at w060 were flagged by the qcs for several hours since the values deviated too much from the values of neighboring stations probably due to a blocked funnel at the station since only raw measurements that passed all qcs checks are used to generate the data 5 min data at station w60 were generated through spatial interpolation i e flagged by q2 and the daily data consequentially has a q1 flag from averaging with q0 data during a day another example is a solid precipitation event in cluster z244 on 2 april 2013 austria had an unusually cold spring in 2013 and temperatures had been below 2 c for most of the day as a result the wegenernet qcs decided to interpolate data from the heated stations to generate the solid precipitation data except for two hours in the afternoon when the temperature rose above 2 c for a while however the qcs could not secure enough data for the interpolation due to malfunctions of most heating systems finally we get only the missing values q4 flag this leads to discrepancies in the daily data records between stations wegenernet recorded 10 6 mmd 1 while zamg recorded 17 5 mmd 1 in conclusion it was found that a small amount of data collected under a specific adverse weather conditions can cause unexpectedly high errors in daily data records therefore we minimized those errors by using only q0 rainfall data in this study 
7606,eight years of daily rainfall data from wegenernet were analyzed by comparison with data from austrian national weather stations wegenernet includes 153 ground level weather stations in an area of about 15km 20km in the feldbach region in southeast austria rainfall has been measured by tipping bucket gauges at 150 stations of the network since the beginning of 2007 since rain gauge measurements are considered close to true rainfall there are increasing needs for wegenernet data for the validation of rainfall data products such as remote sensing based estimates or model outputs serving these needs this paper aims at providing a clearer interpretation on wegenernet rainfall data for users in hydro meteorological communities five clusters a cluster consists of one national weather station and its four closest wegenernet stations allowed us close comparison of datasets between the stations linear regression analysis and error estimation with statistical indices were conducted to quantitatively evaluate the wegenernet daily rainfall data it was found that rainfall data between the stations show good linear relationships with an average correlation coefficient r of 0 97 while wegenernet sensors tend to underestimate rainfall according to the regression slope 0 87 for the five clusters investigated the bias and relative bias were 0 97 mmd 1 and 11 5 on average except data from new sensors the average of bias and relative bias however could be reduced by about 80 through a simple linear regression slope correction with the assumption that the underestimation in wegenernet data was caused by systematic errors the results from the study have been employed to improve wegenernet data for user applications so that a new version of the data v5 is now available at the wegenernet data portal www wegenernet org keywords precipitation rainfall measurements wegenernet rain gauges high resolution validation 1 introduction rainfall data are essential for a large number of applications the data provide direct inputs for understanding and modeling of heavy rainfall floods and landslides hong et al 2007 medlin et al 2007 offer information for relevant applications such as agriculture and urban drainage systems ines and hansen 2006 villarini et al 2010 and add insights across sectors for example health and insurance hellmuth et al 2009 kirschbaum 2016 such rainfall data can mainly be obtained from gauge measurements or remote sensing based observations e g radars and satellites although it is difficult to obtain the data without introducing systematic errors and other uncertainties sevruk 2005 aghakouchak et al 2012 kirstetter et al 2012 despite recent developments in rainfall estimations using remote sensing techniques to overcome spatial coverage limitations in rain gauge data such ground level gauges remain the true reference since they are the only instruments that give direct measurements of rainfall the data from rain gauges have been merged into radar or satellite algorithms to optimize their rainfall information adler et al 2000 sinclair and pegram 2005 vila et al 2009 nerini et al 2015 and have also been used to validate rainfall datasets produced from remote sensing observations bringi et al 2011 worqlul et al 2014 therefore the availability of proper ground networks is one of the key factors to obtain more accurate rainfall estimations for remote sensing communities habib and krajewski 2002 krajewski et al 2010 kneis et al 2014 sharifi et al 2016 for example the nasa precipitation measurement missions pmm project has operated a ground validation program gv for collecting rain gauge and radar gauge merged data to validate the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and the global precipitation measurement gpm satellite products bidwell et al 2004 wolff et al 2005 a high density ground weather station network wegenernet was developed in 2006 to satisfy such requirements for long term high spatial and temporal resolution measurements the wegenernet feldbach region network includes 153 weather stations in an area of about 15km 20km in southeast austria designed to serve as a long term monitoring and validation facility for weather and climate research and applications kirchengast et al 2014 the region is in the alpine foreland shielded by the mountain crest so the climate is more heavily influenced by mediterranean climate systems this leads to mild winters hot summers and summer precipitation dominated by heavy rain from thunderstorms kabas et al 2011 strauss et al 2013 denk and berg 2014 after the beginning of regular measurements in 2007 precipitation data have been used for applications such as the study of small scale rainfall events kabas et al 2011 and for the evaluation of precipitation analyses of the austrian operational nowcasting system inca kann et al 2015 the latter system has also been evaluated for temperature humidity and wind speed using wegenernet measurements data kann et al 2011 however there has been little consideration given to quantitative assessment of the wegenernet precipitation data moreover the need for a careful performance evaluation of the wegenernet data is increasing as more communities request the data as a valuable ground validation reference as did the nasa pmm science team recently fuchsberger et al 2015 when precipitation data from rain gauges are used as reference data in research the main concern is related to uncertainties in the accuracy of areal estimates which stem from the limited spatial representativeness of the gauges villarini et al 2008 in this study however the investigation on agreements with operational gauges in sub areas is given priority over the study of the whole domain of the wegenernet network a spatially uniform and high resolution configuration of the wegenernet implies that it is less likely to suffer from uncertainties in terms of spatial resolution morrissey et al 1995 moreover we are operating our maintenance team not only for data quality control but also for on site routine tasks in the field to assure that the wegenernet can rather be used as a reference to evaluate the uncertainties in other rainfall data for the same domain additionally according to tokay et al 2010 who compared rainfall data between various types of gauges it is recommendable to report the findings from certain gauge networks so that users or network organizers can have the knowledge of a particular gauge type or a network the main objective of this study is to quantitatively evaluate wegenernet daily rainfall data through careful comparison with data from austrian national weather stations based on the results this study suggests a linear correction factor to decrease bias in the wegenernet data the datasets used in the study are introduced in section 2 section 3 describes the research setup including data preparation section 4 presents results and discussion of data analysis and correction finally we conclude by summarizing the main results and discussing considerations for the use of wegenernet data 2 data 2 1 wegenernet fig 1 shows the wegenernet feldbach region network with the 150 weather stations at which precipitation is measured with tipping bucket gauges sevruk 1996 pavlyukov 2007 the region is characterized by the river raab valley and a moderate hilly landscape ranging from 257m to 609m the network was developed in 2006 with the station locations carefully selected to be representative for their local area amongst the neighbor station areas and to be influenced by no or minor nearby obstacles and has been providing station and gridded datasets of temperature precipitation humidity and other parameters since january 2007 data are available at http www wegenernet org the wegenernet and its datasets have already been described in detail by kirchengast et al 2014 so we will only focus on explaining precipitation measurements as we use and evaluate them in the context of this study integrated precipitation amount is sampled every five minutes at each station raw measurements are checked for technical and physical plausibility through a quality control system qcs scheidl 2014 szeberenyi 2014 called level 1 data and are then interpolated and summed up to produce level 2 precipitation data products for a range of time scales from sub daily starting at 5min to annual level 2 daily data are used in this study wegenernet employs three different types of sensors a reference station employs all three sensors and 11 primary stations are equipped with a sensor with heating system so that they can measure solid precipitation see also appendix a for details currently the sensor type in use for these stations is kroneis meteoservis type mr3h hereafter referred to as meteo meteo 2016 note that the stations had r m young model 52202 gauges hereafter young young 2016 until october 2013 when they were all replaced by meteo sensors the majority of stations 138 are base stations which were equipped with a sensor of theodor friedrichs co model 7041 2000 until 2016 hereafter friedrichs friedrichs 2016 without a heating system since recently after a replacement project for the friedrichs sensors within 2016 all base stations are equipped with meteo sensors see section 5 2 2 reference stations precipitation data collected from weather stations operated by the central institute for meteorology and geodynamics zamg and by the austrian hydrographic service ahyd were selected as reference data because of their reliability zamg operates a network of semi automatic stations across the country and ahyd operates a hydrometeorological network both providing quality controlled precipitation data the data from these networks have been used for official records of austrian precipitation data and have enabled the operation of the inca system in austria rudel 2008 haiden et al 2009 2011 the geographic locations of two zamg and three ahyd stations in the study area are shown in fig 1 the zamg stations have tipping bucket gauges with a sensor of anton paar model ap 23 hereafter paar paar 2016 equipped with a heating system both 10 min and daily precipitation data are available ahyd stations provide precipitation data by manual measurement with a daily temporal resolution termed manual hereafter each station is named in this paper by its official number as annotated in fig 1 3 research setup 3 1 data preparation daily data for the eight year period from 2007 to 2014 were used in this study given that a gauge can represent rainfall measurements for a limited spatial extent only wegenernet stations near each reference were selected for comparison see fig 1 right panel five clusters each comprised of one reference station and the four closest wegenernet stations are defined the average distance between a wegenernet station and its reference station is around 1 02km ranging from 0 23 to 2 75km each cluster is labeled with the name of the reference station table 1 lists the selected stations along with information on their data note that for wegenernet stations level 2 data from version 4 were used we considered only pairs of daily rainfall amount data for which wegenernet and reference station values are both non zero and non missing additionally wegenernet data lower than 0 2mmd 1 and reference data lower than 0 1mmd 1 were deleted to avoid false alarms at very low intensities finally solid precipitation data were excluded this will be addressed later in section 4 1 note that the descriptive statistics in table 1 are calculated from the datasets after all data preparation steps 3 2 analyses we first compared data between wegenernet and reference stations using scatter plots with a regression line through the origin eisenhauer 2003 to determine the general behavior of the wegenernet stations let w i and r i be the data from wegenernet and the reference station respectively at the i th day the slope of the regression line can be expressed as 1 slope i 1 n w i r i i 1 n r i 2 where n is the number of available paired daily datasets the pearson correlation coefficient between the data is given by 2 r i 1 n w i 2 i 1 n w i 2 where w i is the i th fitted value of wegenernet data from the linear regression line fit considering the purpose of the study to provide information for wegenernet data users we selected widely used statistical indices for evaluating of the data bias bias and mean absolute error mae are computed according to eqs 3 and 4 relative bias rbias and relative mean absolute error rmae are similar to the bias and mae but they are relative values with respect to the reference values according to eqs 5 and 6 the root mean squared error rmse is defined per eq 7 3 bias i 1 n w i r i n 4 mae i 1 n w i r i n 5 rbias i 1 n w i r i i 1 n r i 100 6 rmae i 1 n w i r i i 1 n r i 100 7 rmse i 1 n w i r i 2 n 4 results and discussion 4 1 data availability after preliminary analyses of errors in the wegenernet data only data with a zero quality flag hereafter q0 were selected for the study the q0 flag means that the data passed the qcs without errors kabas et al 2011 kirchengast et al 2014 the upper part of table 2 shows the percentage of wegenernet precipitation data for each quality flag over the study period the lower availability of q0 data during the winter is caused by solid precipitation measurements since only 12 stations are heated all other stations get interpolated values for solid precipitation those data are marked by a quality flag of 3 or 4 which indicate data interpolated spatially from closest points in derived grid data and missing values due to a lack of sufficient data for the spatial interpolation respectively for further information on the quality flags see appendix a to avoid artificial errors by solid precipitation measurements we decided to focus on wegenernet data collected on days with a minimum temperature above 2 c therefore we will refer to the data used in this study as rainfall rather than more generally as precipitation as a result the availability of q0 data is calculated to be more than 95 for the five clusters as well as for the whole wegenernet network as summarized in the lower part of table 2 around 660 daily records the total amount of rainfall is 4747mm for the study period at each station could be used in the study after data preprocessing before the exclusion of solid precipitation the number of rainy day data was around 710 records the total amount of precipitation was 4961mm at each station the number of available data is larger from april to october around 96 it encompasses the rainy season of austria in which the high spatial resolution network is of special interest in addition it was found that data with a non zero quality flag have larger errors or exceptionally large errors under specific weather conditions such as heavy snowfall the details are addressed for background information in appendix a 4 2 data comparison fig 2 shows a direct comparison of the daily and accumulated rainfall data over the study period at three exemplary clusters h4100 z244 and z298 to give a first impression of the data characteristics the paired datasets follow a similar inter annual and annual variability and well describe an annual rainfall pattern in the recent past including the story of 2009 summer rainfall when southeast austria suffered from heavy rainfall events although there is a fair correspondence between datasets it can be seen from the accumulated rainfall and the peaks of daily rainfall that wegenernet generally depicts lower rainfall records than the reference stations the other two clusters not shown confirm a similar underestimation behavior in the wegenernet data fig 3 displays a linear regression through the origin along with the q q quantile quantile plots to quantify the underestimates the slope slope correlation coefficient r of the linear regression and the number of data used n are specified in each plot the rainfall data show a good correlation with the scattered data along the linear function but the wegenernet sensors tend to underestimate the rainfall in all the stations investigated the slope ranges from 0 81 to 0 98 except for station w145 0 70 which somehow yielded particularly poor agreement with its reference the average of the underestimation factor slope is 0 87 the analysis also indicates that the data from the friedrichs sensors are in closer agreement with the reference data compared to those from the young sensors although only three young sensor stations were included in the study the young sensors show an average slope of 0 82 while the friedrichs sensors show 0 88 the difference in the slope value could be attributed to a systematic error between different sensor types in fact young sensors feature the smallest catching area compared with the other sensors catching area of young sensor is 200cm2 while friedrichs and meteo sensor have 211 and 500cm2 respectively which likely contributes to the undercatch of actual rain amounts or it could be due to the fact that young sensors were partially blocked more often e g by leaves insects or pollen we assume however that such bad data were removed by selecting only the q0 data in section 4 1 the scatter plots reveal that the correlation between the wegenernet and reference data is strong for all clusters regardless of sensor type the correlation coefficient ranges from 0 93 to 0 99 averaging about 0 97 based on this high correlation coefficient between the datasets the underestimation can be regarded as a systematic error due to different gauge or sensor types in addition the q q plots which lie along regression lines show that the linear relationship remains the same in different rain intensity ranges the change in data agreement due to sensor replacements is represented in fig 4 stations w011 w082 and w135 which are currently equipped with meteo sensors had young sensors before october 2013 along with the other stations equipped with friedrichs sensors a linear regression was conducted for each station using data separately before and after the sensor replacements there has been considerable improvement in the data agreement between wegenernet and reference stations after the meteo sensors started reporting their measurements as the average slope jumped from 0 82 to 0 96 on the other hand the friedrichs stations do not show any significant improvement as expected we may need more sampling from the meteo sensors for a longer period to make a fairly firm conclusion nevertheless the result provides strong evidence of higher reliability of these new meteo sensors additionally the improvement in the agreement between the datasets after installing better sensors provided added confidence in the zamg and ahyd data as a reference while checking the outliers in the scatter plots we found cases such as the one shown in fig 5 which can highlight the advantage of the high spatial resolution of the network in spite of the underestimation behavior in the sensors on 8 may 2007 when daily rainfall was recorded as 7 6 mm and 16 4 mm by z244 and the wegenernet stations in the cluster respectively a short term rainfall event occurred during 20min z244 recorded missing values while the wegenernet stations recorded 5 0 mm and a maximum of 3 4 mm 5min 1 at station w134 during the event under normal circumstances we have to rely on the information from the zamg station on the other hand wegenernet can provide more reliable data in terms of spatial uncertainty first the high spatial resolution can overcome the under sampling issue as confirmed graphically in the figure second instantaneous errors at a station can be corrected through the consistency check between the stations therefore the wegenernet network will be particularly valuable to study the intensity and structure of small scale convective rainfall systems 4 3 error analysis the level of agreement between wegenernet and reference station data is measured for each month through bias rbias mae rmae and rmse as defined by eqs 3 7 after removing outliers as shown in fig 6 we removed the outliers based on rmae so as to eliminate errors which probably resulted from unusual cases such as sensor failure rather than systematic differences between the stations the distribution of rmae was calculated using all data from each sensor type e g data from three stations were combined to calculate rmae of young and then two criteria were considered to define outliers first a wegenernet station in a cluster showed rmae higher than the 95th percentile which was 100 0 for the friedrichs and 94 3 for the young sensor but the other three stations did not second rmae was higher than the 80th percentile at all four wegenernet stations in a cluster 41 7 for the friedrichs and 51 7 for the young sensor as expected the average bias shows a negative value amounting to 0 84 mmd 1 the rbias ranges from 6 9 in january to 12 1 in july averaging 10 1 which shows that monthly rbias lies within a certain limited range of values the averages of mae rmae and rmse are 1 37mmd 1 16 5 2 33 mmd 1 respectively the monthly averages mae rmae and rmse range from 0 72 to 2 17 mmd 1 from 11 9 to 19 9 and from 0 95 to 3 85 mmd 1 respectively large values for mae and rmse 1 75 mmd 1 and 3 19mmd 1 on average appear during may september during the summer season the dominant rainfall type in the region is often a convective system associated with high rain rates which can lead to higher mae and rmse during this season some high error values were investigated in detail first the data from december to february show a wider range of errors or a different behavior e g positive bias that is probably due to the small number of available records during the winter season sometimes less than 10 daily datasets at a station for a month next the w145 station has relatively high errors for example the outlier of strong negative bias in july and august was recorded at this station this somehow shows poorer performance than the others which is consistent with the results in section 4 2 4 4 bias correction according to wagner 2009 63 of surveyed research institutions across europe did not conduct precipitation correction and corrections mostly covered only the filling of data gaps wagner 2009 also studied several correction methods using wind speed or raindrop size data at the same time however the results indicated that it is difficult to recommend a specific method since error strongly depends on the site s surroundings moreover it would be ambiguous to define a new function between errors in wegenernet data and specific parameters for data correction it may be due to the fact that the correction equations were often defined under an ideal experimental environment while wegenernet data contain various and combined error sources caused by the different sensor types and their individual characteristics in section 4 2 we confirmed that wegenernet rainfall data show a high correlation with the references besides we further compared wegenernet and references data at sub daily time scales to check the robustness of the linear relationship differences in time scales did not result in significant variations in the slope values not shown note that the sub daily comparison was restricted to the clusters around zamg stations although we have limited data six friedrichs stations except w145 we found that the average slope is 0 85 for daily data and 0 84 for hourly data these analyses led to the decision that it is sufficient to use a simple linear correction factor derived from the regression line slopes to reliably reduce the bias in wegenernet rainfall data without overdoing the case the fundamental concept of the correction is to apply a correction factor a defined as the inverse of one common slope of the linear regression between datasets from all 19 wegenernet stations except w145 and the corresponding reference stations the linear regression function to predict correct toward true values was calculated for friedrichs and young separately as shown in table 3 meteo sensors were not included in the correction procedure since they had been found to have the same quality level as the reference stations without correction see fig 4 the form of the simple correction is as follows 8 x a x where a is the inverse of slope x is the rainfall intensity mmd 1 measured by wegenernet stations before the correction and x is the bias corrected rainfall intensity mmd 1 fig 7 shows bias rbias and slope before and after the correction at each station for all five clusters related average numbers are shown in table 4 before the correction the average of bias rbias and slope had values of 0 97 mmd 1 11 5 and 0 87 respectively station w027 is the only one having a positive bias of 0 28 mmd 1 which is the smallest bias in absolute terms this station also has the best agreement with its reference according to the scatter plot in the previous section fig 3 the average values of bias and rbias of meteo data no correction are 0 30 mmd 1 and 3 1 respectively after applying the correction factor the accuracy of wegenernet rainfall data improved in terms of both bias and rbias which decreased to 0 20 mmd 1 and to 2 5 on average respectively the average of the slope also improved by about 10 from 0 87 to 0 96 which is much closer to the one to one line on the other hand some stations like w027 and w006 were overcorrected but positive results clearly dominate 5 conclusions the main purpose of the study was to provide insight into wegenernet daily rainfall data regarding general data characteristics and their associated errors therefore we undertook to characterize wegenernet precipitation data through comparison and error analyses against precipitation data from national weather stations the comparison conducted in five station clusters of four wegenernet and one reference station each showed good agreement between the datasets but also that the wegenernet stations somewhat underestimate rainfall amounts the underestimates of wegenernet data contribute to a negative bias and relative bias which have values of 0 97 mmd 1 and 11 5 respectively such underestimation applies to the friedrichs and young sensor data in wegenernet the meteo sensor data are in good agreement with the reference stations along these lines we found a clear improvement in the data agreement with the reference stations after replacement of young by meteo sensors at some of wegenernet stations to mitigate the biases of around 12 from the friedrichs and young sensors we derived simple bias correction factors based on the regression line slope calculated by all data from each sensor type which were found to effectively reduce the biases by around 80 findings from the study raise several points firstly studies on wegenernet data under various weather conditions can be informative for the use of data for a specific purpose for example for validating other data e g from radar or model output fields further quantitative evaluations on the sub daily data or on the specific events such as extreme rainfall light rainfall and solid precipitation could provide more detailed information on the uncertainties in the data secondly an additional analysis on the whole wegenernet station network is required to assess uncertainties in the spatial sampling of the data that are of interest particularly for the use of wegenernet as a ground validation reference lastly the high spatial resolution of wegenernet data can be beneficial for addressing research questions that need rainfall data at different scales over the 1 km to 10 km scale range for example the sensitivity of small catchment models to rainfall data or the evaluation of rainfall under sampling during intense convective rainfall events could draw key advantages from wegenernet datasets as a consequence the results from this study have been reflected in the operation and maintenance of the wegenernet and in the improvement of the data for user applications for example the bias correction factors in this study for the friedrichs and young sensors were applied to all rainfall values in the new version v5 level 2 data all versions are available at the wegenernet data portal furthermore we concluded that there was a mechanical problem in the sensor of station w145 which showed strong underestimates rather than systematic errors so it has already been replaced in addition and as a fundamental long term improvement a major sensor replacement cycle during 2016 after about 10years of wegenernet operations was recently completed by august 2016 we installed the high quality meteo sensors also at all 138 base stations in the complete network during this cycle at these stations without a heating system at the same time we keep operating the wegenernet reference station with all the three different sensors for the purpose of continuing sensor intercomparison we therefore expect that wegenernet will be a unique high density precipitation measurement network for the hydro meteorological communities for many years to come acknowledgments we acknowledge the zentralanstalt für meteorologie und geodynamik zamg and the austrian hydrographical services ahyd for providing

in wegenernet daily precipitation data 2007 2014 for all quality flag levels of the data see table 2 for the brief description of quality flags and kirchengast et al 2014 for details note that the quality flag for daily data is an average of all flags on native resolution 5min data figs a 1 and a 2 present bias and rmse of wegenernet data compared to the reference stations respectively similar to fig 6 but for all quality flag levels the errors were obtained for each month since table 2 indicated that the number of quality flags is seasonally dependent there are more non zero quality flagged data during winter which is related to solid precipitation the wegenernet quality control system qcs assumes that the station measures solid precipitation if the mean measured temperature during the last five hours is lower than 2 c then the stations with friedrichs sensors get spatially interpolated values of the measurement at the 12 heated stations instead of their own measurements those data are flagged by a quality flag of 3 interpolation from grid or 4 no interpolation possible e g if some of the heated stations have malfunctions from may to september the temperature is mostly above 2 c so there are always enough unheated stations for direct interpolation q2 flag this is why there are no errors from q3 and q4 data during this period as depicted in the figures generally figs a 1 and a 2 show that q0 data cause the smallest errors for bias and rmse relatively high errors are observed from the q1 data around summer from may to september while the high errors for q3 or q4 data are detected during the months from october to april to illustrate the source of the errors one case of q1 data in august and one of q4 data in april were further investigated using 10 min data of the wegenernet and zamg stations during a short duration rainfall event in the cluster of z298 on 2 august 2008 only the w060 station data were flagged by q1 and the rainfall recorded at the station was 6 8 mmd 1 which is much less than other wegenernet stations 11 5 mmd 1 on average and the reference 19 1 mmd 1 raw measurements at w060 were flagged by the qcs for several hours since the values deviated too much from the values of neighboring stations probably due to a blocked funnel at the station since only raw measurements that passed all qcs checks are used to generate the data 5 min data at station w60 were generated through spatial interpolation i e flagged by q2 and the daily data consequentially has a q1 flag from averaging with q0 data during a day another example is a solid precipitation event in cluster z244 on 2 april 2013 austria had an unusually cold spring in 2013 and temperatures had been below 2 c for most of the day as a result the wegenernet qcs decided to interpolate data from the heated stations to generate the solid precipitation data except for two hours in the afternoon when the temperature rose above 2 c for a while however the qcs could not secure enough data for the interpolation due to malfunctions of most heating systems finally we get only the missing values q4 flag this leads to discrepancies in the daily data records between stations wegenernet recorded 10 6 mmd 1 while zamg recorded 17 5 mmd 1 in conclusion it was found that a small amount of data collected under a specific adverse weather conditions can cause unexpectedly high errors in daily data records therefore we minimized those errors by using only q0 rainfall data in this study 
7607,spatial rainfall data is an essential input to distributed hydrological models dhm and a significant contributor to hydrological model uncertainty model uncertainty is higher when rain gauges are sparse as is often the case in practice currently satellite based precipitation products increasingly provide an alternative means to ground based rainfall estimates in which case a rigorous product assessment is required before implementation accordingly the twofold objective of this work paper was the real world assessment of both a the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm rainfall product using gauge data and b the trmm product s role in forcing data for hydrologic simulations in the area of the tiaoxi catchment taihu lake basin china the trmm rainfall products used in this study are the version 7 real time 3b42rt and the post real time 3b42 it was found that the trmm rainfall data showed a superior performance at the monthly and annual scales fitting well with surface observation based frequency rainfall distributions the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce and the relative bias ratio bias were used to evaluate hydrologic model performance the satisfactory performance of the monthly runoff simulations in the tiaoxi study supports the view that the implementation of real time 3b42rt allows considerable room for improvement at the same time post real time 3b42 can be a valuable tool of hydrologic modeling water balance analysis and basin water resource management especially in developing countries or at remote locations in which rainfall gauges are scarce keywords trmm rainfall water balance swat tiaoxi catchment 1 introduction rainfall is a fundamental component of the global hydrologic cycle and to a certain degree it governs the distribution of renewable water resources that affect economic ecological and agricultural development the spatial and temporal resolutions of rainfall data are interrelated and mutually affected and both resolutions have significant impacts on the determination of surface hydrology masih et al 2011 michaelides et al 2009 xu et al 2014 2013 hydrologic models provide abstract and often simplified representations of natural hydrologic processes although these models can be well founded in physical theory and empirically justified by past performance they will fail to produce accurate hydrograph predictions if the precision of the input precipitation data is not sufficiently high precipitation gauges provide the primary means of estimating point precipitation and calculating regional precipitation by means of interpolation methods such as geostatistical kriging thiessen polygons and trend surface analysis christakos 1992 it is commonly accepted that more reliable precipitation estimates at unsampled locations can be derived in areas of high rain gauge density than in areas of low rain gauge density chappell et al 2013 yoo 2000 however in many areas the ground based observations are usually sparse or unevenly distributed due to economic or terrain limitations for example in several developing countries the ground based rainfall observation networks have always been relatively sparse hughes 2006 also in many regions of southern africa rain gauge observations are usually not available in real time on the other hand it has been found that the estimation of spatial rainfall distribution can be improved with the inclusion of ancillary data such as radar satellite and topography data in addition high resolution satellite rainfall estimates have been used in many studies as a valuable data source for hydrologic applications and water resources planning purposes masih et al 2011 wilk et al 2006 yan and gebremichael 2009 zhang et al 2009 as a result satellite rainfall estimates open new opportunities for efficient forecasting in regions of limited accessibility and with sparse ground based observations moreno et al 2012 in fact the first precipitation radar was installed onboard the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite in 1997 kummerow 1998 the availability of active precipitation detection from space has laid the groundwork of spaceborne estimation from radar and radar radiometer michaelides et al 2009 yet the absolute accuracy of satellite rainfall products is questionable tian and peters lidard 2010 and needs a thorough validation before it can be used extensively recent studies have evaluated the performance of multiple satellite rainfall products over different regions of the world dinku et al 2008 hu et al 2013 jiang et al 2010 ochoa et al 2014 shen and phanikumar 2010 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 worqlul et al 2014 the results of these studies showed that the quality of satellite rainfall products varies with region season and elevation generally while the trmm 3b42 product performs reasonably well over most regions it depicts the overall rainfall spatial patterns with only small biases compared to gauge data it generally underestimates rainfall in regions of intense convection over land in addition a number of studies comparing trmm rainfall data vs rain gauge data at the catchment scale and evaluating hydrologic processes using trmm rainfall data in simulation and water balance analysis provide useful information for hydrology research and water management purposes kneis et al 2014 li et al 2012 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 su et al 2008 in view of the above considerations the present work is aimed at 1 comparing the trmm rainfall product vs gauge rainfall data and 2 assessing the suitability and adequacy of the trmm rainfall product for simulating regional water balance specifically section 2 below provides a brief introduction to the region of interest together with a discussion of the rain gauge and trmm rainfall data available in section 3 the performance of trmm rainfall data vs rain gauge data is assessed quantitatively followed by a critical study of the simulated watershed hydrologies driven by the two datasets 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area with an area of 5900km2 the tiaoxi watershed is part of the southern catchment of taihu lake in southeastern china fig 1 it is located at e119 13 120 19 longitude and n30 7 31 11 latitude the tiaoxi river is the major tributary of taihu lake basin supplying drinking water to 11 5 million residents of hangzhou and huzhou cities the mean sea level elevation of this area varies from 1 0m to 1580 1m with alluvial plains lying in the northeastern parts of the area in sum the watershed is characterized by a a semitropical climate with an average annual temperature and precipitation of 15 6 c and 1460mm respectively b long summer and winter seasons and c short spring and autumn seasons su et al 2014 the rainfall is highly seasonal with 60 70 falls during spring and summer forest is the dominant land use type in the study area of the tiaoxi watershed forest covers approximately 62 of the land within the basin farmland orchard surface waters and urban areas occupy the rest of catchment fig 2 as fig 3 shows the soils in the study area are dominated by two soil groups red soils 46 and paddy soils 27 other soil groups include skeleton soils 10 fluvio aquic soils 5 limestone soils 4 yellow soils 3 and purple soils 2 the water resources department of the zhejiang province monitors rainfall discharge at several gauging stations throughout the tiaoxi watershed in particular the measured daily flow data at the gangkou and pingyao gauging stations during the period 1999 2008 were collected and used in the present study the drainage areas represented by the gangkou and pingyao stream gauges are about 1889 km2 and 1406 km2 respectively 2 2 gauge rainfall data specifically fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the 42 rain gauges considered the daily precipitation data were collected during the years 1999 2008 and subsequently recorded in the hydrological yearbook of people s republic of china hydrological data of taihu lake basin we notice that all the precipitation measurement instruments employed by the above gauges met national standardof the people s republic of china general principles for analytical methods of the wet precipitation gb t13580 1 1992 as well as the environmental protection industry standard of the people s republic of china specifications and test procedures for automatic rainfall sampler hj t 174 2005 the precipitation data were recorded by means of automated instruments as well as human observers with 0 05 4mm mingauge range 4 precisionand interval of 3 h following ren et al 2010 outlier processing and homogenization served as a quality control procedure monthly precipitation series were calculated for each rain gauge and tested for homogeneity by means of a well known standard normal homogeneity test alexandersson 1986 alexandersson and moberg 1997 the test was applied to a series of ratios comparing the observations at each measuring station with the averaged observations at the 5 nearest stations the test did not show any considerable discontinuities between the two observation sets and therefore no homogenization problems were detected at the 42 rain gauges 2 3 trmm data trmm generates global precipitation estimates based on a wide variety of meteorological satellites huffman et al 2010 the version 7 trmm data were used in this study and this includes both the near real time version 3b42rt and the post real time version 3b42 specifically the 3b42rt dataset is available starting march 1st 2000 whereas the 3b42 is the latest version of the gauge adjusted post real time trmm product which supersedes all previous versions yong et al 2014 the 3b42rt about 6h after real time covers the global latitude belt from 60 n to 60 s and the gauge adjusted post real time research version 3b42 approximately 10 15days after the end of each month ranges from 50 n to 50 s both 3b42rt and 3b42 have a 3 h temporal and a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the 3b42rt uses the trmm combined instrument tci dataset which includes the trmm precipitation radar pr and trmm microwave imager tmi to calibrate precipitation estimates derived from the available low earth orbit leo microwave mw radiometers ochoa et al 2014 the 3b42rt then merges all of the estimates at 3 h intervals and the gaps in the analyses are filled using geostationary earth orbit geo infrared ir data regionally calibrated on the basis of the merged mw product the 3b42 adjusts the monthly accumulations of the 3 h fields from 3b42rt based on a monthly gauge analysis including global precipitation climatology centre gpcc 1 1 monthly rain gauge analysis rudolf et al 1994 and climate assessment and monitoring system cams 0 5 0 5 monthly rain gauge analysis the daily satellite rainfall data employed in the present work were obtained by aggregating 3 h temporal resolution data over 24 h trmm 3b42 product data of gpcc from synoptic observations of ca 6000 7000 stations were available worldwide schneider et al 2013 however only ca 600 700 stations were used to construct the gridded precipitation over china none of which is located in the study area the adjacent gauges used for trmm correction were those of hangzhou ghcnd chm00058457 nanjing ghcnd chm00058238 and shanghai hongqiao ghcnd chm00058367 which are about 60 160 and 180km respectively away from tiaoxi watershed it is critical to evaluate the adjustment effect in this very low density area this assessment can be extended to large regions including europe north america australia east and south asia and parts of africa where the density of gauge network is higher than that of china schneider et al 2013 however it is necessary to adequately assess the absolute accuracy of the satellite rainfall products shi et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 hydrologic model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a well established semi distributed eco hydrologic model operating on a daily monthly or yearly time step arnold et al 1998 the main model components consist of weather hydrology soil temperature plant growth nutrients pesticides land management bacteria and pathogens the swat model has been widely used worldwide the purpose of using the swat model is to estimate the volume and pollutant concentration of runoff for assessing agricultural non point source nps pollution which is especially evident in developing countries the tiaoxi watershed is dominated by two land uses forest and farmland the most common reason for the water quality problems in this area is agricultural nps pollution the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm of the swat cup software was used for auto calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour et al 2007 delineating watershed into sub basins and hydrologic response units hru requires three essential inputs a digital elevation model dem a land use and land cover lulc map and a soil map the topography was represented by a 30m 30m elevation raster daily time series of measured air temperature pan evaporation and relative humidity were obtained at six meteorological stations huzhou anji deqing changxing yuhang and linan 3 2 temporal and spatial analysis method following the methodology of tian et al 2009 and habib et al 2009 the total rainfall bias was broken down into three independent components consisting of i the bias of successful detection hit ii the bias due to missed precipitation and iii the bias due to false detection specifically in the hit case satellite and rain gauge data report rainfall simultaneously in this case the bias can be negative positive or zero the false bias expresses the extent of rainfall occurrence detected by the estimator when the reference dataset is not indicating rainfall on the other hand the satellite could fail to detect the ground based rainfall event which is termed a missed rainfall the spatial rainfall distribution is estimated from the rain gauge data by means of the ordinary kriging interpolation technique christakos 1992 which is a geostatistics technique that generates estimates at unsampled locations or areas in particular kriging is regarded as an accurate interpolation technique for daily averaged rainfall data matos et al 2013 nerini et al 2015 often producing more reliable estimates than other interpolation techniques yao et al 2013 yue et al 2016 3 3 categorical indexes the correlation coefficient cc was used toevaluate the accuracy of theestimatedtrmm daily precipitation moreover the present study adopted two commonly used statistical criteria the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce and the relative bias ratio bias to evaluate hydrologic model performance meng et al 2014 the mathematical definitions of the above categorical indexes are listed in table 1 more specifically in the definition of cc the pest and pobs denote respectively the gauge and the satellite time series of rainfall data for a single position pixel in the definition of nsce and bias q 0 is the mean value of the observed discharge for the entire time under consideration and qs is the simulated discharge of theith day lastly bias assesses the systematic errors of simulated discharge and nsce is an indicator of model fit between the simulated and the observed discharge the highest skill level corresponds to nsce 1 and bias 0 in addition the determination coefficient r 2 is used to measure model ability and reliability in simulating the observed discharge 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of trmm rainfall with rain gauges data the values of statistical indexes regarding the trmm rainfall and rain gauges datasets under consideration are listed in table 2 the areal averaged rainfall was estimated from rain gauges data using the thiessen polygon interpolation method all trmm grid cells have been spatially averaged across the catchment the estimates of areal averaged rainfall during 1999 2008 were 3 1 5 4mm d rain gauges 3 3 5 4mm d 3b42 and 3 3 4 7mm d 3b42rt the maximum precipitation occurred during 1999 for both the rain gauges data and the 3b42 data whereas the 1999 3b42rt data are missing the minimum precipitation of rain gauges data occurred during 2003 but the gross overestimation of 3b42rt 13 4 and 3b42 25 7 of the year during which minimum precipitation occurred do not correspond to rain gauge data all three datasets revealed low precipitation levels and experienced lower bias during 2006 while the difference between the three estimates is small the 3b42 rainfall is higher than the rain gauge data based areal averaged rainfall during most years except during the year 2008 and the 3b42rt bias 17 1 to 25 7 was larger than that of 3b42 9 0 to 13 4 compared to the gauge analysis a comparison between the rainfall std deviations calculated on the basis of the three datasets showed larger differences than that of the areal averaged rainfall above especially during the period 2000 2005 the large std deviations differences were caused by trmm data overestimating heavy rain frequency and intensity especially during the rainy season april to august during the period 1999 2008 the differences between the observed max daily and max 5 day rainfall levels were large specifically the max daily rainfall were 37 5 134 5mm d rain gauge data 48 1 120 9mm d 3b42 and 48 1 116 6mm d 3b42rt the max 5 day rainfall were 83 8 300 2mm d rain gauge data 89 7 274 4mm d 3b42 and 104 3 236 6mm d 3b42rt the capability of trmm to detect heavy rain event is deteriorated thus the trmm rainfall data failed to describe the occurrence of max daily and 5 day max rainfall accurately the results demonstrated that while the data range was similar during the time period of interest the days of the month of july with the max daily and max 5 day rainfall occurrences were different in most years the differences between the max daily and max 5 day rainfalls were large 4 1 1 temporal distribution fig 4 shows the trends of the time series of trmm data error components to remove cluttering a 31 day moving average was applied in the temporal error trend analysis the turquoise and orange shades in the graph represent the missed and the false precipitation respectively the black and red lines represent the total bias and hit bias respectively the 3b42 product displays a significant improvement in accuracy with the total bias range being reduced from 6 4 7 7 to 3 6 3 7 both 3b42rt and 3b42 have similar error trends and also both display miss rain bias during winter and false rain bias during summer trmm data are characterized by positive hit bias throughout the study period whose magnitude is higher than that of the missed or false precipitation therefore in the case of the trmm product the total bias is dominated by hit bias 4 1 2 spatial distribution fig 5 displays the annual precipitation in the tiaoxi watershed downscaled by means of the kriging interpolation technique trmm 3b42 and trmm 3b42rt for the average precipitation the years of 1999 2008 as it can be seen generally the three datasets share the same spatial pattern more precipitation in thesouthwest and a small part of the north of the watershed and less precipitation in the middle plain region the correlation of trmm 3b42rt is oscillating between 0 40 p 0 01 and 0 59 p 0 01 a higher correlation 0 50 0 59 p 0 01 was found in the northeast part of the watershed whereas a higher correlation was observed in the western low altitude valley areas in stations with adjacent steep slopes or located in high altitude areas the observed correlations range from 0 40 p 0 01 to 0 49 p 0 01 the correlation of trmm 3b42 0 48 0 63 p 0 01 shows a very modest improvement over 3b42rt and the same spatial pattern as 3b42rt the trmm 3b42rt and 3b42 daily data and the rain gauge data were compared both at the grid and at the watershed scales fig 6 shows the scatter plots of data from rain gauge stations vs trmm 3b42rt and 3b42 at two spatial scales for 3b42 there are totally 29 216 points for grid based evaluation and 3652 pairs for watershed based evaluation during the 10 year period of interest due to the lack of data the number of points of 3b42rt is less than that of 3b42 the calculated statistical indicators are all included in fig 6 at grid scale both 3b42rt and 3b42 showed moderate agreement with the rain gauge data with a cc of 0 56 and 0 60 respectively the 3b42 data showed a better agreement with the rain gauge data with a bias of 4 1 than the 3b42rt data with a bias of 8 6 which reflects the slight overestimation by these two datasets overall as expected the trmm 3b42rt and 3b42 data showed a better agreement with a cc of 0 66 and 0 72 at the watershed scale since the trmm performance improves with increased time aggregation conti et al 2014 and it provides a reasonable performance at the 1 month scale it could be utilized for the purposes of seasonal and annual water management in order to further evaluate the relationships between the gauge and trmm rainfall datasets the scatter plots of monthly trmm rainfall vs rain gauges rainfall data are presented in fig 7 the comparison was made based on the primary 8 trmm pixels study area 0 5 trmm pixels area and all the precipitation stations in each pixel the results indicated a very good linear relationship between the three rainfall datasets with the determination coefficient r 2 ranging from 0 89 to 0 94 3b42 and from 0 62 to 0 71 3b42rt the slopes of the regression lines ranged between 0 79 and 1 00 for 3b42 and between 0 78 and 1 19 for 3b42rt whereas the slopes were equal to 0 97 3b42 and 1 04 3b42rt for the areal average dataset 4 1 3 rainfall intensity distribution fig 8 displays the daily rainfall intensity distributions and their corresponding contributions to the total rainfall as a function of rain rate during different years as regards gauge rainfall statistics rainfall 0 3mm was the rainfall class that occurred most frequently 37 63 the second largest class was non rainy days occurring in about 12 35 of the total number of days as regards trmm rainfall statistics they were numerically different from the gauge rainfall statistics the largest class remained that of non rainy days occurring in about 37 45 3b42 and 30 51 3b42rt of the total number of days and the second largest class rainfall 0 3mm occurred in only about 30 40 3b42 and 26 36 3b42rt of the total number of days clearly more non rainy days were recorded in the trmm data whereas more light rain days class of rainfall 0 3mm were found in the gauge rainfall data that is since trmm is less effective in correctly specifying moderate and light rain rates at short time intervals michaelides et al 2009 much of the light rainfall during certain days are classified as non rainy in the trmm data the sum of the first two classes non rainy and light rain gives a similar percentage 80 for both trmm data and gauge data it was found that although the occurrences of light rain rainfall 0 3mm are as high as in 10 30 of the total days its contribution to the total rainfall amount is only about 1 in both cases of rainfall data trmm and rain gauge it is important to point out that although the high rainfall ranges occurred only during about 0 5 of the total days the max is 2 1 during 1999 they had a significant contribution to the total rainfall amount pierce et al 2013 the high rainfall class rainfall 50mm contributed a 9 0 on average max 25 5 during 1999 to the total rainfall case of rain gauge data 13 5 max 22 2 in 1999 to the total rainfall case of 3b42 and 15 4 max 29 in 1999 to the total rainfall case of 3b42rt for the class of rainfall 0 3mm both the occurrence and contribution rate of trmm rainfall were smaller than those of gauge data but the differences were rather small during each year and for the class of rainfall 10 25mm the contribution rates were nearly the same for these three rainfall datasets the trmm data showed a reasonable performance at the annual scale reproducing adequately the surface observation based precipitation histogram in general although systematic errors were also noticeable at the monthly time step scale and taking into consideration the temporal and spatial variability of these three rainfall datasets the trmm satellite was able to characterize more adequately the rainfall structure compared to the characterization in terms of rainfall measurements from traditional rain gauges at different locations in the tiaoxi watershed 4 2 hydrologic process simulation to assess runoff predictions obtained from the gauge and trmm rainfall datasets certain experiments based on the swat model were conducted with inputs from both datasets across the tiaoxi watershed the swat model contains parameters that need to be determined by means of calibration however calibrated values were affected by correlations between model parameters and observed data to avoid the calibration effects of the three datasets which is critical but has not been studied sufficiently in the relevant literature the nsce index was used as the objective function evaluating hydrologic processes for three scenarios in scenario 1 a the daily rain gauges rainfall data was first used to drive the model and optimize the parameter values b the daily 3b42 and 3b42rt rainfall data were subsequently used to run the model with the same parameter values and c the simulated runoffs for the two model runs were compared in scenario 2 the daily 3b42rt rainfall was utilized to drive the swat model and optimize the parameter values and then the rain gauge and 3b42 rainfall were utilized to drive the model in scenario 3 3b42 rainfall data was used to get the parameters and the rain gauge and 3b42rt rainfall data were used to drive the model prior to model calibration the parameters listed in table 3 were identified as most sensitive based on a swat sensitivity analysis procedure these parameters represented the groundwater soil runoff evaporation and channel components of the watershed hydrologic process the sufi 2 algorithm was used for auto calibration and uncertainty analysis in fact sufi 2 is a widely used tool for the combined calibration uncertainty analysis of the swat model setegn et al 2009 wu and chen 2015 zhou et al 2014 yang et al 2008 have described the detailed steps of the sufi 2 optimization algorithm wu and chen 2015 have shown that the sufi 2 method is able to provide more reasonable and balanced predictions than the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue and the parameter solution parasol methods for illustration numerical parameter optimization results in the study area are shown in table 3 moreover model performance results are presented in table 4 the model using conventional rain gauge data produced a good overall fit for hydrologic processes in the case of scenario 1 due to the impact of human beings on the aquatic environment and the sparseness of rain gauges model performance in pingyao is not as good as in gangkou the nsce values obtained were surprisingly high at gangkou nsce 0 92 and a little lower at pingyao nsce 0 75 the calculated relative runoff depth errors were 1 2 gangkou and 29 4 pingyao also the relatively high r 2 values 0 83 0 92 showed that the model described well the observed streamflow variation therefore based on the obtained results the model was considered robust and provided a sound basis for testing the precision and applicability of trmm 3b42 and 3b42rt rainfall step a of scenario 1 above however the subsequent performance of the swat model using 3b42 data see step b above was relatively lower the nsce values were not higher than 0 72 and the r 2 ranged from 0 55 to 0 72 the relative runoff depth errors were between 5 4 and 6 4 for scenario 2 the model performance utilizing 3b42rt rainfall data was unacceptable the nsce values were between 0 67 and 0 10 only the relative runoff depth errors were between 22 4 and 28 6 and the r 2 ranged from 0 35 to 0 41 for scenario 3 table 4 shows that the 3b42 rainfall based model calibration led to slightly improved results than 3b42rt with nsce ranging between 0 50 and 0 72 as well as reasonable relative runoff depth errors ranging between 9 0 and 3 0 even after model calibration the 3b42rt dataset alone cannot be used directly in hydrologic modeling but the gauge adjusted 3b42 rainfall data driving model generated adequate simulations 0 65 nsce 0 75 or satisfactorily simulations 0 50 nsce 0 65 moriasi et al 2007 and then can be used to obtain hydrologic budget estimates for a watershed fig 9 further compares the observed and simulated monthly runoff hydrographs from january 1st 2000 to december 31st 2008 based on trmm 3b42 and 3b42rt rainfall estimates and rain gauges with their own optimal parameter values the simulated streamflow hydrographs driven by rain gauge data exhibited a closer agreement with observations than model simulations using trmm 3b42 and 3b42rt rainfall the model was able to predict peak flow and flow conditions using the gauge rain data the extreme flow peaks tended to be overestimated in model simulations with the 3b42rt data at both gangkou and pingyao stations and the low flow condition was overestimated most of the time the performance of model simulations based on 3b42 data was a considerable improvement compared to that with 3b42rt data the results indicated that the 3b42 rainfall data were still feasible for monthly stream flow simulation purposes in the study area according to arnold et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2007 the models are considered satisfactory if the monthly nsce 0 5 and the absolute of bias 25 gauge adjusted 3b42 rainfall data have the potential to be an alternative data source in cases of data poor or ungauged basins particularly in developing countries or at remote locations subsequently we also examined model precision using rain gauge and 3b42 data for daily streamflow simulation purposes the evaluation of the model performance and the calculated statistical indicators are all shown in fig 10 it can be seen from this that the gauge rainfall based model performs satisfactorily at the gangkou station with an nsce of 0 53 a bias of 0 9 and an r 2 of 0 54 unfortunately the model based on 3b42 data produces unsatisfying results with an nsce of 0 07 a bias of 6 1 and an r 2 of 0 26 due to human impact on aquatic environment and the sparseness of rain gauges model performance in pingyao were shown to be unsatisfactory especially after the year 2005 when the real estate development by the local governments was growing rapidly in particular model simulations using both gauge data and 3b42 data overestimated the discharges the trmm rainfall data were not suitable for daily streamflow simulation purposes in the area of interest 4 3 water balance in addition to streamflow hydrograph comparisons water balance results provide another important indicator for testing rainfall data validity xu et al 2013 we examined the differences in water balance components from monthly streamflow simulations using rain gauges and trmm 3b42 rainfall according to the above modeling results the difference of water balance simulation is slight a numerical comparison of the averaged water balance components in the study area from 2000 to 2008 is shown in table 5 the swat model partitions precipitation into evaporation transpiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge includes base flow in the case of the rain gauge driven calculations 52 2 of precipitation was exhausted through evaporation and transpiration whereas in the case of trmm rainfall data the corresponding rate was 54 9 the groundwater recharge was 20 3 gauge rainfall and 19 3 trmm rainfall groundwater recharge is a key component that determines the amount of base flow although the precipitation volume was a little different i e 1355 9mm y gauge rainfall vs 1312 8mm y trmm rainfall the estimated groundwater recharges were very similar 274 68mm and 253 7mm respectively in the case of total runoff less precipitation was distributed into runoff in the gauge rainfall case 587 4mm than in the trmm rainfall case 625 0mm as a matter of fact this difference is mainly due to surface runoff volume difference which is 132 5mm gauge rainfall case vs 203 7mm trmm rainfall case lastly the differences in baseflow estimation are small 454 9mm and 421 3mm respectively 5 conclusions the present work compared areal averaged rainfall calculated from two rainfall sources trmm rainfall retrievals vs rain gauge data and derived an assessment of the impact of trmm rainfall as forcing data in hydrologic applications and water balance analysis at the tiaoxi catchment china the results showed that the areal averaged rainfall differences calculated from the trmm gauge adjusted 3b42 vs the rain gauge rainfall sources were insignificant within an acceptable range the rain gauge observations showed a significantly better correlation when combined with the 3b42 data than with real time estimates 3b42rt product moreover due to detection defects concerning the heavy rainfall capacity the observed differences between max daily and max 5 day rainfall were large accordingly the daily trmm rainfall data were proven to be better in determining rainfall occurrence and mean rainfall values than in determining rainfall extremes furthermore even when the gauges used for adjustment are more than 60km away the generated monthly hydrologic process simulations demonstrated that the swat model using trmm 3b42 data as inputs produces a good fit overall on the other hand the statistical results showed that the trmm rainfall data were not suitable for daily streamflow simulation purposes in the area of interest the comparison of the discharge calculated by the three types of rainfall data showed that although the simulation with 3b42rt performance as not good both 3b42 and gauge rain sources could describe well the runoff volume and its composition which is very useful in watershed management given that over europe north america australia east and south asia andparts of africa the densities of gauge adjustment network are generally higher than in the tiaoxi watershed so trmm 3b42 data can be used effectively in these regions trmm data is an example of a satellite based rainfall product that has great potential in real world applications involving hydrologic simulation and water balance calculations at the monthly or seasonal time steps certain shortcomings were noted too for example due to trmm overestimation or underestimation in some years and in certain areas extreme rainfalls cannot be detected precisely thus reducing streamflow simulation accuracy at short time steps for flood forecasting purposes li et al 2014 the near real time monitoring of torrential rains and the accurate estimation of time accumulation of rain volume must be improved moreover given that satellite based rainfall data cover a large part of the world satellite based product assessment is necessary in different climatic areas in order for hydrologists and engineers to be able to apply current generation satellite based rainfall products for various purposes acknowledgements the authors would like to thank drs junjun zhi and yao zhu cers zhejiang university and dr shenpan lin michigan state

7607,spatial rainfall data is an essential input to distributed hydrological models dhm and a significant contributor to hydrological model uncertainty model uncertainty is higher when rain gauges are sparse as is often the case in practice currently satellite based precipitation products increasingly provide an alternative means to ground based rainfall estimates in which case a rigorous product assessment is required before implementation accordingly the twofold objective of this work paper was the real world assessment of both a the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm rainfall product using gauge data and b the trmm product s role in forcing data for hydrologic simulations in the area of the tiaoxi catchment taihu lake basin china the trmm rainfall products used in this study are the version 7 real time 3b42rt and the post real time 3b42 it was found that the trmm rainfall data showed a superior performance at the monthly and annual scales fitting well with surface observation based frequency rainfall distributions the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce and the relative bias ratio bias were used to evaluate hydrologic model performance the satisfactory performance of the monthly runoff simulations in the tiaoxi study supports the view that the implementation of real time 3b42rt allows considerable room for improvement at the same time post real time 3b42 can be a valuable tool of hydrologic modeling water balance analysis and basin water resource management especially in developing countries or at remote locations in which rainfall gauges are scarce keywords trmm rainfall water balance swat tiaoxi catchment 1 introduction rainfall is a fundamental component of the global hydrologic cycle and to a certain degree it governs the distribution of renewable water resources that affect economic ecological and agricultural development the spatial and temporal resolutions of rainfall data are interrelated and mutually affected and both resolutions have significant impacts on the determination of surface hydrology masih et al 2011 michaelides et al 2009 xu et al 2014 2013 hydrologic models provide abstract and often simplified representations of natural hydrologic processes although these models can be well founded in physical theory and empirically justified by past performance they will fail to produce accurate hydrograph predictions if the precision of the input precipitation data is not sufficiently high precipitation gauges provide the primary means of estimating point precipitation and calculating regional precipitation by means of interpolation methods such as geostatistical kriging thiessen polygons and trend surface analysis christakos 1992 it is commonly accepted that more reliable precipitation estimates at unsampled locations can be derived in areas of high rain gauge density than in areas of low rain gauge density chappell et al 2013 yoo 2000 however in many areas the ground based observations are usually sparse or unevenly distributed due to economic or terrain limitations for example in several developing countries the ground based rainfall observation networks have always been relatively sparse hughes 2006 also in many regions of southern africa rain gauge observations are usually not available in real time on the other hand it has been found that the estimation of spatial rainfall distribution can be improved with the inclusion of ancillary data such as radar satellite and topography data in addition high resolution satellite rainfall estimates have been used in many studies as a valuable data source for hydrologic applications and water resources planning purposes masih et al 2011 wilk et al 2006 yan and gebremichael 2009 zhang et al 2009 as a result satellite rainfall estimates open new opportunities for efficient forecasting in regions of limited accessibility and with sparse ground based observations moreno et al 2012 in fact the first precipitation radar was installed onboard the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite in 1997 kummerow 1998 the availability of active precipitation detection from space has laid the groundwork of spaceborne estimation from radar and radar radiometer michaelides et al 2009 yet the absolute accuracy of satellite rainfall products is questionable tian and peters lidard 2010 and needs a thorough validation before it can be used extensively recent studies have evaluated the performance of multiple satellite rainfall products over different regions of the world dinku et al 2008 hu et al 2013 jiang et al 2010 ochoa et al 2014 shen and phanikumar 2010 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 worqlul et al 2014 the results of these studies showed that the quality of satellite rainfall products varies with region season and elevation generally while the trmm 3b42 product performs reasonably well over most regions it depicts the overall rainfall spatial patterns with only small biases compared to gauge data it generally underestimates rainfall in regions of intense convection over land in addition a number of studies comparing trmm rainfall data vs rain gauge data at the catchment scale and evaluating hydrologic processes using trmm rainfall data in simulation and water balance analysis provide useful information for hydrology research and water management purposes kneis et al 2014 li et al 2012 stampoulis and anagnostou 2012 su et al 2008 in view of the above considerations the present work is aimed at 1 comparing the trmm rainfall product vs gauge rainfall data and 2 assessing the suitability and adequacy of the trmm rainfall product for simulating regional water balance specifically section 2 below provides a brief introduction to the region of interest together with a discussion of the rain gauge and trmm rainfall data available in section 3 the performance of trmm rainfall data vs rain gauge data is assessed quantitatively followed by a critical study of the simulated watershed hydrologies driven by the two datasets 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area with an area of 5900km2 the tiaoxi watershed is part of the southern catchment of taihu lake in southeastern china fig 1 it is located at e119 13 120 19 longitude and n30 7 31 11 latitude the tiaoxi river is the major tributary of taihu lake basin supplying drinking water to 11 5 million residents of hangzhou and huzhou cities the mean sea level elevation of this area varies from 1 0m to 1580 1m with alluvial plains lying in the northeastern parts of the area in sum the watershed is characterized by a a semitropical climate with an average annual temperature and precipitation of 15 6 c and 1460mm respectively b long summer and winter seasons and c short spring and autumn seasons su et al 2014 the rainfall is highly seasonal with 60 70 falls during spring and summer forest is the dominant land use type in the study area of the tiaoxi watershed forest covers approximately 62 of the land within the basin farmland orchard surface waters and urban areas occupy the rest of catchment fig 2 as fig 3 shows the soils in the study area are dominated by two soil groups red soils 46 and paddy soils 27 other soil groups include skeleton soils 10 fluvio aquic soils 5 limestone soils 4 yellow soils 3 and purple soils 2 the water resources department of the zhejiang province monitors rainfall discharge at several gauging stations throughout the tiaoxi watershed in particular the measured daily flow data at the gangkou and pingyao gauging stations during the period 1999 2008 were collected and used in the present study the drainage areas represented by the gangkou and pingyao stream gauges are about 1889 km2 and 1406 km2 respectively 2 2 gauge rainfall data specifically fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the 42 rain gauges considered the daily precipitation data were collected during the years 1999 2008 and subsequently recorded in the hydrological yearbook of people s republic of china hydrological data of taihu lake basin we notice that all the precipitation measurement instruments employed by the above gauges met national standardof the people s republic of china general principles for analytical methods of the wet precipitation gb t13580 1 1992 as well as the environmental protection industry standard of the people s republic of china specifications and test procedures for automatic rainfall sampler hj t 174 2005 the precipitation data were recorded by means of automated instruments as well as human observers with 0 05 4mm mingauge range 4 precisionand interval of 3 h following ren et al 2010 outlier processing and homogenization served as a quality control procedure monthly precipitation series were calculated for each rain gauge and tested for homogeneity by means of a well known standard normal homogeneity test alexandersson 1986 alexandersson and moberg 1997 the test was applied to a series of ratios comparing the observations at each measuring station with the averaged observations at the 5 nearest stations the test did not show any considerable discontinuities between the two observation sets and therefore no homogenization problems were detected at the 42 rain gauges 2 3 trmm data trmm generates global precipitation estimates based on a wide variety of meteorological satellites huffman et al 2010 the version 7 trmm data were used in this study and this includes both the near real time version 3b42rt and the post real time version 3b42 specifically the 3b42rt dataset is available starting march 1st 2000 whereas the 3b42 is the latest version of the gauge adjusted post real time trmm product which supersedes all previous versions yong et al 2014 the 3b42rt about 6h after real time covers the global latitude belt from 60 n to 60 s and the gauge adjusted post real time research version 3b42 approximately 10 15days after the end of each month ranges from 50 n to 50 s both 3b42rt and 3b42 have a 3 h temporal and a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the 3b42rt uses the trmm combined instrument tci dataset which includes the trmm precipitation radar pr and trmm microwave imager tmi to calibrate precipitation estimates derived from the available low earth orbit leo microwave mw radiometers ochoa et al 2014 the 3b42rt then merges all of the estimates at 3 h intervals and the gaps in the analyses are filled using geostationary earth orbit geo infrared ir data regionally calibrated on the basis of the merged mw product the 3b42 adjusts the monthly accumulations of the 3 h fields from 3b42rt based on a monthly gauge analysis including global precipitation climatology centre gpcc 1 1 monthly rain gauge analysis rudolf et al 1994 and climate assessment and monitoring system cams 0 5 0 5 monthly rain gauge analysis the daily satellite rainfall data employed in the present work were obtained by aggregating 3 h temporal resolution data over 24 h trmm 3b42 product data of gpcc from synoptic observations of ca 6000 7000 stations were available worldwide schneider et al 2013 however only ca 600 700 stations were used to construct the gridded precipitation over china none of which is located in the study area the adjacent gauges used for trmm correction were those of hangzhou ghcnd chm00058457 nanjing ghcnd chm00058238 and shanghai hongqiao ghcnd chm00058367 which are about 60 160 and 180km respectively away from tiaoxi watershed it is critical to evaluate the adjustment effect in this very low density area this assessment can be extended to large regions including europe north america australia east and south asia and parts of africa where the density of gauge network is higher than that of china schneider et al 2013 however it is necessary to adequately assess the absolute accuracy of the satellite rainfall products shi et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 hydrologic model the soil and water assessment tool swat is a well established semi distributed eco hydrologic model operating on a daily monthly or yearly time step arnold et al 1998 the main model components consist of weather hydrology soil temperature plant growth nutrients pesticides land management bacteria and pathogens the swat model has been widely used worldwide the purpose of using the swat model is to estimate the volume and pollutant concentration of runoff for assessing agricultural non point source nps pollution which is especially evident in developing countries the tiaoxi watershed is dominated by two land uses forest and farmland the most common reason for the water quality problems in this area is agricultural nps pollution the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm of the swat cup software was used for auto calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour et al 2007 delineating watershed into sub basins and hydrologic response units hru requires three essential inputs a digital elevation model dem a land use and land cover lulc map and a soil map the topography was represented by a 30m 30m elevation raster daily time series of measured air temperature pan evaporation and relative humidity were obtained at six meteorological stations huzhou anji deqing changxing yuhang and linan 3 2 temporal and spatial analysis method following the methodology of tian et al 2009 and habib et al 2009 the total rainfall bias was broken down into three independent components consisting of i the bias of successful detection hit ii the bias due to missed precipitation and iii the bias due to false detection specifically in the hit case satellite and rain gauge data report rainfall simultaneously in this case the bias can be negative positive or zero the false bias expresses the extent of rainfall occurrence detected by the estimator when the reference dataset is not indicating rainfall on the other hand the satellite could fail to detect the ground based rainfall event which is termed a missed rainfall the spatial rainfall distribution is estimated from the rain gauge data by means of the ordinary kriging interpolation technique christakos 1992 which is a geostatistics technique that generates estimates at unsampled locations or areas in particular kriging is regarded as an accurate interpolation technique for daily averaged rainfall data matos et al 2013 nerini et al 2015 often producing more reliable estimates than other interpolation techniques yao et al 2013 yue et al 2016 3 3 categorical indexes the correlation coefficient cc was used toevaluate the accuracy of theestimatedtrmm daily precipitation moreover the present study adopted two commonly used statistical criteria the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce and the relative bias ratio bias to evaluate hydrologic model performance meng et al 2014 the mathematical definitions of the above categorical indexes are listed in table 1 more specifically in the definition of cc the pest and pobs denote respectively the gauge and the satellite time series of rainfall data for a single position pixel in the definition of nsce and bias q 0 is the mean value of the observed discharge for the entire time under consideration and qs is the simulated discharge of theith day lastly bias assesses the systematic errors of simulated discharge and nsce is an indicator of model fit between the simulated and the observed discharge the highest skill level corresponds to nsce 1 and bias 0 in addition the determination coefficient r 2 is used to measure model ability and reliability in simulating the observed discharge 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of trmm rainfall with rain gauges data the values of statistical indexes regarding the trmm rainfall and rain gauges datasets under consideration are listed in table 2 the areal averaged rainfall was estimated from rain gauges data using the thiessen polygon interpolation method all trmm grid cells have been spatially averaged across the catchment the estimates of areal averaged rainfall during 1999 2008 were 3 1 5 4mm d rain gauges 3 3 5 4mm d 3b42 and 3 3 4 7mm d 3b42rt the maximum precipitation occurred during 1999 for both the rain gauges data and the 3b42 data whereas the 1999 3b42rt data are missing the minimum precipitation of rain gauges data occurred during 2003 but the gross overestimation of 3b42rt 13 4 and 3b42 25 7 of the year during which minimum precipitation occurred do not correspond to rain gauge data all three datasets revealed low precipitation levels and experienced lower bias during 2006 while the difference between the three estimates is small the 3b42 rainfall is higher than the rain gauge data based areal averaged rainfall during most years except during the year 2008 and the 3b42rt bias 17 1 to 25 7 was larger than that of 3b42 9 0 to 13 4 compared to the gauge analysis a comparison between the rainfall std deviations calculated on the basis of the three datasets showed larger differences than that of the areal averaged rainfall above especially during the period 2000 2005 the large std deviations differences were caused by trmm data overestimating heavy rain frequency and intensity especially during the rainy season april to august during the period 1999 2008 the differences between the observed max daily and max 5 day rainfall levels were large specifically the max daily rainfall were 37 5 134 5mm d rain gauge data 48 1 120 9mm d 3b42 and 48 1 116 6mm d 3b42rt the max 5 day rainfall were 83 8 300 2mm d rain gauge data 89 7 274 4mm d 3b42 and 104 3 236 6mm d 3b42rt the capability of trmm to detect heavy rain event is deteriorated thus the trmm rainfall data failed to describe the occurrence of max daily and 5 day max rainfall accurately the results demonstrated that while the data range was similar during the time period of interest the days of the month of july with the max daily and max 5 day rainfall occurrences were different in most years the differences between the max daily and max 5 day rainfalls were large 4 1 1 temporal distribution fig 4 shows the trends of the time series of trmm data error components to remove cluttering a 31 day moving average was applied in the temporal error trend analysis the turquoise and orange shades in the graph represent the missed and the false precipitation respectively the black and red lines represent the total bias and hit bias respectively the 3b42 product displays a significant improvement in accuracy with the total bias range being reduced from 6 4 7 7 to 3 6 3 7 both 3b42rt and 3b42 have similar error trends and also both display miss rain bias during winter and false rain bias during summer trmm data are characterized by positive hit bias throughout the study period whose magnitude is higher than that of the missed or false precipitation therefore in the case of the trmm product the total bias is dominated by hit bias 4 1 2 spatial distribution fig 5 displays the annual precipitation in the tiaoxi watershed downscaled by means of the kriging interpolation technique trmm 3b42 and trmm 3b42rt for the average precipitation the years of 1999 2008 as it can be seen generally the three datasets share the same spatial pattern more precipitation in thesouthwest and a small part of the north of the watershed and less precipitation in the middle plain region the correlation of trmm 3b42rt is oscillating between 0 40 p 0 01 and 0 59 p 0 01 a higher correlation 0 50 0 59 p 0 01 was found in the northeast part of the watershed whereas a higher correlation was observed in the western low altitude valley areas in stations with adjacent steep slopes or located in high altitude areas the observed correlations range from 0 40 p 0 01 to 0 49 p 0 01 the correlation of trmm 3b42 0 48 0 63 p 0 01 shows a very modest improvement over 3b42rt and the same spatial pattern as 3b42rt the trmm 3b42rt and 3b42 daily data and the rain gauge data were compared both at the grid and at the watershed scales fig 6 shows the scatter plots of data from rain gauge stations vs trmm 3b42rt and 3b42 at two spatial scales for 3b42 there are totally 29 216 points for grid based evaluation and 3652 pairs for watershed based evaluation during the 10 year period of interest due to the lack of data the number of points of 3b42rt is less than that of 3b42 the calculated statistical indicators are all included in fig 6 at grid scale both 3b42rt and 3b42 showed moderate agreement with the rain gauge data with a cc of 0 56 and 0 60 respectively the 3b42 data showed a better agreement with the rain gauge data with a bias of 4 1 than the 3b42rt data with a bias of 8 6 which reflects the slight overestimation by these two datasets overall as expected the trmm 3b42rt and 3b42 data showed a better agreement with a cc of 0 66 and 0 72 at the watershed scale since the trmm performance improves with increased time aggregation conti et al 2014 and it provides a reasonable performance at the 1 month scale it could be utilized for the purposes of seasonal and annual water management in order to further evaluate the relationships between the gauge and trmm rainfall datasets the scatter plots of monthly trmm rainfall vs rain gauges rainfall data are presented in fig 7 the comparison was made based on the primary 8 trmm pixels study area 0 5 trmm pixels area and all the precipitation stations in each pixel the results indicated a very good linear relationship between the three rainfall datasets with the determination coefficient r 2 ranging from 0 89 to 0 94 3b42 and from 0 62 to 0 71 3b42rt the slopes of the regression lines ranged between 0 79 and 1 00 for 3b42 and between 0 78 and 1 19 for 3b42rt whereas the slopes were equal to 0 97 3b42 and 1 04 3b42rt for the areal average dataset 4 1 3 rainfall intensity distribution fig 8 displays the daily rainfall intensity distributions and their corresponding contributions to the total rainfall as a function of rain rate during different years as regards gauge rainfall statistics rainfall 0 3mm was the rainfall class that occurred most frequently 37 63 the second largest class was non rainy days occurring in about 12 35 of the total number of days as regards trmm rainfall statistics they were numerically different from the gauge rainfall statistics the largest class remained that of non rainy days occurring in about 37 45 3b42 and 30 51 3b42rt of the total number of days and the second largest class rainfall 0 3mm occurred in only about 30 40 3b42 and 26 36 3b42rt of the total number of days clearly more non rainy days were recorded in the trmm data whereas more light rain days class of rainfall 0 3mm were found in the gauge rainfall data that is since trmm is less effective in correctly specifying moderate and light rain rates at short time intervals michaelides et al 2009 much of the light rainfall during certain days are classified as non rainy in the trmm data the sum of the first two classes non rainy and light rain gives a similar percentage 80 for both trmm data and gauge data it was found that although the occurrences of light rain rainfall 0 3mm are as high as in 10 30 of the total days its contribution to the total rainfall amount is only about 1 in both cases of rainfall data trmm and rain gauge it is important to point out that although the high rainfall ranges occurred only during about 0 5 of the total days the max is 2 1 during 1999 they had a significant contribution to the total rainfall amount pierce et al 2013 the high rainfall class rainfall 50mm contributed a 9 0 on average max 25 5 during 1999 to the total rainfall case of rain gauge data 13 5 max 22 2 in 1999 to the total rainfall case of 3b42 and 15 4 max 29 in 1999 to the total rainfall case of 3b42rt for the class of rainfall 0 3mm both the occurrence and contribution rate of trmm rainfall were smaller than those of gauge data but the differences were rather small during each year and for the class of rainfall 10 25mm the contribution rates were nearly the same for these three rainfall datasets the trmm data showed a reasonable performance at the annual scale reproducing adequately the surface observation based precipitation histogram in general although systematic errors were also noticeable at the monthly time step scale and taking into consideration the temporal and spatial variability of these three rainfall datasets the trmm satellite was able to characterize more adequately the rainfall structure compared to the characterization in terms of rainfall measurements from traditional rain gauges at different locations in the tiaoxi watershed 4 2 hydrologic process simulation to assess runoff predictions obtained from the gauge and trmm rainfall datasets certain experiments based on the swat model were conducted with inputs from both datasets across the tiaoxi watershed the swat model contains parameters that need to be determined by means of calibration however calibrated values were affected by correlations between model parameters and observed data to avoid the calibration effects of the three datasets which is critical but has not been studied sufficiently in the relevant literature the nsce index was used as the objective function evaluating hydrologic processes for three scenarios in scenario 1 a the daily rain gauges rainfall data was first used to drive the model and optimize the parameter values b the daily 3b42 and 3b42rt rainfall data were subsequently used to run the model with the same parameter values and c the simulated runoffs for the two model runs were compared in scenario 2 the daily 3b42rt rainfall was utilized to drive the swat model and optimize the parameter values and then the rain gauge and 3b42 rainfall were utilized to drive the model in scenario 3 3b42 rainfall data was used to get the parameters and the rain gauge and 3b42rt rainfall data were used to drive the model prior to model calibration the parameters listed in table 3 were identified as most sensitive based on a swat sensitivity analysis procedure these parameters represented the groundwater soil runoff evaporation and channel components of the watershed hydrologic process the sufi 2 algorithm was used for auto calibration and uncertainty analysis in fact sufi 2 is a widely used tool for the combined calibration uncertainty analysis of the swat model setegn et al 2009 wu and chen 2015 zhou et al 2014 yang et al 2008 have described the detailed steps of the sufi 2 optimization algorithm wu and chen 2015 have shown that the sufi 2 method is able to provide more reasonable and balanced predictions than the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue and the parameter solution parasol methods for illustration numerical parameter optimization results in the study area are shown in table 3 moreover model performance results are presented in table 4 the model using conventional rain gauge data produced a good overall fit for hydrologic processes in the case of scenario 1 due to the impact of human beings on the aquatic environment and the sparseness of rain gauges model performance in pingyao is not as good as in gangkou the nsce values obtained were surprisingly high at gangkou nsce 0 92 and a little lower at pingyao nsce 0 75 the calculated relative runoff depth errors were 1 2 gangkou and 29 4 pingyao also the relatively high r 2 values 0 83 0 92 showed that the model described well the observed streamflow variation therefore based on the obtained results the model was considered robust and provided a sound basis for testing the precision and applicability of trmm 3b42 and 3b42rt rainfall step a of scenario 1 above however the subsequent performance of the swat model using 3b42 data see step b above was relatively lower the nsce values were not higher than 0 72 and the r 2 ranged from 0 55 to 0 72 the relative runoff depth errors were between 5 4 and 6 4 for scenario 2 the model performance utilizing 3b42rt rainfall data was unacceptable the nsce values were between 0 67 and 0 10 only the relative runoff depth errors were between 22 4 and 28 6 and the r 2 ranged from 0 35 to 0 41 for scenario 3 table 4 shows that the 3b42 rainfall based model calibration led to slightly improved results than 3b42rt with nsce ranging between 0 50 and 0 72 as well as reasonable relative runoff depth errors ranging between 9 0 and 3 0 even after model calibration the 3b42rt dataset alone cannot be used directly in hydrologic modeling but the gauge adjusted 3b42 rainfall data driving model generated adequate simulations 0 65 nsce 0 75 or satisfactorily simulations 0 50 nsce 0 65 moriasi et al 2007 and then can be used to obtain hydrologic budget estimates for a watershed fig 9 further compares the observed and simulated monthly runoff hydrographs from january 1st 2000 to december 31st 2008 based on trmm 3b42 and 3b42rt rainfall estimates and rain gauges with their own optimal parameter values the simulated streamflow hydrographs driven by rain gauge data exhibited a closer agreement with observations than model simulations using trmm 3b42 and 3b42rt rainfall the model was able to predict peak flow and flow conditions using the gauge rain data the extreme flow peaks tended to be overestimated in model simulations with the 3b42rt data at both gangkou and pingyao stations and the low flow condition was overestimated most of the time the performance of model simulations based on 3b42 data was a considerable improvement compared to that with 3b42rt data the results indicated that the 3b42 rainfall data were still feasible for monthly stream flow simulation purposes in the study area according to arnold et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2007 the models are considered satisfactory if the monthly nsce 0 5 and the absolute of bias 25 gauge adjusted 3b42 rainfall data have the potential to be an alternative data source in cases of data poor or ungauged basins particularly in developing countries or at remote locations subsequently we also examined model precision using rain gauge and 3b42 data for daily streamflow simulation purposes the evaluation of the model performance and the calculated statistical indicators are all shown in fig 10 it can be seen from this that the gauge rainfall based model performs satisfactorily at the gangkou station with an nsce of 0 53 a bias of 0 9 and an r 2 of 0 54 unfortunately the model based on 3b42 data produces unsatisfying results with an nsce of 0 07 a bias of 6 1 and an r 2 of 0 26 due to human impact on aquatic environment and the sparseness of rain gauges model performance in pingyao were shown to be unsatisfactory especially after the year 2005 when the real estate development by the local governments was growing rapidly in particular model simulations using both gauge data and 3b42 data overestimated the discharges the trmm rainfall data were not suitable for daily streamflow simulation purposes in the area of interest 4 3 water balance in addition to streamflow hydrograph comparisons water balance results provide another important indicator for testing rainfall data validity xu et al 2013 we examined the differences in water balance components from monthly streamflow simulations using rain gauges and trmm 3b42 rainfall according to the above modeling results the difference of water balance simulation is slight a numerical comparison of the averaged water balance components in the study area from 2000 to 2008 is shown in table 5 the swat model partitions precipitation into evaporation transpiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge includes base flow in the case of the rain gauge driven calculations 52 2 of precipitation was exhausted through evaporation and transpiration whereas in the case of trmm rainfall data the corresponding rate was 54 9 the groundwater recharge was 20 3 gauge rainfall and 19 3 trmm rainfall groundwater recharge is a key component that determines the amount of base flow although the precipitation volume was a little different i e 1355 9mm y gauge rainfall vs 1312 8mm y trmm rainfall the estimated groundwater recharges were very similar 274 68mm and 253 7mm respectively in the case of total runoff less precipitation was distributed into runoff in the gauge rainfall case 587 4mm than in the trmm rainfall case 625 0mm as a matter of fact this difference is mainly due to surface runoff volume difference which is 132 5mm gauge rainfall case vs 203 7mm trmm rainfall case lastly the differences in baseflow estimation are small 454 9mm and 421 3mm respectively 5 conclusions the present work compared areal averaged rainfall calculated from two rainfall sources trmm rainfall retrievals vs rain gauge data and derived an assessment of the impact of trmm rainfall as forcing data in hydrologic applications and water balance analysis at the tiaoxi catchment china the results showed that the areal averaged rainfall differences calculated from the trmm gauge adjusted 3b42 vs the rain gauge rainfall sources were insignificant within an acceptable range the rain gauge observations showed a significantly better correlation when combined with the 3b42 data than with real time estimates 3b42rt product moreover due to detection defects concerning the heavy rainfall capacity the observed differences between max daily and max 5 day rainfall were large accordingly the daily trmm rainfall data were proven to be better in determining rainfall occurrence and mean rainfall values than in determining rainfall extremes furthermore even when the gauges used for adjustment are more than 60km away the generated monthly hydrologic process simulations demonstrated that the swat model using trmm 3b42 data as inputs produces a good fit overall on the other hand the statistical results showed that the trmm rainfall data were not suitable for daily streamflow simulation purposes in the area of interest the comparison of the discharge calculated by the three types of rainfall data showed that although the simulation with 3b42rt performance as not good both 3b42 and gauge rain sources could describe well the runoff volume and its composition which is very useful in watershed management given that over europe north america australia east and south asia andparts of africa the densities of gauge adjustment network are generally higher than in the tiaoxi watershed so trmm 3b42 data can be used effectively in these regions trmm data is an example of a satellite based rainfall product that has great potential in real world applications involving hydrologic simulation and water balance calculations at the monthly or seasonal time steps certain shortcomings were noted too for example due to trmm overestimation or underestimation in some years and in certain areas extreme rainfalls cannot be detected precisely thus reducing streamflow simulation accuracy at short time steps for flood forecasting purposes li et al 2014 the near real time monitoring of torrential rains and the accurate estimation of time accumulation of rain volume must be improved moreover given that satellite based rainfall data cover a large part of the world satellite based product assessment is necessary in different climatic areas in order for hydrologists and engineers to be able to apply current generation satellite based rainfall products for various purposes acknowledgements the authors would like to thank drs junjun zhi and yao zhu cers zhejiang university and dr shenpan lin michigan state

7608,high frequency components of precipitation variability have been an important focus of study during the last few decades in chile low frequency variations on the other hand have received less attention especially in association with multi decadal cycles that can affect variability trends of precipitation in the long term this study analyzes these low frequency patterns of precipitation in chile 30years and their relationship to global sea surface temperatures ssts with special focus on associations with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo indices singular spectrum analysis ssa and its multi channel version mssa techniques were applied to a dataset containing long instrumental records of monthly precipitation aggregated yearly and seasonally the relationships between the low frequency variability of precipitation and the pdo are significant to the north of the country whereas connections with the amo are significant to the north and also to the south this is also evident from the global spatial correlation analysis of low frequency precipitation modes and ssts where the southernmost station shows a strong relationship with the atlantic ocean we conclude that a significant multi decadal precipitation cycle between 40 and 60years is evident at the rain gauges located in the subtropical and extratropical regions of chile this low frequency variability seems to be largely linked to pdo and amo modulation keywords precipitation variability ssa mssa climate oscillations pdo amo 1 introduction in chile spectral analysis techniques have been used mainly to observe and model paleoclimate records most of these studies have shown that a substantial part of climate variability seems to be controlled by inter annual to decadal scale oscillations these oscillations include the 2 5 year quasi biennial oscillation qbo see graystone 1959 ebdon 1975 baldwin et al 2001 dean and kemp 2004 the 3 to 7 year el niño southern oscillation enso trenberth 1984 trenberth and hoar 1997 dawson and o hare 2000 and the 10 to 30 year pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua et al 1997 biondi et al 2001 deser et al 2010 for instance villalba et al 1998 applied singular spectrum analysis ssa to develop long term reconstructions 400years of seasonal and annual precipitation variations for northern patagonia east of the andes the study used 22 precipitation records 1912 1989 available between 39 and 43 s and 27 chronologies of austrocedrus chilensis collected along the eastern slopes of the andean patagonia oscillations observed in the power spectra of tree ring chronologies the precipitation records and the reconstructions were mainly associated with qbo the precipitation reconstructions also contained significant peaks in variance within the frequency range of enso however their results did not reveal a clear enso modulation of precipitation variability over the east of the southern andes in the chilean lake district 38 42 s fagel et al 2008 applied ssa to identify potential periodicities and reconstruct oscillatory components of varve thickness over the last centuries the procedure analyzed several short and long annual laminated sediments of lago peyuhue 40 s and 72 w which is located in a region where precipitation is often driven by the southern westerlies the authors found that frequency bands of varve thickness are mainly related to the periodicities of the qbo enso and pdo in addition le quesne et al 2009 developed a multi proxy approach to analyze historical glacier variations in the central andes of chile and argentina 33 36 s they developed a tree ring based multivariate model to reconstruct total annual precipitation of santiago de chile 1866 1999 the periodic behavior of the reconstructed precipitation time series was evaluated by extracting the dominant oscillatory components using ssa they found inter annual oscillatory modes 2 1 3 4yr that explained 18 4 of the variance and decadal inter decadal modes 13 23yr that explained 18 5 of the variance interestingly both the inter annual and decadal inter decadal signals of the el niño 3 4 index extracted by ssa showed better correlations with precipitation records than those observed for the extracted pdo signals aravena and luckman 2009 analyzed the dominant spatial and temporal patterns of a network of 23 homogenous instrumental precipitation records of southern south america 41 53 s finding mostly two to seven year oscillations for the patagonia plains atlantic 43 50 s and southern patagonia 51 53 s with a strong biannual oscillation mode decadal oscillations 12years were observed for the first leading mode of northwestern 41 44 s and central patagonia 45 47 s the regional annual precipitation was proposed to be strongly influenced by antarctic circulation modes i e the antarctic oscillation index or aao whereas enso influence on precipitation variability was less evident rubio álvarez and mcphee 2010 studied the time series of annual and seasonal streamflow of 44 rivers in southern chile spanning the ecoregion between 34 s and 45 s 1952 2003 ssa was applied to the original time series of composite streamflow anomalies to obtain reconstructed time series and their periodograms their results showed cycles of annual seasonal and spatially averaged streamflows covering a range between 2 and 11years the quasi biennial and quasi quadrennial periods were associated with enso while the six year period was related to the north pacific sea surface temperatures ssts the authors also indicated that longer near decadal periods of approximately 7 8 9 and 11years could be related to the pdo and aao oscillations urrutia et al 2011 developed a 410 year annual streamflow reconstruction for the maule river watershed 35 s 36 30 s with a climate like that of the mediterranean using austrocedrus chilensis tree ring chronologies their reconstruction revealed interannual interdecadal and multi decadal oscillation modes that were well correlated with climatic indices positive correlations were observed with the el niño 3 4 index correspondence between high tropical ssts and high streamflows and negative correlations were observed with the aao indicating that above average streamflows are significantly related to the negative phase of the aao this is the result of weakened sea level pressure slp in the mid latitudes and intensified slp in antarctica in this regard one of the most important detected oscillatory modes was an approximately 18 year cycle 30 of explained variance possibly related to the 18 6 year cycle of the lunar tides the other oscillatory mode is a 50 to 60 year cycle particularly significant after 1850 which could possibly be associated with the half gleissberg 70 100years solar magnetic cycle see details in peristykh and damon 2003 and the pdo although several studies have applied ssa to determine oscillatory components in different regions of chile most of them have been focused on the analysis of high to mid frequency modes of precipitation ranging particularly from quasi biennial to inter decadal scales 2 30years our study explores multi decadal patterns of precipitation defined here as those fluctuating over a period longer than 30years in chile by applying ssa and its multi channel version mssa these analyses were applied to a dataset of monthly series obtained from the longest instrumental records of precipitation in chile a span between 1866 and 2014 the degree of the relationship between low frequency modes of precipitation variability and the enso aao and pdo signals is also assessed this study contributes to an increased knowledge of how possible unknown multi decadal modes of sst or slp in the pacific basin and other atmospheric teleconnections could explain low frequency variability of precipitation at an annual seasonal and monthly scale 2 methods 2 1 study area continental chile is located in the pacific coast of south america between latitudes 17 30 s and 56 30 s about 4300km and is divided into 15 administrative regions the geography of the country is mainly dominated by steep mountainous terrains with only around 20 of the continental territory being flat the national territory is composed of 101 main hydrologic basins with more than 300 rivers flowing mainly from east to west the chilean territory is also characterized by a wide variety of landscapes from a geomorphological point of view it is possible to distinguish four major geographical units in the country andes mountains east intermediate depression coastal mountains and coastal plains west see valdés pineda et al 2014 northern chile 17 30 30 s is a hyper arid region under the persistent influence of the south east pacific anticyclone sepa which blocks the westerlies at low levels of the atmosphere as far south as 27 s the south american monsoon system sams brings easterly moisture from amazonia austral summer that generates rain shadow effect over the western andes and atacama desert i e annual accumulation increases from about 20mmyear 1 at 2700m a s l to 300mmyear 1 at 5000m a s l miller 1976 aceituno et al 1993 garreaud et al 2003 houston 2006 minvielle and garreaud 2011 in central chile 30 40 s the strong seasonality of precipitation results from the wintertime retreat of sepa which allows stronger low level westerlies to carry frontal systems to the continent montecinos and aceituno 2003 falvey and garreaud 2007 the annual accumulation peaks during austral winter and increases southward from around 100mm at 30 s to nearly 2000mm at 40 s quintana and aceituno 2012 due to the orographic effect of the andes mountains precipitation in central chile also increases about twice in the cross mountain direction falvey and garreaud 2007 viale and garreaud 2015 in southern and austral chile 40 56 30 s frontal cyclones drifting eastward along the oceanic storm tracks are responsible for most of the precipitation and day to day weather variations quintana and aceituno 2012 garreaud et al 2014 valdés pineda et al 2015 this translates into abundant precipitation accumulation in all seasons reaching more than 4000mmyear 1 along the western andes carrasco et al 2002 villarroel 2013 in general precipitation accumulation in chile tends to increase with latitude and altitude pizarro et al 2012 quintana and aceituno 2012 the annual progression of this latitudinal gradient shows perfect links with the interaction between westerlies and sepa fig 1 a for instance the band of westerlies displaces southward during austral summer strengthened sepa fig 1b and e and moves northward during austral winter weakened sepa fig 1c and d these patterns of precipitation variability are originated by the activity of sst in the equatorial pacific which indeed determines modes of variation such as enso and the pdo for instance research from the last few decades has established that inter annual precipitation variability in chile is related to enso rutllant and fuenzalida 1991 aceituno and garreaud 1995 garreaud and batisti 1999 montecinos and aceituno 2003 garreaud et al 2009 playing a major role during the austral winter valdés pineda et al 2016 the decadal to inter decadal variability of precipitation in the country has been mainly associated with the pdo mantua et al 1997 montecinos and aceituno 2003 garreaud et al 2009 quintana and aceituno 2012 in chilean patagonia another source of precipitation variability is the aao which is characterized by pressure anomalies of one sign centered in the antarctic and anomalies of the opposite sign on a circumglobal band at about 40 50 s garreaud et al 2009 quintana and aceituno 2012 villalba et al 2012 2 2 dataset precipitation records climate indices and gridded fields since our interest was essentially focused in detecting low frequency temporal variability 30years only instrumental records of more than 100years were used for ssa and mssa analysis the meteorological yearbooks of the meteorological directorate of chile dmc were reviewed to obtain the longest records of the country the dmc s database is digitally available only from 1920 to the present http 164 77 222 61 climatologia earlier digital records were acquired from the global historical climatology network database ghcn monthly

gov pub data ghcn v2 after checking all available data only 12 rain gauges evenly distributed between 26 and 53 s were selected see fig 2 these records spanning between 1866 and 2014 represent an important collection for southern south america chile since the current availability of digital climate data over many parts of the world is only restricted to the second half or the last third of the 20th century brunet and jones 2011 other long instrumental records have already been established in the united states see kunkel et al 1999 and europe see zolina et al 2009 the rain gauges located in northern regions were not included in the analysis because they have a significant number of zeros in the monthly and annual accumulation records that disturb the implementation of the methods used in this study only one rain gauge containing less than 100years of records puerto aysen at about 45 s was included in the analysis see table 1 because it presents important information for decision making about ongoing large scale hydroelectricity projects the records of valdivia which date back to 1853 see sanz donaire 2012 were not included in the analysis because from 1970 onwards another rain gauge located 15km away was used to continue the suspended records of valdivia national directorate of water resources of chile dga personal communication 2015 four climate indices and gridded

part of our study 2 3 time series analysis of precipitation records total annual accumulation at each raingauge was obtained by aggregating all monthly accumulations of each calendar year the seasonal series for dry oct mar and wet apr sept periods were split according to the chilean hydrologic year these time series were then standardized in order to give equal weight to all stations and avoid absolute value bias wilks 2011 once all the time series were organized we applied time series analysis tsa techniques to investigate temporal patterns of precipitation tsa is commonly used to detect all essential features of the records i e normality stationarity homogeneity presence absence of trends and persistence machiwal and jha 2012 machiwal et al 2015 we also used the autocorrelation function acf at different lags box and jenkins 1970 box et al 1994 to determine the degree of temporal dependency among precipitation observations at annual seasonal and monthly scales the acf was also useful to identify patterns in terms of trends seasonality and periodicity i e huesca et al 2015 2 4 low frequency modes of precipitation variability 2 4 1 singular spectrum analysis ssa taking into account the consistent length of the period of records we searched for significant low frequency cycles that could explain precipitation variability at a multi decadal scale in this regard ssa was applied to each individual annual seasonal and monthly series of precipitation and the climate indices the soi aao pdo and amo the details and applications of ssa to hydroclimatic series can be found in the last two decades of literature i e weare and nasstrom 1982 broomhead and king 1986a b fraedrich 1986 vautard and ghil 1989 ghil and vautard 1991 ghil et al 2002 marques et al 2006 h wang et al 2015 r wang et al 2015 therefore they are not described in this study 5 see appendix for more details about ssa and mssa 5 the approach is essentially a principal component pc analysis in the time domain which allows for the study of separated spectral contributions of the main oscillatory modes see vautard and ghil 1989 ghil et al 2002 golyandina et al 2001 hassani et al 2009 2015 hassani and thomakos 2010 unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2015 silva and hassani 2015 there are two important parameters to take into account when using ssa to extract each source signal i e a suitable selection of the window length l for constructing the trajectory matrix and the number of components or eigenvalues r to be retained h wang et al 2015 r wang et al 2015 the range of the window length l is usually in 2 l n 2 h wang et al 2015 r wang et al 2015 a discussion about the l parameter is provided by elsner and tsonis 2013 who remarked that choosing l n 4 is a common practice others authors suggest that l should be large enough but not larger than n 2 see golyandina et al 2001 mahmoudvand and zokaeiwe 2012 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 in general large values of l allow longer period oscillations to be resolved but choosing an l that is too large leaves too few observations from which to estimate the covariance matrix of the l variables in this study the l parameter was fixed to one half of the time series length since it has been shown to be a suitable size for the decomposition stage of low frequency patterns mahmoudvand and zokaeiwe 2012 for instance the l parameter for a 100 year series was 50years additionally in order to quantify the periodicities of the cycles associated to low frequency variability the first 10 leading modes pcs were retained and their significances calculated according to north 1982 fig 3 a then the periodicities of each pc were separately calculated using periodogram analysis as described in ghil et al 2002 and chatfield 2013 fig 3b those series with largest periodicities number of years or months as represented by the highest significant spectral peaks were selected as low frequency cycles for further analysis the multi taper method mtm was additionally applied to verify results from periodogram analysis see rao and hamed 2003 this method reduces the variance of spectral estimates by using a small set of tapers rather than the unique data taper or spectral window used by classical methods as fourier analysis ghil et al 2002 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 2 4 2 multi channel singular spectrum analysis mssa mssa approach was useful for obtaining a common structure of several series of precipitation and climatic oscillations see i e cañón et al 2007 and also for establishing causality between the different series the absence of causality between time series i e x and y implies that the knowledge of some predictor y series does not improve the quality of forecasts hassani et al 2010 while knowledge of some climate oscillation x series does not improve the quality of precipitation predictions mssa is a natural extension of ssa for analyzing multivariate time series the algorithm is almost the same as in the univariate mode however in this approach the henkel or trajectory matrix of the multivariate time series consists of stacked trajectory matrices of separate time series mssa also was applied to all rain gauge records in combination only with the soi pdo and amo 1912 2014 since they have much longer records than aao see section 2 2 the grand data matrix that was assembled as the hankel matrix see partington 1988 makowsky and labai 2015 was finally arranged containing records of precipitation and climate indices to be consistent with ssa analysis the l parameter was again fixed to one half of the time series length l n 2 this method has gained global popularity during the last decade for instance krishnamurthy and misra 2010 applied mssa to a climatic series of daily outgoing longwave radiation in the south american monsoon system recently zotov et al 2015 applied mssa to filter data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and separate its principal components pcs at different periodicities over the 15 largest river basins of russia despite this no studies in chile have used this multi channel version of the analysis at least using climate series however mssa has many applications and it is especially popular in analyzing and forecasting economic and financial time series patterson et al 2011 hassani et al 2013 hassani and mahmoudvand 2013 and for determining spatio temporal patterns using climate series i e krishnamurthy and stan 2015 krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2015 2 5 cross correlations between multi decadal modes of precipitation climate indices and gridded fields the large number of interactions comprising the complex ocean atmospheric system can be determined by analyzing the cross correlations between climate signals in order to better diagnose and understand the whole system because of its simplicity traditional cross correlation analysis tca has become the most widely used method for this purpose yuan et al 2015 especially in climatology research tca is used in various fields including dynamic diagnosing and climate forecasting yuan et al 2015 in accordance with this we analyzed the degree of the relationship between precipitation variability and climate indices by implementing traditional and lagged cross correlation analysis see details in bendat and piersol 2011 for instance the reconstructed low frequency modes of precipitation at each rain gauge rpc calculated from either ssa or mssa and the modes of climate indices were used as predictors of annual seasonal and monthly accumulation variability the same analysis was performed to derive significant correlation patterns between the low frequency modes of precipitation and sst and also extended in the discussion section to determine how this multi decadal signal mostly observed in the ocean can be easily detected at some atmospheric levels of pw and zw the idea of applying time lagged cross correlation analysis was to identify significant lagged predictors influencing the low frequency precipitation variability in the country this analysis was conducted through the use of lagged scatterplots one attribute of the lagged scatterplots is that they can show if the cross correlation is representative of the majority of the data or if it is driven by one or more outliers chatfield 2013 when the time series is completely random and the sample size is large the cross lagged correlation coefficient is approximately normally distributed with the mean 0 and the variance 1 n therefore the significance for the cross correlation analysis was calculated assuming that the approximate critical level of correlation at 95 significance α 0 05 is r 95 0 2 n where n is the sample size according to this criterion the required level of correlation for significance becomes very small in a large sample size chatfield 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 leading modes of precipitation and explained variance most of the significant low frequency oscillatory components of precipitation variability were identified within the first five leading modes of annual seasonal and monthly precipitation the sum of these five leading modes can explain annual precipitation variance ranging from 20 3 santiago to 51 puerto aysen with an average of 31 2 when considering all the rain gauges analyzed table 2 these explained variances are slightly smaller than those calculated by aravena and luckman 2009 for the first four leading modes of annual regional averaged indices of precipitation in the chilean patagonia 41 53 s between 1961 2000 but this is expected given the different periods and aggregations analyzed for instance the limited length of the pc series used by aravena and luckman 40years only allowed for the identification of frequency oscillations 20years which limited the ability to detect the signal of multidecadal climatic variations such as the pdo or amo 3 2 periodicities of the leading modes the periodicities calculated for the leading modes of annual seasonal and monthly precipitation ranged mainly from biennial to multi decadal oscillations for instance 79 1 of the first five leading modes of annual precipitation see table 2 are dominated by high frequency oscillations 2 9years which are expected to be associated to qbo and enso see fig 4 a as stated in previous studies for different regions of chile villalba et al 1998 fagel et al 2008 le quesne et al 2009 in addition 11 7 of these annual leading modes revealed oscillations between 9 and 30years which are expected to be connected primarily with the decadal to inter decadal modulation of the pdo fagel et al 2008 masiokas et al 2010 the remaining 9 2 of the annual leading modes revealed multi decadal oscillations 30years that can be linked to the multi decadal signal of the pdo as it can vary irregularly from inter annual to inter decadal time scales mantua et al 1997 deser 2010 dai 2013 dong and dai 2015 no studies have reported a possible influence of the amo signal in chile however as revealed in the following sections of this study the multi decadal modulation of the north atlantic ocean also influences low frequency precipitation variability in chile in addition as indicated by urrutia et al 2011 the half gleissberg solar magnetic cycle could be the external forcing influencing the multi decadal variability of ocean atmosphere processes the results found at an annual scale agree with those observed for monthly precipitation fig 4b and they are also consistent during wet fig 4c and dry fig 4d seasons 3 3 phase space representation most of these frequencies can be explained by looking at the phase diagrams that represent the trajectories of coupled pcs and are commonly found within the first few leading modes of variability fig 5 this is designed to seek not periodicities but rather repeated trajectories in the phase space kim et al 2015 the pcs are related in time as they trace out oscillations in the precipitation time series the low and high frequency cycles of precipitation are characterized by different trajectories multi decadal oscillations 30years for instance are represented by circular trajectories high frequency cycles are represented by different geometries depending on the periodicities of the signal i e triangles 3 yr cycle and pentagons 5 yr cycle well defined trajectories in the phase space are revealed at the annual scale since the noise level is smaller relative to the precipitation signal and vice versa the irregularities observed in some plots can be described mostly by inter annual variability hannachi 2004 3 4 low frequency modes of precipitation 3 4 1 annual and monthly scales the low frequency modes of annual and monthly precipitation 30years explain the largest variance at those rain gauges located in the northern and southern regions of the country fig 6 for instance the rpc1 of annual precipitation variability in copiapó located in northern chile at around 27 s reveals a significant semi centennial cycle fluctuating between 54 and 64years that explains 10 3 of the total variance this rain gauge is placed in the southern part of the atacama desert where precipitation is largely controlled by the sub tropical high pressure belt 15 30 s houston 2006 the upwelling cold peruvian current inhibits the moisture capacity of onshore winds below 1000m a s l and the proximity of the andean cordillera restricts moisture advection from the east houston 2006 therefore winter precipitation originates largely from northerly and easterly moving frontal systems originating from the pacific vuille and ammann 1997 surprisingly this multi decadal pattern was also significant at those rain gauges located along the westerlies wind belt located between 40 and 55 s as a result the rpc1 of annual accumulation in puerto aysen revealed a marked 42 year cycle that explained 14 3 of the variance punta arenas showed two significant leading modes rpc1 and rpc2 that explain 20 5 of the total variance and evolve in a cycle fluctuating between 42 and 64years in these regions high frequency precipitation is largely influenced by the southern annular mode sam or aao in combination with enso aravena and luckman 2009 elbert et al 2011 however the regime is quite variable both in space and time because of the topography of the andes and changes in the strength and latitudinal position of the southern westerlies garreaud et al 2009 for the same region of southern south america aravena and luckman 2009 detected frequencies of fewer than 15years observing decadal variations 12years in northwestern 41 44 s and central patagonia 45 47 s and 2 7year cycles with a strong biennial oscillation mode in the patagonia plains atlantic 43 50 s and southern patagonia 51 53 s 3 4 2 wet and dry seasons the rain gauges shown in fig 6 contain a notable multi decadal cycle which is also apparent at seasonal scale the low frequency rpc1 of those precipitation records is statistically significant in both wet apr sept and dry oct mar seasons being slightly stronger during the wet periods fig 7 the rpc1 observed for those rain gauges located in central chile revealed mostly high frequency oscillations 2 9years which cannot be attributed to the pdo or amo modulation for instance a significant biennial cycle was revealed for the rpc1 of santiago during dry seasons which suggests high enso modulation rutllant and fuenzalida 1991 aceituno and garreaud 1995 garreaud and batisti 1999 montecinos and aceituno 2003 valdés pineda et al 2016 the tropical and extra tropical factors affecting precipitation in central chile are not independent thus the positive negative phase of the southern oscillation and a strengthened weak subtropical high tend to be associated with an increased reduced baroclinicity at mid latitudes in the southeast pacific quintana and aceituno 2012 our results agree with those found by núñez et al 2013 who showed that changes in precipitation in central chile 30 36 s are not strongly related to shifts between the warm and cold phases of the pdo 3 4 3 climate indices the low frequency signals of the soi and aao did not share similarities with the low frequency cycles of precipitation observed in the extreme arid north and cold south regions of chile this pattern is consistent at annual seasonal and monthly scales the periodicities calculated for the low frequency signal rpc1 rpc2 of mean annual soi fig 8 a ranged between 5 8 and 6 8years with a total explained variance of 5 9 fig 8b and c and the low frequency component of the mean annual aao ranged between 5 1 and 6 0years with an explained variance of 14 7 these results are consistent with those described in section 1 of this paper i e studies in which enso and aao activity are strongly modulated by high frequency modes of variability which are not the focus of this study the first two reconstructed leading modes rpc1 and rpc2 of the pdo fig 8j reveal a significant multi decadal 51 to 58 year cycle with a total explained variance of 33 2 fig 8k and l which is consistent at annual seasonal and monthly scales this lower frequency component of the pdo with its characteristic multi decadal timescale of about 60years d orgeville and peltier 2007 has indicated regime shifts associated to ssts that can range between 50 and 80years see i e minobe 1997 lee et al 2013 steinman et al 2015 a 20 year quasi periodic oscillation observed in rpc5 and rpc6 is also suggested in previous studies minobe 1997 d orgeville and peltier 2007 as well as a quasi 30 to 35 year cycle observed in the rpc9 which is not significant under this ssa l n 2 this cycle however could be significantly related to inter decadal low frequency variability in north central chile as indicated by núñez et al 2013 the existence of multi decadal cycles was first evinced by schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 who detected a 65 to 70 year cycle for global mean temperature records in addition sst records of 11 globally distributed geographical regions showed that this multi decadal 50 to 90 year cycle is related to the first empirical orthogonal function eof of sst anomalies in the north atlantic region known as the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo knight et al 2005 justino and peltier 2005 trenberth and shea 2006 specifically positive negative phases of the amo coincide with warmer colder north atlantic ssts enfield et al 2001 mccarthy et al 2015 the leading low frequency modes of amo were calculated to determine possible unrevealed linkages between the multi decadal oscillations of precipitation observed over the extreme arid and cold regions of chile results reveal that rpc1 rpc2 of amo fig 8m evolve in a significant multi decadal 50 to 80 year cycle which explains more than 50 of the total variance fig 8n and o the determination of common oscillatory signals between the multi decadal modes of precipitation and climate indices using mssa is detailed in the following section 3 5 multi channel analysis of precipitation variability compared to the results from using ssa the determination of common oscillatory signals between precipitation and climate indices using mssa was associated with lower variances of the leading modes at all temporal scales this is due to the fact that precipitation is easily influenced by local factors which translates into more complex spatio temporal variability within the matrix containing the time series antunes et al 2006 gomes 2011 the first three low frequency modes l 52years associated with the matrix which includes all rain gauges the soi pdo and amo 1912 2014 revealed significant explained variances of 4 7 rpc1 3 6 rpc2 and 3 5 rpc3 the low values observed in these multi decadal modes are in central chile which is mostly dominated by high frequency enso modulation weighted cross correlations between normalized multi decadal components of precipitation and climate indices confirm positive relationships between pairs of multi decadal modes extracted from those rain gauges located in central chile these normalized modes are positively correlated with the pdo and negatively correlated with the soi and amo fig 9 a suggesting possible large scale multi decadal patterns that affect precipitation variability in central chile the multi decadal cycles however are much stronger and more significant in the extreme regions of the country therefore they constitute a primary basis upon which to explain the past present and future periodicities of extreme hydrologic events in those regions of chile when only copiapó and punta arenas are considered in the analysis with the soi pdo and amo l 52years the explained variances doubled compared to the previous results and the multi decadal modes are easily found within the first two significant components fig 9b in this regard the periodicity of the pdo signal indicates a clear multi decadal cycle that evolves in an almost identical phase to the multi decadal cycle of precipitation extracted for the atacama region s rain gauge fig 9c the amplitude of the multi decadal pdo signal is greater than the amplitude of the amo and soi therefore these three large scale patterns should have different levels of influence over long term precipitation variability in arid i e copiapó and cold i e punta arenas regions of chile for instance if both enso and the pdo are in the same phase it is suggested that el niño la niña impacts can be intensified conversely if enso and the pdo are out of phase they may offset one another preventing the impacts of a strong enso 3 6 phase space of multi decadal modes the evolution between each pair of multi decadal cycles of precipitation and climate indices can be defined as a dynamic system this system is described by trajectories such as those represented by phase space diagrams see i e sivakumar et al 2002 nolte 2010 kim et al 2015 these trajectories reveal significant offsets i e the trajectory representing the relationship between each pair of multi decadal modes showed that the pdo rpc1 rpc2 is significantly but slightly out of phase 4 year lagged with the series of copiapó fig 10 a surprisingly the multi decadal amo signal rpc1 rpc2 shows a strong negative 20 year lagged offset from the same multi decadal component fig 10b for punta arenas rpc1 rpc2 the positive lagged pdo relationship is less evident 10 year lagged since it shows a weaker linkage when outlining the trajectory of both components fig 10c the amo signal indicates phase shifts of about 25years which are weaker than the multi decadal mode of punta arenas fig 10d moreover the phase space representation of both rain gauges did reveal a relationship to a small degree and the most notable pattern is essentially that of copiapó offsetting punta arenas by about 12years fig 10e and f keeping in mind these previous relationships it is important to add that on the timescale of the pdo series 1900 2014 amo is shown to lag the pdo by 17years fig 10g and to lead the pdo by approximately 13years fig 10h and these latter results are in agreement with those found by d orgeville and peltier 2007 who stated that this relationship between the amo and the 60 year component of the pdo are signatures of the same oscillation cycle 3 7 spatial significances of multi decadal modes the projection of the multi decadal signals of the pdo and amo mssa l 52years onto grids of global ssts revealed unprecedented ocean climate linkages for chile we observed that the multi decadal pdo signal projected onto global ssts resulted in two significant bands concentrated over low strong pattern and high weak pattern latitudes of south america this suggests that large scale precipitation variability at annual and seasonal scales wet and dry conditions is driven by a significant multi decadal dipole warming over the pacific ocean fig 11 a as expected from previous results this spatial dipole was also found at all temporal scales when we projected the multi decadal mode of copiapó onto global ssts fig 11b the spatial distribution of this signal showed to be significantly stronger during dry conditions see appendix the multi decadal warming over the north atlantic ocean denotes global amo like significant patterns this low frequency signal which is significantly strong over the north atlantic contrasts with a weakened and not significant pattern over the eastern equatorial and subtropical pacific ocean fig 11c these weaker conditions over the eastern pacific basin are not evident over the western pacific which reveals significant patterns concentrated over low latitudes that can be associated with enhanced precipitation conditions over northeast australia sun et al 2015 and southeast asia i e indonesia the philippines china japan etc see lu et al 2006 zhang and delworth 2006 li et al 2015 this pattern also reveals two elongated significant bands of amo that extend towards mid and high latitudes of the eastern pacific at both hemispheres this ocean connection warm amo means more precipitation along the northwestern united states see enfield et al 2001 mccarthy et al 2015 but it also shows clear influences over the multi decadal signal of annual precipitation found for punta arenas fig 11d this annual signal also reveals a considerable connection with the south atlantic ocean which is significant but weakened during wet and dry conditions see figs b1 and b2 in the appendix 4 discussion 4 1 multi decadal cycles of precipitation variability the emergence of an approximately multi decadal oscillation has been investigated in different areas of the earth sciences klyashtorin et al 2009 for instance long tide gauge records show a significant oscillation with a period of around 60years for the majority of the tide gauges examined during the 20th century in every ocean basin of the world chambers et al 2012 in general these multi decadal oscillations are characterized by 30 year and 50 to 70 year periodic cycles klyashtorin and lyubushin 2007 klyashtorin et al 2009 in this study we extracted significant multi decadal components of precipitation that explain the largest variances at those rain gauges located in the extreme northern arid and southern cold regions of chile the periodicities calculated for these multi decadal components indicate cycles ranging between 40 and 64years these cannot be associated with the modes of the soi aao since their components at least soi show a weak multi decadal signal with a source of variability mostly dominated by strong high frequency cycles 10years the strong high frequency cycles introduce more noise into the precipitation records because of intensification or weakening of precipitation contributions this led to a much more difficult identification of multi decadal cycles of precipitation in central chile and as a result most of the rain gauges produced no significant outcomes this relationship also remained consistent and significant during wet and dry seasons on the other hand this large scale temporal variability of precipitation seems to be highly associated with the multi decadal features observed over the pacific pdo and atlantic amo oceans i e enfield et al 2001 mccabe et al 2004 mccarthy et al 2015 in fact these multi decadal signals are significantly correlated with those records of rain gauges located in the subtropical and extratropical regions of chile the pdo signal is stronger to the north of the country copiapó whereas the amo signal is strong in both the north and the south of the country punta arenas positive sst anomalies are observed during the positive phase of both oceanic oscillations this pattern is evident from the global spatial correlation of low frequency precipitation modes and ssts 4 2 multi decadal oscillations and extreme hydrometeorological events these unprecedented spatial linkages between the multi decadal precipitation variability over chile and the pdo and amo signals constitute an additional and important element to be considered when predicting future impacts associated with extreme hydrological events such as floods and droughts for example the extreme flood events that occurred during march and july of 2015 in the atacama desert wilcox et al 2016 which resulted in several deaths and economic loses were generated by two different ocean atmosphere processes that occurred during the high phase of amo the first event that occurred at the end of the dry season end of march was recently defined by barrett et al 2016 as a cutoff low with anomalous heights that moved east and was directed ashore near 25 s see fig c1 in the appendix by circulation around a very strong ridge centered near 60 s this phenomenon coincided with warmer temperatures in central chile and anomalously high pw content 20mm above climatological norms over the peruvian bight north westerlies picked up higher pw over an area of the subtropical eastern pacific ocean similar to that observed in fig 11 that had warmed rapidly during the prior week and was transported over the northern regions of chile the second event occurred during the rainiest month of the wet season july where moisture from westerlies reached the region as a frontal system due to a weakened sepa northward displacement this finding coincides with the significant positive correlation of amo with pw at 500 mb over the north and south regions of chile during the wet season apr sep in the north of chile the correlation concentrates over the area spanned by the sepa but in the south it appears as an elongated band extended from new zealand towards southern chile this correlation pattern is also significantly positive along the north east pacific coastline and reaches countries all along south america central america southern mexico and the united states fig 12 a it is important to mention that during the high phase of amo the pw reduces in the pacific basin and produces neutral to negative anomalies of pw in central chile however the subtropical and extratropical regions of chile reveal positive anomalies of pw which is part of a pattern extended all over the american continent on the other hand during the dry season oct mar this pattern of positive correlations is still observed in the coastline of northern chile but no longer in southern chile fig 12b according to these findings both march and july events could be potentially associated to the high phase of amo probably intensified by 2015 2016 enso which is strongly associated to a warmer ocean bozkurt et al 2016 higher precipitable water amounts and positive zw anomalies at 500 mb fig 13 a and b in northern and southern regions of chile such events must be also related to the interaction between different phases of enso the pdo and the amo which can intensify or diminish the impacts of each other according to their phases see i e wang et al 2013 when both enso and the pdo are in the same phase it is expected that el niño la niña impacts may be magnified generating positive negative precipitation anomalies over chile accordingly we hypothesize that this reinforcing was also evident during the recent positive phases of both enso and amo producing enhanced positive anomalies of precipitation in chile and other regions of the world the application of this knowledge will potentially benefit the predictive capacity of future extreme hydrometeorological events in semiarid basins of northern chile ungauged where times of concentration are low and lead times are essentially required to minimize impacts on the society 4 3 ongoing and future research the recent opposition between the warm positive phase of the amo and a substantially negative trending cold phase of the multi decadal pdo signal or pacific multi decadal oscillation pmo was apparently producing the slowdown or false pause of warming temperatures of the past decade steinman et al 2015 this global warming hiatus has been also described as the result of interactions between a secular warming tendency due in a large part to the buildup of anthropogenic co2 concentrations and an internally generated cooling due to a cool phase of a quasi 60 year oscillatory variability that is closely associated with the amo and pdo yao et al 2015 despite the hiatus periods that have appeared in surface air temperature records other components of the climate system associated with warming have continued at multi decadal scales these include displacements in the mean latitudinal position of the intertropical convergence zone itcz that vary on a similar cycle to the amo knudsen et al 2011 and likely linkages with external forces related to astronomical dynamics see i e scafetta 2010 knudsen et al 2014 these interrelations must be clarified in future studies in order to improve forecasting schemes and climate scenarios for near and long term impact assessment of extreme hydrological events these studies will need to include the effect of the multi decadal climate variability on the hydrological regime of chilean watersheds as a way to improve water governance schemes 5 conclusions multi decadal cycles of precipitation in chile are significant at annual seasonal and monthly scales the high frequency component associated with precipitation records of central chile is mostly related to the qbo enso and aao the enso represented by soi and the aao did not explain the multi decadal precipitation variability since their frequencies are lower than those observed for the multi decadal leading modes of precipitation variability the strong influence of the pdo and amo signals is significant over the multi decadal precipitation variability of the extreme regions of chile i e those located in low and high latitudes specifically the pdo correlations are evident in the north of the country whereas correlations with the amo are strong both in the north and in the south of the country for instance the raw signal of amo revealed to be significantly correlated with sst pw and zonal winds both measured at 500 mb suggesting that this multi decadal variability is not only observed in the ocean but also in tropospheric processes since the positive phase of amo is also related to higher pw and positive anomalies of zonal winds at 500 mb based on our results we conclude that the pdo and amo are two of the most important factors influencing multi decadal precipitation variability in these northern and southern regions of chile the result of the relationships between warm and cold phases of the enso aao pdo and amo must be researched further to determine the physical factors or patterns that explain this multi decadal mode of variability in chile and other regions of the world the possible connection between this multi decadal pattern and external forcing also must be examined in future studies gridded data and assembled models can be used as part of a future integrated approach to draw new conclusions about the physical origin and interrelations of these signals and these conclusions can be used to improve water governance schemes at catchment scale acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the dirección general de aguas de chile

research these contributions are greatly acknowledged appendix a singular spectrum analysis ssa traditionally the eof method finds a combination of variables which explains most of the variability usually observing high correlation in space however the significant correlation in time is not taken into account auto and cross correlation in time are very useful for prediction purposes and also for building stochastic time series models an extension of the traditional eof method is the extended empirical orthogonal functions eeofs which is a technique to deal not only with spatial but also with temporal correlations observed in climate data the method was first introduced by weare and nasstrom 1982 who applied it to the 300 mb relative vorticity a similar approach was developed to deal with the dynamical reconstruction of low order chaotic systems by broomhead and king 1986a b who called it singular system analysis ssa in the one dimensional case fraedrich 1986 proposed the name of the method as singular spectrum analysis ssa and a modified version named multichannel ssa m ssa recently patterson et al 2011 developed the non parametric method of multivariate singular spectrum analysis mssa for multi vintage data this approach has proven much more flexible than the standard methods of modelling which involve at least one of the restrictive assumptions of linearity normality and stationarity over the last few decades ssa has been considered a powerful technique in time series analysis and it has been developed and applied to many practical problems ssa has been described as a very useful tool that can be used for solving the following problems finding trends of different resolution smoothing extraction of seasonality components simultaneous extraction of cycles with small and large periods extraction of periodicities with varying amplitudes simultaneous extraction of complex trends and periodicities finding structure in short time series and change point detection vautard and ghil 1989 ghil et al 2002 golyandina et al 2001 hassani et al 2009 hassani and thomakos 2010 the ssa decomposes the original time series into a sum of small numbers of interpretable components such as a slowly varying trend an oscillatory component and noise the basic ssa method consists of two complementary stages decomposition and reconstruction each stage includes two separate steps at the first stage the series are decomposed to obtain the trajectory matrix at the second stage the noise free series are reconstructed for forecasting new data points a detailed description of the ssa technique is given in several publications for more explanations and comparison with other time series analysis techniques refer to the references provided in this article in general terms the whole procedure of the ssa technique depends upon two parameters i the lagged window length l ii the number of needed singular values for reconstruction r an improper choice of parameters l and r may yield incomplete reconstruction and misleading results in forecasting recent results obtained by mahmoudvand and zokaei 2012 show that the choice of l close to one half n 2 of the time series length is a suitable choice for the decomposition stage in most cases of ssa however in the case of climatic indices the oscillations reported in previous studies may be used as an appropriate lagged window length for analysis purposes appendix b spatial significances of multi decadal modes of wet and dry seasons appendix c extreme event of march 2015 in the atacama

7608,high frequency components of precipitation variability have been an important focus of study during the last few decades in chile low frequency variations on the other hand have received less attention especially in association with multi decadal cycles that can affect variability trends of precipitation in the long term this study analyzes these low frequency patterns of precipitation in chile 30years and their relationship to global sea surface temperatures ssts with special focus on associations with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo indices singular spectrum analysis ssa and its multi channel version mssa techniques were applied to a dataset containing long instrumental records of monthly precipitation aggregated yearly and seasonally the relationships between the low frequency variability of precipitation and the pdo are significant to the north of the country whereas connections with the amo are significant to the north and also to the south this is also evident from the global spatial correlation analysis of low frequency precipitation modes and ssts where the southernmost station shows a strong relationship with the atlantic ocean we conclude that a significant multi decadal precipitation cycle between 40 and 60years is evident at the rain gauges located in the subtropical and extratropical regions of chile this low frequency variability seems to be largely linked to pdo and amo modulation keywords precipitation variability ssa mssa climate oscillations pdo amo 1 introduction in chile spectral analysis techniques have been used mainly to observe and model paleoclimate records most of these studies have shown that a substantial part of climate variability seems to be controlled by inter annual to decadal scale oscillations these oscillations include the 2 5 year quasi biennial oscillation qbo see graystone 1959 ebdon 1975 baldwin et al 2001 dean and kemp 2004 the 3 to 7 year el niño southern oscillation enso trenberth 1984 trenberth and hoar 1997 dawson and o hare 2000 and the 10 to 30 year pacific decadal oscillation pdo mantua et al 1997 biondi et al 2001 deser et al 2010 for instance villalba et al 1998 applied singular spectrum analysis ssa to develop long term reconstructions 400years of seasonal and annual precipitation variations for northern patagonia east of the andes the study used 22 precipitation records 1912 1989 available between 39 and 43 s and 27 chronologies of austrocedrus chilensis collected along the eastern slopes of the andean patagonia oscillations observed in the power spectra of tree ring chronologies the precipitation records and the reconstructions were mainly associated with qbo the precipitation reconstructions also contained significant peaks in variance within the frequency range of enso however their results did not reveal a clear enso modulation of precipitation variability over the east of the southern andes in the chilean lake district 38 42 s fagel et al 2008 applied ssa to identify potential periodicities and reconstruct oscillatory components of varve thickness over the last centuries the procedure analyzed several short and long annual laminated sediments of lago peyuhue 40 s and 72 w which is located in a region where precipitation is often driven by the southern westerlies the authors found that frequency bands of varve thickness are mainly related to the periodicities of the qbo enso and pdo in addition le quesne et al 2009 developed a multi proxy approach to analyze historical glacier variations in the central andes of chile and argentina 33 36 s they developed a tree ring based multivariate model to reconstruct total annual precipitation of santiago de chile 1866 1999 the periodic behavior of the reconstructed precipitation time series was evaluated by extracting the dominant oscillatory components using ssa they found inter annual oscillatory modes 2 1 3 4yr that explained 18 4 of the variance and decadal inter decadal modes 13 23yr that explained 18 5 of the variance interestingly both the inter annual and decadal inter decadal signals of the el niño 3 4 index extracted by ssa showed better correlations with precipitation records than those observed for the extracted pdo signals aravena and luckman 2009 analyzed the dominant spatial and temporal patterns of a network of 23 homogenous instrumental precipitation records of southern south america 41 53 s finding mostly two to seven year oscillations for the patagonia plains atlantic 43 50 s and southern patagonia 51 53 s with a strong biannual oscillation mode decadal oscillations 12years were observed for the first leading mode of northwestern 41 44 s and central patagonia 45 47 s the regional annual precipitation was proposed to be strongly influenced by antarctic circulation modes i e the antarctic oscillation index or aao whereas enso influence on precipitation variability was less evident rubio álvarez and mcphee 2010 studied the time series of annual and seasonal streamflow of 44 rivers in southern chile spanning the ecoregion between 34 s and 45 s 1952 2003 ssa was applied to the original time series of composite streamflow anomalies to obtain reconstructed time series and their periodograms their results showed cycles of annual seasonal and spatially averaged streamflows covering a range between 2 and 11years the quasi biennial and quasi quadrennial periods were associated with enso while the six year period was related to the north pacific sea surface temperatures ssts the authors also indicated that longer near decadal periods of approximately 7 8 9 and 11years could be related to the pdo and aao oscillations urrutia et al 2011 developed a 410 year annual streamflow reconstruction for the maule river watershed 35 s 36 30 s with a climate like that of the mediterranean using austrocedrus chilensis tree ring chronologies their reconstruction revealed interannual interdecadal and multi decadal oscillation modes that were well correlated with climatic indices positive correlations were observed with the el niño 3 4 index correspondence between high tropical ssts and high streamflows and negative correlations were observed with the aao indicating that above average streamflows are significantly related to the negative phase of the aao this is the result of weakened sea level pressure slp in the mid latitudes and intensified slp in antarctica in this regard one of the most important detected oscillatory modes was an approximately 18 year cycle 30 of explained variance possibly related to the 18 6 year cycle of the lunar tides the other oscillatory mode is a 50 to 60 year cycle particularly significant after 1850 which could possibly be associated with the half gleissberg 70 100years solar magnetic cycle see details in peristykh and damon 2003 and the pdo although several studies have applied ssa to determine oscillatory components in different regions of chile most of them have been focused on the analysis of high to mid frequency modes of precipitation ranging particularly from quasi biennial to inter decadal scales 2 30years our study explores multi decadal patterns of precipitation defined here as those fluctuating over a period longer than 30years in chile by applying ssa and its multi channel version mssa these analyses were applied to a dataset of monthly series obtained from the longest instrumental records of precipitation in chile a span between 1866 and 2014 the degree of the relationship between low frequency modes of precipitation variability and the enso aao and pdo signals is also assessed this study contributes to an increased knowledge of how possible unknown multi decadal modes of sst or slp in the pacific basin and other atmospheric teleconnections could explain low frequency variability of precipitation at an annual seasonal and monthly scale 2 methods 2 1 study area continental chile is located in the pacific coast of south america between latitudes 17 30 s and 56 30 s about 4300km and is divided into 15 administrative regions the geography of the country is mainly dominated by steep mountainous terrains with only around 20 of the continental territory being flat the national territory is composed of 101 main hydrologic basins with more than 300 rivers flowing mainly from east to west the chilean territory is also characterized by a wide variety of landscapes from a geomorphological point of view it is possible to distinguish four major geographical units in the country andes mountains east intermediate depression coastal mountains and coastal plains west see valdés pineda et al 2014 northern chile 17 30 30 s is a hyper arid region under the persistent influence of the south east pacific anticyclone sepa which blocks the westerlies at low levels of the atmosphere as far south as 27 s the south american monsoon system sams brings easterly moisture from amazonia austral summer that generates rain shadow effect over the western andes and atacama desert i e annual accumulation increases from about 20mmyear 1 at 2700m a s l to 300mmyear 1 at 5000m a s l miller 1976 aceituno et al 1993 garreaud et al 2003 houston 2006 minvielle and garreaud 2011 in central chile 30 40 s the strong seasonality of precipitation results from the wintertime retreat of sepa which allows stronger low level westerlies to carry frontal systems to the continent montecinos and aceituno 2003 falvey and garreaud 2007 the annual accumulation peaks during austral winter and increases southward from around 100mm at 30 s to nearly 2000mm at 40 s quintana and aceituno 2012 due to the orographic effect of the andes mountains precipitation in central chile also increases about twice in the cross mountain direction falvey and garreaud 2007 viale and garreaud 2015 in southern and austral chile 40 56 30 s frontal cyclones drifting eastward along the oceanic storm tracks are responsible for most of the precipitation and day to day weather variations quintana and aceituno 2012 garreaud et al 2014 valdés pineda et al 2015 this translates into abundant precipitation accumulation in all seasons reaching more than 4000mmyear 1 along the western andes carrasco et al 2002 villarroel 2013 in general precipitation accumulation in chile tends to increase with latitude and altitude pizarro et al 2012 quintana and aceituno 2012 the annual progression of this latitudinal gradient shows perfect links with the interaction between westerlies and sepa fig 1 a for instance the band of westerlies displaces southward during austral summer strengthened sepa fig 1b and e and moves northward during austral winter weakened sepa fig 1c and d these patterns of precipitation variability are originated by the activity of sst in the equatorial pacific which indeed determines modes of variation such as enso and the pdo for instance research from the last few decades has established that inter annual precipitation variability in chile is related to enso rutllant and fuenzalida 1991 aceituno and garreaud 1995 garreaud and batisti 1999 montecinos and aceituno 2003 garreaud et al 2009 playing a major role during the austral winter valdés pineda et al 2016 the decadal to inter decadal variability of precipitation in the country has been mainly associated with the pdo mantua et al 1997 montecinos and aceituno 2003 garreaud et al 2009 quintana and aceituno 2012 in chilean patagonia another source of precipitation variability is the aao which is characterized by pressure anomalies of one sign centered in the antarctic and anomalies of the opposite sign on a circumglobal band at about 40 50 s garreaud et al 2009 quintana and aceituno 2012 villalba et al 2012 2

part of our study 2 3 time series analysis of precipitation records total annual accumulation at each raingauge was obtained by aggregating all monthly accumulations of each calendar year the seasonal series for dry oct mar and wet apr sept periods were split according to the chilean hydrologic year these time series were then standardized in order to give equal weight to all stations and avoid absolute value bias wilks 2011 once all the time series were organized we applied time series analysis tsa techniques to investigate temporal patterns of precipitation tsa is commonly used to detect all essential features of the records i e normality stationarity homogeneity presence absence of trends and persistence machiwal and jha 2012 machiwal et al 2015 we also used the autocorrelation function acf at different lags box and jenkins 1970 box et al 1994 to determine the degree of temporal dependency among precipitation observations at annual seasonal and monthly scales the acf was also useful to identify patterns in terms of trends seasonality and periodicity i e huesca et al 2015 2 4 low frequency modes of precipitation variability 2 4 1 singular spectrum analysis ssa taking into account the consistent length of the period of records we searched for significant low frequency cycles that could explain precipitation variability at a multi decadal scale in this regard ssa was applied to each individual annual seasonal and monthly series of precipitation and the climate indices the soi aao pdo and amo the details and applications of ssa to hydroclimatic series can be found in the last two decades of literature i e weare and nasstrom 1982 broomhead and king 1986a b fraedrich 1986 vautard and ghil 1989 ghil and vautard 1991 ghil et al 2002 marques et al 2006 h wang et al 2015 r wang et al 2015 therefore they are not described in this study 5 see appendix for more details about ssa and mssa 5 the approach is essentially a principal component pc analysis in the time domain which allows for the study of separated spectral contributions of the main oscillatory modes see vautard and ghil 1989 ghil et al 2002 golyandina et al 2001 hassani et al 2009 2015 hassani and thomakos 2010 unnikrishnan and jothiprakash 2015 silva and hassani 2015 there are two important parameters to take into account when using ssa to extract each source signal i e a suitable selection of the window length l for constructing the trajectory matrix and the number of components or eigenvalues r to be retained h wang et al 2015 r wang et al 2015 the range of the window length l is usually in 2 l n 2 h wang et al 2015 r wang et al 2015 a discussion about the l parameter is provided by elsner and tsonis 2013 who remarked that choosing l n 4 is a common practice others authors suggest that l should be large enough but not larger than n 2 see golyandina et al 2001 mahmoudvand and zokaeiwe 2012 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 in general large values of l allow longer period oscillations to be resolved but choosing an l that is too large leaves too few observations from which to estimate the covariance matrix of the l variables in this study the l parameter was fixed to one half of the time series length since it has been shown to be a suitable size for the decomposition stage of low frequency patterns mahmoudvand and zokaeiwe 2012 for instance the l parameter for a 100 year series was 50years additionally in order to quantify the periodicities of the cycles associated to low frequency variability the first 10 leading modes pcs were retained and their significances calculated according to north 1982 fig 3 a then the periodicities of each pc were separately calculated using periodogram analysis as described in ghil et al 2002 and chatfield 2013 fig 3b those series with largest periodicities number of years or months as represented by the highest significant spectral peaks were selected as low frequency cycles for further analysis the multi taper method mtm was additionally applied to verify results from periodogram analysis see rao and hamed 2003 this method reduces the variance of spectral estimates by using a small set of tapers rather than the unique data taper or spectral window used by classical methods as fourier analysis ghil et al 2002 golyandina and zhigljavsky 2013 2 4 2 multi channel singular spectrum analysis mssa mssa approach was useful for obtaining a common structure of several series of precipitation and climatic oscillations see i e cañón et al 2007 and also for establishing causality between the different series the absence of causality between time series i e x and y implies that the knowledge of some predictor y series does not improve the quality of forecasts hassani et al 2010 while knowledge of some climate oscillation x series does not improve the quality of precipitation predictions mssa is a natural extension of ssa for analyzing multivariate time series the algorithm is almost the same as in the univariate mode however in this approach the henkel or trajectory matrix of the multivariate time series consists of stacked trajectory matrices of separate time series mssa also was applied to all rain gauge records in combination only with the soi pdo and amo 1912 2014 since they have much longer records than aao see section 2 2 the grand data matrix that was assembled as the hankel matrix see partington 1988 makowsky and labai 2015 was finally arranged containing records of precipitation and climate indices to be consistent with ssa analysis the l parameter was again fixed to one half of the time series length l n 2 this method has gained global popularity during the last decade for instance krishnamurthy and misra 2010 applied mssa to a climatic series of daily outgoing longwave radiation in the south american monsoon system recently zotov et al 2015 applied mssa to filter data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and separate its principal components pcs at different periodicities over the 15 largest river basins of russia despite this no studies in chile have used this multi channel version of the analysis at least using climate series however mssa has many applications and it is especially popular in analyzing and forecasting economic and financial time series patterson et al 2011 hassani et al 2013 hassani and mahmoudvand 2013 and for determining spatio temporal patterns using climate series i e krishnamurthy and stan 2015 krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2015 2 5 cross correlations between multi decadal modes of precipitation climate indices and gridded fields the large number of interactions comprising the complex ocean atmospheric system can be determined by analyzing the cross correlations between climate signals in order to better diagnose and understand the whole system because of its simplicity traditional cross correlation analysis tca has become the most widely used method for this purpose yuan et al 2015 especially in climatology research tca is used in various fields including dynamic diagnosing and climate forecasting yuan et al 2015 in accordance with this we analyzed the degree of the relationship between precipitation variability and climate indices by implementing traditional and lagged cross correlation analysis see details in bendat and piersol 2011 for instance the reconstructed low frequency modes of precipitation at each rain gauge rpc calculated from either ssa or mssa and the modes of climate indices were used as predictors of annual seasonal and monthly accumulation variability the same analysis was performed to derive significant correlation patterns between the low frequency modes of precipitation and sst and also extended in the discussion section to determine how this multi decadal signal mostly observed in the ocean can be easily detected at some atmospheric levels of pw and zw the idea of applying time lagged cross correlation analysis was to identify significant lagged predictors influencing the low frequency precipitation variability in the country this analysis was conducted through the use of lagged scatterplots one attribute of the lagged scatterplots is that they can show if the cross correlation is representative of the majority of the data or if it is driven by one or more outliers chatfield 2013 when the time series is completely random and the sample size is large the cross lagged correlation coefficient is approximately normally distributed with the mean 0 and the variance 1 n therefore the significance for the cross correlation analysis was calculated assuming that the approximate critical level of correlation at 95 significance α 0 05 is r 95 0 2 n where n is the sample size according to this criterion the required level of correlation for significance becomes very small in a large sample size chatfield 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 leading modes of precipitation and explained variance most of the significant low frequency oscillatory components of precipitation variability were identified within the first five leading modes of annual seasonal and monthly precipitation the sum of these five leading modes can explain annual precipitation variance ranging from 20 3 santiago to 51 puerto aysen with an average of 31 2 when considering all the rain gauges analyzed table 2 these explained variances are slightly smaller than those calculated by aravena and luckman 2009 for the first four leading modes of annual regional averaged indices of precipitation in the chilean patagonia 41 53 s between 1961 2000 but this is expected given the different periods and aggregations analyzed for instance the limited length of the pc series used by aravena and luckman 40years only allowed for the identification of frequency oscillations 20years which limited the ability to detect the signal of multidecadal climatic variations such as the pdo or amo 3 2 periodicities of the leading modes the periodicities calculated for the leading modes of annual seasonal and monthly precipitation ranged mainly from biennial to multi decadal oscillations for instance 79 1 of the first five leading modes of annual precipitation see table 2 are dominated by high frequency oscillations 2 9years which are expected to be associated to qbo and enso see fig 4 a as stated in previous studies for different regions of chile villalba et al 1998 fagel et al 2008 le quesne et al 2009 in addition 11 7 of these annual leading modes revealed oscillations between 9 and 30years which are expected to be connected primarily with the decadal to inter decadal modulation of the pdo fagel et al 2008 masiokas et al 2010 the remaining 9 2 of the annual leading modes revealed multi decadal oscillations 30years that can be linked to the multi decadal signal of the pdo as it can vary irregularly from inter annual to inter decadal time scales mantua et al 1997 deser 2010 dai 2013 dong and dai 2015 no studies have reported a possible influence of the amo signal in chile however as revealed in the following sections of this study the multi decadal modulation of the north atlantic ocean also influences low frequency precipitation variability in chile in addition as indicated by urrutia et al 2011 the half gleissberg solar magnetic cycle could be the external forcing influencing the multi decadal variability of ocean atmosphere processes the results found at an annual scale agree with those observed for monthly precipitation fig 4b and they are also consistent during wet fig 4c and dry fig 4d seasons 3 3 phase space representation most of these frequencies can be explained by looking at the phase diagrams that represent the trajectories of coupled pcs and are commonly found within the first few leading modes of variability fig 5 this is designed to seek not periodicities but rather repeated trajectories in the phase space kim et al 2015 the pcs are related in time as they trace out oscillations in the precipitation time series the low and high frequency cycles of precipitation are characterized by different trajectories multi decadal oscillations 30years for instance are represented by circular trajectories high frequency cycles are represented by different geometries depending on the periodicities of the signal i e triangles 3 yr cycle and pentagons 5 yr cycle well defined trajectories in the phase space are revealed at the annual scale since the noise level is smaller relative to the precipitation signal and vice versa the irregularities observed in some plots can be described mostly by inter annual variability hannachi 2004 3 4 low frequency modes of precipitation 3 4 1 annual and monthly scales the low frequency modes of annual and monthly precipitation 30years explain the largest variance at those rain gauges located in the northern and southern regions of the country fig 6 for instance the rpc1 of annual precipitation variability in copiapó located in northern chile at around 27 s reveals a significant semi centennial cycle fluctuating between 54 and 64years that explains 10 3 of the total variance this rain gauge is placed in the southern part of the atacama desert where precipitation is largely controlled by the sub tropical high pressure belt 15 30 s houston 2006 the upwelling cold peruvian current inhibits the moisture capacity of onshore winds below 1000m a s l and the proximity of the andean cordillera restricts moisture advection from the east houston 2006 therefore winter precipitation originates largely from northerly and easterly moving frontal systems originating from the pacific vuille and ammann 1997 surprisingly this multi decadal pattern was also significant at those rain gauges located along the westerlies wind belt located between 40 and 55 s as a result the rpc1 of annual accumulation in puerto aysen revealed a marked 42 year cycle that explained 14 3 of the variance punta arenas showed two significant leading modes rpc1 and rpc2 that explain 20 5 of the total variance and evolve in a cycle fluctuating between 42 and 64years in these regions high frequency precipitation is largely influenced by the southern annular mode sam or aao in combination with enso aravena and luckman 2009 elbert et al 2011 however the regime is quite variable both in space and time because of the topography of the andes and changes in the strength and latitudinal position of the southern westerlies garreaud et al 2009 for the same region of southern south america aravena and luckman 2009 detected frequencies of fewer than 15years observing decadal variations 12years in northwestern 41 44 s and central patagonia 45 47 s and 2 7year cycles with a strong biennial oscillation mode in the patagonia plains atlantic 43 50 s and southern patagonia 51 53 s 3 4 2 wet and dry seasons the rain gauges shown in fig 6 contain a notable multi decadal cycle which is also apparent at seasonal scale the low frequency rpc1 of those precipitation records is statistically significant in both wet apr sept and dry oct mar seasons being slightly stronger during the wet periods fig 7 the rpc1 observed for those rain gauges located in central chile revealed mostly high frequency oscillations 2 9years which cannot be attributed to the pdo or amo modulation for instance a significant biennial cycle was revealed for the rpc1 of santiago during dry seasons which suggests high enso modulation rutllant and fuenzalida 1991 aceituno and garreaud 1995 garreaud and batisti 1999 montecinos and aceituno 2003 valdés pineda et al 2016 the tropical and extra tropical factors affecting precipitation in central chile are not independent thus the positive negative phase of the southern oscillation and a strengthened weak subtropical high tend to be associated with an increased reduced baroclinicity at mid latitudes in the southeast pacific quintana and aceituno 2012 our results agree with those found by núñez et al 2013 who showed that changes in precipitation in central chile 30 36 s are not strongly related to shifts between the warm and cold phases of the pdo 3 4 3 climate indices the low frequency signals of the soi and aao did not share similarities with the low frequency cycles of precipitation observed in the extreme arid north and cold south regions of chile this pattern is consistent at annual seasonal and monthly scales the periodicities calculated for the low frequency signal rpc1 rpc2 of mean annual soi fig 8 a ranged between 5 8 and 6 8years with a total explained variance of 5 9 fig 8b and c and the low frequency component of the mean annual aao ranged between 5 1 and 6 0years with an explained variance of 14 7 these results are consistent with those described in section 1 of this paper i e studies in which enso and aao activity are strongly modulated by high frequency modes of variability which are not the focus of this study the first two reconstructed leading modes rpc1 and rpc2 of the pdo fig 8j reveal a significant multi decadal 51 to 58 year cycle with a total explained variance of 33 2 fig 8k and l which is consistent at annual seasonal and monthly scales this lower frequency component of the pdo with its characteristic multi decadal timescale of about 60years d orgeville and peltier 2007 has indicated regime shifts associated to ssts that can range between 50 and 80years see i e minobe 1997 lee et al 2013 steinman et al 2015 a 20 year quasi periodic oscillation observed in rpc5 and rpc6 is also suggested in previous studies minobe 1997 d orgeville and peltier 2007 as well as a quasi 30 to 35 year cycle observed in the rpc9 which is not significant under this ssa l n 2 this cycle however could be significantly related to inter decadal low frequency variability in north central chile as indicated by núñez et al 2013 the existence of multi decadal cycles was first evinced by schlesinger and ramankutty 1994 who detected a 65 to 70 year cycle for global mean temperature records in addition sst records of 11 globally distributed geographical regions showed that this multi decadal 50 to 90 year cycle is related to the first empirical orthogonal function eof of sst anomalies in the north atlantic region known as the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo knight et al 2005 justino and peltier 2005 trenberth and shea 2006 specifically positive negative phases of the amo coincide with warmer colder north atlantic ssts enfield et al 2001 mccarthy et al 2015 the leading low frequency modes of amo were calculated to determine possible unrevealed linkages between the multi decadal oscillations of precipitation observed over the extreme arid and cold regions of chile results reveal that rpc1 rpc2 of amo fig 8m evolve in a significant multi decadal 50 to 80 year cycle which explains more than 50 of the total variance fig 8n and o the determination of common oscillatory signals between the multi decadal modes of precipitation and climate indices using mssa is detailed in the following section 3 5 multi channel analysis of precipitation variability compared to the results from using ssa the determination of common oscillatory signals between precipitation and climate indices using mssa was associated with lower variances of the leading modes at all temporal scales this is due to the fact that precipitation is easily influenced by local factors which translates into more complex spatio temporal variability within the matrix containing the time series antunes et al 2006 gomes 2011 the first three low frequency modes l 52years associated with the matrix which includes all rain gauges the soi pdo and amo 1912 2014 revealed significant explained variances of 4 7 rpc1 3 6 rpc2 and 3 5 rpc3 the low values observed in these multi decadal modes are in central chile which is mostly dominated by high frequency enso modulation weighted cross correlations between normalized multi decadal components of precipitation and climate indices confirm positive relationships between pairs of multi decadal modes extracted from those rain gauges located in central chile these normalized modes are positively correlated with the pdo and negatively correlated with the soi and amo fig 9 a suggesting possible large scale multi decadal patterns that affect precipitation variability in central chile the multi decadal cycles however are much stronger and more significant in the extreme regions of the country therefore they constitute a primary basis upon which to explain the past present and future periodicities of extreme hydrologic events in those regions of chile when only copiapó and punta arenas are considered in the analysis with the soi pdo and amo l 52years the explained variances doubled compared to the previous results and the multi decadal modes are easily found within the first two significant components fig 9b in this regard the periodicity of the pdo signal indicates a clear multi decadal cycle that evolves in an almost identical phase to the multi decadal cycle of precipitation extracted for the atacama region s rain gauge fig 9c the amplitude of the multi decadal pdo signal is greater than the amplitude of the amo and soi therefore these three large scale patterns should have different levels of influence over long term precipitation variability in arid i e copiapó and cold i e punta arenas regions of chile for instance if both enso and the pdo are in the same phase it is suggested that el niño la niña impacts can be intensified conversely if enso and the pdo are out of phase they may offset one another preventing the impacts of a strong enso 3 6 phase space of multi decadal modes the evolution between each pair of multi decadal cycles of precipitation and climate indices can be defined as a dynamic system this system is described by trajectories such as those represented by phase space diagrams see i e sivakumar et al 2002 nolte 2010 kim et al 2015 these trajectories reveal significant offsets i e the trajectory representing the relationship between each pair of multi decadal modes showed that the pdo rpc1 rpc2 is significantly but slightly out of phase 4 year lagged with the series of copiapó fig 10 a surprisingly the multi decadal amo signal rpc1 rpc2 shows a strong negative 20 year lagged offset from the same multi decadal component fig 10b for punta arenas rpc1 rpc2 the positive lagged pdo relationship is less evident 10 year lagged since it shows a weaker linkage when outlining the trajectory of both components fig 10c the amo signal indicates phase shifts of about 25years which are weaker than the multi decadal mode of punta arenas fig 10d moreover the phase space representation of both rain gauges did reveal a relationship to a small degree and the most notable pattern is essentially that of copiapó offsetting punta arenas by about 12years fig 10e and f keeping in mind these previous relationships it is important to add that on the timescale of the pdo series 1900 2014 amo is shown to lag the pdo by 17years fig 10g and to lead the pdo by approximately 13years fig 10h and these latter results are in agreement with those found by d orgeville and peltier 2007 who stated that this relationship between the amo and the 60 year component of the pdo are signatures of the same oscillation cycle 3 7 spatial significances of multi decadal modes the projection of the multi decadal signals of the pdo and amo mssa l 52years onto grids of global ssts revealed unprecedented ocean climate linkages for chile we observed that the multi decadal pdo signal projected onto global ssts resulted in two significant bands concentrated over low strong pattern and high weak pattern latitudes of south america this suggests that large scale precipitation variability at annual and seasonal scales wet and dry conditions is driven by a significant multi decadal dipole warming over the pacific ocean fig 11 a as expected from previous results this spatial dipole was also found at all temporal scales when we projected the multi decadal mode of copiapó onto global ssts fig 11b the spatial distribution of this signal showed to be significantly stronger during dry conditions see appendix the multi decadal warming over the north atlantic ocean denotes global amo like significant patterns this low frequency signal which is significantly strong over the north atlantic contrasts with a weakened and not significant pattern over the eastern equatorial and subtropical pacific ocean fig 11c these weaker conditions over the eastern pacific basin are not evident over the western pacific which reveals significant patterns concentrated over low latitudes that can be associated with enhanced precipitation conditions over northeast australia sun et al 2015 and southeast asia i e indonesia the philippines china japan etc see lu et al 2006 zhang and delworth 2006 li et al 2015 this pattern also reveals two elongated significant bands of amo that extend towards mid and high latitudes of the eastern pacific at both hemispheres this ocean connection warm amo means more precipitation along the northwestern united states see enfield et al 2001 mccarthy et al 2015 but it also shows clear influences over the multi decadal signal of annual precipitation found for punta arenas fig 11d this annual signal also reveals a considerable connection with the south atlantic ocean which is significant but weakened during wet and dry conditions see figs b1 and b2 in the appendix 4 discussion 4 1 multi decadal cycles of precipitation variability the emergence of an approximately multi decadal oscillation has been investigated in different areas of the earth sciences klyashtorin et al 2009 for instance long tide gauge records show a significant oscillation with a period of around 60years for the majority of the tide gauges examined during the 20th century in every ocean basin of the world chambers et al 2012 in general these multi decadal oscillations are characterized by 30 year and 50 to 70 year periodic cycles klyashtorin and lyubushin 2007 klyashtorin et al 2009 in this study we extracted significant multi decadal components of precipitation that explain the largest variances at those rain gauges located in the extreme northern arid and southern cold regions of chile the periodicities calculated for these multi decadal components indicate cycles ranging between 40 and 64years these cannot be associated with the modes of the soi aao since their components at least soi show a weak multi decadal signal with a source of variability mostly dominated by strong high frequency cycles 10years the strong high frequency cycles introduce more noise into the precipitation records because of intensification or weakening of precipitation contributions this led to a much more difficult identification of multi decadal cycles of precipitation in central chile and as a result most of the rain gauges produced no significant outcomes this relationship also remained consistent and significant during wet and dry seasons on the other hand this large scale temporal variability of precipitation seems to be highly associated with the multi decadal features observed over the pacific pdo and atlantic amo oceans i e enfield et al 2001 mccabe et al 2004 mccarthy et al 2015 in fact these multi decadal signals are significantly correlated with those records of rain gauges located in the subtropical and extratropical regions of chile the pdo signal is stronger to the north of the country copiapó whereas the amo signal is strong in both the north and the south of the country punta arenas positive sst anomalies are observed during the positive phase of both oceanic oscillations this pattern is evident from the global spatial correlation of low frequency precipitation modes and ssts 4 2 multi decadal oscillations and extreme hydrometeorological events these unprecedented spatial linkages between the multi decadal precipitation variability over chile and the pdo and amo signals constitute an additional and important element to be considered when predicting future impacts associated with extreme hydrological events such as floods and droughts for example the extreme flood events that occurred during march and july of 2015 in the atacama desert wilcox et al 2016 which resulted in several deaths and economic loses were generated by two different ocean atmosphere processes that occurred during the high phase of amo the first event that occurred at the end of the dry season end of march was recently defined by barrett et al 2016 as a cutoff low with anomalous heights that moved east and was directed ashore near 25 s see fig c1 in the appendix by circulation around a very strong ridge centered near 60 s this phenomenon coincided with warmer temperatures in central chile and anomalously high pw content 20mm above climatological norms over the peruvian bight north westerlies picked up higher pw over an area of the subtropical eastern pacific ocean similar to that observed in fig 11 that had warmed rapidly during the prior week and was transported over the northern regions of chile the second event occurred during the rainiest month of the wet season july where moisture from westerlies reached the region as a frontal system due to a weakened sepa northward displacement this finding coincides with the significant positive correlation of amo with pw at 500 mb over the north and south regions of chile during the wet season apr sep in the north of chile the correlation concentrates over the area spanned by the sepa but in the south it appears as an elongated band extended from new zealand towards southern chile this correlation pattern is also significantly positive along the north east pacific coastline and reaches countries all along south america central america southern mexico and the united states fig 12 a it is important to mention that during the high phase of amo the pw reduces in the pacific basin and produces neutral to negative anomalies of pw in central chile however the subtropical and extratropical regions of chile reveal positive anomalies of pw which is part of a pattern extended all over the american continent on the other hand during the dry season oct mar this pattern of positive correlations is still observed in the coastline of northern chile but no longer in southern chile fig 12b according to these findings both march and july events could be potentially associated to the high phase of amo probably intensified by 2015 2016 enso which is strongly associated to a warmer ocean bozkurt et al 2016 higher precipitable water amounts and positive zw anomalies at 500 mb fig 13 a and b in northern and southern regions of chile such events must be also related to the interaction between different phases of enso the pdo and the amo which can intensify or diminish the impacts of each other according to their phases see i e wang et al 2013 when both enso and the pdo are in the same phase it is expected that el niño la niña impacts may be magnified generating positive negative precipitation anomalies over chile accordingly we hypothesize that this reinforcing was also evident during the recent positive phases of both enso and amo producing enhanced positive anomalies of precipitation in chile and other regions of the world the application of this knowledge will potentially benefit the predictive capacity of future extreme hydrometeorological events in semiarid basins of northern chile ungauged where times of concentration are low and lead times are essentially required to minimize impacts on the society 4 3 ongoing and future research the recent opposition between the warm positive phase of the amo and a substantially negative trending cold phase of the multi decadal pdo signal or pacific multi decadal oscillation pmo was apparently producing the slowdown or false pause of warming temperatures of the past decade steinman et al 2015 this global warming hiatus has been also described as the result of interactions between a secular warming tendency due in a large part to the buildup of anthropogenic co2 concentrations and an internally generated cooling due to a cool phase of a quasi 60 year oscillatory variability that is closely associated with the amo and pdo yao et al 2015 despite the hiatus periods that have appeared in surface air temperature records other components of the climate system associated with warming have continued at multi decadal scales these include displacements in the mean latitudinal position of the intertropical convergence zone itcz that vary on a similar cycle to the amo knudsen et al 2011 and likely linkages with external forces related to astronomical dynamics see i e scafetta 2010 knudsen et al 2014 these interrelations must be clarified in future studies in order to improve forecasting schemes and climate scenarios for near and long term impact assessment of extreme hydrological events these studies will need to include the effect of the multi decadal climate variability on the hydrological regime of chilean watersheds as a way to improve water governance schemes 5 conclusions multi decadal cycles of precipitation in chile are significant at annual seasonal and monthly scales the high frequency component associated with precipitation records of central chile is mostly related to the qbo enso and aao the enso represented by soi and the aao did not explain the multi decadal precipitation variability since their frequencies are lower than those observed for the multi decadal leading modes of precipitation variability the strong influence of the pdo and amo signals is significant over the multi decadal precipitation variability of the extreme regions of chile i e those located in low and high latitudes specifically the pdo correlations are evident in the north of the country whereas correlations with the amo are strong both in the north and in the south of the country for instance the raw signal of amo revealed to be significantly correlated with sst pw and zonal winds both measured at 500 mb suggesting that this multi decadal variability is not only observed in the ocean but also in tropospheric processes since the positive phase of amo is also related to higher pw and positive anomalies of zonal winds at 500 mb based on our results we conclude that the pdo and amo are two of the most important factors influencing multi decadal precipitation variability in these northern and southern regions of chile the result of the relationships between warm and cold phases of the enso aao pdo and amo must be researched further to determine the physical factors or patterns that explain this multi decadal mode of variability in chile and other regions of the world the possible connection between this multi decadal pattern and external forcing also must be examined in future studies gridded data and assembled models can be used as part of a future integrated approach to draw new conclusions about the physical origin and interrelations of these signals and these conclusions can be used to improve water governance schemes at catchment scale acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the dirección general de aguas de chile

research these contributions are greatly acknowledged appendix a singular spectrum analysis ssa traditionally the eof method finds a combination of variables which explains most of the variability usually observing high correlation in space however the significant correlation in time is not taken into account auto and cross correlation in time are very useful for prediction purposes and also for building stochastic time series models an extension of the traditional eof method is the extended empirical orthogonal functions eeofs which is a technique to deal not only with spatial but also with temporal correlations observed in climate data the method was first introduced by weare and nasstrom 1982 who applied it to the 300 mb relative vorticity a similar approach was developed to deal with the dynamical reconstruction of low order chaotic systems by broomhead and king 1986a b who called it singular system analysis ssa in the one dimensional case fraedrich 1986 proposed the name of the method as singular spectrum analysis ssa and a modified version named multichannel ssa m ssa recently patterson et al 2011 developed the non parametric method of multivariate singular spectrum analysis mssa for multi vintage data this approach has proven much more flexible than the standard methods of modelling which involve at least one of the restrictive assumptions of linearity normality and stationarity over the last few decades ssa has been considered a powerful technique in time series analysis and it has been developed and applied to many practical problems ssa has been described as a very useful tool that can be used for solving the following problems finding trends of different resolution smoothing extraction of seasonality components simultaneous extraction of cycles with small and large periods extraction of periodicities with varying amplitudes simultaneous extraction of complex trends and periodicities finding structure in short time series and change point detection vautard and ghil 1989 ghil et al 2002 golyandina et al 2001 hassani et al 2009 hassani and thomakos 2010 the ssa decomposes the original time series into a sum of small numbers of interpretable components such as a slowly varying trend an oscillatory component and noise the basic ssa method consists of two complementary stages decomposition and reconstruction each stage includes two separate steps at the first stage the series are decomposed to obtain the trajectory matrix at the second stage the noise free series are reconstructed for forecasting new data points a detailed description of the ssa technique is given in several publications for more explanations and comparison with other time series analysis techniques refer to the references provided in this article in general terms the whole procedure of the ssa technique depends upon two parameters i the lagged window length l ii the number of needed singular values for reconstruction r an improper choice of parameters l and r may yield incomplete reconstruction and misleading results in forecasting recent results obtained by mahmoudvand and zokaei 2012 show that the choice of l close to one half n 2 of the time series length is a suitable choice for the decomposition stage in most cases of ssa however in the case of climatic indices the oscillations reported in previous studies may be used as an appropriate lagged window length for analysis purposes appendix b spatial significances of multi decadal modes of wet and dry seasons appendix c extreme event of march 2015 in the atacama

7609,understanding the relationships between extreme daily and sub daily rainfall events and their governing factors is important in order to analyse the properties of extreme rainfall events in a changing climate atmospheric temperature is one of the dominant climate variables which has a strong relationship with extreme rainfall events in this study a temperature rainfall binning technique is used to evaluate the dependency of extreme rainfall on daily maximum temperature the clausius clapeyron c c relation was found to describe the relationship between daily maximum temperature and a range of rainfall durations from 6min up to 24h for seven australian weather stations the stations being located in adelaide brisbane canberra darwin melbourne perth and sydney the analysis shows that the rainfall temperature scaling varies with location temperature and rainfall duration the darwin airport station shows a negative scaling relationship while the other six stations show a positive relationship to identify the trend in scaling relationship over time the same analysis is conducted using data covering 10year periods results indicate that the dependency of extreme rainfall on temperature also varies with the analysis period further this dependency shows an increasing trend for more extreme short duration rainfall and a decreasing trend for average long duration rainfall events at most stations seasonal variations of the scale changing trends were analysed by categorizing the summer and autumn seasons in one group and the winter and spring seasons in another group most of 99th percentile of 6min 1h and 24h rain durations at perth melbourne and sydney stations show increasing trend for both groups while adelaide and darwin show decreasing trend furthermore majority of scaling trend of 50th percentile are decreasing for both groups keywords extreme rainfall temperature climate change clausius clapeyron relation trend analysis seasonal variation 1 introduction predicting the impact of future climate change is a real challenge for hydrologists working to mitigate damage from climatic extremes the prediction of sub daily extreme rainfall events is vitally important in urban stormwater modelling studies which seek to recommend future drainage requirements herath et al 2016 there are several approaches are available in the literature to simulate the sub daily extreme rainfall events and most of these studies are based on the down scaling approach of the general climate model gcm predictors fowler et al 2007 herath et al 2016 willems

et al 2011 anthropogenic green house gas ghg emissions have significantly increased since the end of 20th century sachindra et al 2016 and in fact it has been found that it is likely that there is a relationship between climate change and ghg emissions crowley 2000 sachindra et al 2016 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc an increase in ghg emissions has led to changes in rainfall types and patterns across the world an increase in the occurrence of extreme events such as floods as a result of high intensity precipitation and droughts as a result of a lack of precipitation have been simulated using global climate models easterling et al 2000 hirabayashi et al 2008 ipcc 2012 for some parts of the world therefore to mitigate the damage from predicted future disasters it is important to identify the dependency of these extreme events on other climate variables kawagoe et al 2010 in the context of a changing climate research studies which evaluate the relationship between atmospheric temperature and extreme rainfall have been in demand over the last decade panthou et al 2014 utsumi et al 2011 wasko and sharma 2015 the general acceptance is that increases in temperature drive high intensity precipitation events in many parts of the world alexander et al 2006 allan and soden 2008 westra et al 2013 however this hypothesis remains uncertain and does not mean equal influence on all regions of the world fischer and knutti 2015 also this hypothesis is mainly based on future climate projections as governed by the clausius clapeyron c c

events according to the c c relationship the water holding capacity of the atmosphere increases at an exponential rate with increasing temperature over the last decade a number of studies have been conducted to determine the c c scaling relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature in different parts of the world including in australia hardwick jones et al 2010 china yu and li 2012 europe haerter et al 2010 lenderink et al 2011 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 japan utsumi et al 2011 hong kong lenderink et al 2011 and north america shaw et al 2011 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 studied the rainfall temperature scaling phenomena using binning technique approach and this work is recognised as a pioneering in this field they used the binning technique to determine the scale properties of hourly rainfall events by dividing rainfall into 2 c temperature bins the results of this study support the c c scaling hypothesis under some deviations specially scaling between extreme rainfall and temperature vary by significant amount in some occasions as an example higher percentile rainfall events show increased scale of up to 15 per c as a probable impact of intense convective rainfalls berg et al 2013 loriaux et al 2013 molnar et al 2015 furthermore previous studies show that rainfall temperature relationship is stronger for shorter rainfall duration than long durations panthou et al 2014 studied the rainfall temperature scaling over canada and they observed decreasing scale with increasing rain duration similar behaviour of rainfall temperature scaling is identified by wasko et al 2015 and hardwick jones et al 2010 for the australian storms also seasonal impacts on rainfall temperature scaling is analysed by berg et al 2009 and wasko and sharma 2014 over australia however the positive rainfall temperature scaling relationship is valid only for a certain temperature range and beyond this range negative scaling of extreme rainfall events with temperature is evident according to the study conducted by hardwick jones et al 2010 they concluded that availability of moisture is increasingly important in higher temperature therefore unavailability of adequate moisture amount at higher temperature leads decline trend of scale and relative humidity the aim of the study described here was to evaluate the variation of the rainfall temperature scaling relationship between daily maximum temperature and extreme rainfall events over the analysis time period studies described in the literature do not discuss the variation in rainfall temperature scaling relationships over long time periods as determined by analysing the data using different windows in time most of the studies calculated scale by considering the whole period as one slice of time consequently these studies do not show variations in scaling relationships for both past and present conditions studying variations in rainfall temperature scale trend enables researchers to project the behaviour of extreme rainfall events in the future therefore this study has three main goals i identify the relationship between daily and sub daily extreme precipitation and daily maximum temperature ii evaluate the variation in rainfall temperature scale for different time slices and iii analyse the impact of seasonality on rainfall temperature scale 2 study area and data sets australia is one of the driest continents in the world and rainfall pattern throughout the australia is highly seasonal rain gauge stations located across five australian states and two territories with longest record periods and least missing data were considered for this study therefore adelaide airport canberra airport darwin airport melbourne airport perth airport sydney observatory hill and brisbane regional rain gauge stations were selected for the study the locations of these rain gauge stations are presented in fig 1 the australian bureau of meteorology bom is a major provider of weather and climate data in australia for this study bom rainfall data and daily maximum temperature data were collected for the chosen sites detailed information on the seven selected stations is included in table 1 3 methodology the binning technique developed by lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 was used in this study to evaluate the empirical relationships between precipitation and temperature for each station the maximum rainfall depth on wet days defined as rainfall 0 3mm day for a given duration was grouped with the daily maximum temperature consistent results for daily mean temperature and daily maximum temperatures have been obtained by previous studies conducted by other researchers in the same area hardwick jones et al 2010 initial observations clearly indicated that the variation in temperature is primarily driven by seasonality in most locations therefore this study was carried out using yearly and seasonal lumped data there are few limitations have been identified by wasko and sharma 2014 in binning technique compare to the quantile regression approach specially these limitations and bias are associated with the approach of equal width temperature bins assignment of temperature bins of equal width leads to fewer pairs in upper and lower temperature bins furthermore fixing bin temperature ranges may result in empty bins being ignored and the distortion of the relationship between temperature and precipitation by considering the drawbacks associated with the use of equal width bins temperature bins were assigned an equal number of pairs per bin hardwick jones et al 2010 and the median temperature value of each bin was used to identify the bin the temperature range of each bin was then estimated to be approximately 2 c with the temperature range of the upper and lower tails slightly greater than 2 c another minor source of sampling uncertainty is related to the number of pairs in periodic samples as an example different number of pairs in a bin for 1991 2000 period and 2001 2010 period etc in generally sampling uncertainty takes high value at the presence of small number of pairs in a bin when consider the periodic analysis of all stations the median of the pairs in a temperature bin was 104 for this study for the winter spring season number of pairs was 51 and summer autumn season it was 50 therefore uncertainty generates through periodic sampling is minimum in this study to identify the c c scaling relationship between extreme rainfalls and temperature an exponential regression function was applied according to the literature hardwick jones et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 the relationship between precipitation p and temperature is described by eq 1 1 p 2 p 1 1 α δ t wherep 1 and p 2 are the precipitation percentiles at temperature t 1 and t 2 respectively δt is the temperature difference between t 1 and t 2 α is the precipitation temperature scaling co efficient where α 6 8 c 1 at 25 c equivalent to clausius clapeyron for the rainfall temperature scaling analysis the 99th and 50th percentiles of rainfall maxima for 6min 12min 30min 1h 2h 6h 12h and 24h rainfall durations were considered 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluating the rainfall temperature scaling relationship for extreme rainfall and daily maximum temperature initially by taking the total data period as one time slice the rainfall temperature scaling relationship was estimated for extreme rainfall events and daily maximum temperature fig 2 presents the distribution of the 99th and 50th percentiles of daily and sub daily extreme precipitation with daily maximum temperature according to fig 2 both the 99th and 50th percentiles of maximum rainfall events show exponential relationships with daily maximum temperature the relationships are especially strong more positive for the sub daily 6min 12min 30min 1h and 2h rainfall durations however in most instances the resultant exponential scaling rate does not agree with the generally accepted c c scale value of 6 8 c 1 fig 2 also shows that in general the rainfall temperature scaling rate for the 50th percentile has a lower value than the 99th percentile scaling rate and at most stations it is very close to zero for some stations adelaide darwin perth and sydney the scaling rate for the 50th percentile is negative for all rain durations the most significant result apparent in fig 2 is that the exponential scaling relationship exists only within a certain temperature range specifically the graphs show a reduction of the extreme rainfall intensities with increasing temperature between 30 c and 35 c except darwin station fig 3 was developed using eq 1 on the percentiles presented in fig 2 to present the scaling trend fig 3 illustrates the variation of rainfall temperature scaling based on station percentile and rain duration fig 3 a describes the variation in scaling of the 99th percentile of the daily and sub daily maximum rainfall durations 6min to 24h while fig 3 b describes the variation in scaling of the 50th percentile of the daily and sub daily maximum rainfall durations 6min to 24h further these both figures show approximately similar variation of rainfall temperature scaling for all stations except darwin airport it is also evident that with the exception of darwin airport the rainfall temperature scale takes a positive value for 6min to 2h duration for the 99th percentile further the rate of scale varying for the events with short durations 6min to approximately 2h in some stations it may vary from 6min to 1h or 6h is very low but the rate of scale varying is very high in the long duration events i e 2h to 24h range the 6min rainfall durations for the brisbane 7 2 and canberra 6 9 stations show the highest rainfall temperature scale values the melbourne airport station shows a positive scale for all the durations from 6min to 24h while for all other stations the variation in scale becomes negative for the 2h to 24h duration range however the behaviour of the darwin airport station data are different to that from the other stations and in particular the data show a negative scale relationship for all the rainfall durations the literature confirms that similar trends in scaling have been identified by other researchers for these parts of australia wasko and sharma 2015 the data presented in fig 3 b show that the 50th percentile rainfall temperature scale values are lower than the 99th percentile values the data also show a negative scale trend for all rainfall durations for the adelaide darwin perth and sydney stations while positive trends are apparent for short duration rainfall events for the brisbane canberra and melbourne stations furthermore according to fig 3 sensitivity of temperature on more extreme rainfall is higher than average extreme rainfall events it implies that rainfall temperature scaling relationship is highly visible at more extreme rainfall events which saturate release total water vapour amount in the atmosphere rather than average extreme rainfall events hardwick jones et al 2010 4 2 evaluating changes in rainfall temperature scale trends over time the trends in rainfall temperature scale variation were evaluated for different windows of time to allocate the adequate number of pairs into a single temperature bin to minimise the sampling uncertainty this evaluation was conducted for 10year time periods figs 4 6 describe the variation of scale for the 99th and 50th percentiles of 6min 1h and 24h rainfall durations respectively the least square method is used to determine the scaling variability with the time period it can be clearly observed that scales vary significantly from one time slice to the next as the uncertainty of estimated regression lines is very low it implies that climate factors behind the extreme rain events are changing with the time in general all the stations show significant changes within few decades as uncertainty of the regressions lines is very low it clearly verifies that changes are not due to the uncertainty from fig 4 a it can be observed that there is an increasing trend in c c scale for the 99th percentile for 6min extreme rainfall events at all stations except adelaide airport further melbourne and perth airports show the highest increasing trends these trends demonstrate that the influence of daily maximum temperature on more extreme rainfall durations above the 99th percentile is increasing for all stations except adelaide therefore there is a significantly high risk of the occurrence of extreme rainfall events in the future under the influence of increasing daily temperatures anyway fig 4 b presents the scaling trend for the 50th percentile of the 6min extreme rainfall event and clearly shows that all rain gauge stations except brisbane display a decreasing trend in scale over time among these decreasing trends the darwin station shows a significantly high rate of decrease therefore the influence of maximum temperature on the 50th percentile of 6min duration rainfall events is less significant than the 99th percentile it implies that the impact of future temperature change for average short period rainfalls is expected to be minimal whereas impact on extreme rainfalls is significantly high similar trend in scale variation of 1h daily maximum rainfalls can be observed at all stations except one station in fig 5 a the exception being the darwin station compared to fig 4 a fig 5 a shows that the highest increasing trend in scaling occurs at the melbourne station while the darwin and adelaide stations display a decreasing trend in scaling fig 5 b describes the trend of scale variation for the 50th percentile of daily maximum 1h rainfall duration and daily maximum temperature over time according to fig 5 b all station showing decreasing trends while the adelaide and darwin stations show the highest decreasing trend in scaling fig 6 a describes the trend in rainfall temperature scale for daily maximum temperature and the 99th percentile of daily rainfall it is apparent that the scale changing trend of 99th percentile daily rainfall differs from the scale changing trend of 99th percentile of 6min and 1h rainfall events according to fig 6 a only the melbourne perth and sydney stations show a slight increasing trend in the scale and all other stations show a decreasing trend in the scale fig 6 b describes the scaling trend of the 50th percentile of daily rainfall and it shows a decreasing trend for all stations except canberra these trends in extreme daily rainfall events suggest that increasing temperatures will have minimal influence on extreme daily rainfall in contrast to 6min extreme rainfall events therefore it is clear that rainfall temperature scale variation highly depends on location rain duration and the extremeness of the rainfall to further confirm the accuracy of the described graphical results of rainfall temperature scale variation trend over time 95 confidence interval ci of the slope of proposed trend lines are compared with the estimated variability to illustrate this a comparison is presented in table 2 for the 99th percentile of 6min 1h and 24h rainfall durations the uncertainty estimates of trend lines are smaller than the estimated variabilities thus implying that the computed scale slope changes are significant further as estimated 95 cis do not contain zero value it justifies the statistical significance of proposed trends except 24h at sydney and 1h at canberra also the investigation of the uncertainty associated with 50th percentile of rainfall temperature and seasonal rainfall temperature scale variation trend lines see section 4 3 confirms that the scale slope changes in times are significant 4 3 the impact of seasonal variation on rainfall temperature scaling trends understanding the average temporal changes of seasonal variation in rainfall temperature scaling trends is important as it enables the projection of seasonal influence on rainfall extremes in the future for this analysis the summer and autumn months dec may were placed in one group and the winter and spring months june november were placed in another a trend analysis was then conducted to identify the changes in rainfall temperature scale trend from extreme sub daily rainfall events to daily maximum temperature fig 7 describes the trend in the scale variation of the 99th percentile of extreme rainfall and daily maximum temperature seasonally the data presented in fig 7 show an increasing trend in scale for the melbourne perth and sydney stations for summer and autumn rainfalls for all durations 6min 1h and 24h in contrast the winter and spring rainfall events for melbourne and perth show increasing trend while adelaide and darwin show a decreasing trend fig 8 presents the seasonal trend variation of the 50th percentile of extreme rainfall events and daily maximum temperature based on the data presented in fig 8 the adelaide darwin and melbourne stations show a decreasing trend for both seasonal categories while the brisbane and canberra stations show an increasing trend for the summer and autumn seasons furthermore the sydney station shows an increasing trend only for the winter and spring season for the 6min duration rainfall events by comparing changes in rainfall temperature scale trend for the seasonal 99th and 50th percentiles it can be seen that the same trends are evident for the adelaide and darwin stations with the exception of the 6min duration events for the summer autumn rainfall for darwin the melbourne and perth stations show completely opposite trends in 99th and 50th percentile with the exception of the 6min duration events for the winter spring rainfall for perth however magnitude of the scale changing trend is highly variable due to the changes of seasonal storm types circulation patterns in different stations seasonal scale trends for the brisbane canberra and sydney stations are varied and it is difficult to identify any patterns these observations indicate the important role of different climatic factors play in the occurrence of seasonal rainfalls and rainfall temperature scale which is not surprising given that the processes driving rainfall are complex the intensity of extreme rainfall event depends on the combined impact of many number of variables however atmospheric temperature is one of the dominant variables driving the occurrence of intense rainfall events specially slow moving thunderstorms strong lows and tropical cyclone have significant impacts on local extreme rainfall events which make variations in rainfall temperature scale also large scale motion of the atmosphere emori and brown 2005 has a significant impact on extreme rainfall events and changes in moist adiabatic lapse rates o gorman and schneider 2009 is one of the reasons why variations in the scale occur furthermore local occurrence of precipitation extremes does not scale with water vapour content due to changes in moist adiabatic lapse rates and temperature anomalies changing cloud characteristics during rainfall events ke 2011 trenberth et al 2003 also have a significant impact on rainfall depth also high intense convective rainfall events show significantly high rainfall temperature scaling relationship rather than stratiform rainfall events molnar et al 2015 therefore consequent changing patterns in rainfall temperature scale could be explained by the combined impact of all these variables 5 conclusion the empirical relationship between extreme intensities on daily maximum temperature was investigated in this study using data from seven weather stations located throughout australia adelaide brisbane canberra darwin melbourne perth and sydney the scaling relationship for daily maximum temperature and the 99th and 50th percentile of 6min 12min 30min 1h 2h 6h 12h and 24h daily maximum rainfall for wet days rainfall 0 3mm was analysed to minimise the bias associated with c c scale analysis a technique placing an equal number of pairs in designated temperature bins was used to analyse the relationship the initial analysis was conducted by considering the total data period as a single window the results of this analysis were consistent with results reported in the literature with rainfall temperature scaling relationships found for all stations and evidence that the scale varies with location rain duration and temperature darwin station showed a negative scale relationship for both the 50th and 99th percentiles for all rainfall durations it is located in northern territory which has tropical climate throughout the year similar negative scale at weather stations under tropical climate in northern territory are observed by hardwick jones et al 2010 the other six stations showed similar patterns in scale relationship with the highest scale values resulting for 6min rainfall durations and the lowest for 24h rainfall durations for both percentiles these results imply that short duration rainfall events are more dependent on daily maximum temperature than long duration rainfall events however scaling values vary with the percentile of the rainfall event with the 99th percentile always producing a higher value than the 50th percentile therefore we can conclude that the relationship between daily maximum temperature and more extreme rainfall events not the daily maximum is stronger than the relationship with average rainfall events further scale is not constant over a range of temperatures with deviation especially evident at the lower and upper ends of the temperature range the results also show that the positive scaling range is independent from station to station similar behaviours are identified by other researchers in australia and other part of the world berg et al 2009 hardwick jones et al 2010 to identify the variation of this scale with time data was then analysed using 10year data windows the 99th and 50th percentiles of 6min 1h and 24h rainfall events were studied the adelaide station showed a significantly high decreasing rate of the scale for all rainfall events for both percentiles the darwin station also showed a decreasing trend in scale for all events with the exception of the 99th percentile of 6min rainfall events in comparison the other five stations showed an increasing trend in the scale for the 99th percentile of 6min rainfall events this increasing trend may be caused by frequent intensified convictive rainfall events as a result of climate change further the results also show a decreasing trend in the scale especially for the 50th percentile of long duration rainfall events seasonal variations in the trend of the scale change were analysed by placing the summer and autumn seasons in one group and the winter and spring seasons in another group the perth melbourne and sydney except 24h rainfall winter spring stations show increasing trend of scale for both groups while adelaide and darwin show decreasing trend for 99th percentile except 6min rainfall in summer autumn furthermore majority of scaling trend of 50th percentile are decreasing for both groups the uncertainty estimates associated with the observed changes of scaling slopes suggest that latter are significant finally these results clearly show that the rainfall temperature scaling relationship is limited to certain temperature range and this relationship depends on the percentile of rainfall the rainfall duration analysis period and the season both increasing and decreasing scaling trends were observed by periodic analysis according to these results it can be expected more extreme short duration rainfalls in some regions in the future acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of australian postgraduate award apa and

clearly indicated that the variation in temperature is primarily driven by seasonality in most locations therefore this study was carried out using yearly and seasonal lumped data there are few limitations have been identified by wasko and sharma 2014 in binning technique compare to the quantile regression approach specially these limitations and bias are associated with the approach of equal width temperature bins assignment of temperature bins of equal width leads to fewer pairs in upper and lower temperature bins furthermore fixing bin temperature ranges may result in empty bins being ignored and the distortion of the relationship between temperature and precipitation by considering the drawbacks associated with the use of equal width bins temperature bins were assigned an equal number of pairs per bin hardwick jones et al 2010 and the median temperature value of each bin was used to identify the bin the temperature range of each bin was then estimated to be approximately 2 c with the temperature range of the upper and lower tails slightly greater than 2 c another minor source of sampling uncertainty is related to the number of pairs in periodic samples as an example different number of pairs in a bin for 1991 2000 period and 2001 2010 period etc in generally sampling uncertainty takes high value at the presence of small number of pairs in a bin when consider the periodic analysis of all stations the median of the pairs in a temperature bin was 104 for this study for the winter spring season number of pairs was 51 and summer autumn season it was 50 therefore uncertainty generates through periodic sampling is minimum in this study to identify the c c scaling relationship between extreme rainfalls and temperature an exponential regression function was applied according to the literature hardwick jones et al 2010 utsumi et al 2011 the relationship between precipitation p and temperature is described by eq 1 1 p 2 p 1 1 α δ t wherep 1 and p 2 are the precipitation percentiles at temperature t 1 and t 2 respectively δt is the temperature difference between t 1 and t 2 α is the precipitation temperature scaling co efficient where α 6 8 c 1 at 25 c equivalent to clausius clapeyron for the rainfall temperature scaling analysis the 99th and 50th percentiles of rainfall maxima for 6min 12min 30min 1h 2h 6h 12h and 24h rainfall durations were considered 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluating the rainfall temperature scaling relationship for extreme rainfall and daily maximum temperature initially by taking the total data period as one time slice the rainfall temperature scaling relationship was estimated for extreme rainfall events and daily maximum temperature fig 2 presents the distribution of the 99th and 50th percentiles of daily and sub daily extreme precipitation with daily maximum temperature according to fig 2 both the 99th and 50th percentiles of maximum rainfall events show exponential relationships with daily maximum temperature the relationships are especially strong more positive for the sub daily 6min 12min 30min 1h and 2h rainfall durations however in most instances the resultant exponential scaling rate does not agree with the generally accepted c c scale value of 6 8 c 1 fig 2 also shows that in general the rainfall temperature scaling rate for the 50th percentile has a lower value than the 99th percentile scaling rate and at most stations it is very close to zero for some stations adelaide darwin perth and sydney the scaling rate for the 50th percentile is negative for all rain durations the most significant result apparent in fig 2 is that the exponential scaling relationship exists only within a certain temperature range specifically the graphs show a reduction of the extreme rainfall intensities with increasing temperature between 30 c and 35 c except darwin station fig 3 was developed using eq 1 on the percentiles presented in fig 2 to present the scaling trend fig 3 illustrates the variation of rainfall temperature scaling based on station percentile and rain duration fig 3 a describes the variation in scaling of the 99th percentile of the daily and sub daily maximum rainfall durations 6min to 24h while fig 3 b describes the variation in scaling of the 50th percentile of the daily and sub daily maximum rainfall durations 6min to 24h further these both figures show approximately similar variation of rainfall temperature scaling for all stations except darwin airport it is also evident that with the exception of darwin airport the rainfall temperature scale takes a positive value for 6min to 2h duration for the 99th percentile further the rate of scale varying for the events with short durations 6min to approximately 2h in some stations it may vary from 6min to 1h or 6h is very low but the rate of scale varying is very high in the long duration events i e 2h to 24h range the 6min rainfall durations for the brisbane 7 2 and canberra 6 9 stations show the highest rainfall temperature scale values the melbourne airport station shows a positive scale for all the durations from 6min to 24h while for all other stations the variation in scale becomes negative for the 2h to 24h duration range however the behaviour of the darwin airport station data are different to that from the other stations and in particular the data show a negative scale relationship for all the rainfall durations the literature confirms that similar trends in scaling have been identified by other researchers for these parts of australia wasko and sharma 2015 the data presented in fig 3 b show that the 50th percentile rainfall temperature scale values are lower than the 99th percentile values the data also show a negative scale trend for all rainfall durations for the adelaide darwin perth and sydney stations while positive trends are apparent for short duration rainfall events for the brisbane canberra and melbourne stations furthermore according to fig 3 sensitivity of temperature on more extreme rainfall is higher than average extreme rainfall events it implies that rainfall temperature scaling relationship is highly visible at more extreme rainfall events which saturate release total water vapour amount in the atmosphere rather than average extreme rainfall events hardwick jones et al 2010 4 2 evaluating changes in rainfall temperature scale trends over time the trends in rainfall temperature scale variation were evaluated for different windows of time to allocate the adequate number of pairs into a single temperature bin to minimise the sampling uncertainty this evaluation was conducted for 10year time periods figs 4 6 describe the variation of scale for the 99th and 50th percentiles of 6min 1h and 24h rainfall durations respectively the least square method is used to determine the scaling variability with the time period it can be clearly observed that scales vary significantly from one time slice to the next as the uncertainty of estimated regression lines is very low it implies that climate factors behind the extreme rain events are changing with the time in general all the stations show significant changes within few decades as uncertainty of the regressions lines is very low it clearly verifies that changes are not due to the uncertainty from fig 4 a it can be observed that there is an increasing trend in c c scale for the 99th percentile for 6min extreme rainfall events at all stations except adelaide airport further melbourne and perth airports show the highest increasing trends these trends demonstrate that the influence of daily maximum temperature on more extreme rainfall durations above the 99th percentile is increasing for all stations except adelaide therefore there is a significantly high risk of the occurrence of extreme rainfall events in the future under the influence of increasing daily temperatures anyway fig 4 b presents the scaling trend for the 50th percentile of the 6min extreme rainfall event and clearly shows that all rain gauge stations except brisbane display a decreasing trend in scale over time among these decreasing trends the darwin station shows a significantly high rate of decrease therefore the influence of maximum temperature on the 50th percentile of 6min duration rainfall events is less significant than the 99th percentile it implies that the impact of future temperature change for average short period rainfalls is expected to be minimal whereas impact on extreme rainfalls is significantly high similar trend in scale variation of 1h daily maximum rainfalls can be observed at all stations except one station in fig 5 a the exception being the darwin station compared to fig 4 a fig 5 a shows that the highest increasing trend in scaling occurs at the melbourne station while the darwin and adelaide stations display a decreasing trend in scaling fig 5 b describes the trend of scale variation for the 50th percentile of daily maximum 1h rainfall duration and daily maximum temperature over time according to fig 5 b all station showing decreasing trends while the adelaide and darwin stations show the highest decreasing trend in scaling fig 6 a describes the trend in rainfall temperature scale for daily maximum temperature and the 99th percentile of daily rainfall it is apparent that the scale changing trend of 99th percentile daily rainfall differs from the scale changing trend of 99th percentile of 6min and 1h rainfall events according to fig 6 a only the melbourne perth and sydney stations show a slight increasing trend in the scale and all other stations show a decreasing trend in the scale fig 6 b describes the scaling trend of the 50th percentile of daily rainfall and it shows a decreasing trend for all stations except canberra these trends in extreme daily rainfall events suggest that increasing temperatures will have minimal influence on extreme daily rainfall in contrast to 6min extreme rainfall events therefore it is clear that rainfall temperature scale variation highly depends on location rain duration and the extremeness of the rainfall to further confirm the accuracy of the described graphical results of rainfall temperature scale variation trend over time 95 confidence interval ci of the slope of proposed trend lines are compared with the estimated variability to illustrate this a comparison is presented in table 2 for the 99th percentile of 6min 1h and 24h rainfall durations the uncertainty estimates of trend lines are smaller than the estimated variabilities thus implying that the computed scale slope changes are significant further as estimated 95 cis do not contain zero value it justifies the statistical significance of proposed trends except 24h at sydney and 1h at canberra also the investigation of the uncertainty associated with 50th percentile of rainfall temperature and seasonal rainfall temperature scale variation trend lines see section 4 3 confirms that the scale slope changes in times are significant 4 3 the impact of seasonal variation on rainfall temperature scaling trends understanding the average temporal changes of seasonal variation in rainfall temperature scaling trends is important as it enables the projection of seasonal influence on rainfall extremes in the future for this analysis the summer and autumn months dec may were placed in one group and the winter and spring months june november were placed in another a trend analysis was then conducted to identify the changes in rainfall temperature scale trend from extreme sub daily rainfall events to daily maximum temperature fig 7 describes the trend in the scale variation of the 99th percentile of extreme rainfall and daily maximum temperature seasonally the data presented in fig 7 show an increasing trend in scale for the melbourne perth and sydney stations for summer and autumn rainfalls for all durations 6min 1h and 24h in contrast the winter and spring rainfall events for melbourne and perth show increasing trend while adelaide and darwin show a decreasing trend fig 8 presents the seasonal trend variation of the 50th percentile of extreme rainfall events and daily maximum temperature based on the data presented in fig 8 the adelaide darwin and melbourne stations show a decreasing trend for both seasonal categories while the brisbane and canberra stations show an increasing trend for the summer and autumn seasons furthermore the sydney station shows an increasing trend only for the winter and spring season for the 6min duration rainfall events by comparing changes in rainfall temperature scale trend for the seasonal 99th and 50th percentiles it can be seen that the same trends are evident for the adelaide and darwin stations with the exception of the 6min duration events for the summer autumn rainfall for darwin the melbourne and perth stations show completely opposite trends in 99th and 50th percentile with the exception of the 6min duration events for the winter spring rainfall for perth however magnitude of the scale changing trend is highly variable due to the changes of seasonal storm types circulation patterns in different stations seasonal scale trends for the brisbane canberra and sydney stations are varied and it is difficult to identify any patterns these observations indicate the important role of different climatic factors play in the occurrence of seasonal rainfalls and rainfall temperature scale which is not surprising given that the processes driving rainfall are complex the intensity of extreme rainfall event depends on the combined impact of many number of variables however atmospheric temperature is one of the dominant variables driving the occurrence of intense rainfall events specially slow moving thunderstorms strong lows and tropical cyclone have significant impacts on local extreme rainfall events which make variations in rainfall temperature scale also large scale motion of the atmosphere emori and brown 2005 has a significant impact on extreme rainfall events and changes in moist adiabatic lapse rates o gorman and schneider 2009 is one of the reasons why variations in the scale occur furthermore local occurrence of precipitation extremes does not scale with water vapour content due to changes in moist adiabatic lapse rates and temperature anomalies changing cloud characteristics during rainfall events ke 2011 trenberth et al 2003 also have a significant impact on rainfall depth also high intense convective rainfall events show significantly high rainfall temperature scaling relationship rather than stratiform rainfall events molnar et al 2015 therefore consequent changing patterns in rainfall temperature scale could be explained by the combined impact of all these variables 5 conclusion the empirical relationship between extreme intensities on daily maximum temperature was investigated in this study using data from seven weather stations located throughout australia adelaide brisbane canberra darwin melbourne perth and sydney the scaling relationship for daily maximum temperature and the 99th and 50th percentile of 6min 12min 30min 1h 2h 6h 12h and 24h daily maximum rainfall for wet days rainfall 0 3mm was analysed to minimise the bias associated with c c scale analysis a technique placing an equal number of pairs in designated temperature bins was used to analyse the relationship the initial analysis was conducted by considering the total data period as a single window the results of this analysis were consistent with results reported in the literature with rainfall temperature scaling relationships found for all stations and evidence that the scale varies with location rain duration and temperature darwin station showed a negative scale relationship for both the 50th and 99th percentiles for all rainfall durations it is located in northern territory which has tropical climate throughout the year similar negative scale at weather stations under tropical climate in northern territory are observed by hardwick jones et al 2010 the other six stations showed similar patterns in scale relationship with the highest scale values resulting for 6min rainfall durations and the lowest for 24h rainfall durations for both percentiles these results imply that short duration rainfall events are more dependent on daily maximum temperature than long duration rainfall events however scaling values vary with the percentile of the rainfall event with the 99th percentile always producing a higher value than the 50th percentile therefore we can conclude that the relationship between daily maximum temperature and more extreme rainfall events not the daily maximum is stronger than the relationship with average rainfall events further scale is not constant over a range of temperatures with deviation especially evident at the lower and upper ends of the temperature range the results also show that the positive scaling range is independent from station to station similar behaviours are identified by other researchers in australia and other part of the world berg et al 2009 hardwick jones et al 2010 to identify the variation of this scale with time data was then analysed using 10year data windows the 99th and 50th percentiles of 6min 1h and 24h rainfall events were studied the adelaide station showed a significantly high decreasing rate of the scale for all rainfall events for both percentiles the darwin station also showed a decreasing trend in scale for all events with the exception of the 99th percentile of 6min rainfall events in comparison the other five stations showed an increasing trend in the scale for the 99th percentile of 6min rainfall events this increasing trend may be caused by frequent intensified convictive rainfall events as a result of climate change further the results also show a decreasing trend in the scale especially for the 50th percentile of long duration rainfall events seasonal variations in the trend of the scale change were analysed by placing the summer and autumn seasons in one group and the winter and spring seasons in another group the perth melbourne and sydney except 24h rainfall winter spring stations show increasing trend of scale for both groups while adelaide and darwin show decreasing trend for 99th percentile except 6min rainfall in summer autumn furthermore majority of scaling trend of 50th percentile are decreasing for both groups the uncertainty estimates associated with the observed changes of scaling slopes suggest that latter are significant finally these results clearly show that the rainfall temperature scaling relationship is limited to certain temperature range and this relationship depends on the percentile of rainfall the rainfall duration analysis period and the season both increasing and decreasing scaling trends were observed by periodic analysis according to these results it can be expected more extreme short duration rainfalls in some regions in the future acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of australian postgraduate award apa and
