11580,the challenge of partitioning evapotranspiration et components and figuring out the main factors controlling et partitioning was addressed over four seasons in a furrow irrigated vineyard located in northeast china based on the directly measured vineyard et and its components soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t using eddy covariance microlysimeters and sap flow sensors respectively dynamics and controlling factors of et partitioning and dual crop coefficients were studied the seasonal cumulative et was 399 398 and 392mm where e was 185 245 and 224mm t was 173 167 and 158mm and e t was 358 412 and 382mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively seasonal average e represented about 52 59 of e t and t about 41 48 of e t seasonal et partitioning was mainly controlled by surface soil water content swc and leaf area index lai previous studies have found t et was correlated to lai using regression functions in this study a more biophysically robust model to estimate et partitioning from lai and swc is proposed based on dual crop coefficient theory the evaluation of the proposed model indicated that 46 of the vineyard et partitioning was explained soil evaporation coefficients k e were closely correlated to swc and peaked after rain and irrigation even exceeding 1 0 and basal crop coefficients k cb were mainly correlated to lai the average k cb was 0 12 0 31 0 40 0 42 0 31 and 0 18 from may to october respectively keywords evapotranspiration partition vineyard soil evaporation transpiration soil evaporation coefficient basal crop coefficient 1 introduction increasing population and food demands and diminishing water resources in arid and semiarid regions warrant using water efficiently in agriculture hexi corridor in northwest china one of the largest agricultural production areas in china is a severe water shortage region however most of the farmlands in this region were irrigated with water pumped from the groundwater or diverted from the rivers resulting in a decline of water level and rivers drying up kang et al 2017 in recent years large areas of wine grape were planted in this area 20533ha in 2015 accounting for 11 8 of the total in china the data was from the annual report of the development situation of the wine industry in the world and china and gansu province http www gsjye com show asp id 2864 while most of them were furrow irrigated with low water use efficiency wue zhang et al 2011 different from dense planting crops the vineyards have wide row spacing and soil makes up the largest proportion of the surface area thus soil evaporation e can be a substantial source of total evapotranspiration et kool et al 2014a compared with drip irrigated vineyards where water is used more efficiently with e et ranging from 0 09 to 0 31 fandiño et al 2012 ferreira et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 poblete echeverría et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 kool et al 2016 williams and fidelibus 2016 larger amounts of water are evaporated from soil when furrow irrigation is applied with e et about 0 48 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 thus there is a need for in depth research about et partitioning into soil evaporation and transpiration components for making reasonable irrigation strategies and improve wue for furrow irrigated vineyards different functions within agriculture system and distinct contributions to crop production of e and plant transpiration t require separate study of individual components of farmland water loss t is associated with plant productivity while e does not directly contribute to plant production agam et al 2012 kool et al 2014a many studies about et partitioning in vineyard have been conducted including direct measurements of et components using several instruments such as combining sap flow sensors sp and microlysimeters mly with the bowen ratio energy balance breb technique yunusa et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 combining sp and or mly with the eddy covariance system poblete echeverría et al 2012 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 and using the weighing lysimeter covered with a waterproof canvas to eliminate soil evaporation montoro et al 2016 and also indirect methods using models such as the dual crop coefficients approach fandiño et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 the shuttleworth wallace model zhang et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 and the below canopy energy balance approach kool et al 2016 the processes and controlling factors of water loss from soil surface and canopy are different soil evaporation is a physical process while transpiration is a physiological process both e and t are controlled by atmospheric evaporative demand and t is also highly correlated with vegetation leaf area index lai or canopy cover cc while e is highly correlated with surface soil water content swc mitchell et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 raz yaseef et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 thus factors affecting t and e both have influences on et partitioning however most previous studies paid more attention to the effects of vegetation on et partitioning mainly by generating regression functions between canopy size lai or cc and t et or e et kang et al 2003 kato et al 2004 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 wang and yamanaka 2014 yan et al 2015 villegas et al 2015 gong et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and it is not clear to what extent that et partitioning is controlled by surface soil water content though swc has a strong control on soil evaporation especially for sparse vegetation thus this study is aimed at establishing a quantitative biophysical robust function between vineyard et partitioning and controls lai and swc to provide a better way to interpret and model the et partitioning in order to implement an effective irrigation strategy grapevine water requirements should be known measuring crop et and relating it to reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 is the customary procedure to determine crop coefficients k c for irrigation management lópez urrea et al 2012 for sparse vegetation k c can be separated into two different components one related to plant transpiration k cb and another that quantifies soil evaporation k e wright 1981 1982 allen et al 1998 the k c value changes during the growing season with plant growth and canopy development with plants age and mature and with soil water content fluctuates allen et al 2007 many studies reported that vineyard k c and k cb are highly correlated with parameters that characterize crop canopy such as leaf area index canopy cover normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the percent of shaded area williams and ayars 2005 lópez urrea et al 2012 er raki et al 2013 hochberg et al 2016 kool et al 2016 montoro et al 2016 williams and fidelibus 2016 while soil evaporation coefficients k e which represent a large proportion of water loss in the vineyard little research has been conducted anderson et al 2017 studied seasonal variations of k e at three irrigated agricultural sites reporting that k e decreased with increasing crop age cover and residue deposition on the ground but made no quantitative assessments kool et al 2016 recently reported seasonal variations of k e in a drip irrigated vineyard and explored the responses of k e to irrigation events quantitative relationships between soil moisture and k e are not yet clear and how is k e affected by canopy development also needs to be considered to explore the biophysical controls on k cb and k e it is necessary to relate them to the canopy parameters and soil moisture conditions the validity of a combination of sap flow sensors and microlysimeters to partition et was evaluated and demonstrated by many studies including vineyards heilman et al 1994 trambouze et al 1998 yunusa et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 ferreira et al 2012 poblete echeverría et al 2012 maize filed jara et al 1998 ding et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 cotton field ham et al 1990 agam et al 2012 colaizzi et al 2012 olive orchards lópez olivari et al 2016 peach trees paço et al 2011 and apple trees gong et al 2007 liu et al 2012 a study was conducted in a furrow irrigated vineyard in northwest china during four growing seasons based on direct measurements of evapotranspiration and its components by eddy covariance system sap flow sensors and microlysimeters to a quantify vineyard et t and e b explore the seasonal variations of et partitioning e et t et in terms of controlling factors swc and lai and establish a biophysical function between t et and controls and c explore the seasonal dynamics of dual crop coefficients k cb k e and controlling factors the results of present work are expected to provide useful information for optimizing vineyard irrigation schedules and managing grapevine canopy growth reducing water use especially soil evaporation and improving water use efficiency and also providing useful information in developing models for et partitioning 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site measurements of evapotranspiration sap flow and soil evaporation were taken during the growing seasons in 2012 2015 in a flat and uniform merlot vitis vinifera l vineyard with a length of 1650m and a width of 1400m located in northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e 1585m a s l the experimental site is located in a continental temperate zone with a mean annual precipitation of 164 4mm annual temperature of 8 c and annual sunshine duration of over 3000h water is in severe shortage in this region the groundwater table is below 25m and the mean annual pan evaporation is about 2000mm the vineyard soil texture is sandy loam with an average bulk density of 1 47gcm 3 and field capacity of 0 28cm3 cm 3 to a depth of 1 6m the soil properties were determined by digging one trench 1m 1m along one row of the vineyard at 20cm intervals in the vertical direction in the position of ridge and furrow respectively then the soil samples were collected in the cutting ring and the physical properties were analyzed in the lab vineyard row orientation was approximately east west with 2 7m distance between rows the vines were planted 1 0m apart in 1999 and the shoots were maintained on a vertical plane by three iron wires at 0 5 1 0 and 1 5m height respectively supported by a 1 5m high trellis system zhang et al 2011 the vineyard was furrow irrigated with a trapezoid ditch on the north side of each row with depth bottom width and surface width of about 30 90 and 100cm respectively fig 1 a the wetted area by furrow irrigation was about 50 the irrigation quota is about 70mm each time and irrigation dates during the experimental periods were may 4 may 25 june 28 and august 26 in 2012 april 27 may 25 july 1 july 30 august 25 and october 13 in 2013 april 22 may 25 july 2 august 4 august 31 and october 18 in 2014 april 22 may 27 june 27 july 27 august 30 and october 15 in 2015 except for 2012 when the experiment was from late may to early september the experimental periods covered the whole vine growing season from bud break in late april to senescence in middle october from 2013 to 2015 2 2 measurement set up 2 2 1 vineyard evapotranspiration the energy balance of the vineyard including et was measured by an eddy covariance system campbell scientific inc usa located in the northwest of the vineyard and upwind fetch of the prevailing wind direction was 600m li et al 2015 net radiation model nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands was measured at 4 0m height between rows facing the south wind speed ultrasound virtual temperature the densities of atmosphere and water vapor were measured by a csat3 three dimensional sonic anemometer gill instruments uk and an open path h2o co2 analyzer li cor inr usa model li 7500 every 0 1s to obtain latent and sensible heat above the canopy at 4 0m height soil heat flux g was calculated as an average value of two plates model hfp01 hukseflux netherlands placed at 5cm below the soil surface in the ditch and ridge respectively fig 1b all probes were connected with a data logger model cr5000 cambell scientific usa and averages were computed in 30min the procedures for correcting eddy covariance measurements included the planar fit method for coordinate rotation paw et al 2000 finnigan et al 2003 and density correction according to webb et al 1980 directly measured latent and sensible heat fluxes were excluded on rainy days and filled by regression functions with main controlling factors r n lai and swc other gaps due to instrumental problems and power failure were also filled to calculate daily and seasonal energy fluxes the short gaps 2h were filled with linear interpolation and longer data gaps 2h and 24h were filled using the mean diurnal average method falge et al 2001 and gaps exceeding 24h were filled by regression functions with controlling factors finally the percentage of the half hourly data latent and sensible heat fluxes that was gap filled was 6 6 in 2012 2015 2 2 2 plant transpiration and soil evaporation grapevine transpiration was determined using a sap flow system flow32 1k system dynamax houston tx usa eight vines from 2012 to 2014 were selected near the eddy covariance system to measure sap flow while there were only three vines in 2015 because of instrument failure of sap flow sensors and the grapevines selected to install sap flow sensors were different in each year to prevent permanent damage to the vine trunks the types of sap flow sensors were sgb19 and sgb25 grapevine trunk diameters for sap flow measurements ranged in diameter from 1 71 to 3 40cm with an average diameter of 2 50cm since another alternative method was not available to determine vine transpiration simultaneously in this study it was impossible to calibrate the measurements of sap flow system but zhang et al 2011 found that the sum of t measured by sap flow without calibration and e measured by mls was very close to et estimated by the breb method in the same vineyard demonstrating the applicability of sap flow for measuring grape water use in this region and zhao et al 2015 also found that the sum of t measured by sap flow and e measured by mls was very close to hourly and daily et estimated by the ec method in the vineyard also qiu et al 2015 evaluated the good performance of the sap flow sensors by comparing the measured values with the simulated transpiration in a greenhouse hot pepper irrigation may result in flooding and damage the sensors so the sensors were disconnected before irrigation and reinstalled within 2 3days after irrigation zhang et al 2011 the sap flow rate was measured every 60s and recorded as 15 min averages with a cr1000 data logger cambell scientific usa sap flow ld 1 was scaled to tree transpiration mm d 1 using the average ground area of each vine 2 7 1 0m representing the distance of trees between row and within row respectively and the vineyard transpiration was averaged from all the monitored trees heilman et al 1994 daily soil evaporation was measured by 18 micro lysimeters mls made of pvc tubes with 10 cm inside diameter and 20 cm depth from 2013 to 2015 while by 9 mls in 2012 in 2012 three replicates of three mls each was installed at three different positions in the irrigation furrow s bottom and the shaded and non shaded portions of the un wetted furrow fig 1a in 2013 2015 three replicates of six mls each were deployed level with the soil surface along a cross section of the interrow at distances from the row center of 0 05 0 55 1 05 1 55 2 05 2 55m from south to north fig 1a previous studies reported that regular reinstallation of micro lysimeter mly to minimize the difference between soil moisture inside and outside the tubes was needed boast and robertson 1982 thus in present study one replication 6 mlys was reinstalled every 3 5 d from april 30 to july 6 in 2013 and compared with three unchanged replications 18mlys the difference between two methods was smaller e reinstalled 1 02e unchanged 0 11 r 2 0 89 49 observations thus the unchanged micro lysimeters were used zhao et al 2015 finally the daily e was obtained from total nine 2012 and eighteen 2013 2015 mls by weighing them using an electronic scale with a precision of 0 1g at 19 00 local time every day 2 2 3 soil moisture canopy and climate factors volumetric soil water content at a depth of 10cm below the soil surface was continuously monitored from 2013 to 2015 using six soil moisture sensors 5tm soil moisture temperature sensor decagon devices inc usa across the interrow fig 1c then the data were collected every 10min using a data logger em50 decagon devices inc usa and the average swc was calculated from the six sensors leaf area per tree was estimated using a function of the length with total leaf area per shoot of all the shoots on the tree ortega farias et al 2007 we selected 73 shoots samples and measured the total leaf area tla and length of each shoot and then obtained the relationship between tla and length of the sampled shoots then we measured the length of all the shoots on eight sampled trees every 7 15days in each year and then the average leaf area index was calculated details of the calibration of the model and calculation of vineyard lai in our study were interpreted in zhao et al 2015 linear interpolation was applied for the days in between the days of shoot length measurements to obtain a seasonal course of canopy development regular pruning of vine canopy to keep them under control and produce good fruit yields were needed throughout the growing season in present study once canopy pruning occurred the area of pruned leaves was measured and lai after pruning was also measured to capture the sudden decrease of the vineyard leaf area index to determine the extinction coefficient of light attenuation c we measured the diurnal courses every 1h of photosynthetically active radiation par above the canopy and near soil surface across the interrow using sunscan system channel technology group limited uk on several sunny days from late august to early october in 2014 with lai ranged between 1 4 and 2 2m2 m 2 however there was no significantly correlation between daily average c and canopy size c 0 326 0 01 lai n 10 r 2 0 01 p 0 82 thus we adopted the average value of observed c 0 322 for the whole growing seasons all climatic parameters solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed needed to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration et0 by the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and precipitation were measured by a standard automatic weather station hobo onset computer corporation capecod massachusetts usa at a height of 2 0m above the ground over a standard reference surface alfalfa about 3km from the vineyard 2 3 data analysis the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes le h should equal to the vineyard available energy r n g but energy balance closure is seldom achieved with ec system due to systematic underestimation of turbulent fluxes and misses of absorbed energy in the system wilson et al 2002 in the present study energy balance closure was evaluated by linear regression of half hourly turbulent fluxes le h against r n g and the intercept slope and r2 determination coefficient were 24 75wm 2 0 90 and 0 88 respectively the values were within the common results found in previous studies wilson et al 2002 li et al 2005 twine et al 2000 reported that the error of turbulent fluxes was the primary reason for ec underestimation and suggested that adjusting measured turbulent fluxes was necessary using the bowen ratio forced closure brfc method in the same region both ding et al 2010 in a maize field and li et al 2008 in a vineyard demonstrated the necessary of the brfc adjustment thus in this study we forced closure with the brfc approach reported by twine et al 2000 to adjust the original half hourly latent and sensible heat fluxes to calculate the proportion of daily transpiration to vineyard evapotranspiration t et the following strategies were adopted when t was directly measured by sap flow sensors t et were used and et was obtained from the eddy covariance system after the brfc adjustment when t was not directly measured while e was directly measured by microlysimerers et e et were used while when both directly measured e and t were not available t et was unavailable the daily soil evaporation coefficient k e and basal crop coefficient k cb was calculated as the ratio of directly measured daily soil evaporation and transpiration to daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 allen et al 1998 the measurement periods of the vineyard et e and t obtained directly by eddy covariance system microlysimeters and sap flow sensors in 2012 2015 were presented in fig 2 respectively previous studies reported that soil evaporation e was mainly controlled by the surface soil water content swc and net radiation r n mitchell et al 2009 raz yaseef et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 raz yaseef et al 2012 kool et al 2014b jiang et al 2016 kool et al 2016 thus in this study the gaps of missing daily e without direct microlysimeters measurements were filled by multiple regression between daily directly measured e and r n swc in 2013 2015 table 1 similar functions of gap filling soil evaporation based on swc and radiation fluxes were also reported and demonstrated by raz yaseef et al 2010 in a semi arid pine forest then the gaps of missing daily t without sap flow measurements were filled by the difference between daily e and et t et e to estimate the seasonal total grapevine transpiration note that the interpolated e and t values were only used in calculating seasonal total soil evaporation and transpiration while not used in analyzing relationships between daily e or t et against controlling factors 2 4 theoretical approach to explore the biophysical relationships between et partitioning and relevant controlling factors the commonly used dual crop coefficients method dual k c proposed by fao 56 was adopted in the present study allen et al 1998 in the dual k c method soil evaporation and plant transpiration were calculated as follows allen et al 1998 1 e k e e t 0 2 t k s k c b e t 0 3 e t k e k s k c b e t 0 where k cb k e and k s are basal crop coefficient soil evaporation and water stress coefficients respectively and et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mmd 1 based on eqs 1 and 2 the proportion of transpiration to evapotranspiration can be calculated as follows 4 t e t k s k c b k e k s k c b the root zone 40 140cm depth in the furrow where more than 84 of the grape roots propagated soil moisture swc and θ t the water content threshold below that the root zone depletion exceeds p taw and the water stress exits and the water stress coefficient k s were presented in fig 3 and p is the average fraction of total available soil water taw that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress reduction in et occurs 0 1 and is set to be 0 45 in present study based on fao 56 allen et al 1998 as shown in fig 3 water stress existed in late july and late august before the following irrigation when both canopy lai and evaporative demand et 0 were at high levels fig 4 thus we focused the analysis on days without water deficit k s 1 to calibrate and validate the proposed model in present study and eq 4 can be simplified as follows 5 t e t k c b k e k c b based on eq 97 in fao 56 allen et al 1998 k cb can be expressed as 6 k c b k c min k c b f u l l k c min 1 exp c l a i where k cmin is the minimum k c for bare soil k cb full is the estimated basal k cb during the mid season at peak plant size or height for vegetation having full ground cover or lai 3 c is the extinction coefficient of light attenuation 0 322 in this study based on direct ec measurements in early april 2015 when the vine canopy was not existent lai 0 k cmin was observed to be 0 004 in the present study thus we assumed that k cmin 0 and eq 6 can be simplified as 7 k c b k c b f u l l 1 exp c l a i based on eq 71 74 in fao 56 allen et al 1998 k e can be expressed as 8 k e k r k c max k c b f e w k c max where k cmax is the maximum value of k c following rain or irrigation f ew is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed 1 0 and wetted 1 0 for rainfall and 0 5 for irrigation k r is the dimensionless evaporation reduction coefficient dependent on the cumulative depth of water depleted evaporated from the topsoil which is expressed as follows based on eq 73 74 in allen et al 1998 9 k r t e w d e t e w r e w 1000 s w c 0 5 θ w p z e t e w r e w where tew is total evaporable water mm which is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the soil when the topsoil has been initially completely wetted eq 73 in allen et al 1998 d e is the cumulative depth of evaporation depletion from the soil surface layer mm rew is the readily evaporable water which is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the topsoil layer without restriction during stage 1 4 8mm for loamy sand soil table 19 in allen et al 1998 swc is the actual surface volumetric soil water content and θ wp is the surface soil water content at wilting point 0 10m3 m 3 in this study z e is the depth of the surface soil layer that is subject to drying by way of evaporation 0 10 0 15m eq 73 in allen et al 1998 in eq 8 k r k cmax k cb was less than f ew k cmax in most cases in present work data not shown thus k e can be simplified and calculated from eq 8 and 9 as follows 10 k e k c max k c b 1000 z e t e w r e w s w c 0 5 θ w p thus the daily proportion of plant transpiration to evapotranspiration t et can be calculated from eqs 5 7 and 10 as follows 11 t e t 1 exp c l a i exp c

representing k c max k c b f u l l 1 and 1000 z e t e w r e w respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal variations in vineyard et and its components the seasonal variations of daily vineyard evapotranspiration et and plant transpiration t measured by eddy covariance system and sap flow sensors from 2012 to 2015 were shown in fig 4 and the daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 and water inputs irrigation and precipitation were also displayed et 0 was relatively stable in april 4 17 0 37mmd 1 may 4 22 0 20mmd 1 june 4 10 47mmd 1 and july 3 94 0 51mmd 1 then decreased from 3 50 0 23mmd 1 in august to 2 55 0 23mmd 1 in september and to 1 82 0 22mmd 1 in october fig 4 the seasonal variations of et 0 indicated that the atmosphere evaporative demand maintained at a higher level in first half seasons and then decreased in the second half seasons for the whole growing seasons average vineyard et increased from 1 61 0 34mmd 1 in april to 3 08 0 66mmd 1 in july and decreased to 0 80 0 28mmd 1 in october it displayed a pattern similar to canopy growth and was also affected by water input events and increases of et were observed after irrigation or rain fig 4 the seasonal average of et was 2 09mmd 1 2 10mmd 1 2 21mmd 1 and 2 15mmd 1 in 2012 2015 respectively zhang et al 2007 reported daily et ranging from 0 1 to 4 3mmd 1 in a nearby furrow irrigated vineyard and also observed that et increased in response to rainfall or irrigation events in a drip irrigated vineyard in israel maximum et was around 3 5mmd 1 occurring either on the day of or on the day following irrigation when the canopy was fully developed kool et al 2016 similar results were also reported by poblete echeverría et al 2012 who observed peak daily et of 3 5 4 0mmd 1 in a drip irrigated vineyard in chile however williams and fidelibus 2016 reported a maximum etof 9mmd 1 and netzer et al 2009 also reported a maximum et ranged from 7 26 to 8 59mmd 1 in drip irrigated vineyards and the larger et in their studies resulted from the bigger canopy size than our study seasonal patterns of vine transpiration t resembled those of canopy development fig 4 average t increased from 0 52 0 17mmd 1 in may to 1 51 0 31mmd 1 in july and decreased to 0 37 0 35mmd 1 in october because of leaf senescence in october of 2014 and 2015 sudden decreases in t were observed due to a heavy frost in each year causing most of the leaves to die fig 4c d the seasonal average of t was between 0 98 1 00mmd 1 in 2013 2015 and 1 38mmd 1 in 2012 similar results were reported by zhang et al 2011 that seasonal vine t was dynamic from 0 13 to 2 69mmd 1 with an average of 1 25mmd 1 zhang et al 2010 also observed a seasonal average t of 1 2 1 4mmd 1 in a furrow irrigated vineyard however ferreira et al 2012 reported grapevine transpiration exceeding 4 0mmd 1 using sap flow techniques and the canopy seasonal average lai of 1 96 2 39m2 m 2 was bigger than our study seasonal average lai about 1 4m2 m 2 higher values were also reported by poblete echeverría et al 2012 with transpiration ranging from 0 8 to 3 2mmd 1 and averaged at 1 8mmd 1 dynamics of soil evaporation e indicated high fluxes during the wetting periods after irrigation or rain a maximum of 4 9mmd 1 and lower fluxes about 0 1 0 5mmd 1 during the drying periods while they didn t display seasonal variation correlated with canopy development fig 5 soil evaporation correlated well with soil water content at 10cm depth swc while relatively low values of e were observed in october 2014 under wet conditions due to the lower solar radiation fig 5c the seasonal average soil evaporation in 2013 2015 was 0 95mmd 1 1 28mmd 1 and 1 05mmd 1 respectively similar results were also reported by raz yaseef et al 2012 in a forest that seasonal dynamics of soil evaporation were highly correlated with soil water content at 5cm depth ding et al 2013 reported higher soil evaporation after irrigation and rainfall events in early growing seasons of maize field when the canopy was small kool et al 2016 reported that e remained relatively stable throughout the whole season in a drip irrigated vineyard but e was also affected by wetting events with e of 0 35 0 06mmd 1 on days with irrigation 0 19 0 05mmd 1 on the day after and 0 10 0 04mmd 1 on following days higher values of e in present study may be due to the higher wetting fraction of soil surface under furrow irrigation about 50 the wetted soil surface on the north half of the irrigated furrow was also exposed to the sunlight directly during the majority of the growing seasons under sparse canopies fig 1 and williams and fidelibus 2016 reported lower soil evaporation rates in a vineyard which was due to the wetted soil surface being covered by the canopy for the majority of the growing season thus e was mainly controlled by the atmospheric demand and soil surface moisture while not sensitive to the variation in canopy growth in present work which was similar to the results reported by flumignan et al 2011 for coffee trees the relationship between daily e and swc was shown in fig 6 and the effects of radiation on soil evaporation were also displayed indicating that e was simultaneously affected by the available energy and soil moisture table 1 similar exponential functions between e and swc were also reported by zhang et al 2011 in a vineyard jiang et al 2016 in a maize field and mitchell et al 2009 in semi arid eucalypt woodlands in the present study both vineyard et and component t and e were directly measured by eddy covariance sap flow sensors and microlysimeters respectively thus a comparison between daily et and the sum of t and e was evaluated and shown in fig 7 results indicated that the combination of sap flow and microlysimeters can provide reasonable measurements of total et and its components in the vineyard the reliability was evaluated by linear regression of daily e t against et the slope intercept and r 2 were 0 93 0 08mmd 1 and 0 77 and the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were 0 60mmd 1 and 0 44mmd 1 respectively fig 7 3 2 evapotranspiration partitioning based on the directly measured daily vineyard et and its components seasonal dynamics and biophysical controls of et partitioning were analyzed partitioning of daily et showed that e was the dominant component of vineyard et in early season and displayed a roughly seasonal decline trend with canopy developing fig 8 however in 2015 the rain was more equally distributed especially in the first half of the season from 20 may to 22 july which resulted in a relative higher soil moisture content and e et thus no obvious correlation between e et and canopy development was observed in the first half of the season in 2015 and before 20 may in 2015 relative lower e et values compared with 2013 and 2014 were observed though the canopy was very small which could be caused by the discrepancy of the eddy covariance and microlysimeters thus the data of t et before 20 may in 2015 were excluded in the calibration and validation of the parameters in the proposed model eq 12 in october 2014 and 2015 e took a high proportion of et about 90 due to a heavy frost that happened in both years resulting in a sharp decrease of plant transpiration figs 8c d and 4c d what is more remarkable is that daily et partitioning e et t et was closely correlated with soil surface water content swc e et increased after wetting events irrigation and rain and then gradually declined with drying of the soil even in middle season when the canopy was fully developed e et can exceed 80 under wet conditions fig 8c d while under dry conditions in middle season e et was low less than 20 or even 10 fig 8b c similar results were also reported by jara et al 1998 that the highest values of e et in a maize field were obtained at the beginning of the season after irrigation kool et al 2016 reported in a drip irrigated vineyard that e was a relatively large fraction of et and e et was variable and sensitive to wetting events in the early season while after a few weeks t dominated et comprising 90 of et and e et was quite stable and less sensitive to wetting events when the canopy was fully developed the higher proportion of soil evaporation in the present study is attributed to the large wetting fraction of soil surface under furrow irrigation and abundantly available energy for e because of the sparse vine canopy fig 1 to interpret the main factors affecting et partitioning the commonly used method is to use simple regression functions between related variables against measured e et or t et table 2 most of the previous studies focused on the effects of the canopy on et partitioning and lacked biophysical meanings and didn t consider the effects of swc however for sparse vegetation in this study e took a large proportion of et and was strongly affected by swc thus it was necessary to consider the effects of swc on et partitioning table 2 in the present study a more biophysically robust model between t et and biophysical factors lai swc derived from the dual crop coefficient method were used to interpret how vineyard et partitioning was regulated across the whole growing seasons according to eq 12 the relationships between vineyard daily t et and lai and swc fitted to the directly observed data in 2013 2015 were obtained in fig 9 the original value of parameters m and n obtained from k c max k c b f u l l 1 and 1000 z e t e w r e w was 0 304 0 680 and 5 172 respectively since m was variable in different years we set n to be constant 5 172 and only m needed to be fitted then the fitted parameter m was 0 522 0 495 and 0 491 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively and it was within the range of the original values 0 304 0 680 table 3 then we used the parameters obtained in 2013 in eq 12 to simulate the daily t et in 2014 and 2015 then compared with the directly measured values to validate the proposed model fig 10 results indicated that large discrepancies existed between the observed and estimated t et in 2014 while in 2015 the differences were small the performance of the proposed model in present study was not very high with a r 2 of 0 46 however if we use the simple regression between t et and lai and between t et and swc the corresponding coefficient of determination r 2 was 0 17 and 0 19 respectively data not shown and previous studies estimating t et or e et based on the influencing factors also reported relative lower accuracy e g a r 2 of 0 43 by wang et al 2014 and poor performance by zhang et al 2013 the relative lower accuracy of the proposed model in present study could be caused by 1 though a more biophysically robust model was used and both canopy and soil moisture were considered other influencing factors such as the growing stages reported by wang et al 2014 relating to the physiological characteristics were ignored 2 some assumptions were made in present study to simplify the model such as expressing k cb as a function of lai and k cmin was zero eq 6 and 7 and k r k cmax k cb was less than f ew k cmax in eq 8 data not shown 3 the reliability of the dual crop coefficients method in partitioning et in vineyard was reported by previous studies poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 however an underestimation of e and overestimation of t or vice versa could enlarge the deviation of estimated t et from the observed values though the estimated e or t did not differ much from the observed values zhao et al 2015 4 the directly measured e and t were not absolute precise though e t was close to et fig 7 which could also induce errors of the parameters in the model compared with previously reported relationships between et partitioning and lai the biophysically robust model obtained in the present study considered the effects of surface soil moisture on et partitioning under wet conditions when soil evaporation was high t et was relatively low even when the canopy was fully developed fig 9 and for a given lai t et decreased with increasing swc because of the increasing of soil evaporation previous studies have demonstrated the importance of lai in regulating et partitioning and the effects of swc on soil evaporation thus using the observed input parameters lai swc to estimate vineyard t et by the proposed model in this study can provide useful information about the interaction effects of lai and swc on et partitioning different surface soil water regimes swc 0 08 0 10 0 14 and 0 20cm3 cm 3 were selected to calculate the variability of t et under different lai fig 11 under the same swc t et increased with lai which was similar to previous studies kato et al 2004 wang et al 2014 gong et al 2017 for a given swc the t et increased significantly with increasing lai when lai was small i e soil surface was not fully covered by the canopy especially under dry conditions then gradually became stable when canopy reaching maximum fig 11b as shown in fig 11a the directly observed t et displayed a close relationship with canopy development when lai 1 6m2 m 2 however when the canopy was fully developed lai 1 6m2 m 2 the observed t et showed a decrease trend because the soil evaporation was high caused by high swc fig 11a note that the parameters m n obtained in the present study with lai 2 5 m2 m 2 may produce errors when employing eq 12 to estimate t et under high lai conditions lai 2 5m2 m 2 but the type of the function in eq 11 was universal across different ecosystems after the gap filling of missing soil evaporation and transpiration without directly measurements the cumulative etand its components were shown in fig 12 seasonal total et from bud break until harvest late april to middle october was 399mm 398mm and 392mm where e was 185mm 245mm and 224mm t was 173mm 167mm and 158mm and e t was 358mm 412mm and 382mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 12 noted that in 2013 the measurements of e and t ended up earlier than et and the total etobtained from eddy covariance was 389mm during the measurement periods of e and t fig 12a the seasonal soil evaporation fraction e e t was higher in 2014 59 5 and 2015 58 6 with a seasonal average swc of 0 134cm3 cm 3 and 0 135cm3 cm 3 respectively while in 2013 the seasonal e e t was 51 7 with an average swc of 0 126cm3 cm 3 indicating that surface soil moisture may have influences on the annual vineyard et partitioning kool et al 2016 reported seasonal cumulative et in a drip irrigated vineyard of 261mm where e 24mm was 9 of et and t 237mm accounted for 91 of poblete echeverría et al 2012 also observed average t et about 72 in a drip irrigated merlot vineyard also in a drip irrigated vineyard lópez urrea et al 2012 reported seasonal total soil evaporation of 114mm 71mm and 98mm and vine transpiration of 426mm 290mm and 416mm in 2007 2009 respectively with a seasonal t et of 79 80 and 81 respectively compared with drip irrigation a larger proportion of water was evaporated from soil surface under furrow irrigation in the vineyard indicating that the irrigation water could be used more efficiently in the future if the drip irrigation method were adopted 3 3 dual crop coefficients the seasonal dynamic of soil evaporation coefficients k e and basal crop coefficients k cb in 2012 2015 was shown in figs 13 and 14 k e e et 0 and k cb t et 0 were calculated from the directly measurements by sap flow and microlysimeters to investigate the effects of wetting events irrigation and rain and swc on k e the datasets were classified into several sub datasets based on the swc values development of daily k e was mainly influenced by wetting events after irrigation and rainfall k e suddenly increased to a high level even exceeding 1 0 and then gradually declined as soil became dry fig 13 under dry conditions k e was relatively stable and less than 0 2 note that the maximum k e was observed after rainfall not after irrigation due to the wetting fraction of soil surface after irrigation was 50 but nearly 100 after precipitation the seasonal trend of k e was not related to canopy development due to the canopy was small and has low effects on soil surface available energy k cb displayed a seasonal trend with canopy development the average k cb was 0 12 0 03 0 31 0 05 0 40 0 10 0 42 0 08 0 31 0 03 and 0 18 0 10 from may to october respectively fig 14 in october of 2014 and 2015 a sudden decrease of k cb was observed due to a heavy frost causing most of the leaves to die and a sudden decrease in transpiration see fig 4c d compared with previous studies in the vineyard the k e observed in present work was much higher while k cb was similar to other studies in a drip irrigated vineyard lópez urrea et al 2012 reported k e about 0 08 0 16 0 07 0 19 and 0 05 k cb about 0 18 0 22 0 33 0 46 and 0 46 0 69 in early middle and late seasons respectively and the maximum daily k e was less than 0 3 also in a drip irrigated vineyard kool et al 2016 reported that k e were highest on 0days after irrigation dai 0 averaging about 0 05 and reducing to 0 03 and 0 01 on dai 1 and dai 1 respectively and k e appeared to remain constant and was less than 0 06 throughout the whole growing season and the peak values of k cb around 0 4 0 5 were observed in middle season while williams and fidelibus 2016 reported a maximum k cb of 1 2 and a seasonal average k cb of 0 93 during the vine growing seasons with a bigger canopy than our study and cancela et al 2015 in a vineyard reported that k e was very close to k c because of the high number of rainfall events and the daily k e ranged between 0 and 0 9 which was similar to our study also in a drip irrigated vineyard montoro et al 2016 reported higher values of k cb 0 20 1 0 and lower k e less than 0 25 than our study similar results of vineyard k cb were also reported by fandiño et al 2012 between 0 07 and 0 57 and by poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 between 0 20 and 0 55 overall higher k e values in our study under furrow irrigation indicated that large fractions of irrigated water were evaporated from surface soil compared with drip irrigation based on eq 7 the relationship between daily k cb and lai was obtained in 2012 2015 similar results in the vineyard were also reported by previous studies ferreira et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 montoro et al 2016 fig 15 a k e was strongly controlled by surface soil moisture and a linear relationship was observed between k e and swc in our study which has not been reported by previous studies fig 15b 4 conclusions based on the directly measured vineyard et and its components dynamics and controlling factors of et partitioning and dual crop coefficients were studied main findings are outlined as follows 1 seasonal total et from bud break until harvest was 399 398 and 392mm where e was 185 245 and 224mm t was 173 167 and 158mm and e t was 358 412 and mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively seasonal average e represented about 52 59 of e tand t about 41 48 of e t 2 seasonal et partitioning was controlled by surface soil water content swc and leaf area index lai and annual et partitioning was related to swc 3 a biophysically robust model based on the dual crop coefficients method which can describe the effects of lai and swc on et partitioning was proposed in the present study and explained 46 of the vineyard et partitioning 4 soil evaporation coefficients were strongly affected by wetting events irrigation and rain and closely correlated to swc and basal crop coefficients were mainly correlated with canopy development acknowledgements the research was financially supported by the national

11580,the challenge of partitioning evapotranspiration et components and figuring out the main factors controlling et partitioning was addressed over four seasons in a furrow irrigated vineyard located in northeast china based on the directly measured vineyard et and its components soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t using eddy covariance microlysimeters and sap flow sensors respectively dynamics and controlling factors of et partitioning and dual crop coefficients were studied the seasonal cumulative et was 399 398 and 392mm where e was 185 245 and 224mm t was 173 167 and 158mm and e t was 358 412 and 382mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively seasonal average e represented about 52 59 of e t and t about 41 48 of e t seasonal et partitioning was mainly controlled by surface soil water content swc and leaf area index lai previous studies have found t et was correlated to lai using regression functions in this study a more biophysically robust model to estimate et partitioning from lai and swc is proposed based on dual crop coefficient theory the evaluation of the proposed model indicated that 46 of the vineyard et partitioning was explained soil evaporation coefficients k e were closely correlated to swc and peaked after rain and irrigation even exceeding 1 0 and basal crop coefficients k cb were mainly correlated to lai the average k cb was 0 12 0 31 0

increasing population and food demands and diminishing water resources in arid and semiarid regions warrant using water efficiently in agriculture hexi corridor in northwest china one of the largest agricultural production areas in china is a severe water shortage region however most of the farmlands in this region were irrigated with water pumped from the groundwater or diverted from the rivers resulting in a decline of water level and rivers drying up kang et al 2017 in recent years large areas of wine grape were planted in this area 20533ha in 2015 accounting for 11 8 of the total in china the data was from the annual report of the development situation of the wine industry in the world and china and gansu province http www gsjye com show asp id 2864 while most of them were furrow irrigated with low water use efficiency wue zhang et al 2011 different from dense planting crops the vineyards have wide row spacing and soil makes up the largest proportion of the surface area thus soil evaporation e can be a substantial source of total evapotranspiration et kool et al 2014a compared with drip irrigated vineyards where water is used more efficiently with e et ranging from 0 09 to 0 31 fandiño et al 2012 ferreira et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 poblete echeverría et al 2012 cancela et al 2015 kool et al 2016 williams and fidelibus 2016 larger amounts of water are evaporated from soil when furrow irrigation is applied with e et about 0 48 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 thus there is a need for in depth research about et partitioning into soil evaporation and transpiration components for making reasonable irrigation strategies and improve wue for furrow irrigated vineyards different functions within agriculture system and distinct contributions to crop production of e and plant transpiration t require separate study of individual components of farmland water loss t is associated with plant productivity while e does not directly contribute to plant production agam et al 2012 kool et al 2014a many studies about et partitioning in vineyard have been conducted including direct measurements of et components using several instruments such as combining sap flow sensors sp and microlysimeters mly with the bowen ratio energy balance breb technique yunusa et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 combining sp and or mly with the eddy covariance system poblete echeverría et al 2012 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 and using the weighing lysimeter covered with a waterproof canvas to eliminate soil evaporation montoro et al 2016 and also indirect methods using models such as the dual crop coefficients approach fandiño et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 the shuttleworth wallace model zhang et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 and the below canopy energy balance approach kool et al 2016 the processes and controlling factors of water loss from soil surface and canopy are different soil evaporation is a physical process while transpiration is a physiological process both e and t are controlled by atmospheric evaporative demand and t is also highly correlated with vegetation leaf area index lai or canopy cover cc while e is highly correlated with surface soil water content swc mitchell et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 raz yaseef et al 2012 jiang et al 2016 thus factors affecting t and e both have influences on et partitioning however most previous studies paid more attention to the effects of vegetation on et partitioning mainly by generating regression functions between canopy size lai or cc and t et or e et kang et al 2003 kato et al 2004 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 wang and yamanaka 2014 yan et al 2015 villegas et al 2015 gong et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and it is not clear to what extent that et partitioning is controlled by surface soil water content though swc has a strong control on soil evaporation especially for sparse vegetation thus this study is aimed at establishing a quantitative biophysical robust function between vineyard et partitioning and controls lai and swc to provide a better way to interpret and model the et partitioning in order to implement an effective irrigation strategy grapevine water requirements should be known measuring crop et and relating it to reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 is the customary procedure to determine crop coefficients k c for irrigation management lópez urrea et al 2012 for sparse vegetation k c can be separated into two different components one related to plant transpiration k cb and another that quantifies soil evaporation k e wright 1981 1982 allen et al 1998 the k c value changes during the growing season with plant growth and canopy development with plants age and mature and with soil water content fluctuates allen et al 2007 many studies reported that vineyard k c and k cb are highly correlated with parameters that characterize crop canopy such as leaf area index canopy cover normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the percent of shaded area williams and ayars 2005 lópez urrea et al 2012 er raki et al 2013 hochberg et al 2016 kool et al 2016 montoro et al 2016 williams and fidelibus 2016 while soil evaporation coefficients k e which represent a large proportion of water loss in the vineyard little research has been conducted anderson et al 2017 studied seasonal variations of k e at three irrigated agricultural sites reporting that k e decreased with increasing crop age cover and residue deposition on the ground but made no quantitative assessments kool et al 2016 recently reported seasonal variations of k e in a drip irrigated vineyard and explored the responses of k e to irrigation events quantitative relationships between soil moisture and k e are not yet clear and how is k e affected by canopy development also needs to be considered to explore the biophysical controls on k cb and k e it is necessary to relate them to the canopy parameters and soil moisture conditions the validity of a combination of sap flow sensors and microlysimeters to partition et was evaluated and demonstrated by many studies including vineyards heilman et al 1994 trambouze et al 1998 yunusa et al 2004

seasons based on direct measurements of evapotranspiration and its components by eddy covariance system sap flow sensors and microlysimeters to a quantify vineyard et t and e b explore the seasonal variations of et partitioning e et t et in terms of controlling factors swc and lai and establish a biophysical function between t et and controls and c explore the seasonal dynamics of dual crop coefficients k cb k e and controlling factors the results of present work are expected to provide useful information for optimizing vineyard irrigation schedules and managing grapevine canopy growth reducing water use especially soil evaporation and improving water use efficiency and also providing useful information in developing models for et partitioning 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site measurements of evapotranspiration sap flow and soil evaporation were taken during the growing seasons in 2012 2015 in a flat and uniform merlot vitis vinifera l vineyard with a length of 1650m and a width of 1400m located in northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e 1585m a s l the experimental site is located in a continental temperate zone with a mean annual precipitation of 164 4mm annual temperature of 8 c and annual sunshine duration of over 3000h water is in severe shortage in this region the groundwater table is below 25m and the mean annual pan evaporation is about 2000mm the vineyard soil texture is sandy loam with an average bulk density of 1 47gcm 3 and field capacity of 0 28cm3 cm 3 to a depth of 1 6m the soil properties were determined by digging one trench 1m 1m along one row of the vineyard at 20cm intervals in the vertical direction in the position of ridge and furrow respectively then the soil samples were collected in the cutting ring and the physical properties were analyzed in the lab vineyard row orientation was approximately east west with 2 7m distance between rows the vines were planted 1 0m apart in 1999 and the shoots were maintained on a vertical plane by three iron wires at 0 5 1 0 and 1 5m height respectively supported by a 1 5m high trellis system zhang et al 2011 the vineyard was furrow irrigated with a trapezoid ditch on the north side of each row with depth bottom width and surface width of about 30 90 and 100cm respectively fig 1 a the wetted area by furrow irrigation was about 50 the irrigation quota is about 70mm each time and irrigation dates during the experimental periods were may 4 may 25 june 28 and august 26 in 2012 april 27 may 25 july 1 july 30 august 25 and october 13 in 2013 april 22 may 25 july 2 august 4 august 31 and october 18 in 2014 april 22 may 27 june 27 july 27 august 30 and october 15 in 2015 except for 2012 when the experiment was from late may to early september the experimental periods covered the whole vine growing season from bud break in late april to senescence in middle october from 2013 to 2015 2 2 measurement set up 2 2 1 vineyard evapotranspiration the energy balance of the vineyard including et was measured by an eddy covariance system campbell scientific inc usa located in the northwest of the vineyard and upwind fetch of the prevailing wind direction was 600m li et al 2015 net radiation model nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands was measured at 4 0m height between rows facing the south wind speed ultrasound virtual temperature the densities of atmosphere and water vapor were measured by a csat3 three dimensional sonic anemometer gill instruments uk and an open path h2o co2 analyzer li cor inr usa model li 7500 every 0 1s to obtain latent and sensible heat above the canopy at 4 0m height soil heat flux g was calculated as an average value of two plates model hfp01 hukseflux netherlands placed at 5cm below the soil surface in the ditch and ridge respectively fig 1b all probes were connected with a data logger model cr5000 cambell scientific usa and averages were computed in 30min the procedures for correcting eddy covariance measurements included the planar fit method for coordinate rotation paw et al 2000 finnigan et al 2003 and density correction according to webb et al 1980 directly measured latent and sensible heat fluxes were excluded on rainy days and filled by regression functions with main controlling factors r n lai and swc other gaps due to instrumental problems and power failure were also filled to calculate daily and seasonal energy fluxes the short gaps 2h were filled with linear interpolation and longer data gaps 2h and 24h were filled using the mean diurnal average method falge et al 2001 and gaps exceeding 24h were filled by regression functions with controlling factors finally the percentage of the half hourly data latent and sensible heat fluxes that was gap filled was 6 6 in 2012 2015 2 2 2 plant transpiration and soil evaporation grapevine transpiration was determined using a sap flow system flow32 1k system dynamax houston tx usa eight vines from 2012 to 2014 were selected near the eddy covariance system to measure sap flow while there were only three vines in 2015 because of instrument failure of sap flow sensors and the grapevines selected to install sap flow sensors were different in each year to prevent permanent damage to the vine trunks the types of sap flow sensors were sgb19 and sgb25 grapevine trunk diameters for sap flow measurements ranged in diameter from 1 71 to 3 40cm with an average diameter of 2 50cm since another alternative method was not available to determine vine transpiration simultaneously in this study it was impossible to calibrate the measurements of sap flow system but zhang et al 2011 found that the sum of t measured by sap flow without calibration and e measured by mls was very close to et estimated by the breb method in the same vineyard demonstrating the applicability of sap flow for measuring grape water use in this region and zhao et al 2015 also found that the sum of t measured by sap flow and e measured by mls was very close to hourly and daily et estimated by the ec method in the vineyard also qiu et al 2015 evaluated the good performance of the sap flow sensors by comparing the measured values with the simulated transpiration in a greenhouse hot pepper irrigation may result in flooding and damage the sensors so the sensors were disconnected before irrigation and reinstalled within 2 3days after irrigation zhang et al 2011 the sap flow rate was measured every 60s and recorded as 15 min averages with a cr1000 data logger cambell scientific usa sap flow ld 1 was scaled to tree transpiration mm d 1 using the average ground area of each vine 2 7 1 0m representing the distance of trees between row and within row respectively and the vineyard transpiration was averaged from all the monitored trees heilman et al 1994 daily soil evaporation was measured by 18 micro lysimeters mls made of pvc tubes with 10 cm inside diameter and 20 cm depth from 2013 to 2015 while by 9 mls in 2012 in 2012 three replicates of three mls each was installed at three different positions in the irrigation furrow s bottom and the shaded and non shaded portions of the un wetted furrow fig 1a in 2013 2015 three replicates of six mls each were deployed level with the soil surface along a cross section of the interrow at distances from the row center of 0 05 0 55 1 05 1 55 2 05 2 55m from south to north fig 1a previous studies reported that regular reinstallation of micro lysimeter mly to minimize the difference between soil moisture inside and outside the tubes was needed boast and robertson 1982 thus in present study one replication 6 mlys was reinstalled every 3 5 d from april 30 to july 6 in 2013 and compared with three unchanged replications 18mlys the difference between two methods was smaller e reinstalled 1 02e unchanged 0 11 r 2 0 89 49 observations thus the unchanged micro lysimeters were used zhao et al 2015 finally the daily e was obtained from total nine 2012 and eighteen 2013 2015 mls by weighing them using an electronic scale with a precision of 0 1g at 19 00 local time every day 2 2 3 soil moisture canopy and climate factors volumetric soil water content at a depth of 10cm below the soil surface was continuously monitored from 2013 to 2015 using six soil moisture sensors 5tm soil moisture temperature sensor decagon devices inc usa across the interrow fig 1c then the data were collected every 10min using a data logger em50 decagon devices inc usa and the average swc was calculated from the six sensors leaf area per tree was estimated using a function of the length with total leaf area per shoot of all the shoots on the tree ortega farias et al 2007 we selected 73 shoots samples and measured the total leaf area tla and length of each shoot and then obtained the relationship between tla and length of the sampled shoots then we measured the length of all the shoots on eight sampled trees every 7 15days in each year and then the average leaf area index was calculated details of the calibration of the model and calculation of vineyard lai in our study were interpreted in zhao et al 2015 linear interpolation was applied for the days in between the days of shoot length measurements to obtain a seasonal course of canopy development regular pruning of vine canopy to keep them under control and produce good fruit yields were needed throughout the growing season in present study once canopy pruning occurred the area of pruned leaves was measured and lai after pruning was also measured to capture the sudden decrease of the vineyard leaf area index to determine the extinction coefficient of light attenuation c we measured the diurnal courses every 1h of photosynthetically active radiation par above the canopy and near soil surface across the interrow using sunscan system channel technology group limited uk on several sunny days from late august to early october in 2014 with lai ranged between 1 4 and 2 2m2 m 2 however there was no significantly correlation between daily average c and canopy size c 0 326 0 01 lai n 10 r 2 0 01 p 0 82 thus we adopted the average value of observed c 0 322 for the whole growing seasons all climatic parameters solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed needed to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration et0 by the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and precipitation were measured by a standard automatic weather station hobo onset computer corporation capecod massachusetts usa at a height of 2 0m above the ground over a standard reference surface alfalfa about 3km from the vineyard 2 3 data analysis the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes le h should equal to the vineyard available energy r n g but energy balance closure is seldom achieved with ec system due to systematic underestimation of turbulent fluxes and misses of absorbed energy in the system wilson et al 2002 in the present study energy balance closure was evaluated by linear regression of half hourly turbulent fluxes le h against r n g and the intercept slope and r2 determination coefficient were 24 75wm 2 0 90 and 0 88 respectively the values were within the common results found in previous studies wilson et al 2002 li et al 2005 twine et al 2000 reported that the error of turbulent fluxes was the primary reason for ec underestimation and suggested that adjusting measured turbulent fluxes was necessary using the bowen ratio forced closure brfc method in the same region both ding et al 2010 in a maize field and li et al 2008 in a vineyard demonstrated the necessary of the brfc adjustment thus in this study we forced closure with the brfc approach reported by twine et al 2000 to adjust the original half hourly latent and sensible heat fluxes to calculate the proportion of daily transpiration to vineyard evapotranspiration t et the following strategies were adopted when t was directly measured by sap flow sensors t et were used and et was obtained from the eddy covariance system after the brfc adjustment when t was not directly measured while e was directly measured by microlysimerers et e et were used while when both directly measured e and t were not available t et was unavailable the daily soil evaporation coefficient k e and basal crop coefficient k cb was calculated as the ratio of directly measured daily soil evaporation and transpiration to daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 allen et al 1998 the measurement periods of the vineyard et e and t obtained directly by eddy covariance system microlysimeters and sap flow sensors in 2012 2015 were presented in fig 2 respectively previous studies reported that soil evaporation e was mainly controlled by the surface soil water content swc and net radiation r n mitchell et al 2009 raz yaseef et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 raz yaseef et al 2012 kool et al 2014b jiang et al 2016 kool et al 2016 thus in this study the gaps of missing daily e without direct microlysimeters measurements were filled by multiple regression between daily directly measured e and r n swc in 2013 2015 table 1 similar functions of gap filling soil evaporation based on swc and radiation fluxes were also reported and demonstrated by raz yaseef et al 2010 in a semi arid pine forest then the gaps of missing daily t without sap flow measurements were filled by the difference between daily e and et t et e to estimate the seasonal total grapevine transpiration note that the interpolated e and t values were only used in calculating seasonal total soil evaporation and transpiration while not used in analyzing relationships between daily e or t et against controlling factors 2 4 theoretical approach to explore the biophysical relationships between et partitioning and relevant controlling factors the commonly used dual crop coefficients method dual k c proposed by fao 56 was adopted in the present study allen et al 1998 in the dual k c method soil evaporation and plant transpiration were calculated as follows allen et al 1998 1 e k e e t 0 2 t k s k c b e t 0 3 e t k e k s k c b e t 0 where k cb k e and k s are basal crop coefficient soil evaporation and water stress coefficients respectively and et 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mmd 1 based on eqs 1 and 2 the proportion of transpiration to evapotranspiration can be calculated as follows 4 t e t k s k c b k e k s k c b the root zone 40 140cm depth in the furrow where more than 84 of the grape roots propagated soil moisture swc and θ t the water content threshold below that the root zone depletion exceeds p taw and the water stress exits and the water stress coefficient k s were presented in fig 3 and p is the average fraction of total available soil water taw that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress reduction in et occurs 0 1 and is set to be 0 45 in present study based on fao 56 allen et al 1998 as shown in fig 3 water stress existed in late july and late august before the following irrigation when both canopy lai and evaporative demand et 0 were at high levels fig 4 thus we focused the analysis on days without water deficit k s 1 to calibrate and validate the proposed model in present study and eq 4 can be simplified as follows 5 t e t k c b k e k c b based on eq 97 in fao 56 allen et al 1998 k cb can be expressed as 6 k c b k c min k c b f u l l k c min 1 exp c l a i where k cmin is the minimum k c for bare soil k cb full is the estimated basal k cb during the mid season at peak plant size or height for vegetation having full ground cover or lai 3 c is the extinction coefficient of light attenuation 0 322 in this study based on direct ec measurements in early april 2015 when the vine canopy was not existent lai 0 k cmin was observed to be 0 004 in the present study thus we assumed that k cmin 0 and eq 6 can be simplified as 7 k c b k c b f u l l 1 exp c l a i based on eq 71 74 in fao 56 allen et al 1998 k e can be expressed as 8 k e k r k c max k c b f e w k c max where k cmax is the maximum value of k c following rain or irrigation f ew is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed 1 0 and wetted 1 0 for rainfall and 0 5 for irrigation k r is the dimensionless evaporation reduction coefficient dependent on the cumulative depth of water depleted evaporated from the topsoil which is expressed as follows based on eq 73 74 in allen et al 1998 9 k r t e w d e t e w r e w 1000 s w c 0 5 θ w p z e t e w r e w where tew is total evaporable water mm which is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the soil when the topsoil has been initially completely wetted eq 73 in allen et al 1998 d e is the cumulative depth of evaporation depletion from the soil surface layer mm rew is the readily evaporable water which is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the topsoil layer without restriction during stage 1 4 8mm for loamy sand soil table 19 in allen et al 1998 swc is the actual surface volumetric soil water content and θ wp is the surface soil water content at wilting point 0 10m3 m 3 in this study z e is the depth of the surface soil layer that is subject to drying by way of evaporation 0 10 0 15m eq 73 in allen et al 1998 in eq 8 k r k cmax k cb was less than f ew k cmax in most cases in present work data not shown thus k e can be simplified and calculated from eq 8 and 9 as follows 10 k e k c max k c b 1000 z e t e w r e w s w c 0 5 θ w p thus the daily proportion of plant transpiration to evapotranspiration t et can be calculated from eqs 5 7 and 10 as follows 11 t e t 1 exp c l a i exp c

content swc we changed the form of eq 11 as follows 12 t e t 1 exp c l a i exp c l a i m n s w c 0 5 θ w p 1 exp c l a i where c was directly measured 0 322 θ wp was 0 10m3 m 3 m and n were constant representing k c max k c b f u l l 1 and 1000 z e t e w r e w respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal variations in vineyard et and its components the seasonal variations of daily vineyard evapotranspiration et and plant transpiration t measured by eddy covariance system and sap flow sensors from 2012 to 2015 were shown in fig 4 and the daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 and water inputs irrigation and precipitation were also displayed et 0 was relatively stable in april 4 17 0 37mmd 1 may 4 22 0 20mmd 1 june 4 10 47mmd 1 and july 3 94 0 51mmd 1 then decreased from 3 50 0 23mmd 1 in august to 2 55 0 23mmd 1 in september and to 1 82 0 22mmd 1 in october fig 4 the seasonal variations of et 0 indicated that the atmosphere evaporative demand maintained at a higher level in first half seasons and then decreased in the second half seasons for the whole growing seasons average vineyard et increased from 1 61 0 34mmd 1 in april to 3 08 0 66mmd 1 in july and decreased to 0 80 0 28mmd 1 in october it displayed a pattern similar to canopy growth and was also affected by water input events and increases of et were observed after irrigation or rain fig 4 the seasonal average of et was 2 09mmd 1 2 10mmd 1 2 21mmd 1 and 2 15mmd 1 in 2012 2015 respectively zhang et al 2007 reported daily et ranging from 0 1 to 4 3mmd 1 in a nearby furrow irrigated vineyard and also observed that et increased in response to rainfall or irrigation events in a drip irrigated vineyard in israel maximum et was around 3 5mmd 1 occurring either on the day of or on the day following irrigation when the canopy was fully developed kool et al 2016 similar results were also reported by poblete echeverría et al 2012 who observed peak daily et of 3 5 4 0mmd 1 in a drip irrigated vineyard in chile however williams and fidelibus 2016 reported a maximum etof 9mmd 1 and netzer et al 2009 also reported a maximum et ranged from 7 26 to 8 59mmd 1 in drip irrigated vineyards and the larger et in their studies resulted from the bigger canopy size than our study seasonal patterns of vine transpiration t resembled those of canopy development fig 4 average t increased from 0 52 0 17mmd 1 in may to 1 51 0 31mmd 1 in july and decreased to 0 37 0 35mmd 1 in october because of leaf senescence in october of 2014 and 2015 sudden decreases in t were observed due to a heavy frost in each year causing most of the leaves to die fig 4c d the seasonal average of t was between 0 98 1 00mmd 1 in 2013 2015 and 1 38mmd 1 in 2012 similar results were reported by zhang et al 2011 that seasonal vine t was dynamic from 0 13 to 2 69mmd 1 with an average of 1 25mmd 1 zhang et al 2010 also observed a seasonal average t of 1 2 1 4mmd 1 in a furrow irrigated vineyard however ferreira et al 2012 reported grapevine transpiration exceeding 4 0mmd 1 using sap flow techniques and the canopy seasonal average lai of 1 96 2 39m2 m 2 was bigger than our study seasonal average lai about 1 4m2 m 2 higher values were also reported by poblete echeverría et al 2012 with transpiration ranging from 0 8 to 3 2mmd 1 and averaged at 1 8mmd 1 dynamics of soil evaporation e indicated high fluxes during the wetting periods after irrigation or rain a maximum of 4 9mmd 1 and lower fluxes about 0 1 0 5mmd 1 during the drying periods while they didn t display seasonal variation correlated with canopy development fig 5 soil evaporation correlated well with soil water content at 10cm depth swc while relatively low values of e were observed in october 2014 under wet conditions due to the lower solar radiation fig 5c the seasonal average soil evaporation in 2013 2015 was 0 95mmd 1 1 28mmd 1 and 1 05mmd 1 respectively similar results were also reported by raz yaseef et al 2012 in a forest that seasonal dynamics of soil evaporation were highly correlated with soil water content at 5cm depth ding et al 2013 reported higher soil evaporation after irrigation and rainfall events in early growing seasons of maize field when the canopy was small kool et al 2016 reported that e remained relatively stable throughout the whole season in a drip irrigated vineyard but e was also affected by wetting events with e of 0 35 0 06mmd 1 on days with irrigation 0 19 0 05mmd 1 on the day after and 0 10 0 04mmd 1 on following days higher values of e in present study may be due to the higher wetting fraction of soil surface under furrow irrigation about 50 the wetted soil surface on the north half of the irrigated furrow was also exposed to the sunlight directly during the majority of the growing seasons under sparse canopies fig 1 and williams and fidelibus 2016 reported lower soil evaporation rates in a vineyard which was due to the wetted soil surface being covered by the canopy for the majority of the growing season thus e was mainly controlled by the atmospheric demand and soil surface moisture while not sensitive to the variation in canopy growth in present work which was similar to the results reported by flumignan et al 2011 for coffee trees the relationship between daily e and swc was shown in fig 6 and the effects of radiation on soil evaporation were also displayed indicating that e was simultaneously affected by the available energy and soil moisture table 1 similar exponential functions between e and swc were also reported by zhang et al 2011 in a vineyard jiang et al 2016 in a maize field and mitchell et al 2009 in semi arid eucalypt woodlands in the present study both vineyard et and component t and e were directly measured by eddy covariance sap flow sensors and microlysimeters respectively thus a comparison between daily et and the sum of t and e was evaluated and shown in fig 7 results indicated that the combination of sap flow and microlysimeters can provide reasonable measurements of total et and its components in the vineyard the reliability was evaluated by linear regression of daily e t against et the slope intercept and r 2 were 0 93 0 08mmd 1 and 0 77 and the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were 0 60mmd 1 and 0 44mmd 1 respectively fig 7 3 2 evapotranspiration partitioning based on the directly measured daily vineyard et and its components seasonal dynamics and biophysical controls of et partitioning were analyzed partitioning of daily et showed that e was the dominant component of vineyard et in early season and displayed a roughly seasonal decline trend with canopy developing fig 8 however in 2015 the rain was more equally distributed especially in the first half of the season from 20 may to 22 july which resulted in a relative higher soil moisture content and e et thus no obvious correlation between e et and canopy development was observed in the first half of the season in 2015 and before 20 may in 2015 relative lower e et values compared with 2013 and 2014 were observed though the canopy was very small which could be caused by the discrepancy of the eddy covariance and microlysimeters thus the data of t et before 20 may in 2015 were excluded in the calibration and validation of the parameters in the proposed model eq 12 in october 2014 and 2015 e took a high proportion of et about 90 due to a heavy frost that happened in both years resulting in a sharp decrease of plant transpiration figs 8c d and 4c d what is more remarkable is that daily et partitioning e et t et was closely correlated with soil surface water content swc e et increased after wetting events irrigation and rain and then gradually declined with drying of the soil even in middle season when the canopy was fully developed e et can exceed 80 under wet conditions fig 8c d while under dry conditions in middle season e et was low less than 20 or even 10 fig 8b c similar results were also reported by jara et al 1998 that the highest values of e et in a maize field were obtained at the beginning of the season after irrigation kool et al 2016 reported in a drip irrigated vineyard that e was a relatively large fraction of et and e et was variable and sensitive to wetting events in the early season while after a few weeks t dominated et comprising 90 of et and e et was quite stable and less sensitive to wetting events when the canopy was fully developed the higher proportion of soil evaporation in the present study is attributed to the large wetting fraction of soil surface under furrow irrigation and abundantly available energy for e because of the sparse vine canopy fig 1 to interpret the main factors affecting et partitioning the commonly used method is to use simple regression functions between related variables against measured e et or t et table 2 most of the previous studies focused on the effects of the canopy on et partitioning and lacked biophysical meanings and didn t consider the effects of swc however for sparse vegetation in this study e took a large proportion of et and was strongly affected by swc thus it was necessary to consider the effects of swc on et partitioning table 2 in the present study a more biophysically robust model between t et and biophysical factors lai swc derived from the dual crop coefficient method were used to interpret how vineyard et partitioning was regulated across the whole growing seasons according to eq 12 the relationships between vineyard daily t et and lai and swc fitted to the directly observed data in 2013 2015 were obtained in fig 9 the original value of parameters m and n obtained from k c max k c b f u l l 1 and 1000 z e t e w r e w was 0 304 0 680 and 5 172 respectively since m was variable in different years we set n to be constant 5 172 and only m needed to be fitted then the fitted parameter m was 0 522 0 495 and 0 491 in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively and it was within the range of the original values 0 304 0 680 table 3 then we used the parameters obtained in 2013 in eq 12 to simulate the daily t et in 2014 and 2015 then compared with the directly measured values to validate the proposed model fig 10 results indicated that large discrepancies existed between the observed and estimated t et in 2014 while in 2015 the differences were small the performance of the proposed model in present study was not very high with a r 2 of 0 46 however if we use the simple regression between t et and lai and between t et and swc the corresponding coefficient of determination r 2 was 0 17 and 0 19 respectively data not shown and previous studies estimating t et or e et based on the influencing factors also reported relative lower accuracy e g a r 2 of 0 43 by wang et al 2014 and poor performance by zhang et al 2013 the relative lower accuracy of the proposed model in present study could be caused by 1 though a more biophysically robust model was used and both canopy and soil moisture were considered other influencing factors such as the growing stages reported by wang et al 2014 relating to the physiological characteristics were ignored 2 some assumptions were made in present study to simplify the model such as expressing k cb as a function of lai and k cmin was zero eq 6 and 7 and k r k cmax k cb was less than f ew k cmax in eq 8 data not shown 3 the reliability of the dual crop coefficients method in partitioning et in vineyard was reported by previous studies poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 zhao et al 2015 however an underestimation of e and overestimation of t or vice versa could enlarge the deviation of estimated t et from the observed values though the estimated e or t did not differ much from the observed values zhao et al 2015 4 the directly measured e and t were not absolute precise though e t was close to et fig 7 which could also induce errors of the parameters in the model compared with previously reported relationships between et partitioning and lai the biophysically robust model obtained in the present study considered the effects of surface soil moisture on et partitioning under wet conditions when soil evaporation was high t et was relatively low even when the canopy was fully developed fig 9 and for a given lai t et decreased with increasing swc because of the increasing of soil evaporation previous studies have demonstrated the importance of lai in regulating et partitioning and the effects of swc on soil evaporation thus using the observed input parameters lai swc to estimate vineyard t et by the proposed model in this study can provide useful information about the interaction effects of lai and swc on et partitioning different surface soil water regimes swc 0 08 0 10 0 14 and 0 20cm3 cm 3 were selected to calculate the variability of t et under different lai fig 11 under the same swc t et increased with lai which was similar to previous studies kato et al 2004 wang et al 2014 gong et al 2017 for a given swc the t et increased significantly with increasing lai when lai was small i e soil surface was not fully covered by the canopy especially under dry conditions then gradually became stable when canopy reaching maximum fig 11b as shown in fig 11a the directly observed t et displayed a close relationship with canopy development when lai 1 6m2 m 2 however when the canopy was fully developed lai 1 6m2 m 2 the observed t et showed a decrease trend because the soil evaporation was high caused by high swc fig 11a note that the parameters m n obtained in the present study with lai 2 5 m2 m 2 may produce errors when employing eq 12 to estimate t et under high lai conditions lai 2 5m2 m 2 but the type of the function in eq 11 was universal across different ecosystems after the gap filling of missing soil evaporation and transpiration without directly measurements the cumulative etand its components were shown in fig 12 seasonal total et from bud break until harvest late april to middle october was 399mm 398mm and 392mm where e was 185mm 245mm and 224mm t was 173mm 167mm and 158mm and e t was 358mm 412mm and 382mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 12 noted that in 2013 the measurements of e and t ended up earlier than et and the total etobtained from eddy covariance was 389mm during the measurement periods of e and t fig 12a the seasonal soil evaporation fraction e e t was higher in 2014 59 5 and 2015 58 6 with a seasonal average swc of 0 134cm3 cm 3 and 0 135cm3 cm 3 respectively while in 2013 the seasonal e e t was 51 7 with an average swc of 0 126cm3 cm 3 indicating that surface soil moisture may have influences on the annual vineyard et partitioning kool et al 2016 reported seasonal cumulative et in a drip irrigated vineyard of 261mm where e 24mm was 9 of et and t 237mm accounted for 91 of poblete echeverría et al 2012 also observed average t et about 72 in a drip irrigated merlot vineyard also in a drip irrigated vineyard lópez urrea et al 2012 reported seasonal total soil evaporation of 114mm 71mm and 98mm and vine transpiration of 426mm 290mm and 416mm in 2007 2009 respectively with a seasonal t et of 79 80 and 81 respectively compared with drip irrigation a larger proportion of water was evaporated from soil surface under furrow irrigation in the vineyard indicating that the irrigation water could be used more efficiently in the future if the drip irrigation method were adopted 3 3 dual crop coefficients the seasonal dynamic of soil evaporation coefficients k e and basal crop coefficients k cb in 2012 2015 was shown in figs 13 and 14 k e e et 0 and k cb t et 0 were calculated from the directly measurements by sap flow and microlysimeters to investigate the effects of wetting events irrigation and rain and swc on k e the datasets were classified into several sub datasets based on the swc values development of daily k e was mainly influenced by wetting events after irrigation and rainfall k e suddenly increased to a high level even exceeding 1 0 and then gradually declined as soil became dry fig 13 under dry conditions k e was relatively stable and less than 0 2 note that the maximum k e was observed after rainfall not after irrigation due to the wetting fraction of soil surface after irrigation was 50 but nearly 100 after precipitation the seasonal trend of k e was not related to canopy development due to the canopy was small and has low effects on soil surface available energy k cb displayed a seasonal trend with canopy development the average k cb was 0 12 0 03 0 31 0 05 0 40 0 10 0 42 0 08 0 31 0 03 and 0 18 0 10 from may to october respectively fig 14 in october of 2014 and 2015 a sudden decrease of k cb was observed due to a heavy frost causing most of the leaves to die and a sudden decrease in transpiration see fig 4c d compared with previous studies in the vineyard the k e observed in present work was much higher while k cb was similar to other studies in a drip irrigated vineyard lópez urrea et al 2012 reported k e about 0 08 0 16 0 07 0 19 and 0 05 k cb about 0 18 0 22 0 33 0 46 and 0 46 0 69 in early middle and late seasons respectively and the maximum daily k e was less than 0 3 also in a drip irrigated vineyard kool et al 2016 reported that k e were highest on 0days after irrigation dai 0 averaging about 0 05 and reducing to 0 03 and 0 01 on dai 1 and dai 1 respectively and k e appeared to remain constant and was less than 0 06 throughout the whole growing season and the peak values of k cb around 0 4 0 5 were observed in middle season while williams and fidelibus 2016 reported a maximum k cb of 1 2 and a seasonal average k cb of 0 93 during the vine growing seasons with a bigger canopy than our study and cancela et al 2015 in a vineyard reported that k e was very close to k c because of the high number of rainfall events and the daily k e ranged between 0 and 0 9 which was similar to our study also in a drip irrigated vineyard montoro et al 2016 reported higher values of k cb 0 20 1 0 and lower k e less than 0 25 than our study similar results of vineyard k cb were also reported by fandiño et al 2012 between 0 07 and 0 57 and by poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 between 0 20 and 0 55 overall higher k e values in our study under furrow irrigation indicated that large fractions of irrigated water were evaporated from surface soil compared with drip irrigation based on eq 7 the relationship between daily k cb and lai was obtained in 2012 2015 similar results in the vineyard were also reported by previous studies ferreira et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 montoro et al 2016 fig 15 a k e was strongly controlled by surface soil moisture and a linear relationship was observed between k e and swc in our study which has not been reported by previous studies fig 15b 4 conclusions based on the directly measured vineyard et and its components dynamics and controlling factors of et partitioning and dual crop coefficients were studied main findings are outlined as follows 1 seasonal total et from bud break until harvest was 399 398 and 392mm where e was 185 245 and 224mm t was 173 167 and 158mm and e t was 358 412 and mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively seasonal average e represented about 52 59 of e tand t about 41 48 of e t 2 seasonal et partitioning was controlled by surface soil water content swc and leaf area index lai and annual et partitioning was related to swc 3 a biophysically robust model based on the dual crop coefficients method which can describe the effects of lai and swc on et partitioning was proposed in the present study and explained 46 of the vineyard et partitioning 4 soil evaporation coefficients were strongly affected by wetting events irrigation and rain and closely correlated to swc and basal crop coefficients were mainly correlated with canopy development acknowledgements the research was financially supported by the national

11581,irrigation exhibits large variation across producer fields even within same region and year a knowledge gap exists relative to factors that explain this variation in part due to lack of availability of high quality irrigation data from multiple field years this study assessed sources of variation in irrigation using a large database collected during 9 years 2005 2013 from ca 1400 maize and soybean producer fields in nebraska central usa total of 12 750 field year observations the study area is representative of ca 4 5 million ha of irrigated land sown with maize and soybean influence of biophysical weather soil and crop type and behavioral producer skills risk aversion factors on irrigation was investigated field irrigation distributions showed a substantial number of fields received irrigation amounts that were well above average irrigation for same region year variation in irrigation across fields within the same region was as large as year to year variation seasonal water deficit defined as total reference evapotranspiration minus precipitation soil available water holding capacity and crop type explained about half of observed variation in field irrigation indicating that producers adjusted irrigation depending upon site year variation in these parameters however half of the variation in irrigation remained unexplained indicating that producer behavior and skills play also an important role there was evidence of a neighbor effect as fields that received large irrigation were surrounded by other fields with similarly large irrigation likewise fields with above or below average irrigation in one year remained consistently above and below regional average irrigation respectively in other years despite similarity in weather and soil among fields these findings indicate that irrigation decisions are influenced by both biophysical and behavioral factors making predictions of field and regional irrigation extremely difficult this study highlights the value of collecting on farm irrigation data to understand producer decision making and find opportunities to improve current water management in irrigated crop

schultz et al 2005 molden 2007 irrigation increases and stabilizes crop yields in areas where precipitation is not sufficient to satisfy crop water requirements grassini et al 2014a however there is

regression analysis was used to assess variation in irrigation in relation to specific variables such as seasonal wd and awhc 2 3 influence of producer behavior on irrigation amounts influence of

effect irrigation data from sc fields were found to be lognormally distributed and were subsequently logarithmically transformed to obtain z score values a z score was calculated for each field by subtracting mean irrigation from field irrigation and dividing by standard deviation for each field the z score was calculated for all surrounding fields at increasing distance in 1 6km increments after the z score and standard deviation of the z score were determined fields were grouped by their local z score the mean and standard deviations for each group were then back calculated to obtain average values this calculation was performed separately for each year and then averaged across all years included in the study period persistence in irrigation decisions across years was investigated following farmaha et al 2016 because we were interested in analyzing persistence in relation with producer behavior and not with soil type or irrigation system type the analysis was constrained to the center pivot irrigated fields in sc because soil properties were nearly identical among all fields two years 2010 and 2012 were chosen in the present study as ranking years to analyze persistence in irrigation amount across all other years during the study period these two years represent extreme weather conditions with 2010 and 2012 having above and below average seasonal precipitation 415 and 105mm respectively for both 2010 and 2012 fields located in the top and bottom quartiles of the field irrigation distribution were selected resulting in four categories 2010 high irrigation 2012 high irrigation 2010 low irrigation and 2012 low irrigation relative irrigation ri was calculated as follows 1 ri ij iij ij ij where iij was average irrigation for field category i in year j and ij was average regional irrigation in year j this resulted in ri values for each year a ri value of zero indicated that average irrigation for a given category was equal to regional average irrigation in that year in contrast a ri value of 0 5 meant that average irrigation in that field category was 50 higher than the regional average irrigation for that same year ri values consistently above or below zero in non ranking year indicated persistent behavior meaning that producers applying above or below average irrigation in one year will tend to do the same in the rest of the years in contrast if ri approaches zero in most non ranking years it indicated that most producers erratically modify their irrigation decisions year after year following farmaha et al 2016 persistence was calculated as the ratio between average ri for category i i e high or low irrigation across non ranking years and ri calculated for ranking year k i e 2010 or 2012 a high persistence value would imply that irrigation in ranking and non ranking years consistently deviated from the regional average irrigation across all years and not just in the year in which fields were ranked 3 results 3 1 explanatory factors driving year to year and field to field variation in irrigation average 2005 2013 seasonal precipitation and eto were remarkably similar between the two regions table 1 however regions varied markedly relative to soil type with soils in nc fields having nearly half available water holding capacity awhc relative to sc fields coefficient of variation cv for awhc indicate that soils were remarkably similar across sc fields while soil were more heterogeneous across nc fields intermediate twi values and their relatively small field to field variation indicate that a large fraction of fields in both regions were located in flat terrain as expected for center pivot irrigated fields visual inspection of producer field irrigation distributions indicated large variation in irrigation across regions year crops and fields fig 2 field to field variation in irrigation within the same crop region year was very large as indicated by cv values ranging from 18 to 58 across crop region years cases field to field variation in irrigation was as large as if not larger year to year variation cv range 17 37 the majority 70 of crop region year field irrigation distributions deviated from a normal distribution d agostino pearson test p 0 01 and most of them were positively skewed fig 2 in other words the shape of the irrigation distributions showed a substantial number of fields receiving irrigation amounts that were well above average irrigation for the same region year availability of irrigation data for a wide range of weather soil and management conditions presented a unique opportunity to investigate sources of variation in irrigation analysis of variance indicated that weather soil and crop type explained an important portion of the observed variation in irrigation across field years table 2 wd alone explained only 18 of observed variation column a in table 2 addition of crop type soil parameters and their interactions with wd substantially increased model explanatory power columns b and c in table 2 still nearly than half 46 of field to field variation in irrigation remained unexplained by the parameters accounted for in this analysis table 2 variation in regional average irrigation across years was explained by magnitude of seasonal wd for both crops p 0 01 r2 0 68 fig 3 as expected irrigation amounts were lower than seasonal wd because i actual crop et is significantly lower than et0 before canopy closure and during the late reproductive stages allen et al 1998 and ii available soil water content at sowing which is typically near field capacity in nebraska also contributes to satisfy crop water requirements fig 3 indeed total water supply from sowing to physiological maturity including stored soil water at sowing plus in season rainfall and irrigation exceeded wd in most irrigated fields data not shown on average maize received 15 and 5 higher irrigation than soybean in sc and nc fields respectively p 0 01 fig 3 this difference reflected differences in irrigation requirements and management between the two crops torrion et al 2014 sharma et al 2015 average irrigation in nc fields was consistently higher than in sc fields across the entire range of wd with an average difference of ca 150mm between the two regions fig 3 difference in average irrigation was attributable to the remarkable difference in average awhc between the two regions 104 versus 199mm and not due to weather as indicated by similarity in seasonal precipitation and eto table 1 our analysis revealed that irrigation decisions were also influenced by more complex interactions between wd and crop type and awch table 2 column d for example the 150 mm difference in irrigation between nc and sc fields was disproportionally larger than the difference in awhc 95mm fig 3 we speculate that the inequality 1 6mm irrigation increase per mm decrease in awhc can be explained by i producers applying higher seasonal irrigation in nc fields to compensate for lower irrigation efficiency i e how much of the applied irrigation water is captured by crops in fields with low awhc ii greater risk aversion attitude in producers irrigating coarse textured soils or iii a combination of these two factors 3 2 is field to field variation in irrigation consistent across years with contrasting weather an important question that arose was whether field to field variation in producer irrigation was similar across years or instead it changed from year to year due to variation in weather our analysis indicated that field to field irrigation variation expressed as cv diminished with increasing magnitude of the seasonal water deficit fig 4 in other words field to field variation in irrigation was largest in the 2010 wet year relative to the 2012 drought year average cvs 46 versus 25 this finding suggests that irrigation requirements in a drought year are so high that it becomes less likely for a producer to apply irrigation in excess of crop water requirements because of system capacity constraints making differences in producer risk behavior less relevant in contrast in a wet year satisfying irrigation water requirements requires fewer irrigation events and smaller amounts and differences among producers relative to irrigation scheduling skills and risk aversion become more evident field to field variation was consistently higher in sc fields relative to nc fields across the entire range of seasonal water deficit average cvs of 40 and 25 respectively fig 4 this finding was consistent with our previous hypothesis since for the same level of water deficit irrigation water requirement is higher in nc fields due to lower awhc relative to sc fields 3 3 producer behavior in relation with irrigation water use iterative analysis of irrigation variation with distance from a given field revealed that clustering of irrigation existed within sc fields fig 5 in other words irrigation decisions made in an individual field also impacted irrigation decision in adjacent fields as distance increased from a field with high irrigation 651 800mm irrigation remained higher than average with this trend persisting until a distance of about 4km i e 5 center pivot irrigated fields in every direction representing an area equivalent of ca 25 fields while it is possible that clustering occurred due to management of several fields by a single producer this is unlikely since on average producers in nebraska owned 5 irrigated fields similarly fields with low irrigation 35 124mm were related to lower than average irrigation in surrounding fields but only to a distance of about 2km away convergence of lines to regional mean irrigation between 250 and 300mm indicated disappearance of neighbor effect with distance from a given field fig 5 interestingly fields with high irrigation affected surrounding fields at a greater distance than low irrigation fields suggesting that producers applying large irrigation amounts may influence the decisions of neighboring producers to a greater extent relative to the influence of producers applying comparatively smaller amounts over neighboring producers fields in the sc region with above high irrigation category and below average low irrigation category irrigation in ranking years were also the same fields exhibiting respective larger and smaller irrigation amounts in the rest of the years fig 6 high degree of persistence in irrigation decisions across years became clear as average irrigation calculated for each field category did not approach the y 0 line in any of the years interestingly fields with above and below average irrigation in 2010 had irrigation closer to the regional average in non ranking years persistence of ca 40 for both high and low irrigation field categories compared to the fields selected in 2012 ranking year persistence of 73 and 80 for high and low irrigation field categories respectively 4 discussion our study analyzed variation in producer irrigation across different years crops and soil types using actual irrigation data collected from hundreds of producer fields the interactive influence of multiple factors including weather crop type soil properties and producer behavior in relation to irrigation water use highlights how difficult it is to predict field and regional irrigation based on a few biophysical factors our findings are consistent with lorite et al 2004 who concluded that use of average irrigation values does not capture the variability in water use among farmers or the variation in irrigation strategies among different crops and soil types for example our study showed that even at a regional level average irrigation can vary as much as 200mm for the same level of seasonal water deficit due to differences in soil type we argue here that given the difficulties to predict irrigation accurately from secondary variables there is an urgent need to increase availability of high quality producer field irrigation data without accurate irrigation data future research focusing on the food water nexus will continue to rely on coarse fragmented irrigation data which will in turn diminish our capacity to inform decision making and prioritize research and investment in irrigated agriculture and water resources weather crop type and soil properties influenced producer field irrigation however these factors only accounted for 53 of observed field to field variation in producer irrigation while part of the unexplained variation might be attributable to factors that were not account for in our analysis due to lack of data e g tillage method producer behavior associated with irrigation management appeared to be an important source of variation consistently with this hypothesis we found that i irrigation amounts were higher in the region with sandy soils even after accounting for differences in awhc between regions ii field to field variation increased with decreasing magnitude of seasonal water deficit i e greater field to field variation in wet years iii there was a significant neighbor effect and iv presence of producers that persistently apply greater or lower irrigation relative to the mean average irrigation across fields with almost identical weather and soil type we also found a high degree of persistence in irrigation amounts over time indicating that the factor s explaining larger irrigation amounts in a group of fields is related with a factor that is persistent over time in contrast to factors that may influence irrigation decisions in a given year but not in others the implication is that there is a substantial opportunity for improving irrigation water use i e grain produced per unit of irrigation if these factors are identified allowing research and extension efforts to focus on correcting these management practices in a cost effective way and properly informing policy and incentives the degree of field to field variation for irrigation reported here is higher than the reported variation for other agricultural inputs such as nitrogen n fertilizer cv 17 grassini et al 2011 we speculate that since most of the n fertilizer is applied in a single dose in the fall or around sowing producers have limited ability to adjust n input relative to year specific conditions hence the amount of n fertilizer to be applied depends on producer yield goal which is generally estimated based on average yield during previous years and exhibits relatively small year to year and field to field variation in irrigated maize systems grassini et al 2011 2014a 2014b in contrast producers have more flexibility in relation to irrigation scheduling and ultimately producers decisions on irrigation timing and amount will depend on their understanding of irrigation requirements in a given year as determined by in season weather soil and crop type and their perception of risk the real time nature of irrigation management exposes to a larger degree the differences in skills and risk aversion attitudes among producers which ultimately results in a high degree of variation in irrigation amounts across fields even for those with almost identical weather and soil examination of field irrigation distributions indicated that there is an important portion of producers ca 10 20 that applied very large irrigation amounts in relation to the rest of producers within the same region year this observation has implications relative to the extension model to be used to improve management of water resources for crop production at district watershed and state levels in this case should extension education prioritize resources to reduce irrigation inputs in the whole population or instead focus on those producers within the upper tail of the field irrigation distribution on the one hand focusing on fields with highest irrigation offers greater potential payoff in terms of irrigation water savings especially if the cause for irrigation surplus can be identified and solved on the other hand these fields might be managed by producers with very high risk aversion attitude who may be less receptive to follow flexible irrigation decisions based for example on crop developmental stages or soil water content thresholds we believe that on farm data as presented in this study complemented with data relative to the factors that drive producer irrigation decisions and determine irrigation water requirements can help answer these kinds of questions as well as prioritize research and extension activities and inform policy and incentive programs similarly access to thousands of irrigation records provides with a unique opportunity to benchmark irrigation management in individual fields indeed we are developing an online database platform to allow producers to compare their field irrigation amounts against the irrigation reported for other fields located within the same climate soil spatial domain such a platform will help producers diagnose current irrigation management and evaluate options to reduce irrigation amount without sacrificing crop yield acknowledgements funding and support for this project comes from the

11581,irrigation exhibits large variation across producer fields even within same region and year a knowledge gap exists relative to factors that explain this variation in part due to lack of availability of high quality irrigation data from multiple field years this study assessed sources of variation in irrigation using a large database collected during 9 years 2005 2013 from ca 1400 maize and soybean producer fields in nebraska central usa total of 12 750 field year observations the study area is representative of ca 4 5 million ha of irrigated land sown with maize and soybean influence of biophysical weather soil and crop type and behavioral producer skills risk aversion factors on irrigation was investigated field irrigation distributions showed a substantial number of fields received irrigation amounts that were well above average irrigation for same region year variation in irrigation across fields within the same region was as large as year to year variation seasonal water deficit defined as total reference evapotranspiration minus precipitation soil available water holding capacity and crop type explained about half of observed variation in field irrigation indicating that producers adjusted irrigation depending upon site year variation in these parameters however half of the variation in irrigation remained unexplained indicating that producer behavior and skills play also an important role there was evidence of a neighbor effect as fields that received large irrigation were surrounded by other fields with similarly large irrigation likewise fields with above or below average irrigation in one year remained consistently above and below regional average irrigation respectively in other years despite similarity in weather and soil among fields these findings indicate that irrigation decisions are influenced by both biophysical and behavioral factors making predictions of field and regional irrigation extremely

105mm respectively for both 2010 and 2012 fields located in the top and bottom quartiles of the field irrigation distribution were selected resulting in four categories 2010 high irrigation 2012 high irrigation 2010 low irrigation and 2012 low irrigation relative irrigation ri was calculated as follows 1 ri ij iij ij ij where iij was average irrigation for field category i in year j and ij was average regional irrigation in year j this resulted in ri values for each year a ri value of zero indicated that average irrigation for a given category was equal to regional average irrigation in that year in contrast a ri value of 0 5 meant that average irrigation in that field category was 50 higher than the regional average irrigation for that same year ri values consistently above or below zero in non ranking year indicated persistent behavior meaning that producers applying above or below average irrigation in one year will tend to do the same in the rest of the years in contrast if ri approaches zero in most non ranking years it indicated that most producers erratically modify their irrigation decisions year after year following farmaha et al 2016 persistence was calculated as the ratio between average ri for category i i e high or low irrigation across non ranking years and ri calculated for ranking year k i e 2010 or 2012 a high persistence value would imply that irrigation in ranking and non ranking years consistently deviated from the regional average irrigation across all years and not just in the year in which fields were ranked 3 results 3 1 explanatory factors driving year to year and field to field variation in irrigation average 2005 2013 seasonal precipitation and eto were remarkably similar between the two regions table 1 however regions varied markedly relative to soil type with soils in nc fields having nearly half available water holding capacity awhc relative to sc fields coefficient of variation cv for awhc indicate that soils were remarkably similar across sc fields while soil were more heterogeneous across nc fields intermediate twi values and their relatively small field to field variation indicate that a large fraction of fields in both regions were located in flat terrain as expected for center pivot irrigated fields visual inspection of producer field irrigation distributions indicated large variation in irrigation across regions year crops and fields fig 2 field to field variation in irrigation within the same crop region year was very large as indicated by cv values ranging from 18 to 58 across crop region years cases field to field variation in irrigation was as large as if not larger year to year variation cv range 17 37 the majority 70 of crop region year field irrigation distributions deviated from a normal distribution d agostino pearson test p 0 01 and most of them were positively skewed fig 2 in other words the shape of the irrigation distributions showed a substantial number of fields receiving irrigation amounts that were well above average irrigation for the same region year availability of irrigation data for a wide range of weather soil and management conditions presented a unique opportunity to investigate sources of variation in irrigation analysis of variance indicated that weather soil and crop type explained an important portion of the observed variation in irrigation across field years table 2 wd alone explained only 18 of observed variation column a in table 2 addition of crop type soil parameters and their interactions with wd substantially increased model explanatory power columns b and c in table 2 still nearly than half 46 of field to field variation in irrigation remained unexplained by the parameters accounted for in this analysis table 2 variation in regional average irrigation across years was explained by magnitude of seasonal wd for both crops p 0 01 r2 0 68 fig 3 as expected irrigation amounts were lower than seasonal wd because i actual crop et is significantly lower than et0 before canopy closure and during the late reproductive stages allen et al 1998 and ii available soil water content at sowing which is typically near field capacity in nebraska also contributes to satisfy crop water requirements fig 3 indeed total water supply from sowing to physiological maturity including stored soil water at sowing plus in season rainfall and irrigation exceeded wd in most irrigated fields data not shown on average maize received 15 and 5 higher irrigation than soybean in sc and nc fields respectively p 0 01 fig 3 this difference reflected differences in irrigation requirements and management between the two crops torrion et al 2014 sharma et al 2015 average irrigation in nc fields was consistently higher than in sc fields across the entire range of wd with an average difference of ca 150mm between the two regions fig 3 difference in average irrigation was attributable to the remarkable difference in average awhc between the two regions 104 versus 199mm and not due to weather as indicated by similarity in seasonal precipitation and eto table 1 our analysis revealed that irrigation decisions were also influenced by more complex interactions between wd and crop type and awch table 2 column d for example the 150 mm difference in irrigation between nc and sc fields was disproportionally larger than the difference in awhc 95mm fig 3 we speculate that the inequality 1 6mm irrigation increase per mm decrease in awhc can be explained by i producers applying higher seasonal irrigation in nc fields to compensate for lower irrigation efficiency i e how much of the applied irrigation water is captured by crops in fields with low awhc ii greater risk aversion attitude in producers irrigating coarse textured soils or iii a combination of these two factors 3 2 is field to field variation in irrigation consistent across years with contrasting weather an important question that arose was whether field to field variation in producer irrigation was similar across years or instead it changed from year to year due to variation in weather our analysis indicated that field to field irrigation variation expressed as cv diminished with increasing magnitude of the seasonal water deficit fig 4 in other words field to field variation in irrigation was largest in the 2010 wet year relative to the 2012 drought year average cvs 46 versus 25 this finding suggests that irrigation requirements in a drought year are so high that it becomes less likely for a producer to apply irrigation in excess of crop water requirements because of system capacity constraints making differences in producer risk behavior less relevant in contrast in a wet year satisfying irrigation water requirements requires fewer irrigation events and smaller amounts and differences among producers relative to irrigation scheduling skills and risk aversion become more evident field to field variation was consistently higher in sc fields relative to nc fields across the entire range of seasonal water deficit average cvs of 40 and 25 respectively fig 4 this finding was consistent with our previous hypothesis since for the same level of water deficit irrigation water requirement is higher in nc fields due to lower awhc relative to sc fields 3 3 producer behavior in relation with irrigation water use iterative analysis of irrigation variation with distance from a given field revealed that clustering of irrigation existed within sc fields fig 5 in other words irrigation decisions made in an individual field also impacted irrigation decision in adjacent fields as distance increased from a field with high irrigation 651 800mm irrigation remained higher than average with this trend persisting until a distance of about 4km i e 5 center pivot irrigated fields in every direction representing an area equivalent of ca 25 fields while it is possible that clustering occurred due to management of several fields by a single producer this is unlikely since on average producers in nebraska owned 5 irrigated fields similarly fields with low irrigation 35 124mm were related to lower than average irrigation in surrounding fields but only to a distance of about 2km away convergence of lines to regional mean irrigation between 250 and 300mm indicated disappearance of neighbor effect with distance from a given field fig 5 interestingly fields with high irrigation affected surrounding fields at a greater distance than low irrigation fields suggesting that producers applying large irrigation amounts may influence the decisions of neighboring producers to a greater extent relative to the influence of producers applying comparatively smaller amounts over neighboring producers fields in the sc region with above high irrigation category and below average low irrigation category irrigation in ranking years were also the same fields exhibiting respective larger and smaller irrigation amounts in the rest of the years fig 6 high degree of persistence in irrigation decisions across years became clear as average irrigation calculated for each field category did not approach the y 0 line in any of the years interestingly fields with above and below average irrigation in 2010 had irrigation closer to the regional average in non ranking years persistence of ca 40 for both high and low irrigation field categories compared to the fields selected in 2012 ranking year persistence of 73 and 80 for high and low irrigation field categories respectively 4 discussion our study analyzed variation in producer irrigation across different years crops and soil types using actual irrigation data collected from hundreds of producer fields the interactive influence of multiple factors including weather crop type soil properties and producer behavior in relation to irrigation water use highlights how difficult it is to predict field and regional irrigation based on a few biophysical factors our findings are consistent with lorite et al 2004 who concluded that use of average irrigation values does not capture the variability in water use among farmers or the variation in irrigation strategies among different crops and soil types for example our study showed that even at a regional level average irrigation can vary as much as 200mm for the same level of seasonal water deficit due to differences in soil type we argue here that given the difficulties to predict irrigation accurately from secondary variables there is an urgent need to increase availability of high quality producer field irrigation data without accurate irrigation data future research focusing on the food water nexus will continue to rely on coarse fragmented irrigation data which will in turn diminish our capacity to inform decision making and prioritize research and investment in irrigated agriculture and water resources weather crop type and soil properties influenced producer field irrigation however these factors only accounted for 53 of observed field to field variation in producer irrigation while part of the unexplained variation might be attributable to factors that were not account for in our analysis due to lack of data e g tillage method producer behavior associated with irrigation management appeared to be an important source of variation consistently with this hypothesis we found that i irrigation amounts were higher in the region with sandy soils even after accounting for differences in awhc between regions ii field to field variation increased with decreasing magnitude of seasonal water deficit i e greater field to field variation in wet years iii there was a significant neighbor effect and iv presence of producers that persistently apply greater or lower irrigation relative to the mean average irrigation across fields with almost identical weather and soil type we also found a high degree of persistence in irrigation amounts over time indicating that the factor s explaining larger irrigation amounts in a group of fields is related with a factor that is persistent over time in contrast to factors that may influence irrigation decisions in a given year but not in others the implication is that there is a substantial opportunity for improving irrigation water use i e grain produced per unit of irrigation if these factors are identified allowing research and extension efforts to focus on correcting these management practices in a cost effective way and properly informing policy and incentives the degree of field to field variation for irrigation reported here is higher than the reported variation for other agricultural inputs such as nitrogen n fertilizer cv 17 grassini et al 2011 we speculate that since most of the n fertilizer is applied in a single dose in the fall or around sowing producers have limited ability to adjust n input relative to year specific conditions hence the amount of n fertilizer to be applied depends on producer yield goal which is generally estimated based on average yield during previous years and exhibits relatively small year to year and field to field variation in irrigated maize systems grassini et al 2011 2014a 2014b in contrast producers have more flexibility in relation to irrigation scheduling and ultimately producers decisions on irrigation timing and amount will depend on their understanding of irrigation requirements in a given year as determined by in season weather soil and crop type and their perception of risk the real time nature of irrigation management exposes to a larger degree the differences in skills and risk aversion attitudes among producers which ultimately results in a high degree of variation in irrigation amounts across fields even for those with almost identical weather and soil examination of field irrigation distributions indicated that there is an important portion of producers ca 10 20 that applied very large irrigation amounts in relation to the rest of producers within the same region year this observation has implications relative to the extension model to be used to improve management of water resources for crop production at district watershed and state levels in this case should extension education prioritize resources to reduce irrigation inputs in the whole population or instead focus on those producers within the upper tail of the field irrigation distribution on the one hand focusing on fields with highest irrigation offers greater potential payoff in terms of irrigation water savings especially if the cause for irrigation surplus can be identified and solved on the other hand these fields might be managed by producers with very high risk aversion attitude who may be less receptive to follow flexible irrigation decisions based for example on crop developmental stages or soil water content thresholds we believe that on farm data as presented in this study complemented with data relative to the factors that drive producer irrigation decisions and determine irrigation water requirements can help answer these kinds of questions as well as prioritize research and extension activities and inform policy and incentive programs similarly access to thousands of irrigation records provides with a unique opportunity to benchmark irrigation management in individual fields indeed we are developing an online database platform to allow producers to compare their field irrigation amounts against the irrigation reported for other fields located within the same climate soil spatial domain such a platform will help producers diagnose current irrigation management and evaluate options to reduce irrigation amount without sacrificing crop yield acknowledgements funding and support for this project comes from the

main research target the impact of nitrogen n fertilizer on root growth water use and wue were examined for winter wheat grown in a semiarid farm on the loess plateau of china a four growing season

wheat nitrogen root systems water use water use efficiency 1 introduction on the loess plateau of china more than half of the precipitation is received during the fallow season from july to september wang et al 2011 the precipitation storage efficiency pse expressed as soil water accumulation divided by precipitation received during fallow periods is approximately 35 40 shangguan et al 2002 therefore maximizing water productivity is a major target in this region and will have a great impact at local and regional scales grain yield and water use efficiency wue in wheat are primarily limited by the soil water deficit during the spring growth and through the grain filling because of the high evaporation and the erratic distribution of rainfall high wheat grain yields are often achieved by using n fertilizer and this practice has markedly increased in china to the point that a controversial environmental concern has been brought to grain production zhu and chen 2002 it is considered that high n fertilization will not be sufficient in the long term maintenance of high grain yields and wue because of the potential depletion of soil water under high n supply fan et al 2005 huang et al 2003 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 the understanding of the mechanisms that control water use and wue under n fertilization is critical for the efficient use of water in semiarid regions of the world including the loess plateau of china one of the ways for efficient water use improvement by a crop is through increasing the depth of the root system since in most dryland environments crops do not use all the water available in the soil profile due to restrictions to root growth turner 2004 the growth and distribution of the crop root system is affected by factors such as cultivar soil properties timing and amount of irrigation and fertilization and tillage management huang et al 2012 outoukarte et al 2010 wang et al 2014 for instance fertilizer application stimulates deeper root growth in winter wheat enabling access to more stored soil water and reducing the risk of water deficit read et al 1982 wang et al 2011 a larger root system can also lead to increases in evapotranspiration et through increases in the extraction of stored soil water cooper et al 1987 and if the soil water is not sufficient then highly fertilized crops may experience greater water deficit late in the season limiting grain yield and wue fan et al 2005 frederick and camberato 1995 huang et al 2003 alternatively if the crop has a poor developed root system grain yield can be also limited because of insufficient capture of soil water by the roots johnson and davis 1980 for instance a grain yield of 0 84 mg ha 1 resulted from plots in which the soil water extraction was limited to a depth of 0 9m in the soil profile leaving 72mm of available soil water in the 2 1m of the soil in contrast a high yield of 2 3 mg ha 1 resulted when only 25mm of available soil water was left in the 2 1m profile because crops captured more water from deeper soil layers johnson and davis 1980 the role of roots system in acquiring n and water have increasingly gained focus in recent years fang et al 2017 palta and watt 2009 palta et al 2011 wang et al 2014 with valuable results for improving crop yields and the efficiency of water and n use on the loess plateau of china limited and erratic rainfall is the primary water resource for rainfed wheat production and no other water resources are available liu et al 2013 additionally in most cases the limited water resources are used inefficiently by crops therefore improving the efficient use of rainfall is a primary target in this region an ideotype of root architecture seems to be important for improving the capture of water and nitrogen palta and watt 2009 however the effects of n fertilization on the soil water balance grain yield and wue need to be assessed for wheat grown in a region with limited and erratic rainfall before a root architecture is designed the aims of this study were i to determine the effect of n application rate on the spatial distribution of the root system and its relationship with wue and grain yield and ii to evaluate the sustainability of obtaining high grain yield under high rates of n fertilizer a field study was conducted during four consecutive growing seasons 2011 2015 and the n fertilizer rates of 0 60 120 and 180kgnha 1 were applied to a wheat crop in each growing season it was hypothesized that i n application to winter wheat increase root length density rld in deeper layers of the soil profile increasing water use and grain yield and ii high n application rates increasing grain yield and wue adversely deplete the soil water and organic c 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a four growing season s field study was conducted at the changwu agri ecological station of the loess plateau 107 44 703 e 35 12 787 n in changwu county shaanxi province china during 2011 2015 growing seasons the site is located in a warm temperate zone with a continental monsoon climate with a long term average rainfall of 570mm 1984 2010 with more than half falling from july to september the mean frost free period is 194days and an annual water surface evaporation demand of 1552mm the experimental site is 1220m above sea level and has a slope of 0 07 the soils are cumuli ustic isohumosols according to the chinese soil taxonomy gong 1999 containing 37 clay 59 silt and 4 sand the dominant clay mineral in this region is i s mixed layer mineral approximately 69

experimental design and crop management the traditional practice in the region is to apply all n fertilizer before sowing as the base fertilizer however the late n amendment has been proposed as a strategy to achieve an improvement in grain yield in recent years because it stimulates photosynthate use in the growth processes and delays senescence of the photosynthetic apparatus fuertes mendizábal et al 2010 so we optimized this pattern using late n fertilizer application in this study the four n treatments were as follows 1 no n applied n0 2 60kgnha 1 n60 3 120kgnha 1 n120 4 180kgnha 1 n180 for treatments of n60 n120 n180 36 72 and 108kgnha 1 urea was broadcast at planting as base fertilizer and an additional 24 48 and 72kgnha 1 were broadcast at flag leaf visible stage i e from april 20 to may 2 when there was some rainfall respectively superphosphate was the p source and was broadcast at a rate of 120kg p2o5 ha 1 at planting the experimental plots were 12m 5m 25 rows and each n treatment was replicated four times for a total of 16 plots in each growing season the plots with the different n application were arranged in a randomized complete block design and located in the same location for the four growing seasons winter wheat cv changhan 58 a high yielding cultivar was sown at the rate of 150kgha 1 using a no till disk drill with 20 cm row spacing wheat crops were sown in late september and harvest in late june of four consecutive growing seasons 2011 2015 all residual straw was removed after harvest for each growing season 2 3 sampling and measurements the dates of the developmental stages phenostages for anthesis and physiological maturity flag leaves turned yellow hanft and wych 1982 were recorded for each plot in each n treatment daily observations were made and the phenostage noted when 50 of the plants in each plot had achieved the particular stage phenostages were defined using the zadoks scale of cereal development zadoks et al 1974 comparisons between the two phenostages were made in days after sowing das rainfall was recorded daily at the experimental station in addition daily records of wet and dry bulb temperature windspeed and class a pan evaporation were obtained from an automatic weather station located 500m away from the experimental plots annual rainfall fallow rainfall and growth season rainfall were also calculated according to the periods of winter wheat growth in the region the drought index di for annual rainfall was used to assess variations and status in rainfall among the four growing seasons and calculated using the following equation fan et al 2005 guo et al 2012 1 di ar m σ where ar is the annual rainfall the sum of fallow rainfall and seasonal rainfall m is the average annual rainfall and s is the standard deviation for annual rainfall di is used to distinguish among the wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 growing seasons guo et al 2012 similarly the dis for fallow rainfall and seasonal rainfall were also calculated to assess variations and status in rainfall among different growing seasons soils from the surface to a depth of 200cm were sampled before sowing at start of elongation gs30 anthesis gs60 and after final harvest gs92 respectively for measurement of soil water content soil water balance s precipitation storage efficiency pse and water use efficiency samples were collected at intervals of 10cm within the ﬁrst 100cm depth and at 20cm intervals from 101cm to 200cm the fresh weight of the samples was determined immediately and the dry weight determined after drying in a forced air oven at 105 c until a constant weight was achieved to calculate the soil moisture the soil water storage swc evapotranspiration et soil water balance swc precipitation storage efficiency pse were determined according to the following equations wang et al 2011 2013 2 sws sd r wm 100 3 δswcf swcph swcs where the sws sd r and wm are soil water storage mm soil depth m soil bulk density gcm 3 and soil moisture at different depths respectively swcf is soil water storage during the fallow period mm swcph is soil water content at previous harvest or the beginning of the fallow period mm and swcs is the soil water content at wheat planting or the end of the fallow period mm the precipitation storage efficiency pse was calculated by 4 pse δ swcf rf where rf is the rainfall during the fallow period mm the etg mm was calculated by 5 etg swcs rg swch where rg is the seasonal rainfall mm swch is the soil water content at harvest mm the change of soil water storage mm was calculated by 6 δswc p et where p is the rainfall occurring during the given period mm et is the amount of evapotranspiration mm and dswc is the change of soil water storage

growing period dswcy which represents the soil water recharge during the fallow period the soil water depletion during growing season and annual soil water balance respectively three soil cores diameter 4 5cm height 20cm were taken randomly in each plot before sowing in 2011 when the experiment was initiated and at harvest in 2013 2015 growing seasons respectively for measurement of soil nutrient contents soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 0mm sieve dried samples weighing 5g each were added to 50ml of 2m kcl shaken for 60min and analyzed with a fiastar 5000

selected and wheat root samples were harvested with a root auger at the flowering stage the radius and length of the drill bit of the root auger were 5 and 10cm respectively the following sampling method was used two cores were collected per plot one within the crop row and one in the midway between rows xue et al 2003 each soil layer was 20cm in depth to a total depth of 2m the mixtures of roots and soil were transferred into a 100 mesh nylon bag and then submerged in water for 30min and subsequently samples were washed with tap water and the impurities were removed the cleaned root samples were placed on the glass plate of a root system scanner for grey scale scanning with an epson perfection v700 photo flatbed scanner seiko epson corp nagano japan an analysis of files was conducted using root system analysis software winrhizo 2008 to obtain root morphology parameters such as root length density rld root dry weight rdw and root mass per unit of root length rml then the root samples were dried at 85 c to a constant dry weight to obtain root dry weight root dry weight rdw per unit area refers to the root dry weight in unit area of soil the rdw gm 2 was calculated by 7

than half of the annual rainfall received during the summer fallow period july to september compared with the long term average of 569mm 1984 2010 the annual rainfall in 2014 2015 was similar to the long term average but lower than that in 2011 2012 667mm and 2013 2014 644mm and higher than that in 2012 2013 456mm the fallow rainfall and seasonal rainfall were not parallel to the annual rainfall

in 2013 2014 growing season wet growing season and 2014 2015 growing season normal growing season et2 was higher than in 2011 2013 growing seasons because of greater precipitation during the stem

growing season table 6 application of n fertilizer increased cdmr in 2012 2014 growing seasons whereas in 2014 2015 growing season the cdmr reduced with n rate increased because of the hail damage at

increased fertilizer application greatly decreased wue for biomass production during the grain filling wueb compared with that in n0 on average treatments n60 n120 and n180 decreased wueb by 26 6 36 8 and 26 1 respectively p 0 05 table 6 wue for grain yield wueg varied with the n application rate and growing season table 7 in 2012 2013 growing season wueg was not significantly different among n

application significantly increased soil mineral n in 0 200cm layers of the soil profile in each growing season of the study when compared to the non n treatment table 8 whereas 60kgnha 1 application only significantly increased soil mineral n in 0 200cm layers of the soil profile in 2013 2014 growing season and in 20 140cm soil layers in 2014 2015 growing season respectively table 8 over the 4 years 120 and 180kgnha 1 application gradually increased soil mineral n in 0 200cm soil layers compared to that in 2011 but 0 and 60kgnha 1 application slowly reduced soil mineral n compared to that in 2011 the n rate soil depth interaction was significant for soil mineral n p 0 05 data not shown compared to the non n treatment application of n fertilizer reduced soil available p content at 0

fertilizer n applications than under non applications of n the soil organic c content in the 20 200cm layers of the soil profile was not significantly different among the n application rates with the increase in the rate of n application soil organic c was reduced from 8 6 to 7 7gkg 1 at the 0 20cm soil layer in 2013 2014 growing season and from 8 7 to 7 6gkg 1 at the 0 20cm soil layer in 2014 2015 growing season the soil organic c content at the 0 20cm soil layer under n180 and n120 was not significantly different with that in n60 table 8 over the 4 years non applications of n fertilizer treatment increased soil organic c content by 0 59gkg 1 at 0 20cm soil layer but n60 n120 and n180 treatments reduced soil organic c content by 0 13 0 36 and 0 60gkg 1 at 0 20cm soil layer respectively table 8 4 discussion 4 1 n applications affected root growth and water uptake application of n significantly enhanced root growth and increased rld in deeper soil layers in wheat one hand mainly because of an increase in soil mineral n in deeper soil layers one the other hand likely because of a decrease in root mass per unit of root length and average root diameter liao et al 2004 2006 russell 1978 the high precipitation at the jointing stage in the 2013 2014 growing season increased rdw and reduced rld and rd compared to low rainfall growing season of 2014 2015 indicating that soil water available at the jointing stage increased rdw rather than root length similar responses have been reported for spring wheat in canada read et al 1982 and grasslands in patagonia schulze et al 1996 in contrast low rainfall at the jointing stage increased root branching and lateral root extension agreeing with findings in maize anderson 1998 application of n fertilizer enhanced rld in deeper layers of the soil profile 80 140cm which could be beneficial in environments prone to end of season drought or terminal drought palta and watt 2009 palta et al 2011 because roots at deeper layers of the soil profile are able to extract the deep available water kirkegaard et al 2007 manschadi et al 2006 the activity of these roots was evidenced through the n applications of more soil water used by plants from deep layers than those in the non n supply treatments 4 2 n applications influenced biomass allocation application of n fertilizer reduced the proportion of the total biomass allocated to the root system as it has been shown in the studies of ercoli et al 2008 and kamiji et al 2014 presumably because the decreased rd and rml a low rd and rml as a result of the n fertilizer application would enhance rld without more increasing root biomass thus the water uptake and aboveground biomass significantly increased with the increase in the n rate accordingly the proportion of the total biomass allocated to the root system was reduced by n fertilizer application compared to n0 in addition a lower partitioning of assimilates to roots has been associated with a higher grain yield and wue fang et al 2010 hu et al 2015 ma et al 2010 reynolds et al 1994 4 3 effect of nitrogen rates on yield and wue the high biomass accumulation before anthesis under high n supply improved grain yield mainly because of the significant increase in ear number and grain number per m2 ercoli et al 2010 estrada campuzano et al 2012 ferrante et al 2012 peltonen sainio et al 2007 sinclair and jamieson 2006 application of n fertilizer in the season with high precipitation 2011 2012 and 2013 2015 prolonged the duration of grain filling likely because of a delay in senescence of the photosynthetic apparatus which improved grain yield altenbach et al 2003 fuertes mendizábal et al 2010 however the duration of grain filling as short in the season with low precipitation 2012 2013 mainly because drought stress and high air temperature during grain filling paced plant senescence altenbach et al 2003 wiegand and cuellar 1981 n applications had lower wue for biomass yield during grain filling mainly because the greater biomass accumulation creates excessive transpiration and water loss from the crop canopy which in turn causes severe water deficits during later critical crop development stage fan et al 2005 frederick and camberato 1995 huang et al 2003 wang et al 2011 ultimately reducing wueb during grain filling however n applications increased wueb during vegetative growth stage mainly because the large increase in biomass accumulation before anthesis reduced soil evaporation through increasing canopy cover and enhanced crop transpiration asseng et al 2001 kang et al 2002 turner 2004 zhang et al 1998 1999 in cereals such as rice maize and wheat it is often accepted that a high hi under water limited conditions is essential in obtaining a high yield and wue kang et al 2002 perry and d antuono 1989 siddique et al 1989 however our results indicated that the improved yield and wueg as a result of n fertilization arise mainly from a greater biomass accumulation rather than from a high hi this is likely because hi in wheat is now approaching a plateau and further increases in grain yield will require an increase in biomass accumulation parry et al 2010 therefore increased n fertilization did not increase the contribution of pre anthesis stored dry matter to the grain although the dmr increased as the n rate increased these results of this study highlight that the application of n increased dryland winter wheat wueg through the more efficient utilization of the available soil water during vegetative growth stage 4 4 effect of n application rates on pse and soil water balance in this study the pse fluctuation was dependent on the summer rainfall and the average pse less than 43 is common for the region in which a conventional wheat summer fallow system varies from 12 to 36 in different years jin et al 2007 rainfall during the fallow period of the study was abundant but a high evaporation loss from the soil surface failed to store enough water for the spring growth and during grain filling therefore the high evaporation during the fallow period and through the winter severely limited the yield and wue the pse and swcf increased with an increase in n fertilizer rate presumably as a result of a high soil reservoir available to store precipitation during the fallow period it is likely that this high soil reservoir resulted from the high soil water uptake by the succeeding wheat wang et al 2011 since etg during the winter wheat growing season on the loess plateau of china is much higher than the rainfall chen et al 2015b huang et al 2003 jin et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 the high levels of n applications i e n120 and n180 increased water uptake and resulted in severe soil water depletion during the growing season swcy 0 mainly because the large increase in rld under n120 and n180 treatments significantly increased water uptake in deeper layers of the soil profile this suggests that wheat grown under increased n fertilization depleted more soil water to supply high demand and to generate high yield it is likely that in the long term high n fertilizer supply might not be sufficient to maintain high yields fan et al 2005 huang et al 2003 liu et al 2013 the high rates of n supply n120 and n180 reduced soil organic c content at 0 20cm likely because the slow straw rotting failed to increase the organic matter of soil due to the drying soil environments in the loess plateau sun et al 2013 in addition application of n could significantly increase soil respiration bowden et al 2004 burton et al 2002 pregitzer et al 2000 leading to decrease in soil c content cao and woodward 1998 ding et al 2007 however wang et al 2013 found that increased n fertilization can be sufficient to maintain high yields and wueg due to increasing soil organic matter and water stored compared to no n fertilization this discrepancy may be associated to differences in planting densities since some studies have been conducted under low planting density 80kgha 1 and with yield variation from 1 2 to 4 2mgha 1 wang et al 2013 under these conditions depletion of soil water and loss of soil organic c could not be clearly observed our results suggest that when grain yield was higher than 4 2mgha 1 increases in n fertilization resulted in adverse effects that included the depletion of soil water and loss of soil organic c which approves our second hypothesis however we suggest that n fertilization can improve high yields and wueg by facilitating the more efficient use of soil water 5 conclusions the increase in root branching and rld in deeper layers of the soil profile with the increases of n applications improved water uptake efficiency despite the reduction in root shoot ratio above ground biomass accumulation at anthesis was positively associated with the n application rates water use efficiency during vegetative growth stage and grain yield respectively however the increases in the pse and root biomass did not prevent the depletion of soil water and loss of soil organic c that resulted from increased fertilizer application n fertilization improved dryland winter wheat yield and wueg by increasing deep root growth and water use during vegetative other than grain filling it is notable that n fertilization may result in depletion of soil water and loss of soil organic c and thus in the long term winter wheat monoculture with increased n fertilization might not be sufficient to maintain high yields and wueg acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

wheat nitrogen root systems water use water use efficiency 1 introduction on the loess plateau of china more than half of the precipitation is received during the fallow season from july to september wang et al 2011 the precipitation storage efficiency pse expressed as soil water accumulation divided by precipitation received during fallow periods is approximately 35 40 shangguan et al 2002 therefore maximizing water productivity is a major target in this region and will have a great impact at local and regional scales grain yield and water use efficiency wue in wheat are primarily limited by the soil water deficit during the spring growth and through the grain filling because of the high evaporation and the erratic distribution of rainfall high wheat grain yields are often achieved by using n fertilizer and this practice has markedly increased in china to the point that a controversial environmental concern has been brought to grain production zhu and chen 2002 it is considered that high n fertilization will not be sufficient in the long term maintenance of high grain yields and wue because of the potential depletion of soil water under high n supply fan et al 2005 huang et al 2003 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 the understanding of the mechanisms that control water use and wue under n fertilization is critical for the efficient use of water in semiarid regions of the world including the loess plateau of china one of the ways for efficient water use improvement by a crop is through increasing the depth of the root system since in most dryland environments crops do not use all the water available in the soil profile due to restrictions to root growth turner 2004 the growth and distribution of the crop root system is affected by factors such as cultivar soil properties timing and amount of irrigation and fertilization and tillage management huang et al 2012 outoukarte et al 2010 wang et al 2014 for instance fertilizer application stimulates deeper root growth in winter wheat enabling access to more stored soil water and reducing the risk of water deficit read et al 1982 wang et al 2011 a larger root system can also lead to increases in evapotranspiration et through increases in the extraction of stored soil water cooper et al 1987 and if the soil water is not sufficient then highly fertilized crops may experience greater water deficit late in the season limiting grain yield and wue fan et al 2005 frederick and camberato 1995 huang et al 2003 alternatively if the crop has a poor developed root system grain yield can be also limited because of insufficient capture of soil water by the roots johnson and davis 1980 for instance a grain yield of 0 84 mg ha 1 resulted from plots in which the soil water extraction was limited to a depth of 0 9m in the soil profile leaving 72mm of available soil water in the 2 1m of the soil in contrast a high yield of 2 3 mg ha 1 resulted when only 25mm of available soil water was left in the 2 1m profile because crops captured more water from deeper soil layers johnson and davis 1980 the role of roots system in acquiring n and water have increasingly gained focus in recent years fang et al 2017 palta and watt 2009 palta et al 2011 wang et al 2014 with valuable results for improving crop yields and the efficiency of water and n use on the loess plateau of china limited and erratic rainfall is the primary water resource for rainfed wheat production and no other water resources are available liu et al 2013 additionally in most cases the limited water resources are used inefficiently by crops therefore improving the efficient use of rainfall is a primary target in this region an ideotype of root architecture seems to be important for improving the capture of water and nitrogen palta and watt 2009 however the effects of n fertilization on the soil water balance grain yield and wue need to be assessed for wheat grown in a region with limited and erratic rainfall before a root architecture is designed the aims of this study were i to determine the effect of n application rate on the spatial distribution of the root system and its relationship with wue and grain yield and ii to evaluate the sustainability of obtaining high grain yield under high rates of n fertilizer a field study was conducted during four consecutive growing seasons 2011 2015 and the n fertilizer rates of 0 60 120 and 180kgnha 1 were applied to a wheat crop in each growing season it was hypothesized that i n application to winter wheat increase root length density rld

experimental design and crop management the traditional practice in the region is to apply all n fertilizer before sowing as the base fertilizer however the late n amendment has been proposed as a strategy to achieve an improvement in grain yield in recent years because it stimulates photosynthate use in the growth processes and delays senescence of the photosynthetic apparatus fuertes mendizábal et al 2010 so we optimized this pattern using late n fertilizer application in this study the four n treatments were as follows 1 no n applied n0 2 60kgnha 1 n60 3 120kgnha 1 n120 4 180kgnha 1 n180 for treatments of n60 n120 n180 36 72 and 108kgnha 1 urea was broadcast at planting as base fertilizer and an additional 24 48 and 72kgnha 1 were broadcast at flag leaf visible stage i e from april 20 to may 2 when there was some rainfall respectively superphosphate was the p source and was broadcast at a rate of 120kg p2o5 ha 1 at planting the experimental plots were 12m 5m 25 rows and each n treatment was replicated four times for a total of 16 plots in each growing season the plots with the different n application were arranged in a randomized complete block design and located in the same location for the four growing seasons winter wheat cv changhan 58 a high yielding cultivar was sown at the rate of 150kgha 1 using a no till disk drill with 20 cm row spacing wheat crops were sown in late september and harvest in late june of four consecutive growing seasons 2011 2015 all residual straw was removed after harvest for each growing season 2 3 sampling and measurements the dates of the developmental stages phenostages for anthesis and physiological maturity flag leaves turned yellow hanft and wych 1982 were recorded for each plot in each n treatment daily observations were made and the phenostage noted when 50 of the plants in each plot had achieved the particular stage phenostages were defined using the zadoks scale of cereal development zadoks et al 1974 comparisons between the two phenostages were made in days after sowing das rainfall was recorded daily at the experimental station in addition daily records of wet and dry bulb temperature windspeed and class a pan evaporation were obtained from an automatic weather station located 500m away from the experimental plots annual rainfall fallow rainfall and growth season rainfall were also calculated according to the periods of winter wheat growth in the region the drought index di for annual rainfall was used to assess variations and status in rainfall among the four growing seasons and calculated using the following equation fan et al 2005 guo et al 2012 1 di ar m σ where ar is the annual rainfall the sum of fallow rainfall and seasonal rainfall m is the average annual rainfall and s is the standard deviation for annual rainfall di is used to distinguish among the wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 growing seasons guo et al 2012 similarly the dis for fallow rainfall and seasonal rainfall were also calculated to assess variations and status in rainfall among different growing seasons soils from the surface to a depth of 200cm were sampled before sowing at start of elongation gs30 anthesis gs60 and after final harvest gs92 respectively for measurement of soil water content soil water balance s precipitation storage efficiency pse and water use efficiency samples were collected at intervals of 10cm within the ﬁrst 100cm depth and at 20cm intervals from 101cm to 200cm the fresh weight of the samples was determined immediately and the dry weight determined after drying in a forced air oven at 105 c until a constant weight was achieved to calculate the soil moisture the soil water storage swc evapotranspiration et soil water balance swc precipitation storage efficiency pse were determined according to the following equations wang et al 2011 2013 2 sws sd r wm 100 3 δswcf swcph swcs where the sws sd r and wm are soil water storage mm soil depth m soil bulk density gcm 3 and soil moisture at different depths respectively swcf is soil water storage during the fallow period mm swcph is soil water content at previous harvest or the beginning of the fallow period mm and swcs is the soil water content at wheat planting or the end of the fallow period mm the precipitation storage efficiency pse was calculated by 4 pse δ swcf rf where rf is the rainfall during the fallow period mm the etg mm was calculated by 5 etg swcs rg swch where rg is the seasonal rainfall mm swch is the soil water content at harvest mm the change of soil water storage mm was calculated by 6 δswc p et where p is the rainfall occurring during the given period mm et is the amount of evapotranspiration mm and dswc is the change of soil water storage within the soil profile mm the soil water balance was measured for the fallow period dswcf growing season dswcg and the whole growing season from the beginning of the fallow period to the end of growing period dswcy which represents the soil water recharge during the fallow period the soil water depletion during growing season and annual soil water balance respectively three soil cores diameter 4 5cm height 20cm were taken randomly in each plot before sowing in 2011 when the experiment was initiated and at harvest in 2013 2015 growing seasons respectively for measurement of soil nutrient contents soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 0mm sieve dried samples weighing 5g each were added to 50ml of 2m kcl shaken for 60min and analyzed with a fiastar 5000 analyzer foss tecator sweden for nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n available phosphorus ap was determined using the olsen method olsen 1954 soil organic c concentration was determined by wet oxidation with k2cr2o7 and h2so4 nelson and sommers 1996 roots measurements made only in the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons in each plot areas with uniform growth of wheat plants were selected and wheat root samples were harvested with a root auger at the flowering stage the radius and length of the drill bit of the root auger were 5 and 10cm respectively the following sampling method was used two cores were collected per plot one within the crop row and one in the midway between rows xue et al 2003 each soil layer was 20cm in depth to a total depth of 2m the mixtures of roots and soil were transferred into a 100 mesh nylon bag and then submerged in water for 30min and subsequently samples were washed with tap water and the impurities were removed the cleaned root samples were placed on the glass plate of a root system scanner for grey scale scanning with an epson perfection v700 photo flatbed scanner seiko epson corp nagano japan an analysis of files was conducted using root system analysis software winrhizo 2008 to obtain root morphology parameters such as root length density rld root dry weight rdw and root mass per unit of root length rml then the root samples were dried at 85 c to a constant dry weight to obtain root dry weight root dry weight rdw per unit area refers to the root dry weight in unit area of soil the rdw gm 2 was calculated by 7 r d w m s 10 4 where m and s are the total root dry weight g within of 0 200cm of the soil profile and the soil area cm2 respectively the soil area cm2 was calculated by 8 s 3πpr2 where r is the radius of the drilling bit r 5cm the rld cmcm 3 was calculated by 9 rld l sh where l and h are the root length cm of different soil layer and the sampling depth h 20cm respectively the rml mgm 1 was

pse soil water profile and water balance precipitation storage efficiency pse varied among n rates and growing seasons fig 2 and was lower under n0 than under the other n rates on average the n60 n120 and n180 rates significantly increased the pse by 11 9 18 2 and 19 2 respectively when compared to n0 treatment soil water recharge during the fallow period swcf was affected by n fertilization application of n fertilizer resulted in greater water replenishment during the fallow period in all growing seasons table 3 over the 4 years the n60 n120 and n180 rates increased soil water replenishment during the fallow period by 11 p 0 05 24 and 25mm p 0 05 respectively when compared to non n treatment table 3 on the contrary n fertilization reduced evapotranspiration during the fallow period etf when compared n0 treatment table 3 the soil water storage at planting swcs was not significantly different among the n treatments table 3 at physiological maturity gs92 the soil water storage was lower under all n rates than under the treatment without n table 3 under the n60 n120 and n180 rates the soil water storage at harvest decreased by 16 p 0 05 31 and 36mm p 0 05 respectively in 2011 2012 growing season 41 55 and 56mm respectively in 2012 2013 growing season p 0 05 33 44 and 48mm respectively in 2013 2014 growing season p 0 05 and 49 74 and 89mm respectively in 2014 2015 growing season p 0 05 when compared to non n treatment table 3 over the 4 years the n60 n120 and n180 rates increased water uptake by 11 6 p 0 05 22 3 and 24 8mm p 0 05 respectively in the 0 80cm layers of the soil profile 15 9 20 1 and 22 9mm respectively p 0 05 in the 80 140cm soil layers and 7 5 8 6 and 8 3mm respectively p 0 05 in the 140 200cm soil layers when compared to the non n treatments data not shown the interaction n rate soil depth was statistical significant for soil water content p 0 05 data not shown thus on average the soil water storage at harvest decreased

the n60 n120 and n180 rates increased et2 by 2 3 p 0 05 11 5 and 22 1mm p 0 05 respectively and et3 by 19 9 49 3 and 28 2mm p 0 05 respectively soil water consumption varied with the growing season and in 2011 2012 growing season extremely wet growing season was higher than that in other growing seasons because of higher precipitation in the summer fallow period and growing season p 0 05 table 4 in 2013 2014 growing season wet growing season and 2014 2015 growing season normal growing season et2 was higher than in 2011 2013 growing seasons because of greater precipitation during the stem elongation and grain filling stages p 0 05 evapotranspiration during the growing season etg was high in 2011 2012 growing season due to a wet growing season and low in 2012 2013 growing season as a result of a dry growing season table 4 for the 4 growing seasons of the study the etg increased significantly by 27 54 and 48mm for n60 n120 and n180 respectively when compared with n0 table 4 3 4 effect of n rate on root growth the root dry weight rdw average root diameter rd and root length density rld were affected by n application fig 3 table 5 n60 n120 and n180 treatments increased rdw by

n60 n120 and n180 treatments increased rld in the 0 140cm layers of the soil profile between the rows in each growing season of the study p 0 05 table 5 however rld within row under 120 and 180kgnha 1 application was significantly increased in the 0 140cm layers of the soil profile in both 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing seasons when compared n0 table 5 but rld within row under 60kgnha 1 application was different only in 20 140cm soil layers in 2013 2014 growing season and in 0 20 and 40 80cm soil layers in 2014 2015 growing season respectively when compared n0 table 5 rld between the

the n60 n120 and n180 rates reduced the rml by 16 4 20 2 and 21 5 respectively p 0 05 fig 4b 3 5 effect of n application on biomass and remobilization of stored dm biomass accumulation varied with the growing season of the study in 2011 2012 growing season an extremely wet growing season biomass accumulation increased with the increase in the n rate table 6 in 2012 2013 growing season an extremely dry growing season and in 2013 2014 growing season an average wet growing season biomass accumulation was not affected under n applications above 120kgnha 1 table 6 the increased n fertilizer

on yield yield components and wue thousand grain weight tgw was slightly reduced in n treatments regardless n rates applied than the non n treatment p 0 05 but application of n did not affect hi p 0 05 table 7 the increase of grain yield owing the n application was mainly from the increase of ear number per m2 and grain number per m2 table 7 on average for the four growing season the ear number

application significantly increased soil mineral n in 0 200cm layers of the soil profile in each growing season of the study when compared to the non n treatment table 8 whereas 60kgnha 1 application only significantly increased soil mineral n in 0 200cm layers of the soil profile in 2013 2014 growing season and in 20 140cm soil layers in 2014 2015 growing season respectively table 8 over the 4 years 120 and 180kgnha 1 application gradually increased soil mineral n in 0 200cm soil layers compared to that in 2011 but 0 and 60kgnha 1 application slowly reduced soil mineral n compared to that in 2011 the n rate soil depth interaction was significant for soil mineral n p 0 05 data not shown compared to the non n treatment application of n fertilizer reduced soil available p content at 0

respectively table 8 4 discussion 4 1 n applications affected root growth and water uptake application of n significantly enhanced root growth and increased rld in deeper soil layers in wheat one hand mainly because of an increase in soil mineral n in deeper soil layers one the other hand likely because of a decrease in root mass per unit of root length and average root diameter liao et al 2004 2006 russell 1978 the high precipitation at the jointing stage in the 2013 2014 growing season increased rdw and reduced rld and rd compared to low rainfall growing season of 2014 2015 indicating that soil water available at the jointing stage increased rdw rather than root length similar responses have been reported for spring wheat in canada read et al 1982 and grasslands in patagonia schulze et al 1996 in contrast low rainfall at the jointing stage increased root branching and lateral root extension agreeing with findings in maize anderson 1998 application of n fertilizer enhanced rld in deeper layers of the soil profile 80 140cm which could be beneficial in environments prone to end of season drought or terminal drought palta and watt 2009 palta et al 2011 because roots at deeper layers of the soil profile are able to extract the deep available water kirkegaard et al 2007 manschadi et al 2006 the activity of these roots was evidenced through the n applications of more soil water used by plants from deep layers than those in the non n supply treatments 4 2 n applications influenced biomass allocation application of n fertilizer reduced the proportion of the total biomass allocated to the root system as it has been shown in the studies of ercoli et al 2008 and kamiji et al 2014 presumably because the decreased rd and rml a low rd and rml as a result of the n fertilizer application would enhance rld without more increasing root biomass thus the water uptake and aboveground biomass significantly increased with the increase in the n rate accordingly the proportion of the total biomass allocated to the root system was reduced by n fertilizer application compared to n0 in addition a lower partitioning of assimilates to roots has been associated with a higher grain yield and wue fang et al 2010 hu et al 2015 ma et al 2010 reynolds et al 1994 4 3 effect of nitrogen rates on yield and wue the high biomass accumulation before anthesis under high n supply improved grain yield mainly because of the significant increase in ear number and grain number per m2 ercoli et al 2010 estrada campuzano et al 2012 ferrante et al 2012 peltonen sainio et al 2007 sinclair and jamieson 2006 application of n fertilizer in the season with high precipitation 2011 2012 and 2013 2015 prolonged the duration of grain filling likely because of a delay in senescence of the photosynthetic apparatus which improved grain yield altenbach et al 2003 fuertes mendizábal et al 2010 however the duration of grain filling as short in the season with low precipitation 2012 2013 mainly because drought stress and high air temperature during grain filling paced plant senescence altenbach et al 2003 wiegand and cuellar 1981 n applications had lower wue for biomass yield during grain filling mainly because the greater biomass accumulation creates excessive transpiration and water loss from the crop canopy which in turn causes severe water deficits during later critical crop development stage fan et al 2005 frederick and camberato 1995 huang et al 2003 wang et al 2011 ultimately reducing wueb during grain filling however n applications increased wueb during vegetative growth stage mainly because the large increase in biomass accumulation before anthesis reduced soil evaporation through increasing canopy cover and enhanced crop transpiration asseng et al 2001 kang et al 2002 turner 2004 zhang et al 1998 1999 in cereals such as rice maize and wheat it is often accepted that a high hi under water limited conditions is essential in obtaining a high yield and wue kang et al 2002 perry and d antuono 1989 siddique et al 1989 however our results indicated that the improved yield and wueg as a result of n fertilization arise mainly from a greater biomass accumulation rather than from a high hi this is likely because hi in wheat is now approaching a plateau and further increases in grain yield will require an increase in biomass accumulation parry et al 2010 therefore increased n fertilization did not increase the contribution of pre anthesis stored dry matter to the grain although the dmr increased as the n rate increased these results of this study highlight that the application of n increased dryland winter wheat wueg through the more efficient utilization of the available soil water during vegetative growth stage 4 4 effect of n application rates on pse and soil water balance in this study the pse fluctuation was dependent on the summer rainfall and the average pse less than 43 is common for the region in which a conventional wheat summer fallow system varies from 12 to 36 in different years jin et al 2007 rainfall during the fallow period of the study was abundant but a high evaporation loss from the soil surface failed to store enough water for the spring growth and during grain filling therefore the high evaporation during the fallow period and through the winter severely limited the yield and wue the pse and swcf increased with an increase in n fertilizer rate presumably as a result of a high soil reservoir available to store precipitation during the fallow period it is likely that this high soil reservoir resulted from the high soil water uptake by the succeeding wheat wang et al 2011 since etg during the winter wheat growing season on the loess plateau of china is much higher than the rainfall chen et al 2015b huang et al 2003 jin et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 the high levels of n applications i e n120 and n180 increased water uptake and resulted in severe soil water depletion during the growing season swcy 0 mainly because the large increase in rld under n120 and n180 treatments significantly increased water uptake in deeper layers of the soil profile this suggests that wheat grown under increased n fertilization depleted more soil water to supply high demand and to generate high yield it is likely that in the long term high n fertilizer supply might not be sufficient to maintain high yields fan et al 2005 huang et al 2003 liu et al 2013 the high rates of n supply n120 and n180 reduced soil organic c content at 0 20cm likely because the slow straw rotting failed to increase the organic matter of soil due to the drying soil environments in the loess plateau sun et al 2013 in addition application of n could significantly increase soil respiration bowden et al 2004 burton et al 2002 pregitzer et al 2000 leading to decrease in soil c content cao and woodward 1998 ding et al 2007 however wang et al 2013 found that increased n fertilization can be sufficient to maintain high yields and wueg due to increasing soil organic matter and water stored compared to no n fertilization this discrepancy may be associated to differences in planting densities since some studies have been conducted under low planting density 80kgha 1 and with yield variation from 1 2 to 4 2mgha 1 wang et al 2013 under these conditions depletion of soil water and loss of soil organic c could not be clearly observed our results suggest that when grain yield was higher than 4 2mgha 1 increases in n fertilization resulted in adverse effects that included the depletion of soil water and loss of soil organic c which approves our second hypothesis however we suggest that n fertilization can improve high yields and wueg by facilitating the more efficient use of soil water 5 conclusions the increase in root branching and rld in deeper layers of the soil profile with the increases of n applications improved water uptake efficiency despite the reduction in root shoot ratio above ground biomass accumulation at anthesis was positively associated with the n application rates water use efficiency during vegetative growth stage and grain yield respectively however the increases in the pse and root biomass did not prevent the depletion of soil water and loss of soil organic c that resulted from increased fertilizer application n fertilization improved dryland winter wheat yield and wueg by increasing deep root growth and water use during vegetative other than grain filling it is notable that n fertilization may result in depletion of soil water and loss of soil organic c and thus in the long term winter wheat monoculture with increased n fertilization might not be sufficient to maintain high yields and wueg acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

11583,controlled drainage cd has recently been proposed as a best management practice for reducing nutrient export from drained cropland in the u s midwest to the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico we conducted a 25 year simulation study using the hydrological model drainmod and the carbon and nitrogen n model drainmod nii to evaluate the performance of cd at 48 locations across the u s midwest hydrological and nitrogen predictions of this simulation study were compared to rzwqm dssat predictions by thorp et al 2008 simulation results showed that cd reduced annual subsurface drainage by 86mm 30 and annual n drainage losses by 10 9kgnha 1 32 on average over the 48 sites drainmod predicted highest reductions in drain flow at the south and southeast locations and lowest reductions at the northwest locations the large reductions in drain flow in the south and southeast locations resulted in a large increase in surface runoff which could increase soil erosion and sediment transport to surface water in the north and northwest locations the smaller amount of water that did not pass through the drainage system because of cd was primarily lost as evapotranspiration drainmod nii predictions of annual reductions in n drainage loss followed the same trend of annual reductions in drainage flow drainmod nii predictions show that reductions in n drainage loss under cd were mainly attributed to increase in denitrification the declining trend in predicted annual denitrification from the southern to the northern locations of the midwest region is most likely attributed to the lower temperature and less precipitation at the northern locations rzwqm dssat predicted reductions in annual drainage and n loss under cd conditions showed a similar trend to drainmod drainmod nii predictions rzwqm dssat however predicted substantially higher reductions in both drain flow regional average of 151mmyr 1 53 and n drainage losses regional average of 18 9kgnha 1 yr 1 51 the discrepancies between drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat predictions of annual reductions in drain flow and n loss under cd conditions were caused by differences in model predictions of individual components of the water and nitrogen balances under both free drainage and controlled drainage scenarios overall this simulation study showed that climate variation across the region has a substantial impact on cd efficacy for reducing n drainage loss keywords agricultural drainage controlled drainage drainmod drainmod nii rzwqm dssat nitrogen losses 1 introduction agricultural drainage is essential for crop production on over 40 million ha or about 25 of cropland in the united states drainage improves trafficability providing timely access for performing field operations such as tillage planting and harvesting more importantly drainage removes excess water in the plant root zone minimizing plant stress due to excess water and improving crop yield evans and fausey 1999 subsurface drainage also reduces surface runoff sediment losses and the movement of contaminants attached to the sediment such as pesticides and phosphorus into surface waters skaggs et al 1994 drainage however significantly alters the hydrology and nitrogen n cycling in naturally poorly drained soils it lowers the water table and increases soil aeration which increases soil organic matter decomposition and associated n mineralization immobilization and decreases denitrification the net result of artificial drainage is an increase in subsurface drainage flow rates and n leaching losses to receiving surface waters nitrogen n losses from drained cropland in the u s midwest have been identified as one of the main sources of n leading to the hypoxic conditions in the gulf of mexico petrolia and gowda 2006 turner et al 2008 rabalais et al 2007 2014 there are over 16 million ha of artificially drained land in crop production in the midwest with five states illinois indiana iowa ohio and minnesota accounting for over 50 of the u s land planted to corn and soybean petrolia and gowda 2006 nitrogen losses from drained corn and soybean fields in the midwest states make up a significant portion of the estimated 1 6 million metric tons of n discharged annually into the gulf of mexico scavia et al 2004 turner and rabalais 2003 achieving sustainability of crop production on drained land hinges upon the adoption of effective and economically feasible management practices that minimize nutrient export from drained lands without adversely affecting crop yield or increasing production cost drainage water management dwm also referred to as controlled drainage cd is a promising practice that is recently proposed as a best management practice bmp for reducing n export from drained cropland in midwestern u s controlled drainage involves the use of an overflow control device drainage water control structure or flashboard riser at the drainage outlet that regulates the drainage intensity by raising and lowering the drainage outlet to better match the need for drainage in the agricultural field this drainage water control mechanism reduces drainage volumes which decreases the edge of field mass loss of n to receiving surface waters evans et al 1995 evans and skaggs 2004 skaggs et al 2010 skaggs et al 2012 additionally cd raises the water table increasing anaerobic conditions in the soil profile which favors denitrification wesström and messing 2007 skaggs et al 2010 lastly it has been observed that careful management of cd systems during the crop growing season could lead to increasing crop yield and n uptake especially under dry conditions poole et al 2013 achieving the yield benefits of cd requires proper management of the drainage systems during the growing season to avoid potential yield losses due to excessive water stresses the water quality benefits of cd are mostly achieved by managing the drainage outlets during late fall winter and early spring when the practice has little or no effect on crop yield the practice is applicable to both open ditch and subsurface tile drainage systems research conducted in the late 1970 s and 1980 s have shown that cd can substantially reduce the export of n and p to surface water from drained lands in the north carolina atlantic coastal plains by over 40 and 25 respectively gilliam et al 1979 skaggs and gilliam 1981 evans et al 1995 as a result of this research cd was accepted in the mid 1980s as a best management practice bmp for reducing nutrient losses to surface waters with the control structures cost shared by the state of north carolina recently the natural resources conservation service nrcs of the u s department of agriculture has launched a national initiative for large scale adoption and implementation of cd in the midwest to reduce n export from drained cropland to the mississippi river basin the performance of cd depends upon several factors including climatological conditions precipitation and temperature soil type soil texture and organic matter content topography cropping system and farming practices crop rotation fertilization tillage and drainage system design drain depth and spacing thus the effectiveness of cd is expected to vary from location to location and from year to year so the reported performance of cd in the u s southeast cannot be simply extrapolated to other geographic regions such as the u s midwest moreover the magnitude of n losses in drainage water and the effect of cd on those losses are expected to vary among locations within the midwest region the hydrological and water quality effects of cd are not well documented for the drained cropland of the u s midwest in illinois pitts et al 2004 reported 40 reduction in n drainage loss caused by implementing cd practice in ohio fausey 2005 found that cd reduced drainage outflows by 41 and n losses by 46 more recently field experiments have been conducted at several locations across the midwest to study the effects of cd on n losses from drained croplands to surface waters e g adeuya et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 gunn et al 2015 these studies reported that cd reduces annual drainage flow and no3 n losses by 17 up to 90 this large variation in cropping system response to cd was mainly attributed to spatial and temporal variations in weather differences in soil types and the level of management of the control structures in each experimental site despite this effort the long term impacts of the large scale application of cd across midwestern u s cannot be assessed by field experiments only computer simulation models can be cost effective and reliable tools for assessing the performance of cd as influenced by climatological soil and management factors ale et al 2009 simulated the effect of cd on hydrology and crop yield at the purdue university water quality field station wqfs using the drainage water management model drainmod model predictions showed that cd reduced annual drainage by 60 with no significant effect on crop yield ale et al 2009 thorp et al 2008 used the rzwqm dssat model calibrated for a corn and soybean production system on a subsurface drained iowa soil to simulate the performance of cd using 25 years of climatological data for 48 locations across the midwest their analysis showed that cd has a high impact on reducing both drain flow 35 68 and n drainage losses 33 51 this paper reports on a simulation study using the hydrological model drainmod and the carbon and nitrogen companion model drainmod n ii to evaluate the performance of cd across midwestern u s at the same 48 locations previously simulated by thorp et al 2008 using the rzwqm dssat model the performance of the practice predicted by the drainmod suite of models was compared to cd performance predicted by the rzwqm dssat model thorp et al 2008 the performance of cd across the u s midwest predicted by the two widely used models drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat would provide information critically needed for supporting the recent initiatives for the large scale implementation of cd in the midwest to reduce nitrogen loss from drained cropland to the mississippi river basin these model predictions along with the results of available short term experiments will help make guided decisions on where in the midwest cd would be most effective and economically feasible 2 materials and methods 2 1 drainmod description drainmod skaggs 1980 is a field scale hydrological model that was developed in early 1980s to simulate the hydrology of poorly drained high water table soils it uses the water balance approach with functional relationships to describe the main hydrological processes and predict infiltration evapotranspiration water table fluctuation subsurface drainage surface runoff and lateral and vertical seepage in response to given climatological conditions crop rotation soil type and drainage system design and management the model predicts infiltration using the green ampt equation subsurface drainage is calculated using the hooghoudt s equation when the water table is below the surface and kirkham s equations for ponded surface conditions surface runoff is estimated as the difference between rates of precipitation and infiltration once site specific surface depressional storage is filled skaggs 1999 daily potential et pet can be computed by the model using the temperature based thornthwaite method or estimated by the user using any pet method and provided to the model as an input data file the model simulates heat flow using finite difference solution to the heat equation and predicts the temperature distribution throughout the soil profile this enables the model to simulate hydrological processes in cold regions such as midwestern u s which is influenced by soil freezing and thawing and snow accumulation and melt luo et al 2000 the model uses the empirical stress day index approach to simulate the effect of excess and deficit soil water stresses on crop yield skaggs et al 2012 drainmod is easy to use requires relatively few inputs and yet provides quite accurate predictions the model has been widely used to study the effects of drainage design and management on crop yields e g evans et al 1991 wang et al 2006 thorp et al 2009 erosion e g saleh 1994 hydrology of high water table soils e g fouss et al 1987 skaggs et al 1981 wang et al 2006 thorp et al 2009 luo et al 2010 and wetland hydrology e g skaggs et al 2005 jia and luo 2006 a detailed description of drainmod is given by skaggs et al 2012 2 2 drainmod nii description drainmod nii youssef 2003 youssef et al 2005 is a field scale process based model that simulates carbon c and n dynamics in drained cropland for a wide range of soil types climatic conditions and farming practices drainmod nii is a companion model to drainmod it simulates organic carbon oc dynamics using a c cycle adapted from the century model parton et al 1993 the soil c is represented by three soil organic matter pools active slow and passive two above and below ground residue pools metabolic and structural and a surface microbial pool each organic matter pool is characterized by oc content potential rate of decomposition and carbon to nitrogen ratio organic c decomposition is assumed to follow first order kinetics the model simulates a detailed n cycle that represents both mineral n nitrate and ammoniacal forms and organic n on and their interaction as affected by c cycling the model simulates wet atmospheric deposition application of mineral n fertilizers application of organic n sources such as plant residue and animal manure plant n uptake n mineralization and immobilization nitrification denitrification ammonia volatilization and n losses via subsurface drainage deep seepage and surface runoff nitrogen reactive transport is simulated using a multiphase form of the one dimensional advection dispersion reaction adr equation model predictions include daily concentrations of mineral n i e no3 and nh4 in soil solution and drainage outflow oc content of the top 20cm soil layer and cumulative rates of simulated n processes on daily monthly and annual basis drainmod nii has recently been applied successfully to a range of soils and locations across the u s north carolina youssef et al 2006 iowa thorp et al 2009 illinois david et al 2009 minnesota luo et al 2010 and indiana ale et al 2012 and europe germany bechtold et al 2007 and sweden salazar et al 2009 2 3 simulation approach thorp et al 2007 evaluated the performance of the rzwqm dssat model using ten years of measured hydrologic water quality and crop yield data for a corn soybean agricultural system on tile drained silty clay loam clay loam soils in central iowa u s 42 2 n 93 6 w during the ten year study period controlled drainage was not implemented on the research site meaning the outlets of the tile drains remained open during the entire period thorp et al 2009 then evaluated the performance of drainmod and drainmod nii models using the same data set as part of the model evaluation thorp et al 2009 compared the performances of rzwqm dssat and drainmod drainmod nii thorp et al 2008 used the rzwq dssat model calibrated for the iowa corn soybean production system thorp et al 2007 to simulate the performance of cd as affected by differences in climatic conditions crop planting and harvesting dates and n fertilization rates across the u s midwest they conducted the simulations using 30 years of historical climate data 1961 1990 for 48 locations across the midwest fig 1 due to limitations in the interface of rzwqm dssat model thorp et al 2008 dropped the first 5 years of the simulations from the analysis following the same modeling approach by thorp et al 2008 we used drainmod and drainmod nii models calibrated for the iowa crop production system thorp et al 2009 to conduct a thirty year simulation 1961 1990 of the hydrology c and n dynamics and crop yields for each of the 48 midwestern locations fig 1 under both free drainage fd and cd scenarios for the same soil type crop rotation and drainage design across different sites this approach was followed to focus on the effect of geographic location on the performance of cd across midwestern u s using the calibrated parameters for the iowa site which were obtained by thorp et al 2009 enabled us to compare cd performance predicted by the two models drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat the simulated soil consisted of an organic matter rich surface soil with a relatively poorly drained deep soil profile underlain by a semi impermeable layer allowing for vertical downward seepage into the groundwater aquifer key model inputs characterizing soil properties were set similar to values used by thorp et al 2009 the simulated drainage system consists of subsurface drains 145cm deep spaced 27 4m apart maximum surface storage a parameter that controls surface runoff rates was set to 0 5cm assuming a good surface leveling table 1 lists key model inputs characterizing drainage system design soil properties and snow accumulation and melt processes the simulated cropping system includes corn planted in even years and soybean planted in odd years simulated planting and harvesting dates table 2 were based on the state and county level national agricultural statistics service nass data for crop development and management across the region usda 2007 for the cd scenario the overflow level of the drainage water control structure was set to a depth of 30cm during fall winter and early spring four weeks before planting the overflow level was lowered to the drain depth 145cm three weeks after planting the level was raised to a depth of 60cm and remained at this depth during the crop growing season two weeks before harvesting the overflow level was lowered again to the drain depth and one week after harvesting the overflow level of the structure was raised to the off growing season depth of 30cm this is a typical management scheme to reduce drainage intensity when the land is fallow operate the drainage system at maximum capacity to provide trafficable conditions for field operations e g planting and harvesting and provide adequate drainage during the crop growing season ale et al 2012 the levels of the control structure and the timing of adjusting these levels may slightly vary the timings and the levels used in this study were selected to match the timings and levels used by thorp et al 2008 to allow for comparison between predictions of drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm models thirty years of historical measured climate data 1961 1990 including hourly precipitation in addition to daily minimum and maximum temperatures wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity were obtained from the national solar radiation database nrel 1995 these climatological data were used to calculate the daily pet according to the fao pennman monteith method allen et al 1998 which are saved in drainmod compatible input files similarly model inputs required to simulate nitrogen and carbon dynamics were set according to thorp et al 2009 table 3 lists key input parameters of drainmod nii fertilization and tillage management were set to describe common practices implemented for different locations during corn years nitrogen fertilizer was applied seven days before planting at rates equal to the five year 2001 2006 average table 2 according to the data retrieved by thorp et al 2008 from the usda economic research service usda 2008 tillage practices were set similar among the 48 sites and comprised spring field cultivator operations for site preparation one day before planting and fall tillage consisted of chisel plowing following harvest operations 2 4 comparison to rzwqm dssat as stated earlier rzwqm dssat was previously used to assess cd performance across the same 48 sites fig 1 for the same climate time span thorp et al 2008 results of rzwqm dssat simulations published by thorp et al 2008 were compared to drainmod and drainmod nii predictions obtained in this study this section provides a brief comparison between the two models highlighting the similarities and differences in simulating key hydrological and biogeochemical processes understanding these similarities and differences is helpful for comparing cd performance predicted by both models and explaining the differences in these predictions similar to drainmod rzwqm dssat simulates infiltration of water into the soil profile using green ampt equation deep seepage using darcy s equation and simulates tile drainage using hooghoudt equation on the other hand rzwqm dssat applies a numerical solution to richards equation in order to compute soil water distribution in the vadose zone which is different from the empirical drained to equilibrium approach implemented in drainmod the former model uses the shuttleworth wallace pet method farahani and decoursey 2000 while the later model uses either thornthwaite method with monthly correction factors or as was the case in this application reads daily pet input calculated outside the model using any pet method in addition rzwqm dssat does not simulate storage of water on the soil surface rather water that exceeds macropore infiltration is considered runoff the plant growth component of the rzwqm dssat is a deterministic process based module adapted from the widely used dssat crop models these crop modules simulate on a day by day basis plant growth rate and mass accumulation and allocation as affected by temperature soil water and nutrient status as well as atmospheric co2 concentration drainmod simulation of crop yields is based on the empirical stress day index approach the recently upgraded version of drainmod drainmod dssat negm et al 2014 was not used in the current study rzwqm dssat differs from drainmod nii simulations of carbon and nitrogen dynamics rzwqm dssat applies the o rganic m atter and n itrogen omni module developed by shaffer et al 2000 nitrogen transport within rzwqm dssat is simulated using sequential partial piston displacement and mixing approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated effect of controlled drainage on hydrology table 4 summarizes the results of drainmod hydrological simulations for the 48 locations averaged over the 25 year simulation period as expected the model predicted that cd would decrease subsurface drainage and increase surface runoff evapotranspiration and vertical seepage compared to conventional drainage with unmanaged outlets fd model predictions show that cd reduced annual subsurface drainage by 8 6cmyr 1 30 on average over the 48 sites the model predicted a corresponding increase in surface runoff by 4 8cmyr 1 123 evapotranspiration by 2 7cmyr 1 5 and vertical seepage by 0 9cmyr 1 23 of the 8 6cmyr 1 that did not pass through the drainage system because of cd 56 was lost as surface runoff 31 was lost as evapotranspiration and 10 was lost via deep seepage the predicted average water balance for the fd scenario indicated that 31 8 4 5 59 2 and 4 5 of the 88cm yearly average precipitation were lost via subsurface drainage surface runoff evapotranspiration and vertical seepage respectively the corresponding predicted average water balance for the cd scenario shows a substantial decrease in subsurface drainage 22 1 of precipitation compensated for by a substantial increase in surface runoff 10 of precipitation and a slight increase in both evapotranspiration 62 5 of precipitation and vertical seepage 5 5 of precipitation controlled drainage was most effective in reducing drain flow at the south and southeast locations fig 2 a the highest simulated reduction in drain flow occurred in memphis tennessee table 4 for this location cd reduced drain flow by 26 7cmyr 1 45 and increased surface runoff et and vertical seepage by 18 8cmyr 1 355 6 6cmyr 1 11 and 1 2cmyr 1 29 respectively the second highest simulated reduction in drain flow occurred in evansville indiana implementing cd at this location reduced drain flow by 16 3cmyr 1 39 and increased surface runoff et and vertical seepage by 10 8cmyr 1 292 4 2cmyr 1 7 and 1 1cmyr 1 28 respectively the lowest simulated reduction in drain flow of 19 occurred at northwest locations in both sioux city iowa and sioux falls south dakota fig 2a and table 4 for the sioux city location cd slightly reduced drain flow by 2 3cmyr 1 and slightly increased surface runoff et and vertical seepage by 0 2cmyr 1 12 1 5cmyr 1 3 and 0 6cmyr 1 17 respectively the predicted fate of the water that did not pass through the drainage system under cd conditions varied across the region the large reductions in drain flow associated with implementing cd in the south and southeast locations resulted in a large increase in surface runoff and only a modest increase in vertical seepage for example cd reduced drain flow at the memphis location by 26 7cmyr 1 of this amount 70 was lost by surface runoff 25 was lost through et and only 5 was lost through vertical seepage the large increase in surface runoff could have negative impacts due to increased soil erosion and transport of sediment and contaminants attached to sediment including phosphorus and pesticides in the north and northwest locations where cd is relatively less effective drain flow reductions 20 the water that did not pass through the drainage system because of cd was primarily lost through et of the 2 3cmyr 1 reduction in drain flow due to implementing cd at sioux city 65 was lost through et 26 was lost through vertical seepage and only 9 was lost via surface runoff these results indicate that cd does not significantly increase vertical seepage for this soil and boundary conditions as was hypothesized by skaggs et al 2010 for a site in north carolina these findings however cannot be generalized as the effect of cd on field hydrology varies with soil type and boundary conditions on the site another simulation study with different soils would be very useful in assessing the effect of cd on field hydrology and especially on vertical seepage for different soils overall it is clear that climate variation across the region has a substantial impact on cd efficacy for reducing drainage flow normally higher annual precipitation and average annual temperatures were associated with higher drainage rates as well as higher flow reductions under the cd scenario in the south and southeast locations fig 2 flow reductions in the north and northwest locations were significantly lower due to lower annual precipitation and prolonged freezing fallow periods november till early march when cd is mostly applied for water quality benefits drainmod hydrological predictions were used to develop linear regression equations for estimating long term average annual drainage flow under fd and cd scenarios across the midwest region eqs 1 and 2 precipitation was found to be the only explanatory variable that has statistically significant effect on predicting drainage flow the r2 values were 0 95 and 0 89 for the regression equations of fd and cd scenarios respectively indicating that precipitation is an adequate predictor of drainage flow across the midwest region it should be noted that the simulations were conducted with one drainage intensity drain depth and spacing drainage intensity would likely also significantly impact annual subsurface drainage if it had been tested 1 dfd 29 67 0 6548 r 2 dcd 13 92 0 3775 r where dfd and dcd are the long term average annual drainage cmyr 1 under fd and cd scenarios respectively and r is the long term average annual precipitation cmyr 1 3 2 simulated effects of controlled drainage on nitrogen cycle the results of drainmod nii nitrogen simulations for the 48 sites are presented in table 5 on average across the 48 locations model predictions show that cd reduced n drainage losses by 10 9kgnha 1 yr 1 32 increased denitrification by 8 0kgnha 1 yr 1 73 increased plant uptake by 0 9kgnha 1 yr 1 0 65 increased n losses via surface runoff by 1 3kgnha 1 yr 1 76 and slightly decreased n losses via vertical seepage by 0 4kgnha 1 yr 1 12 the predicted fate of the 10 9kgnha 1 yr 1 reduction was as follows 73 was denitrified 12 was lost via surface runoff and 4 was lost via deep seepage practically cd did not affect n plant uptake and net n mineralization these simulation results support the hypothesis that cd increases the anaerobic conditions in the soil profile promoting denitrification and reducing n leaching losses the small n concentrations in runoff water explain the modest increase in mass loss of n via surface runoff despite the large increase in surface runoff induced by cd the increase in predicted denitrification rates caused by cd resulted in a slight decrease in the predicted concentration of no3 n in groundwater 5 reduction and a corresponding reduction in predicted no3 n mass losses via vertical seepage despite the modest increase in vertical seepage flux these simulation results compare well to results of drainmod nii simulation by skaggs et al 2012 who assessed cd performance for an agricultural field in springfield illinois they reported 10 8kgnha 1 reduction in n leaching losses via subsurface drainage under cd conditions 33 reduction the majority of n that did not leave the field via subsurface drainage were denitrified 71 or lost via surface runoff 16 while simulated cd effect on plant uptake mineralization deep seepage as well as flow weighted no3 n concentration were insignificant similar to the simulated hydrology for the 48 sites cd was most effective in reducing n drainage losses at the south and southeast locations and least effective at the north and northwest locations the largest predicted reduction in n drainage losses occurred at memphis tennessee at this location cd reduced n drainage loss by 31 8kgnha 1yr 1 47 and n losses via vertical seepage by 0 5kgnha 1yr 1 14 and increased denitrification by 20 3kgnha 1yr 1 98 n plant uptake by 3 9kgnha 1yr 1 3 and n losses via surface runoff by 3 8kgnha 1yr 1 317 the least reduction in n drainage losses occurred at fargo north dakota at this location cd reduced n drainage loss by 1 4kgnha 1yr 1 12 and n losses via vertical seepage by 0 3kgnha 1yr 1 10 3 and increased denitrification by 1 5kgnha 1yr 1 20 n plant uptake by 0 6kgnha 1yr 1 0 5 and n losses via surface runoff by 0 2kgnha 1yr 1 11 the declining trend in predicted annual denitrification from the southern to the northern locations of the midwest region may be attributed to the lower temperature and less precipitation at the northern locations denitrification reaction proceeds at slower rates at lower temperature also the anaerobic conditions at the shallow soil profile which favors denitrification is expected to occur less frequently as precipitation decreases the long term averages of drainmod nii predictions of annual losses of n across the 48 locations were used to formulate linear regression models for estimating these losses across the midwest region the annual average of daily minimum temperature annual precipitation and annual application rate of nitrogen fertilizer were found to have statistically significant effects on estimating annual n losses via drainage flow under both fd and cd scenarios the developed regression equations are as follows 3 nloss fd 30 52 2 7046 t 0 2768 r 0 1817 n fer 4 nloss cd 13 45 1 6662 t 0 0972 r 0 1286 n fer where nloss fd and nloss cd are the annual losses via drain flow under fd and cd scenarios respectively kgnha 1 yr 1 t is the long term average of minimum daily temperature c r is annual precipitation cm yr 1 and n fer is the annual rate of n fertilizer application kgnha 1 yr 1 the r 2 values for eqs 3 and 4 were 0 91 indicating that the three explanatory variables used to formulate the regression equations are adequate predictors of the response variable drainmod and drainmod n ii predicted that the implementation of cd across the 48 locations will reduce on average over the 25 simulated years drain flow by 30 and reduce n drainage loss by 32 for the memphis location where cd was predicted to be most effective percent reductions in drain flow and n drainage losses were 45 and 47 respectively these predictions support the hypothesis that cd does not significantly change nitrogen concentration in drainage water and thus the percent reduction in n drainage loss can be approximated by the percent reduction in drain flow the predicted change in n cycling caused by cd indicates that the modest changes in n concentration in drainage water does not necessarily mean that the practice has a little impact on n dynamics in the system this set of simulations clearly predicts that cd increases denitrification and subsequently reduces no3 concentration in groundwater at the same time model predictions indicate that percent reductions in drain flow and n drainage losses are nearly equal on a percentage basis which is consistent with the results of field experiments on cd skaggs et al 2012 however field experiments to date have not included a detailed study and accounting of n fate and internal cycling in the soil water plant system as affected by cd the experimental verification of the predicted effect of cd on n balance for crop production systems on drained land would require a side by side comparison of both cd and fd scenarios involving extensive measurements of mineral n concentrations in the root zone in the shallow groundwater at different depths and in drainage outflow these experiments need to be conducted for a long enough time to capture the response of the system to changes in precipitation cropping system and n fertilization due primarily to limitations in the level of financial support required none of the field experiments conducted on cd have included sufficiently intensive measurements over the time and range of conditions necessary to explain with certainty the effects of cd on n fate in drained cropland 3 3 comparison between drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat predictions 3 3 1 model predictions of water and nitrogen budgets for the corn soybean agricultural system in iowa as stated earlier modeling the cd performance across midwestern u s using the two models followed the same approach and used input parameters that were obtained through the calibration and validation of both models using the same data set this data set was collected for a corn soybean agricultural system on tile drained soil in central iowa u s before comparing the predictions of the two models across the 48 locations a brief summary of the calibration and validation conducted by thorp et al 2009 for both models using the ten year iowa data set is given as it is relevant to the comparison of their predictions of cd performance across the entire midwest region the water budgets predicted by the two models were similar but drainmod predicted more surface runoff and less deep seepage than rzwqm thorp et al 2009 over the ten year simulation period both models predicted that annual et and subsurface drainage represent 65 and 25 of annual precipitation respectively drainmod predicted a total of 36mm 4 7 surface runoff and 39mm 5 0 vertical seepage rzwqm predictions of total surface runoff and vertical seepage were 19mm 2 5 and 45mm 5 9 respectively statistical performance measures were similar for both models indicating good agreement between measured and predicted drain flows drainmod s modeling efficiency values for predicting annual drain flow during calibration and validation periods were 0 92 and 0 91 respectively indicating consistent model performance during both calibration and validation periods the corresponding modeling efficiency values of rzwqm were 0 98 and 0 82 indicating more accurate predictions during calibration years and relatively less accurate predictions during validation years for the nitrogen simulations drainmod nii predictions of n losses via subsurface drainage were more accurate than the values predicted by rzwqm dssat model thorp et al 2009 the modeling efficiency values for drainmod nii predictions of annual mass losses of nitrate via subsurface drainage during calibration and validation years were 0 94 and 0 95 respectively the corresponding modeling efficiency values of rzwqm predictions dropped from 0 92 during calibration years to 0 21 during validation years drainmod nii was capable of accurately predicting the fluctuation in annual n drainage losses as influenced by variability in precipitation for the simulated corn soybean production system compared to rzwqm dssat model drainmod nii predicted higher n losses via subsurface drainage surface runoff and denitrification higher mineral n input through mineralization and lower n fixation and n losses via deep seepage and ammonia volatilization thorp et al 2009 3 3 2 model predictions of water and nitrogen budgets across midwestern u s both drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat predicted a declining trend in the effectiveness of cd from the south to the north within the u s midwest region the two models however differed substantially in the predicted magnitude of reduction in both annual drain flow and n drainage loss drainmod predicted that cd would reduce average annual drain flow by a range of 19 45 with an overall average of 30 across the region in contrast rzwqm dssat predicted much larger reductions in annual drain flow ranging from 35 to 68 with an average of 53 across the region average reductions in annual n mass loadings predicted by drainmod nii ranged from 12 to 47 with an overall average of 32 across the region similar to drainage predictions predicted reductions in annual n mass loadings by rzwqm dssat were much larger than drainmod nii predictions ranging from 33 to 58 with an overall average of 51 across the 48 locations examining the water and nitrogen budgets predicted by both models under fd and cd scenarios should explain why the two models differed substantially in predicting cd performance across the midwest drainmod and rzwqm predictions of annual drainage flow closely matched under fd scenario fig 3 a paired two sample t test indicated that the differences between drainage flow predictions of the two models were statistically insignificant p 0 3807 0 05 on average across the 48 locations drainage flow predictions of drainmod and rzwqm were 27 9 and 28 3cmyr 1 respectively under this scenario both models predicted a small contribution of the surface runoff to the water balance drainmod predicted 3 9cmyr 1 and rzwqm predicted 2 6cmyr 1 however et and deep seepage predictions of the two models were quite different drainmod predicted average annual et of 51 9cm and deep seepage of 3 9cm rzwqm predicted less et 46 8cmyr 1 and about three times more seepage 11 6cmyr 1 than drainmod not only were seepage predictions by rzwqm much higher but also they exhibited much larger variation across locations than drainmod predictions fig 4 a under cd scenario rzwqm consistently predicted much less drainage than drainmod fig 3b which led to predicting much larger reductions in drainage flow fig 3c this is supported by the results of the t test which indicates a statistically significant difference p 0 001 between the drainage flows predicted by the two models under cd scenario this is primarily because of differences in model predictions of surface runoff and et on average across the 48 locations rzwqm predicted that cd increased surface runoff by 8 5cmyr 1 from 2 6cmyr 1 to 11 1cmyr 1 on the other hand drainmod predicted that cd would increase surface runoff by only 4 8cmyr 1 from 3 9cmyr 1 to 8 7cmyr 1 these differences in the simulated cd impact on surface runoff are mainly attributed to the fact that the former model does consider ponded conditions or surface storage fig 3b shows that the deviation between drainage flow predictions by the two models under cd scenario become more pronounced as the drainage flow increases under cd scenario relatively high drainage flow is most likely accompanied by high water table depth and surface runoff since rzwqm does not represent surface storage this model is expected to over predict surface runoff and under predicted subsurface drainage under these conditions evapotranspiration predictions by the two models for fd and cd scenarios were somewhat different presumably due to different approaches implemented in each model to simulate et on average across the 48 locations drainmod predicted 2 7cm increase in et compared to 5 2cm higher et predicted by rzwqm despite the substantial difference in annual vertical seepage predicted by the two models for fd both models predicted that cd would increase vertical seepage by only 1 1 5cmyr 1 according to these predictions cd does not substantially increase vertical seepage for the soil and boundary conditions considered in this simulation study however the effect of cd on seepage may be considerable for other soils skaggs et al 2010 the box plot shown in fig 4b visually compares the different components of the water balance predicted by the two models under cd scenario similar to annual drainage predictions rzwqm dssat predicted larger reductions in annual n loss associated with cd compared to drainmod nii predictions fig 3f unlike drainage predictions however these larger reductions where caused by differences in model predictions of n losses under both fd and cd scenarios this is supported by the results of the paired two sample t tests showing that n drainage losses predicted by the two models were statistically significantly different under both fd p 0 001 and cd p 0 001 scenarios rzwqm dssat predicted higher n losses under fd scenario fig 3d and lower losses under cd scenario fig 3e rzwqm dssat predicted substantially higher plant uptake than drainmod nii 90kgnha 1yr 1 under fd and 94kgnha 1yr 1 under cd fig 5 which is consistent with the results of thorp et al 2008 who stated that the overestimated n removal in corn grain predictions of rzwqm dssat is one of the issues that limited the reliability of its crop growth simulations compared with rzwqm dssat drainmod nii predicted that cd would increase denitrification at relatively higher rates drainmod nii predicted that implementation of cd would increase denitrification from 11kgnha 1 to 19kgnha 1 according to rzwqm dssat predictions the implementation of cd would increase denitrification from 13kgnha 1 to 18kgnha 1 additionally the discrepancies in predicted nitrogen loadings were also driven by the discrepancies in drain flow predictions 4 conclusion the field scale hydrologic models drainmod and drainmod nii were used to simulate the effect of cd on the hydrology and n dynamics for 48 sites across midwestern united states the average reduction in subsurface drainage was 29 4 and the average reduction in n drainage losses was 32 3 across the region the results indicated that the effect of cd on hydrology and nitrogen losses to surface waters differed spatially within the region the minimum effect of cd on both hydrology and n losses was 1 4cmyr 1 23 reduction in subsurface drainage flow and 1 5kgnha 1yr 1 12 4 reduction in n losses in drainage water occurred at the most northern site fargo nd the maximum effect occurred at the most southern site memphis tn where predicted subsurface drainage was reduced by 26 7cmyr 1 45 3 and n loss via drainage water by 31 8kgnha 1yr 1 46 8 the predicted large reductions in drainage flow at the southern sites were accompanied by relatively large increase in surface runoff which could lead to soil erosion and transport of sediment and phosphorus to receiving streams thus care should be taken when managing the drainage control structures at sites that are prone to soil erosion the results of drainmod were compared to the results obtained by rzwqm thorp et al 2008 for the same sites under the same conditions although effects of cd on both drainage volumes and n losses predicted by rzwqm were larger than those predicted by drainmod the two models predicted similar trends across the region the differences in predictions of drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat are attributed to structural differences in both models which differed in representing some of the key processes affecting the hydrology and n dynamics including et surface runoff denitrification and n uptake the results of this study can be used to inform policy makers government agencies and other stakeholders on where the practice can be implemented and what would be the expected long term performance of implementing the practice at a specific geographic location within the u s midwest region 
11583,controlled drainage cd has recently been proposed as a best management practice for reducing nutrient export from drained cropland in the u s midwest to the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico we conducted a 25 year simulation study using the hydrological model drainmod and the carbon and nitrogen n model drainmod nii to evaluate the performance of cd at 48 locations across the u s midwest hydrological and nitrogen predictions of this simulation study were compared to rzwqm dssat predictions by thorp et al 2008 simulation results showed that cd reduced annual subsurface drainage by 86mm 30 and annual n drainage losses by 10 9kgnha 1 32 on average over the 48 sites drainmod predicted highest reductions in drain flow at the south and southeast locations and lowest reductions at the northwest locations the large reductions in drain flow in the south and southeast locations resulted in a large increase in surface runoff which could increase soil erosion and sediment transport to surface water in the north and northwest locations the smaller amount of water that did not pass through the drainage system because of cd was primarily lost as evapotranspiration drainmod nii predictions of annual reductions in n drainage loss followed the same trend of annual reductions in drainage flow drainmod nii predictions show that reductions in n drainage loss under cd were mainly attributed to increase in denitrification the declining trend in predicted annual denitrification from the southern to the northern locations of the midwest region is most likely attributed to the lower temperature and less precipitation at the northern locations rzwqm dssat predicted reductions in annual drainage and n loss under cd conditions showed a similar trend to drainmod drainmod nii predictions rzwqm dssat however predicted substantially higher reductions in both drain flow regional average of 151mmyr 1 53 and n drainage losses regional average of 18 9kgnha 1 yr 1 51 the discrepancies between drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat predictions of annual reductions in drain flow and n loss under cd conditions were caused by differences in model predictions of individual components of the water and nitrogen balances under both free drainage and controlled drainage scenarios overall this simulation study showed that climate variation across the region has a substantial impact on cd efficacy for reducing n drainage loss keywords agricultural drainage controlled drainage drainmod drainmod nii rzwqm dssat nitrogen losses 1 introduction agricultural drainage is essential for crop production on over 40 million ha or about 25 of cropland in the united states drainage improves trafficability providing timely access for performing field operations such as tillage planting and harvesting more importantly drainage removes excess water in the plant root zone minimizing plant stress due to excess water and improving crop yield evans and fausey 1999 subsurface drainage also reduces surface runoff sediment losses and the movement of contaminants attached to the sediment such as pesticides and phosphorus into surface waters skaggs et al 1994 drainage however significantly alters the hydrology and nitrogen n cycling in naturally poorly drained soils it lowers the water table and increases soil aeration which increases soil organic matter decomposition and associated n mineralization immobilization and decreases denitrification the net result of artificial drainage is an increase in subsurface drainage flow rates and n leaching losses to receiving surface waters nitrogen n losses from drained cropland in the u s midwest have been identified as one of the main sources of n leading to the hypoxic conditions in the gulf of mexico petrolia and gowda 2006 turner et al 2008 rabalais et al 2007 2014 there are over 16 million ha of artificially drained land in crop production in the midwest with five states illinois indiana iowa ohio and minnesota accounting for over 50 of the u s land planted to corn and soybean petrolia and gowda 2006 nitrogen losses from drained corn and soybean fields in the midwest states make up a significant portion of the estimated 1 6 million metric tons of n discharged annually into the gulf of mexico scavia et al 2004 turner and rabalais 2003 achieving sustainability of crop production on drained land hinges upon the adoption of effective and economically feasible management practices that minimize nutrient export from drained lands without adversely affecting crop yield or increasing production cost drainage water management dwm also referred to as controlled drainage cd is a promising practice that is recently proposed as a best management practice bmp for reducing n export from drained cropland in midwestern u s controlled drainage involves the use of an overflow control device drainage water control structure or flashboard riser at the drainage outlet that regulates the drainage intensity by raising and lowering the drainage outlet to better match the need for drainage in the agricultural field this drainage water control mechanism reduces drainage volumes which decreases the edge of field mass loss of n to receiving surface waters evans et al 1995 evans and skaggs 2004 skaggs et al 2010 skaggs et al 2012 additionally cd raises the water table increasing anaerobic conditions in the soil profile which favors denitrification wesström and messing 2007 skaggs et al 2010 lastly it has been observed that careful management of cd systems during the crop growing season could lead to increasing crop yield and n uptake especially under dry conditions poole et al 2013 achieving the yield benefits of cd requires proper management of the drainage systems during the growing season to avoid potential yield losses due to excessive water stresses the water quality benefits of cd are mostly achieved by managing the drainage outlets during late fall winter and early spring when the practice has little or no effect on crop yield the practice is applicable to both open ditch and subsurface tile drainage systems research conducted in the late 1970 s and 1980 s have shown that cd can substantially reduce the export of n and p to surface water from drained lands in the north carolina atlantic coastal plains by over 40 and 25 respectively gilliam et al 1979 skaggs and gilliam 1981 evans et al 1995 as a result of this research cd was accepted in the mid 1980s as a best management practice bmp for reducing nutrient losses to surface waters with the control structures cost shared by the state of north carolina recently the natural resources conservation service nrcs of the u s department of agriculture has launched a national initiative for large scale adoption and implementation of cd in the midwest to reduce n export from drained cropland to the mississippi river basin the performance of cd depends upon several factors including climatological conditions precipitation and temperature soil type soil texture and organic matter content topography cropping system and farming practices crop rotation fertilization tillage and drainage system design drain depth and spacing thus the effectiveness of cd is expected to vary from location to location and from year to year so the reported performance of cd in the u s southeast cannot be simply extrapolated to other geographic regions such as the u s midwest moreover the magnitude of n losses in drainage water and the effect of cd on those losses are expected to vary among locations within the midwest region the hydrological and water quality effects of cd are not well documented for the drained cropland of the u s midwest in illinois pitts et al 2004 reported 40 reduction in n drainage loss caused by implementing cd practice in ohio fausey 2005 found that cd reduced drainage outflows by 41 and n losses by 46 more recently field experiments have been conducted at several locations across the midwest to study the effects of cd on n losses from drained croplands to surface waters e g adeuya et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 gunn et al 2015 these studies reported that cd reduces annual drainage flow and no3 n losses by 17 up to 90 this large variation in cropping system response to cd was mainly attributed to spatial and temporal variations in weather differences in soil types and the level of management of the control structures in each experimental site despite this effort the long term impacts of the large scale application of cd across midwestern u s cannot be assessed by field experiments only computer simulation models can be cost effective and reliable tools for assessing the performance of cd as influenced by climatological soil and management factors ale et al 2009 simulated the effect of cd on hydrology and crop yield at the purdue university water quality field station wqfs using the drainage water management model drainmod model predictions showed that cd reduced annual drainage by 60 with no significant effect on crop yield ale et al 2009 thorp et al 2008 used the rzwqm dssat model calibrated for a corn and soybean production system on a subsurface drained iowa soil to simulate the performance of cd using 25 years of climatological data for 48 locations across the midwest their analysis showed that cd has a high impact on reducing both drain flow 35 68 and n drainage losses 33 51 this paper reports on a simulation study using the hydrological model drainmod and the carbon and nitrogen companion model drainmod n ii to evaluate the performance of cd across midwestern u s at the same 48 locations previously simulated by thorp et al 2008 using the rzwqm dssat model the performance of the practice predicted by the drainmod suite of models was compared to cd performance predicted by the rzwqm dssat model thorp et al 2008 the performance of cd across the u s midwest predicted by the two widely used models drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat would provide information critically needed for supporting the recent initiatives for the large scale implementation of cd in the midwest to reduce nitrogen loss from drained cropland to the mississippi river basin these model predictions along with the results of available short term experiments will help make guided decisions on where in the midwest cd would be most effective and economically feasible 2 materials and methods 2 1 drainmod description drainmod skaggs 1980 is a field scale hydrological model that was developed in early 1980s to simulate the hydrology of poorly drained high water table soils it uses the water balance approach with functional relationships to describe the main hydrological processes and predict infiltration evapotranspiration water table fluctuation subsurface drainage surface runoff and lateral and vertical seepage in response to given climatological conditions crop rotation soil type and drainage system design and management the model predicts infiltration using the green ampt equation subsurface drainage is calculated using the hooghoudt s equation when the water table is below the surface and kirkham s equations for ponded surface conditions surface runoff is estimated as the difference between rates of precipitation and infiltration once site specific surface depressional storage is filled skaggs 1999 daily potential et pet can be computed by the model using the temperature based thornthwaite method or estimated by the user using any pet method and provided to the model as an input data file the model simulates heat flow using finite difference solution to the heat equation and predicts the temperature distribution throughout the soil profile this enables the model to simulate hydrological processes in cold regions such as midwestern u s which is influenced by soil freezing and thawing and snow accumulation and melt luo et al 2000 the model uses the empirical stress day index approach to simulate the effect of excess and deficit soil water stresses on crop yield skaggs et al 2012 drainmod is easy to use requires relatively few inputs and yet provides quite accurate predictions the model has been widely used to study the effects of drainage design and management on crop yields e g evans et al 1991 wang et al 2006 thorp et al 2009 erosion e g saleh 1994 hydrology of high water table soils e g fouss et al 1987 skaggs et al 1981 wang et al 2006 thorp et al 2009 luo et al 2010 and wetland hydrology e g skaggs et al 2005 jia and luo 2006 a detailed description of drainmod is given by skaggs et al 2012 2 2 drainmod nii description drainmod nii youssef 2003 youssef et al 2005 is a field scale process based model that simulates carbon c and n dynamics in drained cropland for a wide range of soil types climatic conditions and farming practices drainmod nii is a companion model to drainmod it simulates organic carbon oc dynamics using a c cycle adapted from the century model parton et al 1993 the soil c is represented by three soil organic matter pools active slow and passive two above and below ground residue pools metabolic and structural and a surface microbial pool each organic matter pool is characterized by oc content potential rate of decomposition and carbon to nitrogen ratio organic c decomposition is assumed to follow first order kinetics the model simulates a detailed n cycle that represents both mineral n nitrate and ammoniacal forms and organic n on and their interaction as affected by c cycling the model simulates wet atmospheric deposition application of mineral n fertilizers application of organic n sources such as plant residue and animal manure plant n uptake n mineralization and immobilization nitrification denitrification ammonia volatilization and n losses via subsurface drainage deep seepage and surface runoff nitrogen reactive transport is simulated using a multiphase form of the one dimensional advection dispersion reaction adr equation model predictions include daily concentrations of mineral n i e no3 and nh4 in soil solution and drainage outflow oc content of the top 20cm soil layer and cumulative rates of simulated n processes on daily monthly and annual basis drainmod nii has recently been applied successfully to a range of soils and locations across the u s north carolina youssef et al 2006 iowa thorp et al 2009 illinois david et al 2009 minnesota luo et al 2010 and indiana ale et al 2012 and europe germany bechtold et al 2007 and sweden salazar et al 2009 2 3 simulation approach thorp et al 2007 evaluated the performance of the rzwqm dssat model using ten years of measured hydrologic water quality and crop yield data for a corn soybean agricultural system on tile drained silty clay loam clay loam soils in central iowa u s 42 2 n 93 6 w during the ten year study period controlled drainage was not implemented on the research site meaning the outlets of the tile drains remained open during the entire period thorp et al 2009 then evaluated the performance of drainmod and drainmod nii models using the same data set as part of the model evaluation thorp et al 2009 compared the performances of rzwqm dssat and drainmod drainmod nii thorp et al 2008 used the rzwq dssat model calibrated for the iowa corn soybean production system thorp et al 2007 to simulate the performance of cd as affected by differences in climatic conditions crop planting and harvesting dates and n fertilization rates across the u s midwest they conducted the simulations using 30 years of historical climate data 1961 1990 for 48 locations across the midwest fig 1 due to limitations in the interface of rzwqm dssat model thorp et al 2008 dropped the first 5 years of the simulations from the analysis following the same modeling approach by thorp et al 2008 we used drainmod and drainmod nii models calibrated for the iowa crop production system thorp et al 2009 to conduct a thirty year simulation 1961 1990 of the hydrology c and n dynamics and crop yields for each of the 48 midwestern locations fig 1 under both free drainage fd and cd scenarios for the same soil type crop rotation and drainage design across different sites this approach was followed to focus on the effect of geographic location on the performance of cd across midwestern u s using the calibrated parameters for the iowa site which were obtained by thorp et al 2009 enabled us to compare cd performance predicted by the two models drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat the simulated soil consisted of an organic matter rich surface soil with a relatively poorly drained deep soil profile underlain by a semi impermeable layer allowing for vertical downward seepage into the groundwater aquifer key model inputs characterizing soil properties were set similar to values used by thorp et al 2009 the simulated drainage system consists of subsurface drains 145cm deep spaced 27 4m apart maximum surface storage a parameter that controls surface runoff rates was set to 0 5cm assuming a good surface leveling table 1 lists key model inputs characterizing drainage system design soil properties and snow accumulation and melt processes the simulated cropping system includes corn planted in even years and soybean planted in odd years simulated planting and harvesting dates table 2 were based on the state and county level national agricultural statistics service nass data for crop development and management across the region usda 2007 for the cd scenario the overflow level of the drainage water control structure was set to a depth of 30cm during fall winter and early spring four weeks before planting the overflow level was lowered to the drain depth 145cm three weeks after planting the level was raised to a depth of 60cm and remained at this depth during the crop growing season two weeks before harvesting the overflow level was lowered again to the drain depth and one week after harvesting the overflow level of the structure was raised to the off growing season depth of 30cm this is a typical management scheme to reduce drainage intensity when the land is fallow operate the drainage system at maximum capacity to provide trafficable conditions for field operations e g planting and harvesting and provide adequate drainage during the crop growing season ale et al 2012 the levels of the control structure and the timing of adjusting these levels may slightly vary the timings and the levels used in this study were selected to match the timings and levels used by thorp et al 2008 to allow for comparison between predictions of drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm models thirty years of historical measured climate data 1961 1990 including hourly precipitation in addition to daily minimum and maximum temperatures wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity were obtained from the national solar radiation database nrel 1995 these climatological data were used to calculate the daily pet according to the fao pennman monteith method allen et al 1998 which are saved in drainmod compatible input files similarly model inputs required to simulate nitrogen and carbon dynamics were set according to thorp et al 2009 table 3 lists key input parameters of drainmod nii fertilization and tillage management were set to describe common practices implemented for different locations during corn years nitrogen fertilizer was applied seven days before planting at rates equal to the five year 2001 2006 average table 2 according to the data retrieved by thorp et al 2008 from the usda economic research service usda 2008 tillage practices were set similar among the 48 sites and comprised spring field cultivator operations for site preparation one day before planting and fall tillage consisted of chisel plowing following harvest operations 2 4 comparison to rzwqm dssat as stated earlier rzwqm dssat was previously used to assess cd performance across the same 48 sites fig 1 for the same climate time span thorp et al 2008 results of rzwqm dssat simulations published by thorp et al 2008 were compared to drainmod and drainmod nii predictions obtained in this study this section provides a brief comparison between the two models highlighting the similarities and differences in simulating key hydrological and biogeochemical processes understanding these similarities and differences is helpful for comparing cd performance predicted by both models and explaining the differences in these predictions similar to drainmod rzwqm dssat simulates infiltration of water into the soil profile using green ampt equation deep seepage using darcy s equation and simulates tile drainage using hooghoudt equation on the other hand rzwqm dssat applies a numerical solution to richards equation in order to compute soil water distribution in the vadose zone which is different from the empirical drained to equilibrium approach implemented in drainmod the former model uses the shuttleworth wallace pet method farahani and decoursey 2000 while the later model uses either thornthwaite method with monthly correction factors or as was the case in this application reads daily pet input calculated outside the model using any pet method in addition rzwqm dssat does not simulate storage of water on the soil surface rather water that exceeds macropore infiltration is considered runoff the plant growth component of the rzwqm dssat is a deterministic process based module adapted from the widely used dssat crop models these crop modules simulate on a day by day basis plant growth rate and mass accumulation and allocation as affected by temperature soil water and nutrient status as well as atmospheric co2 concentration drainmod simulation of crop yields is based on the empirical stress day index approach the recently upgraded version of drainmod drainmod dssat negm et al 2014 was not used in the current study rzwqm dssat differs from drainmod nii simulations of carbon and nitrogen dynamics rzwqm dssat applies the o rganic m atter and n itrogen omni module developed by shaffer et al 2000 nitrogen transport within rzwqm dssat is simulated using sequential partial piston displacement and mixing approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated effect of controlled drainage on hydrology table 4 summarizes the results of drainmod hydrological simulations for the 48 locations averaged over the 25 year simulation period as expected the model predicted that cd would decrease subsurface drainage and increase surface runoff evapotranspiration and vertical seepage compared to conventional drainage with unmanaged outlets fd model predictions show that cd reduced annual subsurface drainage by 8 6cmyr 1 30 on average over the 48 sites the model predicted a corresponding increase in surface runoff by 4 8cmyr 1 123 evapotranspiration by 2 7cmyr 1 5 and vertical seepage by 0 9cmyr 1 23 of the 8 6cmyr 1 that did not pass through the drainage system because of cd 56 was lost as surface runoff 31 was lost as evapotranspiration and 10 was lost via deep seepage the predicted average water balance for the fd scenario indicated that 31 8 4 5 59 2 and 4 5 of the 88cm yearly average precipitation were lost via subsurface drainage surface runoff evapotranspiration and vertical seepage respectively the corresponding predicted average water balance for the cd scenario shows a substantial decrease in subsurface drainage 22 1 of precipitation compensated for by a substantial increase in surface runoff 10 of precipitation and a slight increase in both evapotranspiration 62 5 of precipitation and vertical seepage 5 5 of precipitation controlled drainage was most effective in reducing drain flow at the south and southeast locations fig 2 a the highest simulated reduction in drain flow occurred in memphis tennessee table 4 for this location cd reduced drain flow by 26 7cmyr 1 45 and increased surface runoff et and vertical seepage by 18 8cmyr 1 355 6 6cmyr 1 11 and 1 2cmyr 1 29 respectively the second highest simulated reduction in drain flow occurred in evansville indiana implementing cd at this location reduced drain flow by 16 3cmyr 1 39 and increased surface runoff et and vertical seepage by 10 8cmyr 1 292 4 2cmyr 1 7 and 1 1cmyr 1 28 respectively the lowest simulated reduction in drain flow of 19 occurred at northwest locations in both sioux city iowa and sioux falls south dakota fig 2a and table 4 for the sioux city location cd slightly reduced drain flow by 2 3cmyr 1 and slightly increased surface runoff et and vertical seepage by 0 2cmyr 1 12 1 5cmyr 1 3 and 0 6cmyr 1 17 respectively the predicted fate of the water that did not pass through the drainage system under cd conditions varied across the region the large reductions in drain flow associated with implementing cd in the south and southeast locations resulted in a large increase in surface runoff and only a modest increase in vertical seepage for example cd reduced drain flow at the memphis location by 26 7cmyr 1 of this amount 70 was lost by surface runoff 25 was lost through et and only 5 was lost through vertical seepage the large increase in surface runoff could have negative impacts due to increased soil erosion and transport of sediment and contaminants attached to sediment including phosphorus and pesticides in the north and northwest locations where cd is relatively less effective drain flow reductions 20 the water that did not pass through the drainage system because of cd was primarily lost through et of the 2 3cmyr 1 reduction in drain flow due to implementing cd at sioux city 65 was lost through et 26 was lost through vertical seepage and only 9 was lost via surface runoff these results indicate that cd does not significantly increase vertical seepage for this soil and boundary conditions as was hypothesized by skaggs et al 2010 for a site in north carolina these findings however cannot be generalized as the effect of cd on field hydrology varies with soil type and boundary conditions on the site another simulation study with different soils would be very useful in assessing the effect of cd on field hydrology and especially on vertical seepage for different soils overall it is clear that climate variation across the region has a substantial impact on cd efficacy for reducing drainage flow normally higher annual precipitation and average annual temperatures were associated with higher drainage rates as well as higher flow reductions under the cd scenario in the south and southeast locations fig 2 flow reductions in the north and northwest locations were significantly lower due to lower annual precipitation and prolonged freezing fallow periods november till early march when cd is mostly applied for water quality benefits drainmod hydrological predictions were used to develop linear regression equations for estimating long term average annual drainage flow under fd and cd scenarios across the midwest region eqs 1 and 2 precipitation was found to be the only explanatory variable that has statistically significant effect on predicting drainage flow the r2 values were 0 95 and 0 89 for the regression equations of fd and cd scenarios respectively indicating that precipitation is an adequate predictor of drainage flow across the midwest region it should be noted that the simulations were conducted with one drainage intensity drain depth and spacing drainage intensity would likely also significantly impact annual subsurface drainage if it had been tested 1 dfd 29 67 0 6548 r 2 dcd 13 92 0 3775 r where dfd and dcd are the long term average annual drainage cmyr 1 under fd and cd scenarios respectively and r is the long term average annual precipitation cmyr 1 3 2 simulated effects of controlled drainage on nitrogen cycle the results of drainmod nii nitrogen simulations for the 48 sites are presented in table 5 on average across the 48 locations model predictions show that cd reduced n drainage losses by 10 9kgnha 1 yr 1 32 increased denitrification by 8 0kgnha 1 yr 1 73 increased plant uptake by 0 9kgnha 1 yr 1 0 65 increased n losses via surface runoff by 1 3kgnha 1 yr 1 76 and slightly decreased n losses via vertical seepage by 0 4kgnha 1 yr 1 12 the predicted fate of the 10 9kgnha 1 yr 1 reduction was as follows 73 was denitrified 12 was lost via surface runoff and 4 was lost via deep seepage practically cd did not affect n plant uptake and net n mineralization these simulation results support the hypothesis that cd increases the anaerobic conditions in the soil profile promoting denitrification and reducing n leaching losses the small n concentrations in runoff water explain the modest increase in mass loss of n via surface runoff despite the large increase in surface runoff induced by cd the increase in predicted denitrification rates caused by cd resulted in a slight decrease in the predicted concentration of no3 n in groundwater 5 reduction and a corresponding reduction in predicted no3 n mass losses via vertical seepage despite the modest increase in vertical seepage flux these simulation results compare well to results of drainmod nii simulation by skaggs et al 2012 who assessed cd performance for an agricultural field in springfield illinois they reported 10 8kgnha 1 reduction in n leaching losses via subsurface drainage under cd conditions 33 reduction the majority of n that did not leave the field via subsurface drainage were denitrified 71 or lost via surface runoff 16 while simulated cd effect on plant uptake mineralization deep seepage as well as flow weighted no3 n concentration were insignificant similar to the simulated hydrology for the 48 sites cd was most effective in reducing n drainage losses at the south and southeast locations and least effective at the north and northwest locations the largest predicted reduction in n drainage losses occurred at memphis tennessee at this location cd reduced n drainage loss by 31 8kgnha 1yr 1 47 and n losses via vertical seepage by 0 5kgnha 1yr 1 14 and increased denitrification by 20 3kgnha 1yr 1 98 n plant uptake by 3 9kgnha 1yr 1 3 and n losses via surface runoff by 3 8kgnha 1yr 1 317 the least reduction in n drainage losses occurred at fargo north dakota at this location cd reduced n drainage loss by 1 4kgnha 1yr 1 12 and n losses via vertical seepage by 0 3kgnha 1yr 1 10 3 and increased denitrification by 1 5kgnha 1yr 1 20 n plant uptake by 0 6kgnha 1yr 1 0 5 and n losses via surface runoff by 0 2kgnha 1yr 1 11 the declining trend in predicted annual denitrification from the southern to the northern locations of the midwest region may be attributed to the lower temperature and less precipitation at the northern locations denitrification reaction proceeds at slower rates at lower temperature also the anaerobic conditions at the shallow soil profile which favors denitrification is expected to occur less frequently as precipitation decreases the long term averages of drainmod nii predictions of annual losses of n across the 48 locations were used to formulate linear regression models for estimating these losses across the midwest region the annual average of daily minimum temperature annual precipitation and annual application rate of nitrogen fertilizer were found to have statistically significant effects on estimating annual n losses via drainage flow under both fd and cd scenarios the developed regression equations are as follows 3 nloss fd 30 52 2 7046 t 0 2768 r 0 1817 n fer 4 nloss cd 13 45 1 6662 t 0 0972 r 0 1286 n fer where nloss fd and nloss cd are the annual losses via drain flow under fd and cd scenarios respectively kgnha 1 yr 1 t is the long term average of minimum daily temperature c r is annual precipitation cm yr 1 and n fer is the annual rate of n fertilizer application kgnha 1 yr 1 the r 2 values for eqs 3 and 4 were 0 91 indicating that the three explanatory variables used to formulate the regression equations are adequate predictors of the response variable drainmod and drainmod n ii predicted that the implementation of cd across the 48 locations will reduce on average over the 25 simulated years drain flow by 30 and reduce n drainage loss by 32 for the memphis location where cd was predicted to be most effective percent reductions in drain flow and n drainage losses were 45 and 47 respectively these predictions support the hypothesis that cd does not significantly change nitrogen concentration in drainage water and thus the percent reduction in n drainage loss can be approximated by the percent reduction in drain flow the predicted change in n cycling caused by cd indicates that the modest changes in n concentration in drainage water does not necessarily mean that the practice has a little impact on n dynamics in the system this set of simulations clearly predicts that cd increases denitrification and subsequently reduces no3 concentration in groundwater at the same time model predictions indicate that percent reductions in drain flow and n drainage losses are nearly equal on a percentage basis which is consistent with the results of field experiments on cd skaggs et al 2012 however field experiments to date have not included a detailed study and accounting of n fate and internal cycling in the soil water plant system as affected by cd the experimental verification of the predicted effect of cd on n balance for crop production systems on drained land would require a side by side comparison of both cd and fd scenarios involving extensive measurements of mineral n concentrations in the root zone in the shallow groundwater at different depths and in drainage outflow these experiments need to be conducted for a long enough time to capture the response of the system to changes in precipitation cropping system and n fertilization due primarily to limitations in the level of financial support required none of the field experiments conducted on cd have included sufficiently intensive measurements over the time and range of conditions necessary to explain with certainty the effects of cd on n fate in drained cropland 3 3 comparison between drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat predictions 3 3 1 model predictions of water and nitrogen budgets for the corn soybean agricultural system in iowa as stated earlier modeling the cd performance across midwestern u s using the two models followed the same approach and used input parameters that were obtained through the calibration and validation of both models using the same data set this data set was collected for a corn soybean agricultural system on tile drained soil in central iowa u s before comparing the predictions of the two models across the 48 locations a brief summary of the calibration and validation conducted by thorp et al 2009 for both models using the ten year iowa data set is given as it is relevant to the comparison of their predictions of cd performance across the entire midwest region the water budgets predicted by the two models were similar but drainmod predicted more surface runoff and less deep seepage than rzwqm thorp et al 2009 over the ten year simulation period both models predicted that annual et and subsurface drainage represent 65 and 25 of annual precipitation respectively drainmod predicted a total of 36mm 4 7 surface runoff and 39mm 5 0 vertical seepage rzwqm predictions of total surface runoff and vertical seepage were 19mm 2 5 and 45mm 5 9 respectively statistical performance measures were similar for both models indicating good agreement between measured and predicted drain flows drainmod s modeling efficiency values for predicting annual drain flow during calibration and validation periods were 0 92 and 0 91 respectively indicating consistent model performance during both calibration and validation periods the corresponding modeling efficiency values of rzwqm were 0 98 and 0 82 indicating more accurate predictions during calibration years and relatively less accurate predictions during validation years for the nitrogen simulations drainmod nii predictions of n losses via subsurface drainage were more accurate than the values predicted by rzwqm dssat model thorp et al 2009 the modeling efficiency values for drainmod nii predictions of annual mass losses of nitrate via subsurface drainage during calibration and validation years were 0 94 and 0 95 respectively the corresponding modeling efficiency values of rzwqm predictions dropped from 0 92 during calibration years to 0 21 during validation years drainmod nii was capable of accurately predicting the fluctuation in annual n drainage losses as influenced by variability in precipitation for the simulated corn soybean production system compared to rzwqm dssat model drainmod nii predicted higher n losses via subsurface drainage surface runoff and denitrification higher mineral n input through mineralization and lower n fixation and n losses via deep seepage and ammonia volatilization thorp et al 2009 3 3 2 model predictions of water and nitrogen budgets across midwestern u s both drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat predicted a declining trend in the effectiveness of cd from the south to the north within the u s midwest region the two models however differed substantially in the predicted magnitude of reduction in both annual drain flow and n drainage loss drainmod predicted that cd would reduce average annual drain flow by a range of 19 45 with an overall average of 30 across the region in contrast rzwqm dssat predicted much larger reductions in annual drain flow ranging from 35 to 68 with an average of 53 across the region average reductions in annual n mass loadings predicted by drainmod nii ranged from 12 to 47 with an overall average of 32 across the region similar to drainage predictions predicted reductions in annual n mass loadings by rzwqm dssat were much larger than drainmod nii predictions ranging from 33 to 58 with an overall average of 51 across the 48 locations examining the water and nitrogen budgets predicted by both models under fd and cd scenarios should explain why the two models differed substantially in predicting cd performance across the midwest drainmod and rzwqm predictions of annual drainage flow closely matched under fd scenario fig 3 a paired two sample t test indicated that the differences between drainage flow predictions of the two models were statistically insignificant p 0 3807 0 05 on average across the 48 locations drainage flow predictions of drainmod and rzwqm were 27 9 and 28 3cmyr 1 respectively under this scenario both models predicted a small contribution of the surface runoff to the water balance drainmod predicted 3 9cmyr 1 and rzwqm predicted 2 6cmyr 1 however et and deep seepage predictions of the two models were quite different drainmod predicted average annual et of 51 9cm and deep seepage of 3 9cm rzwqm predicted less et 46 8cmyr 1 and about three times more seepage 11 6cmyr 1 than drainmod not only were seepage predictions by rzwqm much higher but also they exhibited much larger variation across locations than drainmod predictions fig 4 a under cd scenario rzwqm consistently predicted much less drainage than drainmod fig 3b which led to predicting much larger reductions in drainage flow fig 3c this is supported by the results of the t test which indicates a statistically significant difference p 0 001 between the drainage flows predicted by the two models under cd scenario this is primarily because of differences in model predictions of surface runoff and et on average across the 48 locations rzwqm predicted that cd increased surface runoff by 8 5cmyr 1 from 2 6cmyr 1 to 11 1cmyr 1 on the other hand drainmod predicted that cd would increase surface runoff by only 4 8cmyr 1 from 3 9cmyr 1 to 8 7cmyr 1 these differences in the simulated cd impact on surface runoff are mainly attributed to the fact that the former model does consider ponded conditions or surface storage fig 3b shows that the deviation between drainage flow predictions by the two models under cd scenario become more pronounced as the drainage flow increases under cd scenario relatively high drainage flow is most likely accompanied by high water table depth and surface runoff since rzwqm does not represent surface storage this model is expected to over predict surface runoff and under predicted subsurface drainage under these conditions evapotranspiration predictions by the two models for fd and cd scenarios were somewhat different presumably due to different approaches implemented in each model to simulate et on average across the 48 locations drainmod predicted 2 7cm increase in et compared to 5 2cm higher et predicted by rzwqm despite the substantial difference in annual vertical seepage predicted by the two models for fd both models predicted that cd would increase vertical seepage by only 1 1 5cmyr 1 according to these predictions cd does not substantially increase vertical seepage for the soil and boundary conditions considered in this simulation study however the effect of cd on seepage may be considerable for other soils skaggs et al 2010 the box plot shown in fig 4b visually compares the different components of the water balance predicted by the two models under cd scenario similar to annual drainage predictions rzwqm dssat predicted larger reductions in annual n loss associated with cd compared to drainmod nii predictions fig 3f unlike drainage predictions however these larger reductions where caused by differences in model predictions of n losses under both fd and cd scenarios this is supported by the results of the paired two sample t tests showing that n drainage losses predicted by the two models were statistically significantly different under both fd p 0 001 and cd p 0 001 scenarios rzwqm dssat predicted higher n losses under fd scenario fig 3d and lower losses under cd scenario fig 3e rzwqm dssat predicted substantially higher plant uptake than drainmod nii 90kgnha 1yr 1 under fd and 94kgnha 1yr 1 under cd fig 5 which is consistent with the results of thorp et al 2008 who stated that the overestimated n removal in corn grain predictions of rzwqm dssat is one of the issues that limited the reliability of its crop growth simulations compared with rzwqm dssat drainmod nii predicted that cd would increase denitrification at relatively higher rates drainmod nii predicted that implementation of cd would increase denitrification from 11kgnha 1 to 19kgnha 1 according to rzwqm dssat predictions the implementation of cd would increase denitrification from 13kgnha 1 to 18kgnha 1 additionally the discrepancies in predicted nitrogen loadings were also driven by the discrepancies in drain flow predictions 4 conclusion the field scale hydrologic models drainmod and drainmod nii were used to simulate the effect of cd on the hydrology and n dynamics for 48 sites across midwestern united states the average reduction in subsurface drainage was 29 4 and the average reduction in n drainage losses was 32 3 across the region the results indicated that the effect of cd on hydrology and nitrogen losses to surface waters differed spatially within the region the minimum effect of cd on both hydrology and n losses was 1 4cmyr 1 23 reduction in subsurface drainage flow and 1 5kgnha 1yr 1 12 4 reduction in n losses in drainage water occurred at the most northern site fargo nd the maximum effect occurred at the most southern site memphis tn where predicted subsurface drainage was reduced by 26 7cmyr 1 45 3 and n loss via drainage water by 31 8kgnha 1yr 1 46 8 the predicted large reductions in drainage flow at the southern sites were accompanied by relatively large increase in surface runoff which could lead to soil erosion and transport of sediment and phosphorus to receiving streams thus care should be taken when managing the drainage control structures at sites that are prone to soil erosion the results of drainmod were compared to the results obtained by rzwqm thorp et al 2008 for the same sites under the same conditions although effects of cd on both drainage volumes and n losses predicted by rzwqm were larger than those predicted by drainmod the two models predicted similar trends across the region the differences in predictions of drainmod drainmod nii and rzwqm dssat are attributed to structural differences in both models which differed in representing some of the key processes affecting the hydrology and n dynamics including et surface runoff denitrification and n uptake the results of this study can be used to inform policy makers government agencies and other stakeholders on where the practice can be implemented and what would be the expected long term performance of implementing the practice at a specific geographic location within the u s midwest region 
11584,techniques that reduce the volume of water applied in irrigation are desirable in the face of dwindling water resources and increasing demand for food various water saving irrigation strategies involving the application of water below full crop water requirements have been advanced this study employed meta analysis to examine the relative crop yield performance of full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di and partial root zone drying irrigation prdi the review included 35 studies representing 14 study countries and reporting 43 crop yields of i di against that of prdi ii fi against that of di and iii fi against that of prdi overall crops under di produces similar yields as prdi but yields under both are typically lower than yields of fi there were variations in yield response of different crops to di and prdi suggesting crop and or context specificity the main factors contributing to the yield response were crop species and soil texture crop yields between fi di and prdi vary significantly if crops are more frequently irrigated it is concluded that di and prdi result in yields lower than those of fi but yields of di and prdi are comparable economically justifying and weighing the cost of water saving irrigation strategies against the expected yield penalties is therefore crucial keywords crop yield deficit irrigation irrigation frequency soil texture water use efficiency wue 1 introduction water is a major determinant of biomass production and yields of crops due to its critical role in photosynthesis nutrient dissolution and uptake transport and other physiological processes in crop plants sufficient availability of water in the root zone is therefore crucial throughout the growing season of a crop as a result crop production is the most water intensive human activity accounting for about 70 of water abstracted worldwide yang et al 2006 yawson et al 2014 of this irrigation accounts for 60 80 huffaker and hamilton 2007 however in the face of growing water scarcity and demand for food there is a need to increase water use efficiency wue in crop production without incurring large yield and environmental penalties carrijo et al 2017 given that the increasing wue in crops is a major challenge to breeding due to the intricate relationship between transpiration and photosynthesis agronomic approaches are crucial and inevitable globally only 17 of croplands are under irrigation but this accounts for 40 of total food production molden et al 2010 while irrigation can increase crop yields four fold compared to rain fed production sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 water use efficiencies wues are not particularly high in irrigation production systems some agronomic water saving options promoted include better irrigation scheduling up to date irrigation systems and reuse of wastewater these options can potentially decrease the use of fresh water for irrigation by 30 dworak et al 2007 psarras et al 2014 water saving approaches that directly target reductions in water input include deficit irrigation di applies to conventional or sustained or regulated deficit irrigation in this study and partial root zone drying irrigation prdi compared to full irrigation fi in which crops receive their full evapotranspiration requirements di involves the application of water below the crop s full water requirement in a closely controlled manner over a prescribed part or parts of the seasonal cycle of plant development kriedemann and goodwin 2003 in contrast prdi involves alternating irrigation in space and time to generate wet dry cycles in different sections of the root system to simultaneously maintain plant water status at maximum water potential and control vegetative growth for prescribed parts of the seasonal cycle of plant development sadras 2009 kriedemann and goodwin 2003 although the mode of operation of di and prdi differs significantly both are designed to improve wue and limit excessive vegetative growth kriedemann and goodwin 2003 with di especially regulated di water application is manipulated over time where water deficit is imposed in a controlled way over a critical period during the crop s growth in contrast with prdi water is manipulated over space where water deficit is applied by separating alternating dry and moist roots using dual irrigation lines that can be operated separately kriedemann and goodwin 2003 it has been reported that prdi improves irrigation water productivity iwp yield per unit applied irrigation water with respect to controls receiving markedly more water but similar gains are often attained with di sadras 2009 in a meta analysis sadras 2009 concluded that the water productivity gains from di and prdi were statistically comparable and that it is important to identify conditions under which one method would be economically preferable to the other however in terms of crop yield it is not clear which of these methods is superior and how well they compare with full irrigation at least between di and prdi the results are inconsistent e g see savic et al 2009 kirda et al 2007 ismail and phizackerley 2009 therefore there is a need to establish the effect and superiority of di and prdi on crop yields vis à vis fi to justify recommendation of one approach over another the present study therefore used meta analysis to examine the performance of fi di and prdi in terms of crop yields we distinctly conducted meta analysis of crop yield between di control and prdi fi control and di and fi control and prdi some of the related crop and soil properties which could contribute to the differences in crop yields including crop species agronomic purpose of crops cereals or vegetables or fruits or arable crops etc location of the experiment field or greenhouse the frequency of water supply to the crops and soil texture were also analysed to enable comparison under similar scale and conditions the review was limited to studies reporting on all three irrigation practices 2 methods 2 1 literature search and selection of relevant primary studies we searched for primary studies published between january 1990 and december 2016 that reported yield comparisons between full irrigation fi regulated deficit or conventional deficit irrigation di and partial root zone drying irrigation prdi the search was done in scopus agora and in google scholar combinations of the following search terms were used in all databases full irrigation or deficit irrigation or partial root zone or partial root zone and yield we applied several selection criteria to ensure that minimum scientific standards were met studies were only included if i they reported yield data on individual crop species in a di prdi treatment and there was a control treatment of full irrigation fi ii they reported primary data iii the scale of the yield observations for the fi di and prdi were comparable iv reported the mean x sample size n and a measure of dispersion se sd 95 ci not necessarily mandatory as numerical or graphical data or if sd of yields could be estimated from the reported data for all three irrigation regimes and v the data were not already included from another paper in order to avoid multiple counting standard deviations sd are needed as an important input variable to a meta analysis thus in situations where standard error se of yield has been provided instead of the sd the sd values were computed from se using eq 1 higgins and deeks 2011 1 s d s e n where n is the number of replications in cases where sd or se was not available and we were unsuccessful in retrieving same from corresponding authors sd was reassigned as 10 of the mean for yield luo et al 2006 gattinger et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 the effect of the estimation method for the sd i e available or estimated by multiplying by 1 10 on the results was assessed by sensitivity analyses each observation in a meta analysis is required to be independent but repeated measurements in the same location over time where the same crops provide data for the different time points are not independent in such circumstances a given crop would be providing data for different outcomes and treating the outcomes as independent would lead to incorrect estimates of the variance of the summary effect borenstein et al 2009 such complex data structures were encountered in our meta analysis where studies had presented n x and sds of yield from the same crops separately for different years or for additional variant treatments sub groups in the control or in each of the experimental groups such data types were catered for in the meta analysis by combining across subgroups into a single group for each crop or treatment thus if yield values from a single study were reported for multiple years or seasons we combined across the subgroups years by calculating sum of the sample size and the weighted mean yield by sample size over time to be used in the meta analysis borenstein et al 2009 where studies had included additional variants of the experimental groups i e di or prdi and a single control group i e fi such that crops in the control group contributed information to more than one effect sum of the sample size and the weighted average yield for the various forms of di or prdi was calculated and used in the meta analysis borenstein et al 2009 for both of these complex data structure scenarios the combined standard deviation was computed using eq 2 borenstein et al 2009 2 s 1 n 11 1 s d 11 2 n 12 1 s d 12 2 n 11 n 12 n 11 n 12 x 11 2 x 12 2 2 x 11 x 12 n 11 n 12 1 where s 1 is the combined standard deviation x 11 x 12 are the means in subgroups 1 and 2 of treatment group 1 s11 s12 are the standard deviations and n11 n12 the sample sizes of subgroups 1 and 2 borenstein et al 2009 on the other hand if a primary study contributed several effect sizes to the database by reporting a single time point data for different crops species or varieties the different crops were considered as independent subgroups and were included separately in the meta analysis the data from different crop species from the same primary study are not necessarily independent but it is recommended to still include them separately in the meta analysis as their omission could restrict our analysis of moderators and cause more distortions of the results than the lack of true independence ferreira et al 2016 seufert et al 2012 2 2 effect size effect size expresses the magnitude of an effect of interest in this case irrigation strategy on crop yield and provides a common statistical parameter that allows the combination and comparison on the same scale the results from different studies into a single and standardized metric rosenberg et al 2013 there are different types of effect sizes including hedges d and response ratio for this study hedges d the standardized mean difference between crop yield in di and prdi or between crop yield in fi and either di or prdi was used borenstein et al 2009 hedges d sometimes referred to as hedges g is said to be the most common and preferred metric in use currently hedges and olkin 1985 koricheva et al 2013 hedges d corrects for small sample sizes is unaffected by unequal sampling variance in paired groups allows in contrast to the response ratio metric the usage of reported zero value responses gurevitch et al 1992 morales and traveset 2009 moreover when studies report x and sds and for our purposes of comparing two groups in terms of continues response variable hedges d is among the preferred metric of effect sizes borenstein et al 2009 dependent on which irrigation strategy was defined as the control three categories of meta analysis were performed in this study i to compare crop yield of di and prdi experimental treatments were defined as plots with prdi and controls as plot with di thus hedges d values are negative if prdi causes a reduction in crop yield in comparing fi with either di or prdi experimental treatments were defined as plots with ii di and iii plots with prdi and controls as plots with fi hedges d values are therefore negative if di or prdi causes a reduction in crop yield responses hedges d was computed by using eq 3 rosenberg et al 2013 3 d x e x c s j where xe and xc are the mean of the experimental group and mean of the control group respectively j 1 3 4 n e n c 2 1 is a correction term for small sample size and s n e 1 s e 2 n c 1 s c 2 n e n c 2 is the pooled standard deviation the variance of hedges d is given by eq 4 4 v d n e n c n e n c d 2 2 n e n c where ne and nc are the sample size of the experimental group and the control group respectively rosenberg et al 2013 a random effect model was used to assess the impact on crop yields under di compared with prdi or under fi compared with di or prdi supplementary methods methods s1 explanatory variables moderators considered in this meta analysis included country several

several see supplementary methods s2 for details on moderator analysis supplementary table s1 2 3 publication bias publication bias toward significant results in the overall database was visually assessed by the funnel plot and if there was evidence of publication bias its potential impact on the overall effect size was assessed by the trim and fill method duval and tweedie 2000 ferreira et al

comparisons of all three irrigation regimes fig s4 for comparisons involving di and prdi it appeared that yields of crops watered daily under prdi were superior but this was not significantly different from the yield of crops watered with different irrigation frequencies for comparisons involving fi and di crop yields across various irrigation frequencies were insignificantly different see supplementary information on irrigation frequency effects for details the majority of the studies in our meta analysis came from europe mostly southern europe for all the three types of comparisons

measures of dispersion i e ses sds or cis n 21 and studies for which these measures had to be estimated n 22 no qualitative changes were observed in the trends compared to those found when considering the entire database for example when di was compared with prdi and the analysis was done considering the dataset for which measures of dispersion were originally reported the effect size d 0 121 ci 0 152 to 0 394 was positive but not significant when the analysis was done considering the dataset for which measures of dispersion were estimated the effect size d 0 2 ci 0 045 to 0 444 was larger but still not significantly positive fig 6 a when we compared fi with di the standardized mean differences observed were significantly negative for both studies with available and estimated sds the effect

under controlled environments n 11 no qualitative changes were observed in the trends compared to those found when considering the entire database for example when di was compared with prdi and the

conducted under field conditions and those conducted under controlled environments the effect sizes were 0 686 ci 0 959 to 0 413 and 1 203 ci 1 735 to 0 672 respectively for field and greenhouse experiments fig 6b there was no yield difference between field and greenhouse experiments when fi was compared with di qb 2 86 d f 1 p 0 091 i2 66 83 fig 6b similar trends were observed when fi was compared with prdi fig 6b there was no yield difference between field and greenhouse experiments when fi was compared with prdi qb 0 424 d f 1 p 0 515 i2 70 73 fig 6b the foregoing suggests that the non independence of effect sizes in our database does not significantly affect the results 3 5 analysis of publication bias funnel plots for the analyses indicated a weak tendency for smaller sample sizes to be associated with stronger negative effects supplementary fig s6 for two of the comparisons carried out in this study i e di by prdi and fi by prdi funnel plots obtained were near symmetrical supplementary fig s6a c and for these trim and fill analysis indicated that there were no studies missing to the right side of the grand mean however for the analysis of fi by di fourteen effect sizes were estimated missing on the right side of the grand mean supplementary fig s6b and correcting for that with trim and fill method although changed the magnitude of the effect size did not affect the significance hedges d 0 3816 ci 0 6752 to 0 0880 p 0 0108 the fail safe number rosenberg s nfs for the database is 388 which is over 1 5 fold above the threshold of 225 5 n 10 needed to consider the mean effect size robust thus publication bias was not a grave problem in our meta analysis and a relatively large number of unpublished relationships would be required to change statistically significant effects 4 discussion sustainable crop production urgently requires innovative irrigation strategies and agricultural water management that increase wue without decreasing yields sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 deficit irrigation di and partial root zone drying irrigation prdi are potentially water saving irrigation strategies previous reviews of these irrigation strategies had either focused on only one water saving technique or on various water saving irrigation strategies applied at particular locations for example sadras 2009 compared prdi and di with fi controls of only field experiments using similar irrigation equipment kriedemann and goodwin 2003 used a narrative approach to review di and prdi davies et al 2002 morison et al 2008 and sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 also did a narrative review of the principles and practical results of prdi crop yields are ultimate target of any irrigation strategy employed thus there is the need to establish the comparative effect of water saving irrigation strategies on yield and to understand the factors that could potentially confound the effectiveness of these strategies in the present study we have used meta analysis to compare crop yields of di with prdi fi with di and fi with prdi using a relatively larger dataset encompassing both field and controlled environments and diverse horticultural and arable crops 4 1 overall effect of different types of irrigation strategy on crop yield the results showed that whilst there were no significant differences between yields of crops under di and prdi yields under both strategies were lower than yields under fi however yield penalties incurred under di and prdi might be compensated for with water productivity gains this requires an economic evaluation although the current study is focused on yield the results are consistent with that of sadras 2009 with regard to water productivity gains between prdi and di with respect to fi controls thus it would be economically prudent to index the cost of adopting prdi or di against expected yield penalties the observed lower yields under di and prdi compared to fi can be due to insufficient water supply at critical growth stages especially during yield formation our results are robust to publication bias as indicated by the rosenberg fail safe number and visually by funnel plots however for comparison of yield between fi and di the effect size might be quite conservative as the trim and fill method suggested an even bigger effect size of yield advantage for fi over di the database used in the present study consisted of 43 effect sizes derived from 35 studies but the non independence of multiple effect sizes per study in our data as indicated by sensitivity analysis did not strongly affect the results our analysis of heterogeneity also revealed that the percentage of total variability in a set of effect sizes because of true heterogeneity between study or comparisons rather than sampling error was low to high approximately between 2 and 73 for comparisons that recorded relatively larger i2 values differences in experimental approaches and environmental variables and vagaries between studies could be implicated experiments involving split root systems led to the concept of partial root zone drying as a modified form of deficit irrigation sadras 2009 available literature suggests that the prdi concept was pioneered by grimes et al 1968 on cotton fields and subsequently others including sepaskhah and sichani 1976 sepaskhah and sichani 1976 and samadi and sepaskhah 1984 trialled the technique it appears from the present study that the comparison of the three irrigation strategies began only recently the oldest study which qualified for our meta analysis dates from 2003 supplementary table s1 after 2003 the body of papers on the subject began increasing in consonance with rising concerns about water scarcity climate change and food production interestingly no study conducted in africa met our inclusion criteria the majority of the included studies originated from southern europe followed by oceania north america asia and south america but the results suggested that differences in effect sizes or otherwise observed herein are not dependent on the country of the trial 4 2 yield performance of crops under deficit irrigation yield varied across crop types and species when fi was compared with either di or prdi but not when di was compared with prdi suggesting that the different crop species responded differently to water deficit whilst it has been established here that there may be yield penalties when di or prdi are employed compared with fi controls the results here suggest that the magnitude of this penalty might not be identical for all crop species and types indeed it has been suggested that depending on the crop and its sensitivity to drought water stress could either hasten or delay flowering and physiological maturity farooq et al 2012 in the present study significantly large crop yield advantage of fi over di was observed for tomatoes grapes apples and pepper but yield differences between fi and di for potatoes and oranges were not significantly different fig 2 when prdi was compared with fi yield reductions under prdi were large for tomatoes grapes apples and pepper but not orange and potato fig 3 it appears that two opposing reasons could be involved in the consistently non significant yield differences for oranges and potatoes there is a suggestion that orange yields are less sensitive to water restrictions especially when the restrictions are moderate see for example aguado et al 2012 stagno et al 2015 the relatively strong and large root system of oranges may be an adaptive mechanism for foraging for water under water deficit conditions and therefore unless the stress is very severe and prolonged yields will be unaffected possibly water stress imposed by current setups of prdi and di is not sufficiently severe or long to impact yield of oranges significantly on the other hand compared to other species potato is said to be very sensitive to under and over irrigation and usually experiences large reductions of yield under water stress van loon 1981 reduced leaf area and or reduced photosynthesis per unit of leaf area and the relatively weak root system are some of the factors which causes the sensitivity of the potato to water shortage van loon 1981 probably the weakest of stress imposed by either di or prdi is enough to impact yield of potatoes significantly and equally under both prdi and di thus in order to prevent yield losses due to water stress rate of irrigating potatoes should be higher than for other crop species differences in crop response to water deficits can cause differences in yields steduto et al 2012 similarly for the same crop under different experimental conditions the onset duration and extent of water deficit during the growth stages will result in different effects on yield transpiration efficiencies also contribute to differences in yield response to water deficit ben gal et al 2003 kirda 2002 for most crops reductions in biomass production will result in reduction in the harvestable index fereres and soriano 2007 since both di and prdi result in reduced transpiration and biomass production it is probable that crops that suffered comparatively bigger reductions in biomass production and yield might have greater sensitivity to water deficit perhaps vegetables i e tomatoes and peppers in the present study were less sensitive to water deficits depending on the intensity of the water deficit relative to growth stages mitchell and shennan 1991 for example reported that fruit set and by extension yield in tomatoes was insensitive to water deficit the differential yield responses observed in the present study may also be related to the yield potential of the various crops growth duration and drought tolerance abilities of the specific crops high yielding crop species or cultivars have been found to be more sensitive to water stress than low yielding counterparts kirda 2002 similarly crop varieties that are most suitable for deficit irrigation are those with a short growing season and are tolerant of drought stewart and musick 1982 generally the data herein is consistent with the suggestion of sadras 2009 that the relative importance of the different mechanisms of controlling transpiration by different crop species and how they vary with crop species and variety should be a fundamental feature in irrigation models or in designing water saving irrigation options for different crop species furthermore the yield differences in the present analyses seem to be related to the better performance of vegetables referring to the relative yield of fi to di and prdi over tree and vine fruits and arable crops figs 2 4 the insignificant difference between yields of arable crops under fi and di might be due to the relatively small number of studies 7 in total and attendant small sample size fig 4 for fruits such as grapes and citrus yield reduction due to water deficits might be bigger than in vegetables however improved fruit quality might generate sufficient revenue to offset yield penalties hence high fruit quality with low yield penalty can be acceptable for such fruit crops 4 3 yield performance across soil textures yield varied across soil textures when fi was compared with either di or prdi but not when di was compared with prdi the yield differences seem to be related to the better yield performance of sandy clay loam peat clay loam sandy loam clay and sandy clay referring to the relative yield of fi to di and prdi over clay silt loam sandy soils and in soils labelled as non specified figs 5 it must however be noted that there may be large uncertainty range for the effect size of experiments that used sandy clay loam due to its relatively small number of studies and attendant small sample size number of studies sample size for sandy clay loam 2 40 and 2 46 for fi vs di and fi vs prdi respectively fig 5 kirda 2002 has noted that plants may undergo water stress quickly under deficit irrigation when grown in sandy soils and so the non significant result for sandy soils was not entirely unexpected crops cultivated in deep or fine textured soils such as clay clayey loam soils and peat may have ample time to adjust to low soil water matric pressure and may remain unaffected by low soil water content kirda 2002 whilst the results here suggest that success or enhanced yield performance with deficit irrigation is more probable in deep and finely textured soils it also reiterate the necessity to consider the water retention capacity of soils in the models or designs of successful water saving irrigation options the experiments analysed here were performed on different fields or labs but soil characteristics in this case soil texture can even be highly variable on a much smaller scale in the same field and may impact issues in irrigation management our results demonstrate that the use and management of di or prdi over fi may not be a one size fits all affair if soils are variable on a given field or across various fields an understanding of which soil textures are needed for what irrigation scheme would be crucial for the desired design qualifications the coupling of soil texture characteristics with irrigation parameters can lead to designer systems adjusted for the local soil texture conditions indeed other soils properties including ph and electrical conductivity could influence the relationship between soil water availability and crop yield in the current study it was not possible to include additional soil properties as moderators because these information were largely not reported or were not consistently reported in the included papers 5 conclusion compared to fi both di and prdi are aimed at reducing the volume of water applied in irrigation the partial root zone drying irrigation is an upgrade of deficit irrigation in which water supply is alternated in space and time in planned irrigation events to generate wet dry cycles in different sections of the root system the present study employed a meta analysis using the standardized mean difference hedges d metric to examine the relative yields of a broad range of crops under fi di and prdi under different environments the study also analysed the explanatory variables moderators that may affect the magnitude of yield response to the irrigation techniques in all thirty five studies representing 14 study countries and reporting 43 di to prdi fi to di and fi to prdi yield comparisons on 9 different crop species were analysed the meta analyses of the included data show that overall crop yields under di and prdi are not significantly different however yields under both di and prdi were significantly lower than yields under fi controls different types of crops responded differently to both di and prdi suggesting that the yield response to di or prdi is crop or context specific the main factors contributing to the yield response were crop species and soil texture vegetables contributed largely to the observed higher yields under fi controls compared to fruits and arable crops soil texture also contributes to relative yield responses of crops under different irrigation strategies higher yields occurred on sandy clay loam peat clay loam sandy loam clay and sandy clay compared to clay silt loam and sandy soils this suggests that success or enhanced yield performance with di and prdi is more probable in deep and finely textured soils overall yield did not vary across various irrigation frequencies for comparisons of all three irrigation strategies but crop yields between fi controls and di and prdi vary significantly if crops were more frequently irrigated e g daily irrigation or if irrigation is based on measurements of soil water depletion our results support the suggestion that total number of irrigation applications under deficit irrigation conditions does not affect crop yield signifying that di applications to crops in several small amounts may not be better with respect to crop yield than applying them in relatively large quantities at a reduced frequency with the knowledge that yields of prdi is no different from di but the former is characterised by relatively expensive installations and management complexities than the later it is crucial that the adoption of any water saving irrigation strategy is economically justified in all situations it would also be ideal that the cost of water saving irrigation strategy is weighed against the expected loss in crop yield overall di and prdi might increase water productivity but cause yield penalties compared to fi acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or

11584,techniques that reduce the volume of water applied in irrigation are desirable in the face of dwindling water resources and increasing demand for food various water saving irrigation strategies involving the application of water below full crop water requirements have been advanced this study employed meta analysis to examine the relative crop yield performance of full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di and partial root zone drying irrigation prdi the review included 35 studies representing 14 study countries and reporting 43 crop yields of i di against that of prdi ii fi against that of di and iii fi against that of prdi overall crops under di produces similar yields as prdi but yields under both are typically lower than yields of fi there were variations in yield response of different crops to di and prdi suggesting crop and or context specificity the main factors contributing to the yield response were crop species and soil texture crop yields between fi di and prdi vary significantly if crops are more frequently irrigated it is concluded that di and prdi result in yields lower than those of fi but yields of di and prdi are comparable economically justifying and weighing the cost of water saving irrigation strategies against the expected yield penalties is therefore crucial keywords crop yield deficit irrigation irrigation frequency soil texture water use efficiency wue 1 introduction water is a major determinant of biomass production and yields of crops due to its critical role in photosynthesis nutrient dissolution and uptake transport and other physiological processes in crop plants sufficient availability of water in the root zone is therefore crucial throughout the growing season of a crop as a result crop production is the most water intensive human activity accounting for about 70 of water abstracted worldwide yang et al 2006 yawson et al 2014 of this irrigation accounts for 60 80 huffaker and hamilton 2007 however in the face of growing water scarcity and demand for food there is a need to increase water use efficiency wue in crop production without incurring large yield and environmental penalties carrijo et al 2017 given that the increasing wue in crops is a major challenge to breeding due to the intricate relationship between transpiration and photosynthesis agronomic approaches are crucial and inevitable globally only 17 of croplands are under irrigation but this accounts for 40 of total food production molden et al 2010 while irrigation can increase crop yields four fold compared to rain fed production sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 water use efficiencies wues are not particularly high in irrigation production systems some agronomic water saving options promoted include better irrigation scheduling up to date irrigation systems and reuse of wastewater these options can potentially decrease the use of fresh water for irrigation by 30 dworak et al 2007 psarras et al 2014 water saving approaches that directly target reductions in water input include deficit irrigation di applies to conventional or sustained or regulated deficit irrigation in this study and partial root zone drying irrigation prdi compared to full irrigation fi in which crops receive their full evapotranspiration requirements di involves the application of water below the crop s full water requirement in a closely controlled manner over a prescribed part or parts of the seasonal cycle of plant development kriedemann and goodwin 2003 in contrast prdi involves alternating irrigation in space and time to generate wet dry cycles in different sections of the root system to simultaneously maintain plant water status at maximum water potential and control vegetative growth for prescribed parts of the seasonal cycle of plant development sadras 2009 kriedemann and goodwin 2003 although the mode of operation of di and prdi differs significantly both are designed to improve wue and limit excessive vegetative growth kriedemann and goodwin 2003 with di especially regulated di water application is manipulated over time where water deficit is imposed in a controlled way over a critical period during the crop s growth in contrast with prdi water is manipulated over space where water deficit is applied by separating alternating dry and moist roots using dual irrigation lines that can be operated separately kriedemann and goodwin 2003 it has been reported that prdi improves irrigation water productivity iwp yield per unit applied irrigation water with respect to controls receiving markedly more water but similar gains are often attained with di sadras 2009 in a meta analysis sadras 2009 concluded that the water productivity gains from di and prdi were statistically comparable and that it is important to identify conditions under which one method would be economically preferable to the other however in terms of crop yield it is not clear which of these methods is superior and how well they compare with full irrigation at least between di and prdi the results are inconsistent e g see savic et al 2009 kirda et al 2007 ismail and phizackerley 2009 therefore there is a need to establish the effect and superiority of di and prdi on crop yields vis à vis fi to justify recommendation of one approach over another the present study therefore used meta analysis to examine the performance of fi di and prdi in terms of crop yields we distinctly conducted meta analysis of crop yield between di control and prdi fi control and di and fi control and prdi some of the related crop and soil properties which could contribute to the differences in crop yields including crop species agronomic purpose of crops cereals or vegetables or fruits or arable crops etc location of the experiment field or greenhouse the frequency of water supply to the crops and soil texture were also analysed to enable comparison under similar scale and conditions the review was limited to studies reporting on all three irrigation practices 2 methods 2 1 literature search and selection of relevant primary studies we searched for primary studies published between january 1990 and december 2016 that reported yield comparisons between full irrigation fi regulated deficit or conventional deficit irrigation di and partial root zone drying irrigation prdi the search was done in scopus agora and in google scholar combinations of the following search terms were used in all databases full irrigation or deficit irrigation or partial root zone or partial root zone and yield we applied several selection criteria to ensure that minimum scientific standards were met studies were only included if i they reported yield data on individual crop species in a di prdi treatment and there was a control treatment of full irrigation fi ii they reported primary data iii the scale of the yield observations for the fi di and prdi were comparable iv reported the mean x sample size n and a measure of dispersion se sd 95 ci not necessarily mandatory as numerical or graphical data or if sd of yields could be estimated from the reported data for all three irrigation regimes and v the data were not already included from another paper in order to avoid multiple counting standard deviations sd are needed as an important input variable to a meta analysis thus in situations where standard error se of yield has been provided instead of the sd the sd values were computed from se using eq 1 higgins and deeks 2011 1 s d s e n where n is the number of replications in cases where sd or se was not available and we were unsuccessful in retrieving same from corresponding authors sd was reassigned as 10 of the mean for yield luo et al 2006 gattinger et al 2012 zhao et al 2017 the effect of the estimation method for the sd i e available or estimated by multiplying by 1 10 on the results was assessed by sensitivity analyses each observation in a meta analysis is required to be independent but repeated measurements in the same location over time where the same crops provide data for the different time points are not independent in such circumstances a given crop would be providing data for different outcomes and treating the outcomes as independent would lead to incorrect estimates of the variance of the summary effect borenstein et al 2009 such complex data structures were encountered in our meta analysis where studies had presented n x and sds of yield from the same crops separately for different years or for additional variant treatments sub groups in the control or in each of the experimental groups such data types were catered for in the meta analysis by combining across subgroups into a single group for each crop or treatment thus if yield values from a single study were reported for multiple years or seasons we combined across the subgroups years by calculating sum of the sample size and the weighted mean yield by sample size over time to be used in the meta analysis borenstein et al 2009 where studies had included additional variants of the experimental groups i e di or prdi and a single control group i e fi such that crops in the control group contributed information to more than one effect sum of the sample size and the weighted average yield for the various forms of di or prdi was calculated and used in the meta analysis borenstein et al 2009 for both of these complex data structure scenarios the combined standard deviation was computed using eq 2 borenstein et al 2009 2 s 1 n 11 1 s d 11 2 n 12 1 s d 12 2 n 11 n 12 n 11 n 12 x 11 2 x 12 2 2 x 11 x 12 n 11 n 12 1 where s 1 is the combined standard deviation x 11 x 12 are the means in subgroups 1 and 2 of treatment group 1 s11 s12 are the standard deviations and n11 n12 the sample sizes of subgroups 1 and 2 borenstein et al 2009 on the other hand if a primary study contributed several effect sizes to the database by reporting a single time point data for different crops species or varieties the different crops were considered as independent subgroups and were included separately in the meta analysis the data from different crop species from the same primary study are not necessarily independent but it is recommended to still include them separately in the meta analysis as their omission could restrict our analysis of moderators and cause more distortions of the results than the lack of true independence ferreira et al 2016 seufert et al 2012 2 2 effect size effect size expresses the magnitude of an effect of interest in this case irrigation strategy on crop yield and provides a common statistical parameter that allows the combination and comparison on the same scale the results from different studies into a single and standardized metric rosenberg et al 2013 there are different types of effect sizes including hedges d and response ratio for this study hedges d the standardized mean difference between crop yield in di and prdi or between crop yield in fi and either di or prdi was used borenstein et al 2009 hedges d sometimes referred to as hedges g is said to be the most common and preferred metric in use currently hedges and olkin 1985 koricheva et al 2013 hedges d corrects for small sample sizes is unaffected by unequal sampling variance in paired groups allows in contrast to the response ratio metric the usage of reported zero value responses gurevitch et al 1992 morales and traveset 2009 moreover when studies report x and sds and for our purposes of comparing two groups in terms of continues response variable hedges d is among the preferred metric of effect sizes borenstein et al 2009 dependent on which irrigation strategy was defined as the control three categories of meta analysis were performed in this study i to compare crop yield of di and prdi experimental treatments were defined as plots with prdi and controls as plot with di thus hedges d values are negative if prdi causes a reduction in crop yield in comparing fi with either di or prdi experimental treatments were defined as plots with ii di and iii plots with prdi and controls as plots with fi hedges d values are therefore negative if di or prdi causes a reduction in crop yield responses hedges d was computed by using eq 3 rosenberg et al 2013 3 d x e x c s j where xe and xc are the mean of the experimental group and mean of the control group respectively j 1 3 4 n e n c 2 1 is a correction term for small sample size and s n e 1 s e 2 n c 1 s c 2 n e n c 2 is the pooled standard deviation the variance of hedges d is given by eq 4 4 v d n e n c n e n c d 2 2 n e n c where ne and nc are the sample size of the experimental group and the control group respectively rosenberg et al 2013 a random effect model was used to assess the impact on crop yields under di compared with prdi or under fi compared with di or prdi supplementary methods methods s1 explanatory variables moderators considered in this meta analysis included country several

assessed by the funnel plot and if there was evidence of publication bias its potential impact on the overall effect size was assessed by the trim and fill method duval and tweedie 2000 ferreira et al 2016 jennions et al 2013 in the absence of publication bias the funnel plot should approximately resemble an inverted symmetrical funnel but if there is publication bias for example due to unpublished

different from the yield of crops watered with different irrigation frequencies for comparisons involving fi and di crop yields across various irrigation frequencies were insignificantly different see supplementary information on irrigation frequency effects for details the majority of the studies in our meta analysis came from europe mostly southern europe for all the three types of comparisons made in this meta analysis the splitting of comparisons according to country of study showed no heterogeneity fig s5 see supplementary information on study country effects for detail results and supplementary discussion s1 for its discussion 3 4 sensitivity analysis 3 4 1 data with available sds by data with estimated sds when the dataset was grouped into studies that had originally reported measures of dispersion i e ses sds or cis n 21 and studies for which these measures had to be estimated n 22 no qualitative changes were observed in the trends compared to those found when considering the entire database for example when di was compared with prdi and the analysis was done considering the dataset for which measures of dispersion were originally reported the effect size d 0 121 ci 0 152 to 0 394 was positive but not significant when the analysis was done considering the dataset for which measures of dispersion were estimated the effect size d 0 2 ci 0 045 to 0 444 was larger but still not significantly positive fig 6 a when we compared fi with di the standardized mean differences observed were significantly negative for both studies with available and estimated sds the effect sizes were 0 707 ci 1 079 to 0 335 and 0 872 ci 1 206 to 0 537 respectively for studies with available measures of dispersion and for the studies with estimated measures of dispersion fig 6a similar trends were observed when fi was compared with prdi fig 6a 3 4 2 field by greenhouse experiments when the dataset was grouped into experiments conducted under field conditions n 32 and those conducted under controlled environments n 11 no qualitative changes were observed in the trends compared to those found when considering the entire database for example when di was compared with prdi and the

conducted under field conditions and those conducted under controlled environments the effect sizes were 0 686 ci 0 959 to 0 413 and 1 203 ci 1 735 to 0 672 respectively for field and greenhouse experiments fig 6b there was no yield difference between field and greenhouse experiments when fi was compared with di qb 2 86 d f 1 p 0 091 i2 66 83 fig 6b similar trends were observed when fi was compared with prdi fig 6b there was no yield difference between field and greenhouse experiments when fi was compared with prdi qb 0 424 d f 1 p 0 515 i2 70 73 fig 6b the foregoing suggests that the non independence of effect sizes in our database does not significantly affect the results 3 5 analysis of publication bias funnel plots for the analyses indicated a weak tendency for smaller sample sizes to be associated with stronger negative effects supplementary fig s6 for two of the comparisons carried out in this study i e di by prdi and fi by prdi funnel plots obtained were near symmetrical supplementary fig s6a c and for these trim and fill analysis indicated that there were no studies missing to the right side of the grand mean however for the analysis of fi by di fourteen effect sizes were estimated missing on the right side of the grand mean supplementary fig s6b and correcting for that with trim and fill method although changed the magnitude of the effect size did not affect the significance hedges d 0 3816 ci 0 6752 to 0 0880 p 0 0108 the fail safe number rosenberg s nfs for the database is 388 which is over 1 5 fold above the threshold of 225 5 n 10 needed to consider the mean effect size robust thus publication bias was not a grave problem in our meta analysis and a relatively large number of unpublished relationships would be required to change statistically significant effects 4 discussion sustainable crop production urgently requires innovative irrigation strategies and agricultural water management that increase wue without decreasing yields sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 deficit irrigation di and partial root zone drying irrigation prdi are potentially water saving irrigation strategies previous reviews of these irrigation strategies had either focused on only one water saving technique or on various water saving irrigation strategies applied at particular locations for example sadras 2009 compared prdi and di with fi controls of only field experiments using similar irrigation equipment kriedemann and goodwin 2003 used a narrative approach to review di and prdi davies et al 2002 morison et al 2008 and sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 also did a narrative review of the principles and practical results of prdi crop yields are ultimate target of any irrigation strategy employed thus there is the need to establish the comparative effect of water saving irrigation strategies on yield and to understand the factors that could potentially confound the effectiveness of these strategies in the present study we have used meta analysis to compare crop yields of di with prdi fi with di and fi with prdi using a relatively larger dataset encompassing both field and controlled environments and diverse horticultural and arable crops 4 1 overall effect of different types of irrigation strategy on crop yield the results showed that whilst there were no significant differences between yields of crops under di and prdi yields under both strategies were lower than yields under fi however yield penalties incurred under di and prdi might be compensated for with water productivity gains this requires an economic evaluation although the current study is focused on yield the results are consistent with that of sadras 2009 with regard to water productivity gains between prdi and di with respect to fi controls thus it would be economically prudent to index the cost of adopting prdi or di against expected yield penalties the observed lower yields under di and prdi compared to fi can be due to insufficient water supply at critical growth stages especially during yield formation our results are robust to publication bias as indicated by the rosenberg fail safe number and visually by funnel plots however for comparison of yield between fi and di the effect size might be quite conservative as the trim and fill method suggested an even bigger effect size of yield advantage for fi over di the database used in the present study consisted of 43 effect sizes derived from 35 studies but the non independence of multiple effect sizes per study in our data as indicated by sensitivity analysis did not strongly affect the results our analysis of heterogeneity also revealed that the percentage of total variability in a set of effect sizes because of true heterogeneity between study or comparisons rather than sampling error was low to high approximately between 2 and 73 for comparisons that recorded relatively larger i2 values differences in experimental approaches and environmental variables and vagaries between studies could be implicated experiments involving split root systems led to the concept of partial root zone drying as a modified form of deficit irrigation sadras 2009 available literature suggests that the prdi concept was pioneered by grimes et al 1968 on cotton fields and subsequently others including sepaskhah and sichani 1976 sepaskhah and sichani 1976 and samadi and sepaskhah 1984 trialled the technique it appears from the present study that the comparison of the three irrigation strategies began only recently the oldest study which qualified for our meta analysis dates from 2003 supplementary table s1 after 2003 the body of papers on the subject began increasing in consonance with rising concerns about water scarcity climate change and food production interestingly no study conducted in africa met our inclusion criteria the majority of the included studies originated from southern europe followed by oceania north america asia and south america but the results suggested that differences in effect sizes or otherwise observed herein are not dependent on the country of the trial 4 2 yield performance of crops under deficit irrigation yield varied across crop types and species when fi was compared with either di or prdi but not when di was compared with prdi suggesting that the different crop species responded differently to water deficit whilst it has been established here that there may be yield penalties when di or prdi are employed compared with fi controls the results here suggest that the magnitude of this penalty might not be identical for all crop species and types indeed it has been suggested that depending on the crop and its sensitivity to drought water stress could either hasten or delay flowering and physiological maturity farooq et al 2012 in the present study significantly large crop yield advantage of fi over di was observed for tomatoes grapes apples and pepper but yield differences between fi and di for potatoes and oranges were not significantly different fig 2 when prdi was compared with fi yield reductions under prdi were large for tomatoes grapes apples and pepper but not orange and potato fig 3 it appears that two opposing reasons could be involved in the consistently non significant yield differences for oranges and potatoes there is a suggestion that orange yields are less sensitive to water restrictions especially when the restrictions are moderate see for example aguado et al 2012 stagno et al 2015 the relatively strong and large root system of oranges may be an adaptive mechanism for foraging for water under water deficit conditions and therefore unless the stress is very severe and prolonged yields will be unaffected possibly water stress imposed by current setups of prdi and di is not sufficiently severe or long to impact yield of oranges significantly on the other hand compared to other species potato is said to be very sensitive to under and over irrigation and usually experiences large reductions of yield under water stress van loon 1981 reduced leaf area and or reduced photosynthesis per unit of leaf area and the relatively weak root system are some of the factors which causes the sensitivity of the potato to water shortage van loon 1981 probably the weakest of stress imposed by either di or prdi is enough to impact yield of potatoes significantly and equally under both prdi and di thus in order to prevent yield losses due to water stress rate of irrigating potatoes should be higher than for other crop species differences in crop response to water deficits can cause differences in yields steduto et al 2012 similarly for the same crop under different experimental conditions the onset duration and extent of water deficit during the growth stages will result in different effects on yield transpiration efficiencies also contribute to differences in yield response to water deficit ben gal et al 2003 kirda 2002 for most crops reductions in biomass production will result in reduction in the harvestable index fereres and soriano 2007 since both di and prdi result in reduced transpiration and biomass production it is probable that crops that suffered comparatively bigger reductions in biomass production and yield might have greater sensitivity to water deficit perhaps vegetables i e tomatoes and peppers in the present study were less sensitive to water deficits depending on the intensity of the water deficit relative to growth stages mitchell and shennan 1991 for example reported that fruit set and by extension yield in tomatoes was insensitive to water deficit the differential yield responses observed in the present study may also be related to the yield potential of the various crops growth duration and drought tolerance abilities of the specific crops high yielding crop species or cultivars have been found to be more sensitive to water stress than low yielding counterparts kirda 2002 similarly crop varieties that are most suitable for deficit irrigation are those with a short growing season and are tolerant of drought stewart and musick 1982 generally the data herein is consistent with the suggestion of sadras 2009 that the relative importance of the different mechanisms of controlling transpiration by different crop species and how they vary with crop species and variety should be a fundamental feature in irrigation models or in designing water saving irrigation options for different crop species furthermore the yield differences in the present analyses seem to be related to the better performance of vegetables referring to the relative yield of fi to di and prdi over tree and vine fruits and arable crops figs 2 4 the insignificant difference between yields of arable crops under fi and di might be due to the relatively small number of studies 7 in total and attendant small sample size fig 4 for fruits such as grapes and citrus yield reduction due to water deficits might be bigger than in vegetables however improved fruit quality might generate sufficient revenue to offset yield penalties hence high fruit quality with low yield penalty can be acceptable for such fruit crops 4 3 yield performance across soil textures yield varied across soil textures when fi was compared with either di or prdi but not when di was compared with prdi the yield differences seem to be related to the better yield performance of sandy clay loam peat clay loam sandy loam clay and sandy clay referring to the relative yield of fi to di and prdi over clay silt loam sandy soils and in soils labelled as non specified figs 5 it must however be noted that there may be large uncertainty range for the effect size of experiments that used sandy clay loam due to its relatively small number of studies and attendant small sample size number of studies sample size for sandy clay loam 2 40 and 2 46 for fi vs di and fi vs prdi respectively fig 5 kirda 2002 has noted that plants may undergo water stress quickly under deficit irrigation when grown in sandy soils and so the non significant result for sandy soils was not entirely unexpected crops cultivated in deep or fine textured soils such as clay clayey loam soils and peat may have ample time to adjust to low soil water matric pressure and may remain unaffected by low soil water content kirda 2002 whilst the results here suggest that success or enhanced yield performance with deficit irrigation is more probable in deep and finely textured soils it also reiterate the necessity to consider the water retention capacity of soils in the models or designs of successful water saving irrigation options the experiments analysed here were performed on different fields or labs but soil characteristics in this case soil texture can even be highly variable on a much smaller scale in the same field and may impact issues in irrigation management our results demonstrate that the use and management of di or prdi over fi may not be a one size fits all affair if soils are variable on a given field or across various fields an understanding of which soil textures are needed for what irrigation scheme would be crucial for the desired design qualifications the coupling of soil texture characteristics with irrigation parameters can lead to designer systems adjusted for the local soil texture conditions indeed other soils properties including ph and electrical conductivity could influence the relationship between soil water availability and crop yield in the current study it was not possible to include additional soil properties as moderators because these information were largely not reported or were not consistently reported in the included papers 5 conclusion compared to fi both di and prdi are aimed at reducing the volume of water applied in irrigation the partial root zone drying irrigation is an upgrade of deficit irrigation in which water supply is alternated in space and time in planned irrigation events to generate wet dry cycles in different sections of the root system the present study employed a meta analysis using the standardized mean difference hedges d metric to examine the relative yields of a broad range of crops under fi di and prdi under different environments the study also analysed the explanatory variables moderators that may affect the magnitude of yield response to the irrigation techniques in all thirty five studies representing 14 study countries and reporting 43 di to prdi fi to di and fi to prdi yield comparisons on 9 different crop species were analysed the meta analyses of the included data show that overall crop yields under di and prdi are not significantly different however yields under both di and prdi were significantly lower than yields under fi controls different types of crops responded differently to both di and prdi suggesting that the yield response to di or prdi is crop or context specific the main factors contributing to the yield response were crop species and soil texture vegetables contributed largely to the observed higher yields under fi controls compared to fruits and arable crops soil texture also contributes to relative yield responses of crops under different irrigation strategies higher yields occurred on sandy clay loam peat clay loam sandy loam clay and sandy clay compared to clay silt loam and sandy soils this suggests that success or enhanced yield performance with di and prdi is more probable in deep and finely textured soils overall yield did not vary across various irrigation frequencies for comparisons of all three irrigation strategies but crop yields between fi controls and di and prdi vary significantly if crops were more frequently irrigated e g daily irrigation or if irrigation is based on measurements of soil water depletion our results support the suggestion that total number of irrigation applications under deficit irrigation conditions does not affect crop yield signifying that di applications to crops in several small amounts may not be better with respect to crop yield than applying them in relatively large quantities at a reduced frequency with the knowledge that yields of prdi is no different from di but the former is characterised by relatively expensive installations and management complexities than the later it is crucial that the adoption of any water saving irrigation strategy is economically justified in all situations it would also be ideal that the cost of water saving irrigation strategy is weighed against the expected loss in crop yield overall di and prdi might increase water productivity but cause yield penalties compared to fi acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or
