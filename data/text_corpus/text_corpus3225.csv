16125,the formation of undesirable chloro organic byproducts is of great concern in the uv chlorine process in this study chlorine dioxide clo2 pre oxidation was applied to control the formation of chloro organic byproducts and the toxicity in uv chlorine treated water the molecular level changes in dissolved organic matter dom were tracked by using fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and clo2 pre oxidation was found to preferentially react with dom moieties with high aromaticity level and with a carbon number of 18 producing compounds with a higher degree of oxidation and lower aromaticity the clo2 treated dom was found to be less susceptible to attack by radicals and free chlorine in the uv chlorine process compared to the raw dom clo2 pre oxidation resulted in a significant decrease in the number of unknown chloro organic byproducts i e 17 and the total intensity of organic chlorine detected by ft icr ms i e 31 the molecular characteristics such as o c aromaticity index and the average number of chlorine atoms of these unknown chloro organic byproducts generated in the scenarios with and without clo2 pre oxidation were also different additionally clo2 pre oxidation reduced the genotoxicity sos umu test and cytotoxicity hep g2 cytotoxicity assay of uv chlorine treated water by 26 and 20 respectively the findings in this study highlight the merits of clo2 pre oxidation for controlling chloro organic byproducts and reducing the toxicity of water treated by the uv chlorine process in actual practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ft icr ms chloro organic byproducts uv chlorine chlorine dioxide genotoxicity cytotoxicity 1 introduction the occurrence of micropollutants e g pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products in drinking water sources has led to public concerns because of their potential threats to human health luo et al 2014 ding et al 2020 zhong et al 2021 conventional water treatment plants can only partially remove such micropollutants westerhoff et al 2005 highlighting the need for incorporating advanced micropollutant abatement processes such as advanced oxidation processes aops in the treatment trains the ultraviolet uv chlorine process has been reported to effectively degrade recalcitrant micropollutants guo et al 2018 chuang et al 2019 kwon et al 2020 compared to the uv h2o2 process that has been frequently implemented for water treatment the uv chlorine process has superior efficiency in hydroxy radical ho generation and can also generate reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 which have high reactivity towards micropollutants with electron rich groups fang et al 2014 chuang et al 2017 however in the uv chlorine aop undesirable chloro organic byproducts e g trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are generated from chlorine and rcs reactions with dissolved organic matter dom sun et al 2019 which could induce potential carcinogenicity and other risks to human health richardson and kimura 2017 mazhar et al 2020 since dom is ubiquitously present in surface water control of these undesirable byproducts has become a bottleneck when applying the uv chlorine process in actual water treatment some pre oxidation processes such as ozonation have been implemented to remove taste odor color and reduce the formation of chloro organic byproducts during chlorine disinfection phungsai et al 2018 ike et al 2019 however the formation of bromate bro3 a carcinogenic compound the increased assimilable organic carbon and the high capital cost of ozonation equipment are of concern von gunten 2003 hammes et al 2006 chlorine dioxide clo2 exhibits a higher selectivity toward compounds with electron rich moieties e g phenolic groups which are radical scavengers and important precursors of chloro organic byproducts li et al 2016 than ozone does wenk et al 2013 this makes clo2 pre oxidation a commonly used process to mitigate the formation of chloro organic byproducts by decreasing the reactivity of dom towards chlorine prior to the disinfection step yang et al 2013a 2013b criquet et al 2015 gan et al 2020 in addition clo2 has been also used as a secondary disinfectant as an alternative to chlorine to safeguard the water in drinking water distribution systems especially in italy sorlini et al 2016b previous studies have investigated the reaction mechanisms of clo2 with dom moieties wajon et al 1982 świetlik et al 2004 wenk et al 2013 rougé et al 2020 clo2 is highly reactive towards compounds with electron donating groups e g phenolic type moieties k 103 108 m 1s 1 and results in great decrease in the electron donating capacity edc of dom wenk et al 2013 houska et al 2021 the dominant pathway of clo2 attack has been reported to be electron transfer which converts phenolic moieties to oxidized benzoquinones and subsequently forms ring cleavage products gan et al 2020 additionally reduced hydrophobicity and aromaticity of dom fractions were observed during clo2 oxidation świetlik et al 2004 the alteration of dom e g decreased aromaticity and edc after clo2 treatment ultimately decreased the dbp formation in the subsequent chlorination rougé et al 2020 a recent study reported that clo2 pre oxidation significantly reduced the formation of thms and haas in the subsequent uv chlorine process fan et al 2022 therefore clo2 pre oxidation could be an effective approach for controlling the formation of chloro organic byproducts and reducing the toxicity of the water treated by the uv chlorine process however the commonly known chloro organic byproducts e g thms and haas only account for less than 30 of the total organic halogen tox krasner et al 2006 the influence of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts e g haloacetamides halophenolics and halobenzoquinones many of which could be more toxic than thms and haas remains uncharacterized plewa et al 2008 liu and zhang 2014 lyon et al 2014 a few conventional analytical methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy and uv vis spectrophotometry have been applied to characterize the bulk properties of dom during the clo2 pre oxidation świetlik and sikorska 2004 yang et al 2013a rougé et al 2020 however as dom is a complex mixture of thousands of organic compounds leenheer and croué 2003 the molecular level changes of dom and the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts remain largely unclear fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is an ultra high resolution mass spectrometer providing accurate mass to charge m z ratios and chemical formulas of the detected ions the high mass accuracy within 1 ppm of m z error makes it a powerful non targeted technique to decipher the elemental composition and structural features of dom and characterize the unknown chloro organic byproducts zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2018 previous studies have used ft icr ms to elucidate the changes of dom at the molecular level during aops such as the uv h2o2 and ozonation processes remucal et al 2020 bulman and remucal 2020 xiang et al 2020 the unknown fraction of the chloro organic byproducts generated during chlorination and the uv chlorine process has been characterized ruan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the exploration of the alteration of dom properties and the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts using ft icr ms for the uv chlorine treated samples with and without clo2 pre oxidation can provide more insights into the role of clo2 pre oxidation moreover despite the potential reduction in the formation of chloro organic byproducts the incorporation of pre oxidation by clo2 may promote the formation of inorganic byproducts such as chlorite and chlorate gan et al 2016 2019 terhalle et al 2018 hupperich et al 2020 the changes in the overall toxicity of the water treated by the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation are still unknown and need to be evaluated the objectives of this study are to evaluate the role of clo2 pre oxidation in controlling the formation of chloro organic byproducts and toxicity during the subsequent uv chlorine treatment the molecular level changes of dom and the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts from clo2 pre oxidation were examined the alteration of dom and formation of unknown and known byproducts volatile organic byproducts haas total organic chlorine tocl chlorite and chlorate were explored during uv chlorine treatment with and without clo2 pre oxidation the toxicity changes including genotoxicity cytotoxicity and androgenic and estrogenic activities were examined after the sequential treatments the results of this study suggest the effectiveness of clo2 pre oxidation in controlling the formation of chloro organic byproducts and the toxicity during the uv chlorine treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals information on the chemicals and solutions is provided in text s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 experimental procedures the experimental procedures are summarized in text s1 in the supplementary material 2 3 analytical methods the genotoxicity of the extracted sample was measured by sos umu tests using salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 according to international standard iso 13829 2000 iso 2000 and expressed as the equivalent concentration of 4 nitroquinoline noxide 4 nqo ng 4 nqo l 1 the cytotoxicity of the extracted sample was evaluated using hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay according to gong et al 2017 and calculated as cytotoxicity indices ctis wagner and plewa 2017 androgenic and estrogenic activities of the water samples were evaluated with mda kb2 cells and mvln cells by following the procedures described in xu et al 2019 the detailed analytical procedures of genotoxicity cytotoxicity and androgenic and estrogenic activities tests are provided in text s1 a bruker solarix 7 0 t ft icr ms bruker daltonics gmbh germany equipped with an electrospray ionization source was used to accurately detect the m z of ions in the dom samples in the negative ionization mode reasons for selecting the negative ionization mode are given in text s2 mass spectra were externally calibrated and then internally calibrated using a series of homolog compounds commonly present in dom koch et al 2007 ions with a m z of 150 600 a signal to noise ratio of 10 and a specific intensity of 1 000 000 were exported for formula assignment using in house developed software xiang et al 2020 the mass error was 0 5 ppm for all the assigned formulas the measured and theoretical isotope patterns of the chloro organic byproducts were checked to confirm the formula assignment accuracy calculation of the total intensity of chloro organic byproducts followed the method described in xiang et al 2020 the comparison of the changes in the intensity of the formulas was all based on the raw dom all the experiments were at least duplicated and the number of replicates was shown in the corresponding figure captions error bars in the figures represent the standard deviations from replicates other analytical methods used in this study are described in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of dom and formation of chloro organic byproducts during clo2 pre oxidation the molecular level changes of dom during clo2 pre oxidation are displayed in fig 1 although the number of formulas assigned to the raw dom n 2094 and the dom treated by clo2 pre oxidation hereafter referred to as dom clo2 n 2038 was comparable the elemental composition of dom was drastically altered by clo2 pre oxidation the formulas were classified into five groups i e recalcitrant removed intensity decreased intensity increased and produced formulas the definition is given in text s3 and the alteration in their elemental compositions was visualized by the van krevelen diagram which shows the h c and the o c ratios of each formula as shown in fig 1a 244 out of the 2094 formulas assigned in the raw dom were removed after clo2 pre oxidation and a significant decrease in the intensity of 286 formulas was observed over 20 difference in the intensity is considered as a significant change in this study text s3 the removed and intensity decreased formulas were clustered in the region with relatively lower o c ratios with intensity weighted o c ratios o cw of 0 462 and 0 530 respectively compared to the 188 newly produced o cw 0 617 and 325 intensity increased o cw 0 608 formulas the higher o cw observed in the newly produced and intensity increased formulas indicated an increase in the level of oxidation of dom by clo2 pre oxidation prasert et al 2021 oxygen transfer reactions may proceed with the release of hocl fig s3 during the one electron transfer reactions of clo2 with organic compounds for example clo2 oxidation of phenol and olefins generates benzoquinone and ketones respectively with increased o c ratios together with the release of a substantial amount of hocl wajon et al 1982 wenk et al 2013 gan et al 2020 the intensity weighted h c ratios h cw of the removed and newly produced formulas by clo2 pre oxidation were calculated to be 0 739 and 1 096 respectively and the intensity weighted double bond equivalence dbew values were 16 69 and 11 08 respectively table s4 this indicates an increased level of saturation and suggests potential changes in the aromaticity of dom by clo2 pre oxidation to further investigate such changes a modified aromaticity index aimod was used the parameter aimod describes the existence of aromatic moieties in dom and a larger number means a higher degree of aromaticity e g aimod phenol 0 636 koch and dittmar 2006 the intensity weighted aimod w of the newly produced formulas 0 280 was lower compared to that of the removed formulas 0 578 table s4 suggesting the ring cleavage of aromatic moieties and the formation of aliphatic type moieties and consistent with the decreased uv254 value fig s4 interestingly nearly all formulas with a carbon number larger than 18 in the high aromaticity region aimod 0 5 were removed or exhibited a decrease in intensity after clo2 pre oxidation while the formulas in the low aromaticity region aimod 0 5 were more recalcitrant to clo2 reactions fig s5 previous studies investigating the mechanisms of the interactions between clo2 with dom have reported that clo2 preferentially reacts with the aromatic moieties e g phenolic type moieties in dom wajon et al 1982 wenk et al 2013 gan et al 2020 the findings in our study provided molecular level evidence for the proposed reaction mechanism and indicated that the high carbon number moieties i e carbon number 18 could be more susceptible to clo2 attack than the low carbon number ones when they have a similar level of aromaticity the formation of commonly known chloro organic byproducts including volatile organic byproducts 4 6 0 3 μg l 1 and haas 6 2 0 2 μg l 1 during clo2 pre oxidation clo2 1 0 mg l 1 pre oxidation time 30 min ph 7 5 were found to be insignificant fig 4a b while the unknown chloro organic byproducts 114 11 μg l 1 as cl comprised 93 of the tocl 122 11 μg l 1 as cl fig 4c however it was surprising that 474 unknown chloro organic byproducts were detected by ft icr ms fig 1b and 398 out of the 474 unknown dbps have a relative intensity of 1 it should be noted that all the measured isotope patterns of the chloro organic byproducts were carefully checked in regard to their theoretical isotope patterns to ensure the correct formula assignment tables s5 s7 although clo2 has been reported as not being able to chlorinate moieties in dom free chlorine can be generated in situ from the clo2 oxidation of dom wajon et al 1982 terhalle et al 2018 rougé et al 2020 the yield of hocl was found to be up to 20 of clo2 consumption under the experimental conditions fig s3 which was comparable to the values up to 25 reported in previous studies rougé et al 2018 hupperich et al 2020 houska et al 2021 the formation of hundreds of unknown chloro organic byproducts can be explained by the electrophilic substitution or chlorine addition on dom constituents by the in situ formed free chlorine the elemental composition of the unknown chloro organic byproducts was visualized through the van kreleven diagram fig 1b among the 474 unknown chloro organic byproducts the number of mono chloro and di chloro byproducts was found to be 222 and 234 respectively while only 18 formulas were tri chloro or tetra chloro byproducts the three most abundant chloro organic byproducts were assigned as c14h13o6cl c5ho3cl3 and c15h15o7cl with relative intensities of 29 2 12 9 and 9 1 respectively tables s5 s7 c5ho3cl3 is a highly recognized emerging chloro organic byproduct with a plausible structure of trichloro hydroxy cyclopentene dione frequently detected in the finished drinking water gonsior et al 2014 and after chlorination of simulated drinking water pan et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 c14h13o6cl and c15h15o7cl have been detected in a previous study examining the formation of emerging chloro organic byproducts during dom chlorination but with much lower relative abundances 2 5 and 5 3 respectively ruan et al 2021 the relatively high abundance of mono chloro byproducts e g c14h13o6cl and c15h15o7cl generated during the clo2 pre oxidation of dom is likely due to the limited amount of the in situ generated free chlorine chlorine to doc ratio of 0 5 in addition only one tetra chloro byproduct c4h2o2cl4 was detected with a relative intensity of 1 a plausible structure of c4h2o2cl4 is chlorinated butenoic acid e g 2 2 4 4 tetrachloro 3 butenoic acid which has been proposed as the end product generated through ring cleavage hocl addition and hcl elimination during the chlorination of phenolic compounds such as phenol and p hydroxybenzoic acid bull et al 2006 given the significant removal of the highly aromatic formulas in dom after clo2 pre oxidation fig s5 the formation of c4h2o2cl4 is likely due to the destruction of the phenolic moieties in dom by the in situ generated free chlorine 3 2 alteration of dom during the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation the number of recalcitrant removed intensity decreased intensity increased and produced formulas detected in dom after the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation are shown in the clustered bar charts in fig 2a b smaller changes in dom were observed in the uv chlorine treatment with clo2 pre oxidation than that without clo2 pre oxidation as shown in fig 2b only 464 formulas in dom remained unchanged defined as recalcitrant formulas after the uv chlorine process without clo2 pre oxidation hereafter referred to as dom uv chlorine while 653 recalcitrant formulas fig 2a were detected in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation hereafter referred to as dom clo2 uv chlorine a total of 413 removed formulas and 667 intensity decreased formulas were assigned in dom uv chlorine while the number decreased to 326 and 528 respectively in dom clo2 uv chlorine again indicating the fewer changes in dom formulas with clo2 pre oxidation the results indicated that dom was less susceptible to transform under uv chlorine treatment after clo2 pre oxidation the influence of clo2 pre oxidation on dom alteration was further evaluated by comparing the molecular characteristics of the formulas assigned in dom uv chlorine and dom clo2 uv chlorine by calculating the intensity weighted aimod w and o cw the levels of dom changes in the two scenarios were quantitatively examined and compared as shown in fig 2c d the shifting from highly aromatic formulas towards formulas with low aimod was observed in both dom uv chlorine and dom clo2 uv chlorine compared to the raw dom but greater changes were observed in dom uv chlorine the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation only removed formulas with high aromaticity aimod w 0 553 0 001 while the uv chlorine process without clo2 pre oxidation can remove formulas with lower aimod w 0 526 0 001 statistical analysis shown in table s8 in addition the newly produced formulas in dom uv chlorine were more evidently altered from the raw dom aimod w 0 366 and o cw 0 527 in terms of the aromaticity aimod w 0 227 and the level of oxidation o cw 0 684 compared to those in dom clo2 uv chlorine aimod w 0 247 and o cw 0 619 tables s9 s10 these findings further support that the clo2 treated dom became less susceptible to radical and chlorine attack in the uv chlorine process and can be attributed to the alternation of the phenolic moieties in dom to benzoquinones by the clo2 quinone type moieties are known to be less reactive towards chlorine and reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl and cl2 compared to that of electron rich phenol type moieties lei et al 2019 in the uv chlorine process without clo2 pre oxidation the more reactive phenolic moieties in dom can rapidly react with chlorine and radicals to undergo hydroxylation chlorination decarboxylation and ring cleavage reactions sarathy and mohseni 2007 xiang et al 2020 lei et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 generating products with greater alterations in molecular characteristics such as aromaticity and oxidation level 3 3 formation of chloro organic byproducts during the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation 3 3 1 formation of emerging chloro organic byproducts compared to the dom clo2 n 474 552 chloro organic byproducts were newly produced and 43 chloro organic byproducts became undetectable during the subsequent uv chlorine process resulting in a total of 983 byproducts detected by ft icr ms in dom clo2 uv chlorine fig 3a the proportion of tri tetra and penta chloro byproducts n 282 was greatly increased from 3 8 to 28 6 compared to that detected in the clo2 pre oxidation notably the formation of chloro organic byproducts generated during the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation was greatly reduced compared to the scenario without clo2 pre oxidation a total of 1188 chloro organic byproducts were detected in dom uv chlorine fig 3b where 917 out of the 1188 byproducts were also detected in dom clo2 uv chlorine fig s7 statistical analysis shown in table s11 dom uv chlorine generated a greater number of unique chloro organic byproducts n 271 than the dom clo2 uv chlorine did n 66 fig 3c d and the intensities of 370 chloro organic byproducts were significantly decreased in dom clo2 uv chlorine compared to that without clo2 pre oxidation further the total intensity of chloro organic byproducts detected by ft icr ms decreased from 3 13 1010 to 2 17 1010 by 31 with clo2 pre oxidation statistical analysis shown in table s12 suggesting the reduced formation of chloro organic byproducts by clo2 pre oxidation the difference in the elemental composition of the chloro organic byproducts generated in the two scenarios was further demonstrated by characterizing molecular indices including o cw aimod w and the intensity weighted number of chlorine atoms clw as shown in fig 3d the 271 chloro organic byproducts only detected in dom uv chlorine were located in the high o c 0 4 and low aimod 0 5 region in the aimod versus o c plot with o cw and aimod w values of 0 657 and 0 288 respectively these 271 dbps were more oxidized and less aromatic compared to the 983 dbps detected in dom clo2 uv chlorine o cw 0 610 aimod w 0 380 table s13 this indicated that the clo2 pre oxidation shifted some of the chloro organic byproducts speciation from highly oxidized and aliphatic byproducts towards less oxidized and less aliphatic byproducts prasert et al 2021 which is well correlated with the lower o cw and higher aimod w of the cho formulas in dom clo2 uv chlorine compared to those in dom uv chlorine fig 3c d in addition by calculating clw the influence of clo2 pre oxidation on the level of chlorination in chloro organic byproducts was discovered the clw of the 271 chloro organic byproducts only detected in dom uv chlorine was found to be 2 008 while the clw of the 983 chloro organic byproducts generated in dom clo2 uv chlorine was calculated to be 1 611 the decreased number of chlorine atoms in chloro organic byproducts generated in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation can be associated with the transformation of aromatic moieties of dom to aliphatic moieties which have a lower chlorine reactivity deborde and von gunten 2008 dickenson et al 2008 additionally chlorine and rcs e g cl clo and cl2 are known to preferentially react with electron rich moieties deborde and von gunten 2008 lei et al 2021 and the clo2 process has been reported to greatly reduce the edc of dom wenk et al 2013 houska et al 2021 fan et al 2022 the significant reduction in edc after clo2 pre oxidation may reduce the dom reactions in uv chlorine treatment and thus reduce the formation of chloro organic byproducts 3 3 2 formation of commonly known chloro organic byproducts tocl and inorganic byproducts the formation of commonly known chloro organic byproducts i e six volatile organic byproducts and two haas tocl and inorganic byproducts i e chlorite and chlorate in the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation is shown in fig 4 the clo2 pre oxidation decreased the concentrations of the six volatile organic byproducts tcm dcan dcp tcnm tcp and ch and the two haas dcaa and tcaa by 27 and 19 respectively in the subsequent uv chlorine process compared to the scenario without pre oxidation the decreased formation of these byproducts is consistent with the small molecule unknown byproducts detected in ft icr ms a decrease in the number and the intensities of unknown chloro organic byproducts with a carbon number of 5 was observed in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation the tocl concentrations in the two scenarios were also compared the clo2 pre oxidation decreased the tocl concentration from 502 5 to 361 5 μg l 1 as cl by 28 which is consistent with the decreased total intensity of chloro organic byproducts by 31 detected by ft icr ms inorganic byproducts chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 were also evaluated as they may be formed from clo2 oxidation and chlorine photolysis padhi et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 at 30 min clo2 pre oxidation 1 0 mg l 1 produced 0 52 0 03 mg l 1 chlorite 0 05 0 01 mg l 1 chlorate fig 4d and 0 10 0 01 mg l 1 hocl fig s3 with yields of 65 5 and 16 respectively which was in line with previous studies sorlini et al 2014 rougé et al 2018 padhi et al 2019 as shown in fig 4d no chlorite was detected in the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation while the concentration of chlorate generated from the uv chlorine process was determined to be 0 94 0 02 mg l 1 which increased to 1 17 0 01 mg l 1 with clo2 pre oxidation the increase of chlorate formation is attributed to the reactions between chlorite with radical species e g oh and rcs table s14 which partially convert chlorite to chlorate under the experimental conditions the yield of chlorate 0 23 mg l 1 from chlorite was 36 which is consistent with the previously reported value of 46 zhao et al 2021 in addition experiments with the addition of tert butanol tba a scavenger for oh and rcs were conducted to further verify the role of radicals in reducing chlorite to chlorate as shown in fig s8 the chlorate concentration dropped from 1 17 0 01 to 0 12 0 02 mg l 1 in the presence of tba which confirms the crucial role of radical species in chlorate formation it should be noted that although the level of chlorate in finished drinking water was not regulated by epa usepa 2006 the chlorate concentration in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation is above the who 2017 guideline value of 0 7 mg l 1 it has been reported that granular activated carbon can adsorb the chlorate generated from clo2 oxidation in bench scale column experiments gonce and voudrias 1994 sorlini et al 2016a further investigation is needed to evaluate the efficiency of the integrated treatment processes for controlling both the organic and inorganic byproducts in real world applications the environmental parameters and operational conditions may vary in different water sources therefore additional tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of ph clo2 dosage and pre oxidation time on the formation of byproducts in the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation as displayed in fig s9 the formation of tocl in the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation increased by 21 with increasing ph from 6 to 9 resulting in a comparable formation of tocl to the scenario without clo2 pre oxidation at ph 9 fig s9c this implies that the clo2 pre oxidation is more favorable at neutral and acidic ph with the increasing clo2 dosages from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l 1 corresponding clo2 doc mass ratio of 0 1 0 5 greater levels of tocl reduction were achieved fig s10 it has been reported that a higher clo2 dom ratio led to a more significant edc and uv254 reduction in dom wenk et al 2013 which subsequently reduces the formation of chloro organic byproducts in the uv chlorine process nevertheless the chlorate formation in the uv chlorine process increased with increasing clo2 doc ratio likely due to the increased formation of chlorite during the clo2 pre oxidation gan et al 2019 which can react with radicals and form chlorate during the uv chlorine process table s14 furthermore a longer pre oxidation time from 2 to 30 min reduced the formation of chloro organic byproducts but increased the yield of chlorate in the uv chlorine process fig s11 this suggests that appropriate operational conditions should be selected to balance the risks from exposure to organic and inorganic byproducts when applying clo2 pre oxidation for the uv chlorine process to evaluate the applicability of this process additional tests were performed in a surface water sample collected from a local source as shown in fig s12 clo2 pre oxidation reduced the formation of six volatile organic byproducts two haas and tocl by 28 27 and 31 respectively indicating the effectiveness of clo2 pre oxidation in controlling chloro organic byproduct formation in real water samples however similar to the results obtained from srnom an increment of chlorate concentration from 1 02 0 02 mg l 1 to 1 12 0 08 mg l 1 was observed when applying clo2 pre oxidation for the uv chlorine process 3 4 influence of clo2 pre oxidation on the toxicity of water treated by the uv chlorine process the aforementioned results indicated that clo2 pre oxidation ahead of uv chlorine treatment resulted in fewer changes in dom composition decreased the formation of chloro organic byproducts but enhanced the formation of chlorate compared to the scenario without clo2 pre oxidation as such toxicity evaluation including genotoxicity cytotoxicity and androgenic and estrogenic activities was undertaken as shown in fig 5a the genotoxicity of the uv chlorine treated dom solution with clo2 pre oxidation 38 6 3 3 ng l 1 equivalent 4 nqo was reduced by 26 compared to that without clo2 pre oxidation 51 9 6 8 ng l 1 equivalent 4 nqo p 0 05 the cytotoxicity was compared using the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay which has been used for assessing the comparative cytotoxicity of real water samples gong et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 fig 5b shows the influence of clo2 pre oxidation on the cytotoxicity indices ctis of uv chlorine treated dom solution the dose response curves and the corresponding ec50 values are given in fig s13 a 20 decrease of cti from 3 12 0 39 to 2 51 0 23 was observed in the water treated using the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation compared to that without clo2 pre oxidation p 0 05 suggesting clo2 pre oxidation may reduce the cytotoxicity of water treated by the uv chlorine process it should be noted that the overall genotoxicity equivalents and cytotoxicity indices were higher than the sum of the individual inorganic and organic fractions fig s14 although the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 this might suggest a potential synergistic effect of the organic and inorganic byproducts in uv chlorine treated water on genotoxicity which highlights the importance of toxicity evaluation of the whole byproduct mixture the theoretical genotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by known byproducts were also calculated and compared between the two scenarios the calculation is detailed in text s4 and table s15 as displayed in fig s15a tcnm and dcan contributed the most to the overall calculated genotoxicity and the decreased formation of these two byproducts due to clo2 pre oxidation greatly reduced the calculated genotoxicity haas and dcan are the major contributors to the calculated cytotoxicity fig s15b with the clo2 pre oxidation a reduction of 28 p 0 05 in the calculated cytotoxicity was observed in comparison to that without pre oxidation interestingly clo2 pre oxidation reduced the calculated genotoxicity and cytotoxicity to a greater extent compared to the experimentally determined toxicities this implies that the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by the unknown fraction of chloro organic byproducts were less affected by the clo2 pre oxidation compared to that by the known byproducts besides genotoxicity and cytotoxicity the androgenic and estrogenic activities of the byproduct mixture were further tested to evaluate the endocrine disrupting effects of the oxidized dom solution the responses of the androgenic and estrogenic activities from the uv chlorine treated samples with and without clo2 pre oxidation were lower than 15 of the relative activity induced by the positive control indicating that their androgenic and estrogenic activities were not significant fig s16 to sum up all the toxicity findings suggested that the clo2 pre oxidation is able to reduce the induction of genotoxicity and cytotoxicity from the uv chlorine treated water 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the clo2 pre oxidation approach is effective in reducing the formation of chloro organic byproducts and the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of uv chlorine treated water by applying ft icr ms analysis the molecular level alteration of dom indicated that clo2 preferentially attacked dom moieties with high aromaticity and high carbon number e g carbon number 18 to generate moieties with higher levels of saturation and lower carbon numbers such alterations caused decreasing dom reactivity and ultimately resulted in the formation of decreased number of unknown chloro organic byproducts detected by ft icr ms the average number of chlorine atoms in the unknown chloro organic byproducts formed after the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation was also decreased compared to the scenario without clo2 pre oxidation in addition the clo2 pre oxidation altered the elemental composition of unknown chloro organic byproducts towards less oxidized and less aliphatic ones the total intensities of the unknown chloro organic byproducts as well as the concentrations of the known organic byproducts and tocl in the subsequent uv chlorine process were decreased in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation the only byproduct that showed an increasing trend in the uv chlorine treated sample with clo2 pre oxidation was chlorate primarily due to the clo2 decomposition and the oxidation of chlorite by radical species considering the potential adverse health effect induced by chlorate further study is needed to select proper post treatment strategies for controlling the formation of inorganic byproducts the overall genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of the whole water mixture including both the inorganic and organic fractions exhibited significant reduction by the clo2 pre oxidation and the androgenic and estrogenic activities showed negligible changes further investigation is needed to verify the potential synergistic toxic effect of organic and inorganic byproducts overall the findings of this study support that the proposed clo2 pre oxidation can be an effective approach for reducing the formation of chloro organic byproducts and toxicity in the subsequent uv chlorine process optimized conditions for controlling chlorate formation need further

16125,the formation of undesirable chloro organic byproducts is of great concern in the uv chlorine process in this study chlorine dioxide clo2 pre oxidation was applied to control the formation of chloro organic byproducts and the toxicity in uv chlorine treated water the molecular level changes in dissolved organic matter dom were tracked by using fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and clo2 pre oxidation was found to preferentially react with dom moieties with high aromaticity level and with a carbon number of 18 producing compounds with a higher degree of oxidation and lower aromaticity the clo2 treated dom was found to be less susceptible to attack by radicals and free chlorine in the uv chlorine process compared to the raw dom clo2 pre oxidation resulted in a significant decrease in the number of unknown chloro organic byproducts i e 17 and the total intensity of organic chlorine detected by ft icr ms i e 31 the molecular characteristics such as o c aromaticity index and the average number of chlorine atoms of these unknown chloro organic byproducts generated in the scenarios with and without clo2 pre oxidation were also different additionally clo2 pre oxidation reduced the genotoxicity sos umu test and cytotoxicity hep g2 cytotoxicity assay of uv chlorine treated water by 26 and 20 respectively the findings in this study highlight the merits of clo2 pre oxidation for controlling chloro organic byproducts and reducing the toxicity of water treated by the uv chlorine process in actual practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ft icr ms chloro organic byproducts uv chlorine chlorine dioxide genotoxicity cytotoxicity 1 introduction the occurrence of micropollutants e g pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products in drinking water sources has led to public concerns because of their potential threats to human health luo et al 2014 ding et al 2020 zhong et al 2021 conventional water treatment plants can only partially remove such micropollutants westerhoff et al 2005 highlighting the need for incorporating advanced micropollutant abatement processes such as advanced oxidation processes aops in the treatment trains the ultraviolet uv chlorine process has been reported to effectively degrade recalcitrant micropollutants guo et al 2018 chuang et al 2019 kwon et al 2020 compared to the uv h2o2 process that has been frequently implemented for water treatment the uv chlorine process has superior efficiency in hydroxy radical ho generation and can also generate reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 which have high reactivity towards micropollutants with electron rich groups fang et al 2014 chuang et al 2017 however in the uv chlorine aop undesirable chloro organic byproducts e g trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are generated from chlorine and rcs reactions with dissolved organic matter dom sun et al 2019 which could induce potential carcinogenicity and other risks to human health richardson and kimura 2017 mazhar et al 2020 since dom is ubiquitously present in surface water control of these undesirable byproducts has become a bottleneck when applying the uv chlorine process in actual water treatment some pre oxidation processes such as ozonation have been implemented to remove taste odor color and reduce the formation of chloro organic byproducts during chlorine disinfection phungsai et al 2018 ike et al 2019 however the formation of bromate bro3 a carcinogenic compound the increased assimilable organic carbon and the high capital cost of ozonation equipment are of concern von gunten 2003 hammes et al 2006 chlorine dioxide clo2 exhibits a higher selectivity toward compounds with electron rich moieties e g phenolic groups which are radical scavengers and important precursors of chloro organic byproducts li et al 2016 than ozone does wenk et al 2013 this makes clo2 pre oxidation a commonly used process to mitigate the formation of chloro organic byproducts by decreasing the reactivity of dom towards chlorine prior to the disinfection step yang et al 2013a 2013b criquet et al 2015 gan et al 2020 in addition clo2 has been also used as a secondary disinfectant as an alternative to chlorine to safeguard the water in drinking water distribution systems especially in italy sorlini et al 2016b previous studies have investigated the reaction mechanisms of clo2 with dom moieties wajon et al 1982 świetlik et al 2004 wenk et al 2013 rougé et al 2020 clo2 is highly reactive towards compounds with electron donating groups e g phenolic type moieties k 103 108 m 1s 1 and results in great decrease in the electron donating capacity edc of dom wenk et al 2013 houska et al 2021 the dominant pathway of clo2 attack has been reported to be electron transfer which converts phenolic moieties to oxidized benzoquinones and subsequently forms ring cleavage products gan et al 2020 additionally reduced hydrophobicity and aromaticity of dom fractions were observed during clo2 oxidation świetlik et al 2004 the alteration of dom e g decreased aromaticity and edc after clo2 treatment ultimately decreased the dbp formation in the subsequent chlorination rougé et al 2020 a recent study reported that clo2 pre oxidation significantly reduced the formation of thms and haas in the subsequent uv chlorine process fan et al 2022 therefore clo2 pre oxidation could be an effective approach for controlling the formation of chloro organic byproducts and reducing the toxicity of the water treated by the uv chlorine process however the commonly known chloro organic byproducts e g thms and haas only account for less than 30 of the total organic halogen tox krasner et al 2006 the influence of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts e g haloacetamides halophenolics and halobenzoquinones many of which could be more toxic than thms and haas remains uncharacterized plewa et al 2008 liu and zhang 2014 lyon et al 2014 a few conventional analytical methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy and uv vis spectrophotometry have been applied to characterize the bulk properties of dom during the clo2 pre oxidation świetlik and sikorska 2004 yang et al 2013a rougé et al 2020 however as dom is a complex mixture of thousands of organic compounds leenheer and croué 2003 the molecular level changes of dom and the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts remain largely unclear fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is an ultra high resolution mass spectrometer providing accurate mass to charge m z ratios and chemical formulas of the detected ions the high mass accuracy within 1 ppm of m z error makes it a powerful non targeted technique to decipher the elemental composition and structural features of dom and characterize the unknown chloro organic byproducts zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2018 previous studies have used ft icr ms to elucidate the changes of dom at the molecular level during aops such as the uv h2o2 and ozonation processes remucal et al 2020 bulman and remucal 2020 xiang et al 2020 the unknown fraction of the chloro organic byproducts generated during chlorination and the uv chlorine process has been characterized ruan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the exploration of the alteration of dom properties and the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts using ft icr ms for the uv chlorine treated samples with and without clo2 pre oxidation can provide more insights into the role of clo2 pre oxidation moreover despite the potential reduction in the formation of chloro organic byproducts the incorporation of pre oxidation by clo2 may promote the formation of inorganic byproducts such as chlorite and chlorate gan et al 2016 2019 terhalle et al 2018 hupperich et al 2020 the changes in the overall toxicity of the water treated by the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation are still unknown and need to be evaluated the objectives of this study are to evaluate the role of clo2 pre oxidation in controlling the formation of chloro organic byproducts and toxicity during the subsequent uv chlorine treatment the molecular level changes of dom and the formation of unknown chloro organic byproducts from clo2 pre oxidation were examined the alteration of dom and formation of unknown and known byproducts volatile organic byproducts haas total organic chlorine tocl chlorite and chlorate were explored during uv chlorine treatment with and without clo2 pre oxidation the toxicity changes including genotoxicity cytotoxicity and androgenic and estrogenic activities were examined after the sequential treatments the results of this study suggest the effectiveness of clo2 pre oxidation in controlling the formation of chloro organic byproducts and the toxicity during the uv chlorine treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals information on the chemicals and solutions is provided in text s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 experimental procedures the experimental procedures are summarized in text s1 in the supplementary material 2 3 analytical methods the genotoxicity of the extracted sample was measured by sos umu tests using salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 according to international standard iso 13829 2000 iso 2000 and expressed as the equivalent concentration of 4 nitroquinoline noxide 4 nqo ng 4 nqo l 1 the cytotoxicity of the extracted sample was evaluated using hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay according to gong et al 2017 and calculated as cytotoxicity indices ctis wagner and plewa 2017 androgenic and estrogenic activities of the water samples were evaluated with mda kb2 cells and mvln cells by following the procedures described in xu et al 2019 the detailed analytical procedures of genotoxicity cytotoxicity and androgenic and estrogenic activities tests are provided in text s1 a bruker solarix 7 0 t ft icr ms bruker daltonics gmbh germany equipped with an electrospray ionization source was used to accurately detect the m z of ions in the dom samples in the negative ionization mode reasons for selecting the negative ionization mode are given in text s2 mass spectra were externally calibrated and then internally calibrated using a series of homolog compounds commonly present in dom koch et al 2007 ions with a m z of 150 600 a signal to noise ratio of 10 and a specific intensity of 1 000 000 were exported for formula assignment using in house developed software xiang et al 2020 the mass error was 0 5 ppm for all the assigned formulas the measured and theoretical isotope patterns of the chloro organic byproducts were checked to confirm the formula assignment accuracy calculation of the total intensity of chloro organic byproducts followed the method described in xiang et al 2020 the comparison of the changes in the intensity of the formulas was all based on the raw dom all the experiments were at least duplicated and the number of replicates was shown in the corresponding figure captions error bars in the figures represent the standard deviations from replicates other analytical methods used in this study are described in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of dom and formation of chloro organic byproducts during clo2 pre oxidation the molecular level changes of dom during clo2 pre oxidation are displayed in fig 1 although the number of formulas assigned to the raw dom n 2094 and the dom treated by clo2 pre oxidation hereafter referred to as dom clo2 n 2038 was comparable the elemental composition of dom was drastically altered by clo2 pre oxidation the formulas were classified into five groups i e recalcitrant removed intensity decreased intensity increased and produced formulas the definition is given in text s3 and the alteration in their elemental compositions was visualized by the van krevelen diagram which shows the h c and the o c ratios of each formula as shown in fig 1a 244 out of the 2094 formulas assigned in the raw dom were removed after clo2 pre oxidation and a significant decrease in the intensity of 286 formulas was observed over 20 difference in the intensity is considered as a significant change in this study text s3 the removed and intensity decreased formulas were clustered in the region with relatively lower o c ratios with intensity weighted o c ratios o cw of 0 462 and 0 530 respectively compared to the 188 newly produced o cw 0 617 and 325 intensity increased o cw 0 608 formulas the higher o cw observed in the newly produced and intensity increased formulas indicated an increase in the level of oxidation of dom by clo2 pre oxidation prasert et al 2021 oxygen transfer reactions may proceed with the release of hocl fig s3 during the one electron transfer reactions of clo2 with organic compounds for example clo2 oxidation of phenol and olefins generates benzoquinone and ketones respectively with increased o c ratios together with the release of a substantial amount of hocl wajon et al 1982 wenk et al 2013 gan et al 2020 the intensity weighted h c ratios h cw of the removed and newly produced formulas by clo2 pre oxidation were calculated to be 0 739 and 1 096 respectively and the intensity weighted double bond equivalence dbew values were 16 69 and 11 08 respectively table s4 this indicates an increased level of saturation and suggests potential changes in the aromaticity of dom by clo2 pre oxidation to further investigate such changes a modified aromaticity index aimod was used the parameter aimod describes the existence of aromatic moieties in dom and a larger number means a higher degree of aromaticity e g aimod phenol 0 636 koch and dittmar 2006 the intensity weighted aimod w of the newly produced formulas 0 280 was lower compared to that of the removed formulas 0 578 table s4 suggesting the ring cleavage of aromatic moieties and the formation of aliphatic type moieties and consistent with the decreased uv254 value fig s4 interestingly nearly all formulas with a carbon number larger than 18 in the high aromaticity region aimod 0 5 were removed or exhibited a decrease in intensity after clo2 pre oxidation while the formulas in the low aromaticity region aimod 0 5 were more recalcitrant to clo2 reactions fig s5 previous studies investigating the mechanisms of the interactions between clo2 with dom have reported that clo2 preferentially reacts with the aromatic moieties e g phenolic type moieties in dom wajon et al 1982 wenk et al 2013 gan et al 2020 the findings in our study provided molecular level evidence for the proposed reaction mechanism and indicated that the high carbon number moieties i e carbon number 18 could be more susceptible to clo2 attack than the low carbon number ones when they have a similar level of aromaticity the formation of commonly known chloro organic byproducts including volatile organic byproducts 4 6 0 3 μg l 1 and haas 6 2 0 2 μg l 1 during clo2 pre oxidation clo2 1 0 mg l 1 pre oxidation time 30 min ph 7 5 were found to be insignificant fig 4a b while the unknown chloro organic byproducts 114 11 μg l 1 as cl comprised 93 of the tocl 122 11 μg l 1 as cl fig 4c however it was surprising that 474 unknown chloro organic byproducts were detected by ft icr ms fig 1b and 398 out of the 474 unknown dbps have a relative intensity of 1 it should be noted that all the measured isotope patterns of the chloro organic byproducts were carefully checked in regard to their theoretical isotope patterns to ensure the correct formula assignment tables s5 s7 although clo2 has been reported as not being able to chlorinate moieties in dom free chlorine can be generated in situ from the clo2 oxidation of dom wajon et al 1982 terhalle et al 2018 rougé et al 2020 the yield of hocl was found to be up to 20 of clo2 consumption under the experimental conditions fig s3 which was comparable to the values up to 25 reported in previous studies rougé et al 2018 hupperich et al 2020 houska et al 2021 the formation of hundreds of unknown chloro organic byproducts can be explained by the electrophilic substitution or chlorine addition on dom constituents by the in situ formed free chlorine the elemental composition of the unknown chloro organic byproducts was visualized through the van kreleven diagram fig 1b among the 474 unknown chloro organic byproducts the number of mono chloro and di chloro byproducts was found to be 222 and 234 respectively while only 18 formulas were tri chloro or tetra chloro byproducts the three most abundant chloro organic byproducts were assigned as c14h13o6cl c5ho3cl3 and c15h15o7cl with relative intensities of 29 2 12 9 and 9 1 respectively tables s5 s7 c5ho3cl3 is a highly recognized emerging chloro organic byproduct with a plausible structure of trichloro hydroxy cyclopentene dione frequently detected in the finished drinking water gonsior et al 2014 and after chlorination of simulated drinking water pan et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 c14h13o6cl and c15h15o7cl have been detected in a previous study examining the formation of emerging chloro organic byproducts during dom chlorination but with much lower relative abundances 2 5 and 5 3 respectively ruan et al 2021 the relatively high abundance of mono chloro byproducts e g c14h13o6cl and c15h15o7cl generated during the clo2 pre oxidation of dom is likely due to the limited amount of the in situ generated free chlorine chlorine to doc ratio of 0 5 in addition only one tetra chloro byproduct c4h2o2cl4 was detected with a relative intensity of 1 a plausible structure of c4h2o2cl4 is chlorinated butenoic acid e g 2 2 4 4 tetrachloro 3 butenoic acid which has been proposed as the end product generated through ring cleavage hocl addition and hcl elimination during the chlorination of phenolic compounds such as phenol and p hydroxybenzoic acid bull et al 2006 given the significant removal of the highly aromatic formulas in dom after clo2 pre oxidation fig s5 the formation of c4h2o2cl4 is likely due to the destruction of the phenolic moieties in dom by the in situ generated free chlorine 3 2 alteration of dom during the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation the number of recalcitrant removed intensity decreased intensity increased and produced formulas detected in dom after the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation are shown in the clustered bar charts in fig 2a b smaller changes in dom were observed in the uv chlorine treatment with clo2 pre oxidation than that without clo2 pre oxidation as shown in fig 2b only 464 formulas in dom remained unchanged defined as recalcitrant formulas after the uv chlorine process without clo2 pre oxidation hereafter referred to as dom uv chlorine while 653 recalcitrant formulas fig 2a were detected in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation hereafter referred to as dom clo2 uv chlorine a total of 413 removed formulas and 667 intensity decreased formulas were assigned in dom uv chlorine while the number decreased to 326 and 528 respectively in dom clo2 uv chlorine again indicating the fewer changes in dom formulas with clo2 pre oxidation the results indicated that dom was less susceptible to transform under uv chlorine treatment after clo2 pre oxidation the influence of clo2 pre oxidation on dom alteration was further evaluated by comparing the molecular characteristics of the formulas assigned in dom uv chlorine and dom clo2 uv chlorine by calculating the intensity weighted aimod w and o cw the levels of dom changes in the two scenarios were quantitatively examined and compared as shown in fig 2c d the shifting from highly aromatic formulas towards formulas with low aimod was observed in both dom uv chlorine and dom clo2 uv chlorine compared to the raw dom but greater changes were observed in dom uv chlorine the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation only removed formulas with high aromaticity aimod w 0 553 0 001 while the uv chlorine process without clo2 pre oxidation can remove formulas with lower aimod w 0 526 0 001 statistical analysis shown in table s8 in addition the newly produced formulas in dom uv chlorine were more evidently altered from the raw dom aimod w 0 366 and o cw 0 527 in terms of the aromaticity aimod w 0 227 and the level of oxidation o cw 0 684 compared to those in dom clo2 uv chlorine aimod w 0 247 and o cw 0 619 tables s9 s10 these findings further support that the clo2 treated dom became less susceptible to radical and chlorine attack in the uv chlorine process and can be attributed to the alternation of the phenolic moieties in dom to benzoquinones by the clo2 quinone type moieties are known to be less reactive towards chlorine and reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl and cl2 compared to that of electron rich phenol type moieties lei et al 2019 in the uv chlorine process without clo2 pre oxidation the more reactive phenolic moieties in dom can rapidly react with chlorine and radicals to undergo hydroxylation chlorination decarboxylation and ring cleavage reactions sarathy and mohseni 2007 xiang et al 2020 lei et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 generating products with greater alterations in molecular characteristics such as aromaticity and oxidation level 3 3 formation of chloro organic byproducts during the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation 3 3 1 formation of emerging chloro organic byproducts compared to the dom clo2 n 474 552 chloro organic byproducts were newly produced and 43 chloro organic byproducts became undetectable during the subsequent uv chlorine process resulting in a total of 983 byproducts detected by ft icr ms in dom clo2 uv chlorine fig 3a the proportion of tri tetra and penta chloro byproducts n 282 was greatly increased from 3 8 to 28 6 compared to that detected in the clo2 pre oxidation notably the formation of chloro organic byproducts generated during the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation was greatly reduced compared to the scenario without clo2 pre oxidation a total of 1188 chloro organic byproducts were detected in dom uv chlorine fig 3b where 917 out of the 1188 byproducts were also detected in dom clo2 uv chlorine fig s7 statistical analysis shown in table s11 dom uv chlorine generated a greater number of unique chloro organic byproducts n 271 than the dom clo2 uv chlorine did n 66 fig 3c d and the intensities of 370 chloro organic byproducts were significantly decreased in dom clo2 uv chlorine compared to that without clo2 pre oxidation further the total intensity of chloro organic byproducts detected by ft icr ms decreased from 3 13 1010 to 2 17 1010 by 31 with clo2 pre oxidation statistical analysis shown in table s12 suggesting the reduced formation of chloro organic byproducts by clo2 pre oxidation the difference in the elemental composition of the chloro organic byproducts generated in the two scenarios was further demonstrated by characterizing molecular indices including o cw aimod w and the intensity weighted number of chlorine atoms clw as shown in fig 3d the 271 chloro organic byproducts only detected in dom uv chlorine were located in the high o c 0 4 and low aimod 0 5 region in the aimod versus o c plot with o cw and aimod w values of 0 657 and 0 288 respectively these 271 dbps were more oxidized and less aromatic compared to the 983 dbps detected in dom clo2 uv chlorine o cw 0 610 aimod w 0 380 table s13 this indicated that the clo2 pre oxidation shifted some of the chloro organic byproducts speciation from highly oxidized and aliphatic byproducts towards less oxidized and less aliphatic byproducts prasert et al 2021 which is well correlated with the lower o cw and higher aimod w of the cho formulas in dom clo2 uv chlorine compared to those in dom uv chlorine fig 3c d in addition by calculating clw the influence of clo2 pre oxidation on the level of chlorination in chloro organic byproducts was discovered the clw of the 271 chloro organic byproducts only detected in dom uv chlorine was found to be 2 008 while the clw of the 983 chloro organic byproducts generated in dom clo2 uv chlorine was calculated to be 1 611 the decreased number of chlorine atoms in chloro organic byproducts generated in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation can be associated with the transformation of aromatic moieties of dom to aliphatic moieties which have a lower chlorine reactivity deborde and von gunten 2008 dickenson et al 2008 additionally chlorine and rcs e g cl clo and cl2 are known to preferentially react with electron rich moieties deborde and von gunten 2008 lei et al 2021 and the clo2 process has been reported to greatly reduce the edc of dom wenk et al 2013 houska et al 2021 fan et al 2022 the significant reduction in edc after clo2 pre oxidation may reduce the dom reactions in uv chlorine treatment and thus reduce the formation of chloro organic byproducts 3 3 2 formation of commonly known chloro organic byproducts tocl and inorganic byproducts the formation of commonly known chloro organic byproducts i e six volatile organic byproducts and two haas tocl and inorganic byproducts i e chlorite and chlorate in the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation is shown in fig 4 the clo2 pre oxidation decreased the concentrations of the six volatile organic byproducts tcm dcan dcp tcnm tcp and ch and the two haas dcaa and tcaa by 27 and 19 respectively in the subsequent uv chlorine process compared to the scenario without pre oxidation the decreased formation of these byproducts is consistent with the small molecule unknown byproducts detected in ft icr ms a decrease in the number and the intensities of unknown chloro organic byproducts with a carbon number of 5 was observed in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation the tocl concentrations in the two scenarios were also compared the clo2 pre oxidation decreased the tocl concentration from 502 5 to 361 5 μg l 1 as cl by 28 which is consistent with the decreased total intensity of chloro organic byproducts by 31 detected by ft icr ms inorganic byproducts chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 were also evaluated as they may be formed from clo2 oxidation and chlorine photolysis padhi et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 at 30 min clo2 pre oxidation 1 0 mg l 1 produced 0 52 0 03 mg l 1 chlorite 0 05 0 01 mg l 1 chlorate fig 4d and 0 10 0 01 mg l 1 hocl fig s3 with yields of 65 5 and 16 respectively which was in line with previous studies sorlini et al 2014 rougé et al 2018 padhi et al 2019 as shown in fig 4d no chlorite was detected in the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation while the concentration of chlorate generated from the uv chlorine process was determined to be 0 94 0 02 mg l 1 which increased to 1 17 0 01 mg l 1 with clo2 pre oxidation the increase of chlorate formation is attributed to the reactions between chlorite with radical species e g oh and rcs table s14 which partially convert chlorite to chlorate under the experimental conditions the yield of chlorate 0 23 mg l 1 from chlorite was 36 which is consistent with the previously reported value of 46 zhao et al 2021 in addition experiments with the addition of tert butanol tba a scavenger for oh and rcs were conducted to further verify the role of radicals in reducing chlorite to chlorate as shown in fig s8 the chlorate concentration dropped from 1 17 0 01 to 0 12 0 02 mg l 1 in the presence of tba which confirms the crucial role of radical species in chlorate formation it should be noted that although the level of chlorate in finished drinking water was not regulated by epa usepa 2006 the chlorate concentration in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation is above the who 2017 guideline value of 0 7 mg l 1 it has been reported that granular activated carbon can adsorb the chlorate generated from clo2 oxidation in bench scale column experiments gonce and voudrias 1994 sorlini et al 2016a further investigation is needed to evaluate the efficiency of the integrated treatment processes for controlling both the organic and inorganic byproducts in real world applications the environmental parameters and operational conditions may vary in different water sources therefore additional tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of ph clo2 dosage and pre oxidation time on the formation of byproducts in the uv chlorine process with and without clo2 pre oxidation as displayed in fig s9 the formation of tocl in the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation increased by 21 with increasing ph from 6 to 9 resulting in a comparable formation of tocl to the scenario without clo2 pre oxidation at ph 9 fig s9c this implies that the clo2 pre oxidation is more favorable at neutral and acidic ph with the increasing clo2 dosages from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l 1 corresponding clo2 doc mass ratio of 0 1 0 5 greater levels of tocl reduction were achieved fig s10 it has been reported that a higher clo2 dom ratio led to a more significant edc and uv254 reduction in dom wenk et al 2013 which subsequently reduces the formation of chloro organic byproducts in the uv chlorine process nevertheless the chlorate formation in the uv chlorine process increased with increasing clo2 doc ratio likely due to the increased formation of chlorite during the clo2 pre oxidation gan et al 2019 which can react with radicals and form chlorate during the uv chlorine process table s14 furthermore a longer pre oxidation time from 2 to 30 min reduced the formation of chloro organic byproducts but increased the yield of chlorate in the uv chlorine process fig s11 this suggests that appropriate operational conditions should be selected to balance the risks from exposure to organic and inorganic byproducts when applying clo2 pre oxidation for the uv chlorine process to evaluate the applicability of this process additional tests were performed in a surface water sample collected from a local source as shown in fig s12 clo2 pre oxidation reduced the formation of six volatile organic byproducts two haas and tocl by 28 27 and 31 respectively indicating the effectiveness of clo2 pre oxidation in controlling chloro organic byproduct formation in real water samples however similar to the results obtained from srnom an increment of chlorate concentration from 1 02 0 02 mg l 1 to 1 12 0 08 mg l 1 was observed when applying clo2 pre oxidation for the uv chlorine process 3 4 influence of clo2 pre oxidation on the toxicity of water treated by the uv chlorine process the aforementioned results indicated that clo2 pre oxidation ahead of uv chlorine treatment resulted in fewer changes in dom composition decreased the formation of chloro organic byproducts but enhanced the formation of chlorate compared to the scenario without clo2 pre oxidation as such toxicity evaluation including genotoxicity cytotoxicity and androgenic and estrogenic activities was undertaken as shown in fig 5a the genotoxicity of the uv chlorine treated dom solution with clo2 pre oxidation 38 6 3 3 ng l 1 equivalent 4 nqo was reduced by 26 compared to that without clo2 pre oxidation 51 9 6 8 ng l 1 equivalent 4 nqo p 0 05 the cytotoxicity was compared using the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay which has been used for assessing the comparative cytotoxicity of real water samples gong et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 fig 5b shows the influence of clo2 pre oxidation on the cytotoxicity indices ctis of uv chlorine treated dom solution the dose response curves and the corresponding ec50 values are given in fig s13 a 20 decrease of cti from 3 12 0 39 to 2 51 0 23 was observed in the water treated using the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation compared to that without clo2 pre oxidation p 0 05 suggesting clo2 pre oxidation may reduce the cytotoxicity of water treated by the uv chlorine process it should be noted that the overall genotoxicity equivalents and cytotoxicity indices were higher than the sum of the individual inorganic and organic fractions fig s14 although the difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 this might suggest a potential synergistic effect of the organic and inorganic byproducts in uv chlorine treated water on genotoxicity which highlights the importance of toxicity evaluation of the whole byproduct mixture the theoretical genotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by known byproducts were also calculated and compared between the two scenarios the calculation is detailed in text s4 and table s15 as displayed in fig s15a tcnm and dcan contributed the most to the overall calculated genotoxicity and the decreased formation of these two byproducts due to clo2 pre oxidation greatly reduced the calculated genotoxicity haas and dcan are the major contributors to the calculated cytotoxicity fig s15b with the clo2 pre oxidation a reduction of 28 p 0 05 in the calculated cytotoxicity was observed in comparison to that without pre oxidation interestingly clo2 pre oxidation reduced the calculated genotoxicity and cytotoxicity to a greater extent compared to the experimentally determined toxicities this implies that the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by the unknown fraction of chloro organic byproducts were less affected by the clo2 pre oxidation compared to that by the known byproducts besides genotoxicity and cytotoxicity the androgenic and estrogenic activities of the byproduct mixture were further tested to evaluate the endocrine disrupting effects of the oxidized dom solution the responses of the androgenic and estrogenic activities from the uv chlorine treated samples with and without clo2 pre oxidation were lower than 15 of the relative activity induced by the positive control indicating that their androgenic and estrogenic activities were not significant fig s16 to sum up all the toxicity findings suggested that the clo2 pre oxidation is able to reduce the induction of genotoxicity and cytotoxicity from the uv chlorine treated water 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that the clo2 pre oxidation approach is effective in reducing the formation of chloro organic byproducts and the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of uv chlorine treated water by applying ft icr ms analysis the molecular level alteration of dom indicated that clo2 preferentially attacked dom moieties with high aromaticity and high carbon number e g carbon number 18 to generate moieties with higher levels of saturation and lower carbon numbers such alterations caused decreasing dom reactivity and ultimately resulted in the formation of decreased number of unknown chloro organic byproducts detected by ft icr ms the average number of chlorine atoms in the unknown chloro organic byproducts formed after the uv chlorine process with clo2 pre oxidation was also decreased compared to the scenario without clo2 pre oxidation in addition the clo2 pre oxidation altered the elemental composition of unknown chloro organic byproducts towards less oxidized and less aliphatic ones the total intensities of the unknown chloro organic byproducts as well as the concentrations of the known organic byproducts and tocl in the subsequent uv chlorine process were decreased in the scenario with clo2 pre oxidation the only byproduct that showed an increasing trend in the uv chlorine treated sample with clo2 pre oxidation was chlorate primarily due to the clo2 decomposition and the oxidation of chlorite by radical species considering the potential adverse health effect induced by chlorate further study is needed to select proper post treatment strategies for controlling the formation of inorganic byproducts the overall genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of the whole water mixture including both the inorganic and organic fractions exhibited significant reduction by the clo2 pre oxidation and the androgenic and estrogenic activities showed negligible changes further investigation is needed to verify the potential synergistic toxic effect of organic and inorganic byproducts overall the findings of this study support that the proposed clo2 pre oxidation can be an effective approach for reducing the formation of chloro organic byproducts and toxicity in the subsequent uv chlorine process optimized conditions for controlling chlorate formation need further

16126,the performance of aeration one of the most costly processes at water resource recovery facilities is heavily impacted by actual wastewater characteristics which are commonly taken into account using the alpha factor α this factor varies depending on hydraulic and organic loading such variance includes both time and spatial fluctuations in standard design practice it is often considered as a fixed number or at best a predefined time series the objective of this paper is to propose a new method of predicting plantwide trends in the α factor through the use of process modelling which can accommodate diurnal and seasonal variations the authors concept takes into account the dependence of α on sludge retention time in the form of degradation kinetics the effects of organic loading influent filtered cod the presence or absence of anoxic zones diffuser depth and the impact of high mlss found in certain e g mbr technologies the developed model was calibrated using data from numerous facilities relying on off gas measurements and tests in clean and process water model validation was carried out against averaged α factor gradient data from one plant and against diurnal air

is necessary for design and the analysis of aerobic processes one of the bottlenecks impeding the accurate application of gas transfer theory is the step between clean gas transfer scenarios e g air and clean water and contaminated scenarios e g air and wastewater but due to the unknown composition of the many contaminants that are present in wastewater accuracy is limited numerous investigators have been studying how to quantify and predict the effect of contaminants on gas transfer for the better part of the last century since kessener and ribbius 1934 and eckenfelder and barnhart 1961 the dynamic nature of gas liquid mass transfer significantly impacts the actual process air requirements of water resource recovery affecting operational costs it also plays a role in equipment sizing and capital costs thus defining peak air demand aeration systems are specified based on clean water performance defined as standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote standard oxygen transfer rate sotr kgo2 transferred h 1 and they are scaled to process conditions using the α factor dimensionless as well as the diffuser fouling factor f dimensionless to quantify the decline of performance with time in operation u s environmental protection agency usepa 1989 during the design stage the quantification of sote is the responsibility of the aeration system manufacturer and an independent witness the quantification of α and f are the purview of the design engineers standard testing protocols for sote quantification are adopted in design american society of civil engineers asce 2018 reducing the uncertainty of sote quantification to the experimental error however the research and corresponding literature on the subject of α and f quantification still fall short of significantly reducing uncertainty this shortcoming is not due to negligence but to the nature of the definition of α and f the former is the ratio of oxygen transfer in process water vs clean water i e αsote sote aggregating in one parameter or variable all the uncertainty on the composition of the carbonaceous load applied to the process the latter is site specific and depends on a multitude of factors given that it is a factor that aggregates biofilm adhesion and growth inorganic scaling and diffuser material degradation u s environmental protection agency usepa 1989 kim and boyle 1993 wagner and pöpel 1998 gillot et al 2005 rosso and stenstrom 2006a garrido baserba et al 2016 2017 2018 rosso 2018 fig 1 illustrates an example of how the contribution of factors can be parsed out nevertheless the oxygen transfer operations in a wastewater treatment plant include the compounding effect of all these combined factors α f sote αfsote thereby forcing investigators and design engineers to parse the individual contributions of said factors chiefly because the responsibility of each is attributed to different parties in design rosso 2018 note the significant difference in dynamics amongst these variables with f being the least varying and α the most varying over the short term studying the illustrated example it is apparent that the so called α factor can be the most significant barrier to oxygen dissolution and also the most sensitive to varying loading circumstances karpinska and bridgeman 2016 which among diurnal patterns also show contrast between workdays and weekends the background of this factor relates to contaminants in the wastewater and different aerators in conjunction with links between surfactants and bubble size which have long been studied inter alia kessener and ribbius 1934 stenstrom and gilbert 1981 the α factor is known to be related to the mean cell retention time mcrt of a treatment plant u s environmental protection agency usepa 1989 rosso et al 2005 gillot and héduit 2008 due to kinetic requirements of the processes responsible for eliminating constituents that hamper oxygen transfer this causes α to vary with hydraulic loading which is inversely proportional to the dynamic mcrt consequently the greater the internal recirculation applied to a train the flatter its α gradient will be due to the load distribution effect which also reduces the need for diffuser tapering rosso et al 2007 the presence of non aerated selectors at a treatment line can improve α values overall this is because surface active agents tend to accumulate at bubble surfaces and therefore are harder to access and degrade aerobic processes that directly utilize o2 as an electron acceptor are prone to this effect rosso and stenstrom 2006b 2007 diffuser submergence plays a role too on the local α in aerated tanks gillot and héduit 2008 as the accumulation of surfactants at bubble surfaces toward a steady state in forming a barrier film is facilitated by longer bubble contact times doyle et al 1983 wagner and pöpel 1996 experience shows that oxygen transfer clearly declines with increasing organic contaminant loading and this has been linked with a relation of α factor and soluble cod as well as colloidal cod concentration mueller et al 2000 odize et al 2016 with increased solids concentrations in reactors α reduces locally due to the increased viscosity and non newtonian nature of the mixed liquor and thus drives bubble coalescence which is especially discernible in the range of operating mlss of membrane bioreactors or aerobic digesters muller et al 1995 krampe and krauth 2003 steele et al 2019 below 4 kg tss m 3 though facilities typically operate at shorter mcrt and lower mlss and the resulting α factor is a function of the surfactant available for accumulation at the gas liquid interface baquero rodríguez et al 2018 efforts have previously been made to describe the α factor s dynamic nature relying on algebraic correlations the first examples of such efforts include prediction in function of mcrt air flux and submergence rosso et al 2005 gillot and héduit 2008 one case included the additional impact of mlvss along with mcrt in the equation applied henkel et al 2011 other methods incorporated a direct negative correlation to total cod or soluble cod jiang et al 2017 boog et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 the available empirical models may prove useful in estimating a plant average α factor yet α also varies per reactor and along each reactor analogously to the oxygen uptake since both are driven by process loading however α and our are not correlated because their dynamics are affected by different causes whereas our is driven by the entire biodegradable cod and ammonia load α is mainly affected by a small subset of the bcod molecules i e the surface active agents odize et al 2016 however past work did not address the kinetic and mass balance related phenomena that in fact determine the location specific trend and time based changes regarding the α factor the complex effects of environmental and operational conditions are fundamental in predicting this factor for the accurate design and operation of wrrfs amaral et al 2019 the goal of this paper is to propose a novel approach that incorporates rate equations into process models based upon a surrogate state variable to simulate the wide range of contributors to α while adjusting to diurnal and seasonal variations in hydraulic and organic loading 2 methodological approach the proposed concept of dynamic α factor prediction is based on a typical or average degradable and surface active component as this component sorbs onto flocs and degrades along the process α increases as depicted in fig 2 in a simple conceptual form this new concept was selected because variations of the α value in space and time cannot be directly linked to any of the state variables readily biodegradable substrate ammonia etc usually included in process models to quantify the effect of surface active agents in individual bioreactors and reactive compartments this paper reconsiders the previous dynamic definition of α as a function of cod or bcod jiang et al 2017 boog et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 introducing a state variable named alpha indicator salpha this unitless indicator is dedicated specifically to consider the loading of oxygen transfer impeding contaminants to individual process units in treatment plants and their transformation within those units that incorporate biokinetic and other reactions the change of alpha indicator in time within a completely stirred tank is described by a component balance according to eq 1 1 d s alpha dt q s alpha in q s alpha out rate q s alpha v r the load of alpha indicator to a tank is given by eq 2 2 q s alpha in q in s alpha in similarly the flow of alpha indicator leaving a tank is interpreted in the form of eq 3 3 q s alpha out q out s alpha the kinetic reaction rate of the alpha indicator regarding the removal process of surfactants present as ratesalpha in eqs 4 and 5 is calculated like a rate expression of any integrated state variable derived from a biokinetic matrix by multiplying a stoichiometric coefficient vsalpha with a value of 1 as it indicates a positive change of the indicator towards a saturation value acting as asymptote by a process rate rsalpha 4 rate q s alpha v r rat e s alpha 5 rat e s alpha ν s alpha r s alpha the process rate regarding the elimination of surfactants calculated by eq 6 depends on an alpha improvement rate component qalpha o2 which is correlated with the mlvss concentration meaning that the longer the water is in contact with the sludge the larger change can be achieved in the alpha indicator this correction is in agreement with the observations previously reported by multiple investigators i e that α improves with increasing mlvss for activated sludge processes rosso et al 2005 gillot and héduit 2008 this correction is needed to account for the benefits of biomass sorption of surfactants the driving force of the change in alpha indicator is determined by the difference of the alpha indicator s saturation value 1 by default representing the clean water value and the actual value of the indicator further corrected by a dampening term described in eq 8 6 r s alpha q alpha o 2 x vss dam p alpha s alpha sat s alpha the qalpha o2 component of the process rate is derived from the kinetic model parameter qalpha which must be corrected by the inverse do saturation term in eq 7 in order to account for the enhancing effect of anaerobic or anoxic conditions on the α factor this factor addresses the beneficial effects of anoxic reactors in sorbing surfactants that otherwise would accumulate on bubbles rosso and stenstrom 2006b 2007 thus qalpha o2 is highest at 0 mgo2 l 1 and declines towards qalpha with increasing aerated status 7 q alpha o 2 q alpha 1 f o 2 max alpha s o 2 k o 2 alpha s o 2 f o 2 max alpha the so called dampening is implemented in the form of eq 8 because the improvement in α factor with sludge residence time does not in fact occur according to first order saturation kinetics above a certain ratio of alpha indicator to the saturation value the alpha improvement rate shall be justified by the dampening term to compensate for the otherwise hyperbolic increase in the indicator toward the saturation number 8 dam p alpha 1 coef f damp alpha s alpha s alpha sat po w damp alpha the α factor itself is actually a variable calculated from the alpha indicator according to eq 9 in order to be able to account for local differences in depth and mlss concentration using their respective correction terms 9 α s alpha cor r h diff α cor r tss α in theory the model s alpha

al 2008 was set up in the sumo21 simulation software and used to evaluate potential capex and opex savings by using the predictive α method and the resultingly more accurate blower size control strategy and power demand instead of fixed or scheduled α values generally used in design for the sake of the case studies in this paper there were some modifications necessary compared to the original bsm1 model setup the double exponential settler implementation takács et al 1991 was replaced with a triple exponential approach and compression was included dynamita 2021 furthermore no sensor delays were added because they are not significant for the purpose of these studies all three compartments of the bsm1 reactor cascade were set up with do control and assigned set points of 2 mgo2 l 1 given that the standard bsm1 version provides over aeration with the predefined α kla values 10 h 1 for the first two of the three aerobic zones after initial model testing it was decided that do probes in the three aerated cells and controlled air valves are cheaper compared to purchasing bigger blowers to meet the significant loading peaks and over aerating the first two cells in lower loaded periods that are present in bsm1 do set points were constant throughout the simulation runs for these example studies there is effluent discharge limitation assigned for ammonia nitrogen i e 1 0 mgn l 1 as weekly average and a maximum daily peak of 4 0 mgn l 1 since this paper focuses on aerated processes optimizing the effluent tn via denitrification was not an objective the selected biokinetic model was also replaced from the original asm1 by minisumo in favour of the available gas transfer background calculations along with sumo21 s blower and pump models to assess energy and associated costs dynamita 2021 minisumo is a simplified plant wide model with one step nitrification and denitrification focusing on estimating oxygen requirement and sludge production its gas

temperature and 1 atm pressure throughout the model simulation α factor for aged diffusers αf including the fouling factor f u s environmental protection agency usepa 1989 was used to interpret results having assigned a fixed value of 0 75 for f the selection of a constant f is adequate if the modelling time window is limited e g less than 1 2 months in practice this is best adjusted knowing the diffuser age and the time of the last cleaning procedure jiang et al 2020 3 model calibration and validation data was collected from results of off gas measurement campaigns batch clean water and process water tests as well as from aeration literature review doyle et al 1983 gillot and héduit 2008 leu et al 2009 baquero rodríguez et al 2018 reconciliation of data was carried out according to the iwa good modelling practice guidelines rieger et al 2013 the model was then first fitted to averaged α factor off gas measurements american society of civil engineers asce 2018 from facilities applying newly commissioned fine pore diffusers with and without non aerated selectors in function of the given plant mcrt values as displayed in fig 3 the depth related as well as solids related corrections in the model were fine tuned based upon clean water and process water unsteady state test results american society of civil engineers asce 2006 2018 the α versus influent filtered cod relationship was adjusted based on air flow weighted average diurnal off gas measurements american society of civil engineers asce 2018 from a facility in simi valley california leu et al 2009 as shown by fig 4 which displays a uniform distribution of errors between measured and modelled outputs throughout the day dots on graphs indicate measured data while connected lines represent model outputs calibrated model parameter values are listed in table 1 model validation was carried out against measurements from two water resource recovery facilities firstly steady state α factor simulations were compared to daily averaged off gas test american society of civil engineers asce 2018 results from a municipal plant located in southern california not the aforementioned plant used for calibration with two parallel and independent lines fed separate return sludge rosso et al 2007 both were equipped with ceramic disc diffusers and received the same influent quality but with different volumetric loading thus one of them was operated as a bod removal system i e carbon oxidation only with short sludge retention time while the other one also featured nitrification i e with long sludge retention time throughout the sampling locations measured data points are somewhat scattered compared to a continuous gradient due to the tank hydrodynamic conditions that are difficult to mimic in process modelling this is especially true of the low α measurements at the effluent of both systems and the high outlying datapoints between 130 and 200 m positions of the high mcrt system regardless of this the estimated α trend presented by fig 5 shows good agreement with the measured data reproducing the phenomenon that higher mcrt can result in a two fold increase in oxygen transfer efficiency rosso et al 2005 gillot and héduit 2008 replicating such evolution of α along reactors as well as quantifying air distribution accurately when setting up a plant model are key aspects of diligent plant wide oxygen transfer modelling also these are required for reliable energy and cost calculations and are aligned with the various degrees of oxygenation requirements at different stages of treatment secondly the capability of estimating dynamically varying air flow demand was tested based on a 2 day dataset as seen on fig 6 from a plug flow reactor of wwtp waßmannsdorf in brandenburg germany a facility with denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal schuchardt et al 2007 three zones of the aeration tank with do control in each utilizing a ceramic tube diffuser system were used for comparison modelled results show satisfactory response in terms of air flow despite the slightly higher modelled air flow during the peak loading period a need for larger or more blowers in practice may not be needed if the exercise of scheduling blower operations with varying diurnal do set points is applied being able to reproduce such dynamic profiles along with α in various reactors is essential for the specification of blowers and for the determination of the blower duty schedule also since the n 1 blower added to operations could incur stiff power demand penalties there is a need to overlay these dynamic calculations with the structured power tariff to increase the accuracy of predicting energy consumption power demand energy costs and carbon footprint aymerich et al 2015 amerlinck et al 2016 emami et al 2018 5 results and discussion in the first example the model test configuration ran at a steady state in dry weather conditions using sumo21 s combined global and local solvers followed by five weeks of repeated dry weather diurnal weeks three runs were performed fig 7 to obtain the weekly blower energy demand for the following design scenarios 1 predictive scenario kinetic based model prediction space and time varying αf average calculated αf at 0 49 0 52 and 0 53 in aer1 aer2 and aer3 2 cautious scenario design based on constant αf set to 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 in aer1 aer2 and aer3 3 optimistic scenarios design based on constant αf set to 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 in aer1 aer2 and aer3 compared to the cautious design example that estimates an accumulated blower energy consumption of 44 5 mwh the time and location specific αf prediction use case determines 33 3 mwh suggesting 25 savings on operational costs if blowers with adequate turn down capability were specified the required blower capacity determined with predicted αf is also lower by 21 1 08 104 m3 h 1 instead of 1 37 104 m3 h 1 with corresponding implications on capex and opex although the weekend air demand estimated by the optimistic design approach shows good agreement with the predictive method it only assumes 30 7 mwh of required blower energy and 8 30 103 m3 h 1 for the peak air flow requirement which would lead to insufficient air supply during most of the week overall the results and the illustration in fig 7 emphasize that since predictive αf values relate to dynamic process variables that respond to fluctuations in load the corresponding air flow calculation also follows turn down and turn up trends bounded by the optimistic and cautious αf based ranges that blowers experience in actual facilities the following case study was developed to show the negative effects on effluent quality from choosing excessively optimistic values of αf two simulations were run for 5 weeks with dry weather diurnal flows following steady state calculation all runs applied the predictive αf method however the blower size was restricted according to the capacity determined from either the previously presented predictive scenario 1 08 104 m3 h 1 the cautious scenario 1 37 104 m3 h 1 or the optimistic design scenario 8 30 103 m3 h 1 in order to simulate a real plant situation the total air flow was distributed assuming manual butterfly valves in the proportion of 53 29 and 18 to the three aerated zones aer1 to aer3 fig 8 displays a comparison of the resulting do levels in the last aerated cell aer3 and nh4 n concentrations in the plant effluent despite the smaller blower size and associated cost benefit shown by optimistic αf based sizing this method confirms how excessively optimistic α ranges correspond to inevitably insufficient air flow requirements during periods with higher load i e when oxygen is most needed and with do targets only met throughout the weekend on some days the actual do drops as low as 0 5 mgo2 l 1 moreover this even leads to daily maximum effluent nh4 n violations on the first three consecutive days barely complying with the 1 mgn l 1 weekly average limitation possibly leading to significant fines effluent limitations can only be met with the predictive method or the cautious approach the latter however entails the requirement of higher aeration capacity that impacts costs as discussed in fig 7 with regard to the second demonstrated case dynamically predicted αf numbers take into account variations in a real plant that the underlying kinetic process variables are adapted to and when linked to a biokinetic model they are efficient in determining whether an aeration system is appropriately sized to comply with environmental standards as portrayed in fig 8 predicting αf can also be coupled with increased accuracy in blower design which in this case corresponds to reduced blower capacity to evaluate cases when the phenomenon of do sag due to lack of sufficient air flow leads to a violation of effluent limits another scenario was also modelled i e that of unscheduled additional loading of the same process this is a case when even scheduled α values fall short of describing the true dynamic nature of the process the model predicted αf was compared to constant labeled passé as well as a sinusoidal approximation used in the industry to schedule α values illustrated in fig 9 to fairly compare the calculation scenarios the constant αf values assigned for the reactors in the passé scenario were averaged from weekday and weekend results of the predictive scenario the sinusoidal approximation for αf in each reactor was created using a cosine function also the sinusoidal αf variation was also based on the dynamically predicted model results by matching the average and the timing and value of the highest αf peak in each reactor separately for weekdays and weekend days this choice simplifies the problem by assuming a single loading peak whilst more complex α curves can be constructed by compounding sinusoidal functions so that the process loading pattern is mirrored in the α schedule after steady state calculation and five weeks of dry weather loading the model was run for a sixth week when an additional stormwater event was introduced to the plant on wednesday doubling the peak flow for the hydraulic loading along with the load of organics and solids n and p changed according to a first flush phenomenon air flow was modelled here hence blower size was not restricted in these runs note that the sinusoidal αf scheduling however cannot change during the overload period the modelled air flow portrayed in fig 10 shows how the calculations based on constant or scheduled α are blind to the anomaly represented by the storm event on day 3 the predictive approach relies on kinetic process calculations and considers the load increase evaluates properly lower αf and consequently higher air flow demand 1 35 104 m3 h 1 associated with it the sinusoidal and constant scenarios calculate that less air flow would suffice during this event they do not account for the αf reduction by the sudden load variation as seen previously in fig 9 the sinusoidal approach estimates a peak requirement of 1 03 104 m3 h 1 less than the 1 07 104 m3 h 1 suggested by the constant case emphasizing that the predefined varying α values are randomly scheduled compared to actual loading events these estimations are both more than 20 lower than what the dynamic alpha model predicts there are even short lower loaded periods during the weekend when the scheduled and passé scenarios overestimate the air consumption supposing energy wastage compared to the predicted use case consequently the overall blower energy consumption 35 4 mwh summed for the predicted α based run despite the appropriately predicted increase during the storm event is in fact less than 4 higher than the demand associated with the sinusoidal and constant cases 34 5 mwh and 34 2 mwh respectively do set points are maintained in all three scenarios but in reality only a blower sized using the dynamic αf case would be able to maintain them through the entire time frame although the scheduled α is a step ahead of the constant α model it is a time dependent description of α but is not reliant on process dynamics hence it cannot be considered a true dynamic model the presented dynamic α model is applicable to municipal mainstream treatment processes with no separate model structure dedicated to address non biodegradable surface active agents i e here only mlss determines the asymptote of the maximum α factor in reactors certain types of industrial or mixed municipal industrial wastewater may contain significant amounts of non biodegradable surfactants thus for such applications in the future a new model component representing non biodegradables shall be introduced along with the necessary kinetic parameter re estimation steps other potential further developments include adaptation to municipal sidestream processes 6 summary and conclusions the proposed kinetic model concept for predicting the α factor in time and space was demonstrated to be an ideal option for dynamically estimating process air consumption of wrrfs under both dry and wet weather conditions an α factor derived from process state variables is fundamentally different than a schedule of α values even though both appear time dependent this new predictive approach is verified to provide increased accuracy when sizing or improving aeration systems potentially resulting in significant operational and capital cost savings model predicted α values were revealed to provide a swift response in the calculated reactor specific air flow consumption reproducing the turn up and turn down effects that are important to take into account for time related blower energy and cost estimation the prediction of αf factors using this method is advantageous compared to scheduling αf profiles manually not only because it eliminates the need for complex knowledge and consideration about contributors varying srt cod mlss etc but also because sudden operational changes in load may be accounted for using the underlying process variables the concept can also be applied on a configuration to test whether a blower is undersized if linked to process units with air flow restriction and αf enters a low range that the blower capacity cannot handle pointing out cases of effluent limit violation when do falls short of target values the authors note that α generally correlates well with filtered cod in municipal influents based on the modelled facilities in this paper however the surfactant content relative to the filtered cod of certain wastewater samples may vary if engineers have the opportunity to perform off gas measurements in multiple locations of a system treating a given type of wastewater it is advised that based on air flow weighted diurnal α and influent cod profiles they re estimate the alpha improvement rate and the filtered cod alpha indicator regression parameters in order to achieve an α prediction more representative of that water type it shall be noted that the fouling effects on the αf factor are not modelled dynamically here because the longer term dynamic effects are outside the scope of this research the authors advocate for closing this knowledge gap future research shall be conducted to assess if the presented model represents the process water associated dynamic nature of not only oxygen transfer but other gases both in terms of absorption and stripping once sufficient data is available surfactant elimination

16126,the performance of aeration one of the most costly processes at water resource recovery facilities is heavily impacted by actual wastewater characteristics which are commonly taken into account using the alpha factor α this factor varies depending on hydraulic and organic loading such variance includes both time and spatial fluctuations in standard design practice it is often considered as a

is necessary for design and the analysis of aerobic processes one of the bottlenecks impeding the accurate application of gas transfer theory is the step between clean gas transfer scenarios e g air and clean water and contaminated scenarios e g air and wastewater but due to the unknown composition of the many contaminants that are present in wastewater accuracy is limited numerous investigators have been studying how to quantify and predict the effect of contaminants on gas transfer for the better part of the last century since kessener and ribbius 1934 and eckenfelder and barnhart 1961 the dynamic nature of gas liquid mass transfer significantly impacts the actual process air requirements of water resource recovery affecting operational costs it also plays a role in equipment sizing and capital costs thus defining peak air demand aeration systems are specified based on clean water performance defined as standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote standard oxygen transfer rate sotr kgo2 transferred h 1 and they are scaled to process conditions using the α factor dimensionless as well as the diffuser fouling factor f dimensionless to quantify the decline of performance with time in operation u s environmental protection agency usepa 1989 during the design stage the quantification of sote is the responsibility of the aeration system manufacturer and an independent witness the quantification of α and f are the purview of the design engineers standard testing protocols for sote quantification are adopted in design american society of civil engineers asce 2018 reducing the uncertainty of sote quantification to the experimental error however the research and corresponding literature on the subject of α and f quantification still fall short of significantly reducing uncertainty this shortcoming is not due to negligence but to the nature of the definition of α and f the former is the ratio of oxygen transfer in process water vs clean water i e αsote sote aggregating in one parameter or variable all the uncertainty on the composition of the carbonaceous load applied to the process the latter is site specific and depends on a multitude of factors given that it is a factor that aggregates biofilm adhesion and growth inorganic scaling and diffuser material degradation u s environmental protection agency usepa 1989 kim and boyle 1993 wagner and pöpel 1998 gillot et al 2005 rosso and stenstrom 2006a garrido baserba et al 2016 2017 2018 rosso 2018 fig 1 illustrates an example of how the contribution of factors can be parsed out nevertheless the oxygen transfer operations in a wastewater treatment plant include the compounding effect of all these combined factors α f sote αfsote thereby forcing investigators and design engineers to parse the individual contributions of said factors chiefly because the responsibility of each is attributed to different parties in design rosso 2018 note the significant difference in dynamics amongst these variables with f being the least varying and α the most varying over the short term studying the illustrated example it is apparent that the so called α factor can be the most significant barrier to oxygen dissolution and also the most sensitive to varying loading circumstances karpinska and bridgeman 2016 which among diurnal patterns also show contrast between workdays and weekends the background of this factor relates to contaminants in the wastewater and different aerators in conjunction with links between surfactants and bubble size which have long been studied inter alia kessener and ribbius 1934 stenstrom and gilbert 1981 the α factor is known to be related to the mean cell retention time mcrt of a treatment plant u s environmental protection agency usepa 1989 rosso et al 2005 gillot and héduit 2008 due to kinetic requirements of the processes responsible for eliminating constituents that hamper oxygen transfer this causes α to vary with hydraulic loading which is inversely proportional to the dynamic mcrt consequently the greater the internal recirculation applied to a train the flatter its α gradient will be due to the load distribution effect which also reduces the need for diffuser tapering rosso et al 2007 the presence of non aerated selectors at a treatment line can improve α values overall this is because surface active agents tend to accumulate at bubble surfaces and therefore are harder to access and degrade aerobic processes that directly utilize o2 as an electron acceptor are prone to this effect rosso and stenstrom 2006b 2007 diffuser submergence plays a role too on the local α in aerated tanks gillot and héduit 2008 as the accumulation of surfactants at bubble surfaces toward a steady state in forming a barrier film is facilitated by longer bubble contact times doyle et al 1983 wagner and pöpel 1996 experience shows that oxygen transfer clearly declines with increasing organic contaminant loading and this has been linked with a relation of α factor and soluble cod as well as colloidal cod concentration mueller et al 2000 odize et al 2016 with increased solids concentrations in reactors α reduces locally due to the increased viscosity and non newtonian nature of the mixed liquor and thus drives bubble coalescence which is especially discernible in the range of operating mlss of membrane bioreactors or aerobic digesters muller et al 1995 krampe and krauth 2003 steele et al 2019 below 4 kg tss m 3 though facilities typically operate at shorter mcrt and lower mlss and the resulting α factor is a function of the surfactant available for accumulation at the gas liquid interface baquero rodríguez et al 2018 efforts have previously been made to describe the α factor s dynamic nature relying on algebraic correlations the first examples of such efforts include prediction in function of mcrt air flux and submergence rosso et al 2005 gillot and héduit 2008 one case included the additional impact of mlvss along with mcrt in the equation applied henkel et al 2011 other methods incorporated a direct negative correlation to total cod or soluble cod jiang et al 2017 boog et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 the available empirical models may prove useful in estimating a plant average α factor yet α also varies per reactor and along each reactor analogously to the oxygen uptake since both are driven by process loading however α and our are not correlated because their dynamics are affected by different causes whereas our is driven by the entire biodegradable cod and ammonia load α is mainly affected by a small subset of the bcod molecules i e the surface active agents odize et al 2016 however past work did not address the kinetic and mass balance related phenomena that in fact determine the location specific trend and time based changes regarding the α factor the complex effects of environmental and operational conditions are fundamental in predicting this factor for the accurate design and operation of wrrfs amaral et al 2019 the goal of this paper is to propose a novel approach that incorporates rate equations into process models based upon a surrogate state variable to simulate the wide range of contributors to α while adjusting to diurnal and seasonal variations in hydraulic and organic loading 2 methodological approach the proposed concept of dynamic α factor prediction is based on a typical or average degradable and surface active component as this component sorbs onto flocs and degrades along the process α increases as depicted in fig 2 in a simple conceptual form this new concept was selected because variations of the α value in space and time cannot be directly linked to any of the state variables readily biodegradable substrate ammonia etc usually included in process models to quantify the effect of surface active agents in individual bioreactors and reactive compartments this paper reconsiders the previous dynamic definition of α as a function of cod or bcod jiang et al 2017 boog et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 introducing a state variable named alpha indicator salpha this unitless indicator is dedicated specifically to consider the loading of oxygen transfer impeding contaminants to individual process units in treatment plants and their transformation within those units that incorporate biokinetic and other reactions the change of alpha indicator in time within a completely stirred tank is described by a component balance according to eq 1 1 d s alpha dt q s alpha in q s alpha out rate q s alpha v r the load of alpha indicator to a tank is given by eq 2 2 q s alpha in q in s alpha in similarly the flow of alpha indicator leaving a tank is interpreted in the form of eq 3 3 q s alpha out q out s alpha the kinetic reaction rate of the alpha indicator regarding the removal process of surfactants present as ratesalpha in eqs 4 and 5 is calculated like a rate expression of any integrated state variable derived from a biokinetic matrix by multiplying a stoichiometric coefficient vsalpha with a value of 1 as it indicates a positive change of the indicator towards a saturation value acting as asymptote by a process rate rsalpha 4 rate q s alpha v r rat e s alpha 5 rat e s alpha ν s alpha r s alpha the process rate regarding the elimination of surfactants calculated by eq 6 depends on an alpha improvement rate component qalpha o2 which is correlated with the mlvss concentration meaning that the longer the water is in contact with the sludge the larger change can be achieved in the alpha indicator this correction is in agreement with the observations previously reported by multiple investigators i e that α improves with increasing mlvss for activated sludge processes rosso et al 2005 gillot and héduit 2008 this correction is needed to account for the benefits of biomass sorption of surfactants the driving force of the change in alpha indicator is determined by the difference of the alpha indicator s saturation value 1 by default representing the clean water value and the actual value of the indicator further corrected by a dampening term described in eq 8 6 r s alpha q alpha o 2 x vss dam p alpha s alpha sat s alpha the qalpha o2 component of the process rate is derived from the kinetic model parameter qalpha which must be corrected by the inverse do saturation term in eq 7 in order to account for the enhancing effect of anaerobic or anoxic conditions on the α factor this factor addresses the beneficial effects of anoxic reactors in sorbing surfactants that otherwise would accumulate on bubbles rosso and stenstrom 2006b 2007 thus qalpha o2 is highest at 0 mgo2 l 1 and declines towards qalpha with increasing aerated status 7 q alpha o 2 q alpha 1 f o 2 max alpha s o 2 k o 2 alpha s o 2 f o 2 max alpha the so called dampening is implemented in the form of eq 8 because the improvement in α factor with sludge residence time does not in fact occur according to first order saturation kinetics above a certain ratio of alpha indicator to the saturation value the alpha improvement rate shall be justified by the dampening term to compensate for the otherwise hyperbolic increase in the indicator toward the saturation number 8 dam p alpha 1 coef f damp alpha s alpha s alpha sat po w damp alpha the α factor itself is actually a variable calculated from the alpha indicator according to eq 9 in order to be able to account for local differences in depth and mlss concentration using their respective correction terms 9 α s alpha cor r h diff α cor r tss α in theory the model s alpha

al 2008 was set up in the sumo21 simulation software and used to evaluate potential capex and opex savings by using the predictive α method and the resultingly more accurate blower size control strategy and power demand instead of fixed or scheduled α values generally used in design for the sake of the case studies in this paper there were some modifications necessary compared to the original bsm1 model setup the double exponential settler implementation takács et al 1991 was replaced with a triple exponential approach and compression was included dynamita 2021 furthermore no sensor delays were added because they are not significant for the purpose of these studies all three compartments of the bsm1 reactor cascade were set up with do control and assigned set points of 2 mgo2 l 1 given that the standard bsm1 version provides over aeration with the predefined α kla values 10 h 1 for the first two of the three aerobic zones after initial model testing it was decided that do probes in the three aerated cells and controlled air valves are cheaper compared to purchasing bigger blowers to meet the significant loading peaks and over aerating the first two cells in lower loaded periods that are present in bsm1 do set points were constant throughout the simulation runs for these example studies there is effluent discharge limitation assigned for ammonia nitrogen i e 1 0 mgn l 1 as weekly average and a maximum daily peak of 4 0 mgn l 1 since this paper focuses on aerated processes optimizing the effluent tn via denitrification was not an objective the selected biokinetic model was also replaced from the original asm1 by minisumo in favour of the available gas transfer background calculations along with sumo21 s blower and pump models to assess energy and associated costs dynamita 2021 minisumo is a simplified plant wide model with one step nitrification and denitrification focusing on estimating oxygen requirement and sludge production its gas

temperature and 1 atm pressure throughout the model simulation α factor for aged diffusers αf including the fouling factor f u s environmental protection agency usepa 1989 was used to interpret results having assigned a fixed value of 0 75 for f the selection of a constant f is adequate if the modelling time window is limited e g less than 1 2 months in practice this is best adjusted knowing the diffuser age and the time of the last cleaning procedure jiang et al 2020 3 model calibration and validation data was collected from results of off gas measurement campaigns batch clean water and process water tests as well as from aeration literature review doyle et al 1983 gillot and héduit 2008 leu et al 2009 baquero rodríguez et al 2018 reconciliation of data was carried out according to the iwa good modelling practice guidelines rieger et al 2013 the model was then first fitted to averaged α factor off gas measurements american society of civil engineers asce 2018 from facilities applying newly commissioned fine pore diffusers with and without non aerated selectors in function of the given plant mcrt values as displayed in fig 3 the depth related as well as solids related corrections in the model were fine tuned based upon clean water and process water unsteady state test results american society of civil engineers asce 2006 2018 the α versus influent filtered cod relationship was adjusted based on air flow weighted average diurnal off gas measurements american society of civil engineers asce 2018 from a facility in simi valley california leu et al 2009 as shown by fig 4 which displays a uniform distribution of errors between measured and modelled outputs throughout the day dots on graphs indicate measured data while connected lines represent model outputs calibrated model parameter values are listed in table 1 model validation was carried out against measurements from two water resource recovery facilities firstly steady state α factor simulations were compared to daily averaged off gas test american society of civil engineers asce 2018 results from a municipal plant located in southern california not the aforementioned plant used for calibration with two parallel and independent lines fed separate return sludge rosso et al 2007 both were equipped with ceramic disc diffusers and received the same influent quality but with different volumetric loading thus one of them was operated as a bod removal system i e carbon oxidation only with short sludge retention time while the other one also featured nitrification i e with long sludge retention time throughout the sampling locations measured data points are somewhat scattered compared to a continuous gradient due to the tank hydrodynamic conditions that are difficult to mimic in process modelling this is especially true of the low α measurements at the effluent of both systems and the high outlying datapoints between 130 and 200 m positions of the high mcrt system regardless of this the estimated α trend presented by fig 5 shows good agreement with the measured data reproducing the phenomenon that higher mcrt can result in a two fold increase in oxygen transfer efficiency rosso et al 2005 gillot and héduit 2008 replicating such evolution of α along reactors as well as quantifying air distribution accurately when setting up a plant model are key aspects of diligent plant wide oxygen transfer modelling also these are required for reliable energy and cost calculations and are aligned with the various degrees of oxygenation requirements at different stages of treatment secondly the capability of estimating dynamically varying air flow demand was tested based on a 2 day dataset as seen on fig 6 from a plug flow reactor of wwtp waßmannsdorf in brandenburg germany a facility with denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal schuchardt et al 2007 three zones of the aeration tank with do control in each utilizing a ceramic tube diffuser system were used for comparison modelled results show satisfactory response in terms of air flow despite the slightly higher modelled air flow during the peak loading period a need for larger or more blowers in practice may not be needed if the exercise of scheduling blower operations with varying diurnal do set points is applied being able to reproduce such dynamic profiles along with α in various reactors is essential for the specification of blowers and for the determination of the blower duty schedule also since the n 1 blower added to operations could incur stiff power demand penalties there is a need to overlay these dynamic calculations with the structured power tariff to increase the accuracy of predicting energy consumption power demand energy costs and carbon footprint aymerich et al 2015 amerlinck et al 2016 emami et al 2018 5 results and discussion in the first example the model test configuration ran at a steady state in dry weather conditions using sumo21 s combined global and local solvers followed by five weeks of repeated dry weather diurnal weeks three runs were performed fig 7 to obtain the weekly blower energy demand for the following design scenarios 1 predictive scenario kinetic based model prediction space and time varying αf average calculated αf at 0 49 0 52 and 0 53 in aer1 aer2 and aer3 2 cautious scenario design based on constant αf set to 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 in aer1 aer2 and aer3 3 optimistic scenarios design based on constant αf set to 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 in aer1 aer2 and aer3 compared to the cautious design example that estimates an accumulated blower energy consumption of 44 5 mwh the time and location specific αf prediction use case determines 33 3 mwh suggesting 25 savings on operational costs if blowers with adequate turn down capability were specified the required blower capacity determined with predicted αf is also lower by 21 1 08 104 m3 h 1 instead of 1 37 104 m3 h 1 with corresponding implications on capex and opex although the weekend air demand estimated by the optimistic design approach shows good agreement with the predictive method it only assumes 30 7 mwh of required blower energy and 8 30 103 m3 h 1 for the peak air flow requirement which would lead to insufficient air supply during most of the week overall the results and the illustration in fig 7 emphasize that since predictive αf values relate to dynamic process variables that respond to fluctuations in load the corresponding air flow calculation also follows turn down and turn up trends bounded by the optimistic and cautious αf based ranges that blowers experience in actual facilities the following case study was developed to show the negative effects on effluent quality from choosing excessively optimistic values of αf two simulations were run for 5 weeks with dry weather diurnal flows following steady state calculation all runs applied the predictive αf method however the blower size was restricted according to the capacity determined from either the previously presented predictive scenario 1 08 104 m3 h 1 the cautious scenario 1 37 104 m3 h 1 or the optimistic design scenario 8 30 103 m3 h 1 in order to simulate a real plant situation the total air flow was distributed assuming manual butterfly valves in the proportion of 53 29 and 18 to the three aerated zones aer1 to aer3 fig 8 displays a comparison of the resulting do levels in the last aerated cell aer3 and nh4 n concentrations in the plant effluent despite the smaller blower size and associated cost benefit shown by optimistic αf based sizing this method confirms how excessively optimistic α ranges correspond to inevitably insufficient air flow requirements during periods with higher load i e when oxygen is most needed and with do targets only met throughout the weekend on some days the actual do drops as low as 0 5 mgo2 l 1 moreover this even leads to daily maximum effluent nh4 n violations on the first three consecutive days barely complying with the 1 mgn l 1 weekly average limitation possibly leading to significant fines effluent limitations can only be met with the predictive method or the cautious approach the latter however entails the requirement of higher aeration capacity that impacts costs as discussed in fig 7 with regard to the second demonstrated case dynamically predicted αf numbers take into account variations in a real plant that the underlying kinetic process variables are adapted to and when linked to a biokinetic model they are efficient in determining whether an aeration system is appropriately sized to comply with environmental standards as portrayed in fig 8 predicting αf can also be coupled with increased accuracy in blower design which in this case corresponds to reduced blower capacity to evaluate cases when the phenomenon of do sag due to lack of sufficient air flow leads to a violation of effluent limits another scenario was also modelled i e that of unscheduled additional loading of the same process this is a case when even scheduled α values fall short of describing the true dynamic nature of the process the model predicted αf was compared to constant labeled passé as well as a sinusoidal approximation used in the industry to schedule α values illustrated in fig 9 to fairly compare the calculation scenarios the constant αf values assigned for the reactors in the passé scenario were averaged from weekday and weekend results of the predictive scenario the sinusoidal approximation for αf in each reactor was created using a cosine function also the sinusoidal αf variation was also based on the dynamically predicted model results by matching the average and the timing and value of the highest αf peak in each reactor separately for weekdays and weekend days this choice simplifies the problem by assuming a single loading peak whilst more complex α curves can be constructed by compounding sinusoidal functions so that the process loading pattern is mirrored in the α schedule after steady state calculation and five weeks of dry weather loading the model was run for a sixth week when an additional stormwater event was introduced to the plant on wednesday doubling the peak flow for the hydraulic loading along with the load of organics and solids n and p changed according to a first flush phenomenon air flow was modelled here hence blower size was not restricted in these runs note that the sinusoidal αf scheduling however cannot change during the overload period the modelled air flow portrayed in fig 10 shows how the calculations based on constant or scheduled α are blind to the anomaly represented by the storm event on day 3 the predictive approach relies on kinetic process calculations and considers the load increase evaluates properly lower αf and consequently higher air flow demand 1 35 104 m3 h 1 associated with it the sinusoidal and constant scenarios calculate that less air flow would suffice during this event they do not account for the αf reduction by the sudden load variation as seen previously in fig 9 the sinusoidal approach estimates a peak requirement of 1 03 104 m3 h 1 less than the 1 07 104 m3 h 1 suggested by the constant case emphasizing that the predefined varying α values are randomly scheduled compared to actual loading events these estimations are both more than 20 lower than what the dynamic alpha model predicts there are even short lower loaded periods during the weekend when the scheduled and passé scenarios overestimate the air consumption supposing energy wastage compared to the predicted use case consequently the overall blower energy consumption 35 4 mwh summed for the predicted α based run despite the appropriately predicted increase during the storm event is in fact less than 4 higher than the demand associated with the sinusoidal and constant cases 34 5 mwh and 34 2 mwh respectively do set points are maintained in all three scenarios but in reality only a blower sized using the dynamic αf case would be able to maintain them through the entire time frame although the scheduled α is a step ahead of the constant α model it is a time dependent description of α but is not reliant on process dynamics hence it cannot be considered a true dynamic model the presented dynamic α model is applicable to municipal mainstream treatment processes with no separate model structure dedicated to address non biodegradable surface active agents i e here only mlss determines the asymptote of the maximum α factor in reactors certain types of industrial or mixed municipal industrial wastewater may contain significant amounts of non biodegradable surfactants thus for such applications in the future a new model component representing non biodegradables shall be introduced along with the necessary kinetic parameter re estimation steps other potential further developments include adaptation to municipal sidestream processes 6 summary and conclusions the proposed kinetic model concept for predicting the α factor in time and space was demonstrated to be an ideal option for dynamically estimating process air consumption of wrrfs under both dry and wet weather conditions an α factor derived from process state variables is fundamentally different than a schedule of α values even though both appear time dependent this new predictive approach is verified to provide increased accuracy when sizing or improving aeration systems potentially resulting in significant operational and capital cost savings model predicted α values were revealed to provide a swift response in the calculated reactor specific air flow consumption reproducing the turn up and turn down effects that are important to take into account for time related blower energy and cost estimation the prediction of αf factors using this method is advantageous compared to scheduling αf profiles manually not only because it eliminates the need for complex knowledge and consideration about contributors varying srt cod mlss etc but also because sudden operational changes in load may be accounted for using the underlying process variables the concept can also be applied on a configuration to test whether a blower is undersized if linked to process units with air flow restriction and αf enters a low range that the blower capacity cannot handle pointing out cases of effluent limit violation when do falls short of target values the authors note that α generally correlates well with filtered cod in municipal influents based on the modelled facilities in this paper however the surfactant content relative to the filtered cod of certain wastewater samples may vary if engineers have the opportunity to perform off gas measurements in multiple locations of a system treating a given type of wastewater it is advised that based on air flow weighted diurnal α and influent cod profiles they re estimate the alpha improvement rate and the filtered cod alpha indicator regression parameters in order to achieve an α prediction more representative of that water type it shall be noted that the fouling effects on the αf factor are not modelled dynamically here because the longer term dynamic effects are outside the scope of this research the authors advocate for closing this knowledge gap future research shall be conducted to assess if the presented model represents the process water associated dynamic nature of not only oxygen transfer but other gases both in terms of absorption and stripping once sufficient data is available surfactant elimination

16127,nitrate no3 is a ubiquitous contaminant in water and wastewater conventional treatment processes such as adsorption and membrane separation suffer from low selectivity for no3 removal causing high energy consumption and adsorbents usage in this study we demonstrate selective removal of no3 in an electrosorption process by a thin porous carbonized eggshell membrane cesm derived from eggshell bio waste the cesm possesses an interconnected hierarchical pore structure with pore size ranging from a few nanometers to tens of micrometers when utilized as the anode in an electrosorption process the cesm exhibited strong selectivity for no3 over cl so4 2 and h2po4 adsorption of no3 by the cesm reached 2 4 10 3 mmol m2 almost two orders of magnitude higher than that by activated carbon ac more importantly the cesm achieved no3 cl selectivity of 7 79 at an applied voltage of 1 2 v the highest no3 cl selectivity reported to date the high selectivity led to a five fold reduction in energy consumption for no3 removal compared to electrosorption using conventional ac electrodes density function theory calculation suggests that the high no3 selectivity of cesm is attributed to its rich nitrogen containing functional groups which possess higher binding energy with no3 compared to cl so4 2 and h2po4 these results suggest that nitrogen rich biomaterials are good precursors for no3 selective electrodes similar chemistry can also be used in other materials to achieve no3 selectivity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eggshell membrane nitrate selectivity

impair the immune system and cause stress in aquatic species romano and zeng 2007 in addition as a nutrient excess concentration of no3 in water can cause eutrophication and algal blooms resulting in anoxia and dead zones that can be highly detrimental to ecosystem health the maximum concentration of no3 in drinking water recommended by the world health organization who is 50 mg l the u s

cetyltrimethylammonium bromide achieved a no3 to cl selectivity of 7 7 in an passive inverted cdi cell without an applied electric field oyarzun et al 2018 in addition because no3 is more weakly solvated compared with cl and so4 2 slit micropores have been created in activated carbon to match the planar structure of dehydrated no3 to achieve selective electrosorption of no3 through the ion sieving effect hawks et al 2019 these studies suggest that amine functionalization and pore manipulation are effective approaches to improve no3 selectivity in electrosorption eggshell membrane esm is a natural biomass source available from food industry waste as a porous membrane with unique three dimensional microstructures esm has been used as an adsorbent to remove heavy metals from water including hexavalent chromium mercury silver and cadmium liu and huang 2011 sha wang 2013 sunho park 2016 esm can also be easily carbonized and the carbonized eggshell membranes cesm can be used as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion due to its high porosity as well as high electric conductivity geng et al 2015 li et al 2014 2012 rath et al 2014 in addition the protein network in esm results in high nitrogen content in cesm which has been reported to improve electrochemical properties such as conductivity deng et al 2016 ismagilov et al 2009 ji et al 2018

electrosorption experiments the electrosorption cell consists of a rectangular acrylic housing a pair of titanium current collectors a rubber gasket and a plastic mesh that form the flow channel a cesm working electrode and an ac counter electrode fig 1b because an ac electrode was used as the control anode and was tested using another ac electrode as the cathode the cesm anode was also tested using the same ac cathode both the ac and cesm electrodes have a dimension of 1 cm 5 cm and a cem was installed between the ac electrode and the mesh separator to enhance charge efficiency considering an anion exchange membrane aem may have different permeability for various anions no aem was utilized so that the actual selectivity of ac and cesm materials could be evaluated during operation a cesm 70 0 0 3 mg or ac 55 8 0 1 mg including pva binder but excluding the graphite sheet electrode was used as the anode and an ac electrode was used as the cathode the electrosorption cell was operated in continuous flow mode fig 1c with single solute 2 0 mm or multi solute 0 5 mm for each of the 4 solutes feed solutions containing nano3 nacl na2so4 and or nah2po4 h2o flowing between two electrodes at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min for all experiments the ph of the multi solute solution is 5 6 the temperature is 26 c a constant voltage of 1 2 v or 1 2 v was applied to the electrodes using a potentiostat

highly porous network of proteins on the inner side and a thin dense layer 1 μm of proteins on the outer side facing the inorganic eggshell fig 2 a1 s1 after carbonization the porous structure of the inner layer was well preserved fig 2a2 a3 while the dense outer layer became porous and interconnected with the inner layer network fig 2a4 a5 detailed sem characterization showed that the porous cesm network consisted of interconnected fibers with a diameter of 1 3 μm forming pores with size ranging from 0 5 to 4 μm n2 adsorption desorption isotherm showed that the cumulative pore volume of cesm was 0 0284 cm3 g and the pores were mostly mesopores with three distinct pore size ranges centered at 2 6 4 3 and 7 7 nm respectively fig 2b the hierarchical pore structure with pore sizes ranging from several micrometers macropores to a few nanometers mesopores provide channels for effective ion migration han et al 2019 lytle et al 2011 the high interconnectivity of the network was also conducive to efficient electron transfer li et al 2012 nevertheless as the cesm was not activated its specific surface area was only 13 0 m2 g this was comparable with previous report for a cesm carbonized at 700 c 17 0 m2 g li et al 2012 but much lower than ac 2103 7 m2 g fig 2b the ftir spectrum of the ac powder was smooth with few peaks indicating a high degree of carbonization fig 2c as a comparison the spectrum of esm showed the presence of abundant oxygen oh at 3200 3500 cm 1 c o at 1637 cm 1 and co at 1078 cm 1 arami et al 2006 kong and yu 2007 tsai et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 and nitrogen containing functional groups as indicated by the cn stretching nh bending 1528 cm 1 for amide ii and 1230 cm 1 for amide iii and c n ar 1313 cm 1 peaks liang et al 2014 liu and huang 2011 after carbonization at 600 c most oxygen functional groups were removed by dehydration decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions while most nitrogen functional groups were preserved in the cesm fig 2c xps analyses further confirmed that the high n content 13 3 wt and the n c atomic ratio 14 in the cesm fig 5a in contrast to the activated carbon 0 2 n 3 2 electrosorption for single solute solutions the electrosorption performance of the cesm and ac electrodes were evaluated using single solute solutions containing 2 0 mm nacl nano3 na2so4 or nah2po4 h2o as shown in figs 3a and s2 reproducible current effluent conductivity and ph profiles were obtained for the cesm electrode during the adsorption and desorption cycles a frequency doubling effect ahualli et al 2019 porada et al 2013 occurred for so4 2 because so4 2 possessed twice the charge of the other anions and caused fast release of co ions na during the adsorption period as the system was operated in a continuous flow mode effluent conductivity decreased during the adsorption period and increased during the desorption period at 1 2 v fig 3a despite that the initial conductivities were different for different solutions the changes in conductivity for nano3 and nacl solutions were much higher than that for na2so4 or nah2po4 solution and the conductivity change in the nano3 solution was even greater than that in the nacl solution indicating higher adsorption of no3 than the three other anions effluent anion concentrations determined by ic exhibited a trend consistent with the conductivity profiles fig 3b with single solute adsorption following the order of no3 0 052 0 004 mmol g cl 0 031 0 001 mmol g h2po4 0 008 0 001 mmol g so4 2 0 005 0 001 mmol g fig 3c because h2po4 was the dominant phosphate species at ph 4 5 5 5 h2po4 concentration was used to represent total phosphate furthermore adsorption of all ions was highly reversible with almost complete release of the adsorbed ions during the desorption cycle fig 3b c it was noted that although the hydrated radius of cl is smaller than no3 and the equivalent concentration of so4 2 was twice that of no3 the adsorption of no3 on cesm was much higher than that of cl and so4 2 suggesting that the cesm had different affinity towards the various anions the electric capacitance of the electrode was further characterized by chronopotentiometry as shown in fig 3d the cesm electrode exhibited a much higher electric capacitance in nano3 solution 4 3 0 2 mf g than in nacl solution 3 0 0 3 mf g consistent with the greater electrosorption of no3 by the cesm electrode according to eq 1 the higher capacitance in nano3 than in nacl shows that the cesm has higher adsorption capacity of no3 than cl suggesting that the cesm has more electrosorption sites for no3 than cl which will be further discussed in the following sections the single solute adsorption by the ac electrode also exhibited highly reproducible adsorption and desorption behavior during the charging and discharging periods fig s3 however anion adsorption on the ac anode followed the order of cl 0 133 0 003 mmol g no3 0 107 0 002 mmol g so4 2 0 071 0 003 mmol g h2po4 0 016 0 003 mmol g figure s3 different from the cesm that had the highest electrosorption for no3 chronopotentiometry experiments further confirmed that the ac electrode had a much higher electric capacitance in the nacl solution 7 8 0 6 mf g than in the nano3 solution 2 8 0 2 mf g fig s4 it should be noted that the specific surface area of cesm 13 0 m2 g was less than 1 of that of ac 2103 7 m2 g yet its electric capacitance was 154 and 38 that of ac in nano3 and nacl respectively the electrode mass normalized adsorption of no3 on the cesm 0 052 0 004 mmol g was 48 6 of that on the ac 0 107 0 002 mmol g but the surface area normalized no3 adsorption 4 0 10 3 mmol m 2 was 78 4 times that of the ac 5 1 10 5 mmol m 2 these results suggest an extremely high adsorption capacity and electric capacitance per unit surface area of the cesm especially when no3 was utilized as charge carrier comparable current was produced during the adsorption and desorption periods for all four solutions fig s2 s5 since the cesm has higher ion adsorption for no3 and cl fig 2c it also produced higher current in no3 and cl solutions fig s5 charge efficiencies for cesm were 50 8 53 2 40 5 and 20 2 in the no3 cl h2po4 and so4 2 solution respectively fig 3c these charge efficiencies were relatively low compared to conventional membrane cdi 90 nevertheless the charge efficiency of cesm in no3 and cl solutions were clearly higher than that in so4 2 and h2po4 solutions due to the lower cation i e na concentration suss et al 2015 the low charge efficiencies were caused by the absence of an anion exchange membrane on the cesm surface which allowed adsorption and release of co ions i e na on the anode during the desorption and adsorption cycles respectively in addition as so4 2 and phosphate species possess more charges than cl and no3 they would cause more and faster release of co ions during the adsorption period resulting in lower charge efficiency than in no3 and cl containing solutions this phenomenon was also observed in our previous study where charge efficiency was lower in a cacl2 solution than in a nacl solution of the same molar concentration kim et al 2019 in addition the hydrated size and hydration energy of no3 0 335 nm in radius 300 kj mol and cl 0 332 nm 340 kj mol are also smaller compared to so4 2 0 379 nm 1080 kj mol and h2po4 0 450 nm 465 kj mol hawks et al 2019 marcus 1991 which leads to higher mobility and better access to adsorption sites 3 3 electrosorption of multi solute solutions in natural water or wastewater background anions such as cl and so4 2 would compete with no3 for adsorption sites on the electrode to evaluate the impact of common competing anions electrosorption experiments were carried out using a multi solute solution containing 0 5 mm each of nano3 nacl na2so4 and nah2po4 h2o as shown in fig s6 4a b reproducible effluent conductivity ph and effluent ion concentrations were observed during repeated adsorption and desorption cycles using either the cesm or the ac electrode as the anode the conductivity change was much higher when using ac than cesm anodes indicating higher amount of ion adsorption desorption due to larger surface area of the ac electrode material measurement of anion concentrations showed that the removal of no3 cl so4 2 and h2po4 by the ac electrode was 0 057 0 001 0 051 0 001 0 044 0 001 and 0 026 0 002 mmol g respectively during the adsorption period while the total anion removal tar reached 0 178 mmol g fig s7 in contrast the removal of no3 cl so4 2 and h2po4 by the cesm was 0 031 0 002 0 004 0 001 0 003 0 001 0 003 0 001 mmol g respectively and the tar was 0 041 mmol g fig s7 the no3 removal by the cesm was 54 that of the ac electrode when calculated based on the electrode mass however because the cesm was not activated its surface area 13 0 m2 g was less than 1 of that of ac 2103 7 m2 g when normalizing no3 electrosorption by surface area mmol m2 no3 removal by the cesm would reach 2 4 10 3 mmol m2 which was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of the ac electrode fig 4c these data suggest that the cesm has much higher affinity for no3 than ac detailed analyses found that no3 adsorption by ac 0 057 0 001 mmol g only accounted for 32 0 of the total anion removal fig 4c the selectivity of the ac electrode for no3 over cl so4 2 and h2po4 were calculated to be 1 12 0 04 1 29 0 21 and 2 19 0 15 respectively fig 4d the values suggest that the ac electrode has little selectivity for no3 over the competing cl so4 2 and h2po4 as a comparison no3 accounted for 75 6 of the total anion adsorption on cesm fig 4c more than two times of that for the ac electrode the selectivity for no3 over cl so4 2 and h2po4 of the cesm reached 7 79 0 36 10 38 0 85 and 10 38 0 62 respectively fig 4d much higher than the ac electrode the cesm produced a notably lower current than the ac electrode fig s8 4e however the charge efficiency of the cesm 67 9 4 2 was much higher than ac 39 3 1 8 fig 4e indicating that charges provided to the cesm were more efficiently utilized for ion adsorption this is attributed to the strong interactions between no3 and adsorption sites on the cesm and hence less interference from cations compared to the ac electrode the high charge efficiency and no3 selectivity of the cesm both decrease energy consumption for no3 removal from the multi solute solution the energy consumption for no3 removal from the multi solute solution was 1147 7 kj mol no3 by the ac electrode but only 248 8 kj mol no3 by the cesm an almost 5 fold reduction 3 4 comparison with previous studies table 1 and fig 4f summarize the no3 cl selectivity in electrosorption studies reported in the literature these studies utilized different materials and different applied voltages to achieve selective electrosorption of no3 for example no3 selective ion exchange resin coatings on activated carbon electrodes were reported to reach no3 cl selectivity of 2 3 at 1 0 v kim and choi 2012 and 1 5 at 1 0 1 6 v gan et al 2019 a quaternary amine functionalized carbon achieved no3 cl selectivity of 6 5 at voltage of 0 4 v oyarzun et al 2018 an ultramicroporous carbon with sub nanometer pores realized no3 cl selectivity of 6 1 at 0 6 v hawks et al 2019 and 6 0 at 1 2 v mubita et al 2019 utilizing a commercial anion exchange membrane neosepta amx in cdi also realized no3 cl selectivity of 4 37 at 1 0 v kim et al 2013 in our study the cesm realized no3 cl selectivity of 7 79 0 36 at an applied voltage of 1 2 v to the best of our knowledge this no3 cl selectivity was the highest to date among reported studies operating at 1 2 v fig 4f table 1 it is well understood that the no3 cl selectivity decreases with increasing applied voltage due to enhanced dehydration of cl at higher voltages fig 4f table 1 therefore it is expected that the no3 cl selectivity of the cesm could be further improved if a lower voltage is applied however low operation voltage would lead to decreased electrosorption kinetics and overall electrosorption capacity which would require longer adsorption time and more electrode materials to achieve the same removal a good electrosorption material should possess high selectivity at high operation voltage e g 1 2 v to realize high selectivity fast kinetics as well as low electrode material usage for the removal of a target contaminant it is noted that eq 5 takes into consideration the influent concentrations of the target and competing ions therefore selectivity calculated using eq 5 allows comparison between studies that used different cl to no3 concentration ratios if adsorption is linear with respect to influent concentration which is usually the case at relatively low concentrations the cl to no3 concentration ratios used in the previous studies shown in table 1 ranged from 1 1 to 3 1 in this study the cl no3 concentration ratio 1 1 used was similar to many previous studies hassanvand et al 2018 hawks et al 2019 mubita et al 2019 tong and elimelech 2016 tsai et al 2021 wang et al 2020 this suggests that direct comparison of no3 cl selectivity is reasonable in real water and wastewater however the cl to no3 concentration ratio can be much higher than those used in these studies further research is needed to evaluate electrode materials selectivity in more realistic solution conditions in addition the high no3 concentration in the brine collected during the desorption step is favorable for n recovery as a nutrient in the case degradation is required a higher no3 concentration will also enhance biological or electro chemical degradation rate 3 5 proposed mechanism of nitrate selective removal on cesm several factors influence electrosorption selectivity including hydrated size valence and electronegativity of the ions eliad et al 2001 guyes et al 2019 hawks et al 2019 mubita et al 2019 sun et al 2018 suss 2017 and pore size hawks et al 2019 as well as the surface chemistry ma et al 2019 oyarzun et al 2018 palko et al 2018 of the electrode the no3 and cl ions have smaller hydrated ion radius than h2po4 and so4 2 therefore they have better access to the active sites and adsorption capacity despite that no3 and cl have similar hydrated radius no3 0 335 nm cl 0 332 nm and diffusion coefficients no3 1 91 10 9 m2 s cl 2 03 10 9 m2 s hassanvand et al 2018 previous studies have reported that no3 was preferentially removed by activated carbon electrodes and the selectivity are attributed to its higher electronegativity 4 32 than cl 3 16 sun et al 2018 and weaker solvation which allows no3 to be easily dehydrated and adsorbed in small pores hawks et al 2019 in our study the ac possessed rich micropores with pore sizes 2 nm fig 2c it realized slightly higher electrosorption of no3 0 057 0 001 mmol g than cl 0 051 0 001 mmol g from the multi solute solution consistent with previous reports hawks et al 2019 sun et al 2018 although the cesm possessed much bigger pore sizes 2 5 nm fig 2b it still achieved significantly higher no3 cl selectivity this result indicates that the pore size is not the main reason for the high no3 cl selectivity found in cesm we hypothesize that the high no3 selectivity on cesm resulted from its different chemical composition and unique chemical interactions with no3 as revealed by xps the ac electrode was mainly composed of c with no detectable n atoms fig s9 the cesm however contained 13 3 wt n and 6 2 wt o fig 5a many previous studies have reported that n containing amine functionalized activated carbon oyarzun et al 2018 palko et al 2018 and ion exchange resins containing amine functional groups ebrahimi and roberts 2015 gan et al 2019 kim and choi 2012 improve selective adsorption of no3 therefore it is hypothesized that the rich n species on the cesm are related to the superior no3 cl selectivity as shown in fig 5b detailed xps analysis of the n1s spectrum showed that the cesm contained four nitrogen species pyridinic nitrogen n 6 398 44 ev pyrrolic nitrogen n 5 399 7 ev oxidized pyridinic nitrogen n x 402 5 ev and quaternary nitrogen n q 400 8 ev fig 5b li et al 2014 xiao et al 2013 the n 6 and n 5 are nitrogen atoms that are bonded with two carbon atoms and donate two s electrons to the π system of a 6 and 5 member ring respectively the n x peak originates from oxidized pyridine nitrogen atoms that are bonded with two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom the n q peak is related to nitrogen atoms that are connected with three carbon atoms via covalent bonds it was reported that the n species could induce charge delocalization on the carbon matrix because the electronegativity of n 3 5 is higher than that of c 3 0 wang et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 the charge on c atoms adjacent to n redistributes and reaches a substantially high positive charge density in order to counterbalance the strong electronic affinity of n the redistributed charge can attract cations anions and thus improve electrosorption for target species liu et al 2020 it was also reported that the n q and n x exhibited electron donor ability and could boost electron transfer kinetics through the carbon material cheng et al 2019 shen and fan 2013 zhou et al 2015 and the n 5 and n 6 may enhance electrosorption activity as they are located at the edge sites of the carbon matrix ji et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in addition the n species were also reported to improve the wettability of carbon which was confirmed in this study by contact angle measurement fig s10 and may improve the electrolyte invasion and ion adsorption to evaluate the effect of n species on electrosorption of anions on cesm dft calculation was performed to determine the molecular distance and binding energy between the nitrogen species on cesm and various anions including no3 cl and so4 2 as shown in fig 5c the schematics illustrated the molecular structure and charge distribution of the nitrogen species on cesm and various anions the calculated molecular distance between the n atoms on cesm and various anions showed that all the n species on cesm had the shortest distance to no3 compared with cl and so4 2 fig 5d the gibbs free energy of the binding reactions between various n species on cesm and no3 was negative and lower than that for cl and so4 2 fig 5e implying stronger binding of no3 than cl and so4 2 on the cesm since the calculations were performed in hydrosolvent conditions the high affinity of n species on cesm for no3 may be attributed to the lower absolute hydration energy of no3 300 kj mol than cl 340 kj mol and so4 2 1080 kj mol hawks et al 2019 which leads to a lower energy barrier for dehydration epsztein et al 2019 besides no3 it is also interesting to note that the various n species on cesm also have shorter distance and higher affinity for so4 2 than that of cl while cl removal was higher than so4 2 in both the single solute solution fig 3c and the mixed solute solution fig 4c this result may be caused by the larger size of so4 2 radius of 0 379 nm than cl 0 332 nm which leads to less accessibility of so4 2 to the cesm pores notably the n 6 and n x show smaller closest distance to no3 than n q and n 5 fig 5d and their binding energy is also higher than n q fig 5e suggesting that they may have greater effect on no3 electrosorption further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis using electrode materials doped with single nitrogen species the carbonization temperature was found to have an important impact on the performance of the cesm electrode as shown in fig s11 the cesm carbonized at 400 c exhibited negligible salt electrosorption presumably due to incomplete carbonization and hence low conductance the cesm carbonized at 800 c on the other hand showed higher adsorption capacity for both no3 0 038 mmol g and cl 0 009 mmol g than the cesm carbonized at 600 c table s1 the higher adsorption capacity may be attributed to the higher specific surface area and electric conductivity resulting from the higher carbonization temperature nevertheless the cesm carbonized at 800 c obtained a no3 cl selectivity 4 16 much lower than the cesm carbonized at 600 c these results indicate that carbonization at high temperatures e g 800 c may damage the nitrogen functional groups that are responsible for no3 selectivity 4 conclusion in this study an ultrathin porous electrode derived from the eggshell bio wastes was fabricated and for the first time utilized in electrosorption for removal of anionic species the prepared carbonized eggshell membrane possessed an interconnected porous network with a uniform micrometer thickness and a hierarchical pore size ranging from several tens of microns to a few nanometers although cesm has low specific surface area it has high electric capacitance and realized surface area normalized ion adsorption capacity two orders of magnitude higher than activated carbon more importantly the cesm exhibited to date the highest selectivity for no3 against common competing anions including cl so4 2 and h2po4 dft calculations revealed the critical role of the abundant nitrogen containing functional groups on cesm in selective adsorption of no3 a great advantage of carbon materials derived from protein rich biowaste these findings are particularly encouraging because they not only suggest that nitrogen rich biomaterials are promising precursors for no3 selective electrodes but also provide an important direction for chemical modification of other material systems where selective no3 adsorption is needed from a practical application aspect the as synthesized cesm may not be an economical electrode material yet due to its low specific surface area further activation of the cesm or other nitrogen rich biomaterials can be performed to introduce micropores and increase specific surface area alternatively existing carbon electrode materials with high specific surface area can be functionalized to introduce nitrogen containing function groups e g by doping with n species to further enhance the no3 selectivity in addition the stability of the cesm also needs to be investigated during long term operation these nitrogen rich electrode materials have the potential to remove and recover no3 from water and wastewater through highly selective electrosorption

16127,nitrate no3 is a ubiquitous contaminant in water and wastewater conventional treatment processes such as adsorption and membrane separation suffer from low selectivity for no3 removal causing high energy consumption and adsorbents usage in this study we demonstrate selective removal of no3 in an electrosorption process by a thin porous carbonized eggshell membrane cesm derived from eggshell bio waste the cesm possesses an interconnected hierarchical pore structure with pore size ranging from a few nanometers to tens of micrometers when utilized as the anode in an electrosorption process the cesm exhibited strong selectivity for no3 over cl so4 2 and h2po4 adsorption of no3 by the cesm reached 2 4 10 3 mmol m2 almost two orders of magnitude higher than that by activated carbon ac more importantly the cesm achieved no3 cl selectivity of 7 79 at an applied voltage of 1 2 v the highest no3 cl selectivity reported to date the high selectivity led to a five fold reduction in energy consumption for no3 removal compared to electrosorption using conventional ac electrodes density function theory calculation suggests that the high no3 selectivity of cesm is attributed to its rich nitrogen containing functional groups which possess higher binding energy with no3 compared to cl so4 2 and h2po4 these results suggest that nitrogen rich biomaterials are good precursors for no3 selective electrodes similar chemistry can also be used in other materials to achieve no3 selectivity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eggshell membrane nitrate selectivity electrosorption nitrogen functional groups density functional theory 1 introduction nitrate no3 contamination in drinking water sources is a growing concern worldwide almasri 2007 despite its relatively low acute toxicity no3 is a precursor for nitrite and nitrosamine that are carcinogenic and can cause stomach cancer kälble et al 1990 excessive uptake of nitrate 30 ppm can inhibit growth impair the immune system and cause stress in aquatic species romano and zeng 2007 in addition as a nutrient excess concentration of no3 in water can cause eutrophication and algal blooms resulting in anoxia and dead zones that can be highly detrimental to ecosystem health the maximum concentration of no3 in drinking water recommended by the world health organization who is 50 mg l the u s environmental protection agency epa sets the maximum permissible no3 concentration at 45 mg l or 10 mg l as n in drinking water pastushok et al 2019 major sources of nitrate pollution include wide spread use of nitrogen fertilizers for agriculture discharge of municipal and industrial wastewaters processed food dairy and meat products and leakage of livestock and poultry excreta gan et al 2019 kim and choi 2012 uzun and debik 2019 several technologies have been used to remove no3 from water including biological denitrification ion exchange reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ruiz beviá and fernández torres 2019 these approaches have shown success in specific application scenarios but they each have limitations for example biological treatment is slow and requires large reactors and complex operation it is difficult to scale down to small systems ion exchange requires high concentrations of harsh chemicals such as alkaline for regeneration the subsequent disposal of which has major environmental impact li et al 2015 meng et al 2014 ro and electrodialysis can achieve high no3 removal but they also remove almost all other common ions e g na cl ca2 so4 2 which are often present at concentrations orders of magnitude higher than no3 leading to significant overtreatment and hence high energy consumption electrosorption processes such as capacitive deionization cdi are simple and chemical free they have attracted interest for their capability of removing ionic contaminants as well as desalinating brackish water chen et al 2015 suss et al 2015 in electrosorption ions adsorb on the oppositely charged electrode during adsorption period and desorb when a zero or reversed voltage is applied producing desalinated water and brine in alternating cycles zuo et al 2018 although conventional carbon electrodes remove charged species non selectively through electrostatic interaction selective removal of target contaminants including ca2 so4 2 and heavy metals and high value metals has been demonstrated using functionalized carbon selective ion exchange membranes and coatings d i kim et al 2019 zuo et al 2018 and novel materials such as metal organic frameworks zuo et al 2020 several recent studies have demonstrated selective electrosorption of no3 for example a carbon electrode coated with anion exchange resins containing amine functional groups realized a selectivity of 3 39 for no3 over cl and 2 3 times higher no3 adsorption than the uncoated carbon electrode kim and choi 2012 activated carbon electrode functionalized with quaternary amine surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide achieved a no3 to cl selectivity of 7 7 in an passive inverted cdi cell without an applied electric field oyarzun et al 2018 in addition because no3 is more weakly solvated compared with cl and so4 2 slit micropores have been created in activated carbon to match the planar structure of dehydrated no3 to achieve selective electrosorption of no3 through the ion sieving effect hawks et al 2019 these studies suggest that amine functionalization and pore manipulation are effective approaches to improve no3 selectivity in electrosorption eggshell membrane esm is a natural biomass source available from food industry waste as a porous membrane with unique three dimensional microstructures esm has been used as an adsorbent to remove heavy metals from water including hexavalent chromium mercury silver and cadmium liu and huang 2011 sha wang 2013 sunho park 2016 esm can also be easily carbonized and the carbonized eggshell membranes cesm can be used as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion due to its high porosity as well as high electric conductivity geng et al 2015 li et al 2014 2012 rath et al 2014 in addition the protein network in esm results in high nitrogen content in cesm which has been reported to improve electrochemical properties such as conductivity deng et al 2016 ismagilov et al 2009 ji et al 2018 specific capacitance and wettability li et al 2018 shen and fan 2013 xu et al 2017 2019 yang et al 2019 in this study we for the first time apply the cesm in an electrosorption process for removal of no3 from water that contains common competing anions such as cl so4 2 and h2po4 the electrosorption behavior of cesm for various anions was comprehensively evaluated in single and multi solute solutions to evaluate its selectivity the no3 cl selectivity achieved was compared with those reported in previous publications and the mechanism of selectivity was elucidated using density function

electrode fabrication and characterization after removing the albumen and yolk of the eggs the eggshell was immersed in 0 1 m hcl solution overnight to obtain esm by etching away inorganic components mainly caco3 fig 1 a the eggshell membrane was then rinsed with di water and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight the esm was cut into 5 cm 1 cm coupons and pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace under argon

electrosorption experiments the electrosorption cell consists of a rectangular acrylic housing a pair of titanium current collectors a rubber gasket and a plastic mesh that form the flow channel a cesm working electrode and an ac counter electrode fig 1b because an ac electrode was used as the control anode and was tested using another ac electrode as the cathode the cesm anode was also tested using the same ac cathode both the ac and cesm electrodes have a dimension of 1 cm 5 cm and a cem was installed between the ac electrode and the mesh separator to enhance charge efficiency considering an anion exchange membrane aem may have different permeability for various anions no aem was utilized so that the actual selectivity of ac and cesm materials could be evaluated during operation a cesm 70 0 0 3 mg or ac 55 8 0 1 mg including pva binder but excluding the graphite sheet electrode was used as the anode and an ac electrode was used as the cathode the electrosorption cell was operated in

highly porous network of proteins on the inner side and a thin dense layer 1 μm of proteins on the outer side facing the inorganic eggshell fig 2 a1 s1 after carbonization the porous structure of the inner layer was well preserved fig 2a2 a3 while the dense outer layer became porous and interconnected with the inner layer network fig 2a4 a5 detailed sem characterization showed that the porous cesm network consisted of interconnected fibers with a diameter of 1 3 μm forming pores with size ranging from 0 5 to 4 μm n2 adsorption desorption isotherm showed that the cumulative pore volume of cesm was 0 0284 cm3 g and the pores were mostly mesopores with three distinct pore size ranges centered at 2 6 4 3 and 7 7 nm respectively fig 2b the hierarchical pore structure with pore sizes ranging from several micrometers macropores to a few nanometers mesopores provide channels for effective ion migration han et al 2019 lytle et al 2011 the high interconnectivity of the network was also conducive to efficient electron transfer li et al 2012 nevertheless as the cesm was not activated its specific surface area was only 13 0 m2 g this was comparable with previous report for a cesm carbonized at 700 c 17 0 m2 g li et al 2012 but much lower than ac 2103 7 m2 g fig 2b the ftir spectrum of the ac powder was smooth with few peaks indicating a high degree of carbonization fig 2c as a comparison the spectrum of esm showed the presence of abundant oxygen oh at 3200 3500 cm 1 c o at 1637 cm 1 and co at 1078 cm 1 arami et al 2006 kong and yu 2007 tsai et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 and

after carbonization at 600 c most oxygen functional groups were removed by dehydration decarboxylation and decarbonylation reactions while most nitrogen functional groups were preserved in the cesm fig 2c xps analyses further confirmed that the high n content 13 3 wt and the n c atomic ratio 14 in the cesm fig 5a in contrast to the activated carbon 0 2 n 3 2 electrosorption for single solute solutions the electrosorption performance of the cesm and ac electrodes were evaluated using single solute solutions containing 2 0 mm nacl nano3 na2so4 or nah2po4 h2o as shown in figs 3a and s2 reproducible current effluent conductivity and ph profiles were obtained for the cesm electrode during the adsorption and desorption cycles a frequency doubling effect ahualli et al 2019 porada et al 2013 occurred for so4 2 because so4 2 possessed twice the charge of the other anions and caused fast release of co ions na during the adsorption period as the system was operated in a continuous flow mode effluent conductivity decreased during the adsorption period and increased during the desorption period at 1 2 v fig 3a despite that the initial conductivities were different for different solutions the changes in conductivity for nano3 and nacl solutions were much higher than that for na2so4 or nah2po4 solution and the conductivity change in the nano3 solution was even greater than that in the nacl solution indicating higher adsorption of no3 than the three other anions effluent anion concentrations determined by ic exhibited a trend consistent with the conductivity profiles fig 3b with single solute adsorption following the order of no3 0 052 0 004 mmol g cl 0 031 0 001 mmol g h2po4 0 008 0 001 mmol g so4 2 0 005 0 001 mmol g fig 3c because h2po4 was the dominant phosphate species at ph 4 5 5 5 h2po4 concentration was used to represent total phosphate furthermore adsorption of all ions was highly reversible with almost complete release of the adsorbed ions during the desorption cycle fig 3b c it was noted that although the hydrated radius of cl is smaller than no3 and the equivalent concentration of so4 2 was twice that of no3 the adsorption of no3 on cesm was much higher than that of cl and so4 2 suggesting that the cesm had different affinity towards the various anions the electric capacitance of the electrode was further characterized by chronopotentiometry as shown in fig 3d the cesm electrode exhibited a much higher electric capacitance in nano3 solution 4 3 0 2 mf g than in nacl solution 3 0 0 3 mf g consistent with the greater electrosorption of no3 by the cesm electrode according to eq 1 the higher capacitance in nano3 than in nacl shows that the cesm has higher adsorption capacity of no3 than cl suggesting that the cesm has more electrosorption sites for no3 than cl which will be further discussed in the following sections the single solute adsorption by the ac electrode also exhibited highly reproducible adsorption and desorption behavior during the charging and discharging periods fig s3 however anion adsorption on the ac anode followed the order of cl 0 133 0 003 mmol g no3 0 107 0 002 mmol g so4 2 0 071 0 003 mmol g h2po4 0 016 0 003 mmol g figure s3 different from the cesm that had the highest electrosorption for no3 chronopotentiometry experiments further confirmed that the ac electrode had a much higher electric capacitance in the nacl solution 7 8 0 6 mf g than in the nano3 solution 2 8 0 2 mf g fig s4 it should be noted that the specific surface area of cesm 13 0 m2 g was less than 1 of that of ac 2103 7 m2 g yet its electric capacitance was 154 and 38 that of ac in nano3 and nacl respectively the electrode mass normalized adsorption of no3 on the cesm 0 052 0 004 mmol g was 48 6 of that on the ac 0 107 0 002 mmol g but the surface area normalized no3 adsorption 4 0 10 3 mmol m 2 was 78 4 times that of the ac 5 1 10 5 mmol m 2 these results suggest an extremely high adsorption capacity and electric capacitance per unit surface area of the cesm especially when no3 was utilized as charge carrier comparable current was produced during the adsorption and desorption periods for all four solutions fig s2 s5 since the cesm has higher ion adsorption for no3 and cl fig 2c it also produced higher current in no3 and cl solutions fig s5 charge efficiencies for cesm were 50 8 53 2 40 5 and 20 2 in the no3 cl h2po4 and so4 2 solution respectively fig 3c these charge efficiencies were relatively low compared to conventional membrane cdi 90 nevertheless the charge efficiency of cesm in no3 and cl solutions were clearly higher than that in so4 2 and h2po4 solutions due to the lower cation i e na concentration suss et al 2015 the low charge efficiencies were caused by the absence of an anion exchange membrane on the cesm surface which allowed adsorption and release of co ions i e na on the anode during the desorption and adsorption cycles respectively in addition as so4 2 and phosphate species possess more charges than cl and no3 they would cause more and faster release of co ions during the adsorption period resulting in lower charge efficiency than in no3 and cl containing solutions this phenomenon was also observed in our previous study where charge efficiency was lower in a cacl2 solution than in a nacl solution of the same molar concentration kim et al 2019 in addition the hydrated size and hydration energy of no3 0 335 nm in radius 300 kj mol and cl 0 332 nm 340 kj mol are also smaller compared to so4 2 0 379 nm 1080 kj mol and h2po4 0 450 nm 465 kj mol hawks et al 2019 marcus 1991 which leads to higher mobility and better access to adsorption sites 3 3 electrosorption of multi solute solutions in natural water or wastewater background anions such as cl and so4 2 would compete with no3 for adsorption sites on the electrode to evaluate the impact of common competing anions electrosorption experiments were carried out using a multi solute solution containing 0 5 mm each of nano3 nacl na2so4 and nah2po4 h2o as shown in fig s6 4a b reproducible effluent conductivity ph and effluent ion concentrations were observed during repeated adsorption and desorption cycles using either the cesm or the ac electrode as the anode the conductivity change was much higher when using ac than cesm anodes indicating higher amount of ion adsorption desorption due to larger surface area of the ac electrode material measurement of anion concentrations showed that the removal of no3 cl so4 2 and h2po4 by the ac electrode was 0 057 0 001 0 051 0 001 0 044 0 001 and 0 026 0 002 mmol g respectively during the adsorption period while the total anion removal tar reached 0 178 mmol g fig s7 in contrast the removal of no3 cl so4 2 and h2po4 by the cesm was 0 031 0 002 0 004 0 001 0 003 0 001 0 003 0 001 mmol g respectively and the tar was 0 041 mmol g fig s7 the no3 removal by the cesm was 54 that of the ac electrode when calculated based on the electrode mass however because the cesm was not activated its surface area 13 0 m2 g was less than 1 of that of ac 2103 7 m2 g when normalizing no3 electrosorption by surface area mmol m2 no3 removal by the cesm would reach 2 4 10 3 mmol m2 which was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of the ac electrode fig 4c these data suggest that the cesm has much higher affinity for no3 than ac detailed analyses found that no3 adsorption by ac 0 057 0 001 mmol g only accounted for 32 0 of the total anion removal fig 4c the selectivity of the ac electrode for no3 over cl so4 2 and h2po4 were calculated to be 1 12 0 04 1 29 0 21 and 2 19 0 15 respectively fig 4d the values suggest that the ac electrode has little selectivity for no3 over the competing cl so4 2 and h2po4 as a comparison no3 accounted for 75 6 of the total anion adsorption on cesm fig 4c more than two times of that for the ac electrode the selectivity for no3 over cl so4 2 and h2po4 of the cesm reached 7 79 0 36 10 38 0 85 and 10 38 0 62 respectively fig 4d much higher than the ac electrode the cesm produced a notably lower current than the ac electrode fig s8 4e however the charge efficiency of the cesm 67 9 4 2 was much higher than ac 39 3 1 8 fig 4e indicating that charges provided to the cesm were more efficiently utilized for ion adsorption this is attributed to the strong interactions between no3 and adsorption sites on the cesm and hence less interference from cations compared to the ac electrode the high charge efficiency and no3 selectivity of the cesm both decrease energy consumption for no3 removal from the multi solute solution the energy consumption for no3 removal from the multi solute solution was 1147 7 kj mol no3 by the ac electrode but only 248 8 kj mol no3 by the cesm an almost 5 fold reduction 3 4 comparison with previous studies table 1 and fig 4f summarize the no3 cl selectivity in electrosorption studies reported in the literature these studies utilized different materials and different applied voltages to achieve selective electrosorption of no3 for example no3 selective ion exchange resin coatings on activated carbon electrodes were reported to reach no3 cl selectivity of 2 3 at 1 0 v kim and choi 2012 and 1 5 at 1 0 1 6 v gan et al 2019 a quaternary amine functionalized carbon achieved no3 cl selectivity of 6 5 at voltage of 0 4 v oyarzun et al 2018 an ultramicroporous carbon with sub nanometer pores realized no3 cl selectivity of 6 1 at 0 6 v hawks et al 2019 and 6 0 at 1 2 v mubita et al 2019 utilizing a commercial anion exchange membrane neosepta amx in cdi also realized no3 cl selectivity of 4 37 at 1 0 v kim et al 2013 in our study the cesm realized no3 cl selectivity of 7 79 0 36 at an applied voltage of 1 2 v to the best of our knowledge this no3 cl selectivity was the highest to date among reported studies operating at 1 2 v fig 4f table 1 it is well understood that the no3 cl selectivity decreases with increasing applied voltage due to enhanced dehydration of cl at higher voltages fig 4f table 1 therefore it is expected that the no3 cl selectivity of the cesm could be further improved if a lower voltage is applied however low operation voltage would lead to decreased electrosorption kinetics and overall electrosorption capacity which would require longer adsorption time and more electrode materials to achieve the same removal a good electrosorption material should possess high selectivity at high operation voltage e g 1 2 v to realize high selectivity fast kinetics as well as low electrode material usage for the removal of a target contaminant it is noted that eq 5 takes into consideration the influent concentrations of the target and competing ions therefore selectivity calculated using eq 5 allows comparison between studies that used different cl to no3 concentration ratios if adsorption is linear with respect to influent concentration which is usually the case at relatively low concentrations the cl to no3 concentration ratios used in the previous studies shown in table 1 ranged from 1 1 to 3 1 in this study the cl no3 concentration ratio 1 1 used was similar to many previous studies hassanvand et al 2018 hawks et al 2019 mubita et al 2019 tong and elimelech 2016 tsai et al 2021 wang et al 2020 this suggests that direct comparison of no3 cl selectivity is reasonable in real water and wastewater however the cl to no3 concentration ratio can be much higher than those used in these studies further research is needed to evaluate electrode materials selectivity in more realistic solution conditions in addition the high no3 concentration in the brine collected during the desorption step is favorable for n recovery as a nutrient in the case degradation is required a higher no3 concentration will also enhance biological or electro chemical degradation rate 3 5 proposed mechanism of nitrate selective removal on cesm several factors influence electrosorption selectivity including hydrated size valence and electronegativity of the ions eliad et al 2001 guyes et al 2019 hawks et al 2019 mubita et al 2019 sun et al 2018 suss 2017 and pore size hawks et al 2019 as well as the surface chemistry ma et al 2019 oyarzun et al 2018 palko et al 2018 of the electrode the no3 and cl ions have smaller hydrated ion radius than h2po4 and so4 2 therefore they have better access to the active sites and adsorption capacity despite that no3 and cl have similar hydrated radius no3 0 335 nm cl 0 332 nm and diffusion coefficients no3 1 91 10 9 m2 s cl 2 03 10 9 m2 s hassanvand et al 2018 previous studies have reported that no3 was preferentially removed by activated carbon electrodes and the selectivity are attributed to its higher electronegativity 4 32 than cl 3 16 sun et al 2018 and weaker solvation which allows no3 to be easily dehydrated and adsorbed in small pores hawks et al 2019 in our study the ac possessed rich micropores with pore sizes 2 nm fig 2c it realized slightly higher electrosorption of no3 0 057 0 001 mmol g than cl 0 051 0 001 mmol g from the multi solute solution consistent with previous reports hawks et al 2019 sun et al 2018 although the cesm possessed much bigger pore sizes 2 5 nm fig 2b it still achieved significantly higher no3 cl selectivity this result indicates that the pore size is not the main reason for the high no3 cl selectivity found in cesm we hypothesize that the high no3 selectivity on cesm resulted from its different chemical composition and unique chemical interactions with no3 as revealed by xps the ac electrode was mainly composed of c with no detectable n atoms fig s9 the cesm however contained 13 3 wt n and 6 2 wt o fig 5a many previous studies have reported that n containing amine functionalized activated carbon oyarzun et al 2018 palko et al 2018 and ion exchange resins containing amine functional groups ebrahimi and roberts 2015 gan et al 2019 kim and choi 2012 improve selective adsorption of no3 therefore it is hypothesized that the rich n species on the cesm are related to the superior no3 cl selectivity as shown in fig 5b detailed xps analysis of the n1s spectrum showed that the cesm contained four nitrogen species pyridinic nitrogen n 6 398 44 ev pyrrolic nitrogen n 5 399 7 ev oxidized pyridinic nitrogen n x 402 5 ev and quaternary nitrogen n q 400 8 ev fig 5b li et al 2014 xiao et al 2013 the n 6 and n 5 are nitrogen atoms that are bonded with two carbon atoms and donate two s electrons to the π system of a 6 and 5 member ring respectively the n x peak originates from oxidized pyridine nitrogen atoms that are bonded with two carbon atoms and one oxygen atom the n q peak is related to nitrogen atoms that are connected with three carbon atoms via covalent bonds it was reported that the n species could induce charge delocalization on the carbon matrix because the electronegativity of n 3 5 is higher than that of c 3 0 wang et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 the charge on c atoms adjacent to n redistributes and reaches a substantially high positive charge density in order to counterbalance the strong electronic affinity of n the redistributed charge can attract cations anions and thus improve electrosorption for target species liu et al 2020 it was also reported that the n q and n x exhibited electron donor ability and could boost electron transfer kinetics through the carbon material cheng et al 2019 shen and fan 2013 zhou et al 2015 and the n 5 and n 6 may enhance electrosorption activity as they are located at the edge sites of the carbon matrix ji et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in addition the n species were also reported to improve the wettability of carbon which was confirmed in this study by contact angle measurement fig s10 and may improve the electrolyte invasion and ion adsorption to evaluate the effect of n species on electrosorption of anions on cesm dft calculation was performed to determine the molecular distance and binding energy between the nitrogen species on cesm and various anions including no3 cl and so4 2 as shown in fig 5c the schematics illustrated the molecular structure and charge distribution of the nitrogen species on cesm and various anions the calculated molecular distance between the n atoms on cesm and various anions showed that all the n species on cesm had the shortest distance to no3 compared with cl and so4 2 fig 5d the gibbs free energy of the binding reactions between various n species on cesm and no3 was negative and lower than that for cl and so4 2 fig 5e implying stronger binding of no3 than cl and so4 2 on the cesm since the calculations were performed in hydrosolvent conditions the high affinity of n species on cesm for no3 may be attributed to the lower absolute hydration energy of no3 300 kj mol than cl 340 kj mol and so4 2 1080 kj mol hawks et al 2019 which leads to a lower energy barrier for dehydration epsztein et al 2019 besides no3 it is also interesting to note that the various n species on cesm also have shorter distance and higher affinity for so4 2 than that of cl while cl removal was higher than so4 2 in both the single solute solution fig 3c and the mixed solute solution fig 4c this result may be caused by the larger size of so4 2 radius of 0 379 nm than cl 0 332 nm which leads to less accessibility of so4 2 to the cesm pores notably the n 6 and n x show smaller closest distance to no3 than n q and n 5 fig 5d and their binding energy is also higher than n q fig 5e suggesting that they may have greater effect on no3 electrosorption further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis using electrode materials doped with single nitrogen species the carbonization temperature was found to have an important impact on the performance of the cesm electrode as shown in fig s11 the cesm carbonized at 400 c exhibited negligible salt electrosorption presumably due to incomplete carbonization and hence low conductance the cesm carbonized at 800 c on the other hand showed higher adsorption capacity for both no3 0 038 mmol g and cl 0 009 mmol g than the cesm carbonized at 600 c table s1 the higher adsorption capacity may be attributed to the higher specific surface area and electric conductivity resulting from the higher carbonization temperature nevertheless the cesm carbonized at 800 c obtained a no3 cl selectivity 4 16 much lower than the cesm carbonized at 600 c these results indicate that carbonization at high temperatures e g 800 c may damage the nitrogen functional groups that are responsible for no3 selectivity 4 conclusion in this study an ultrathin porous electrode derived from the eggshell bio wastes was fabricated and for the first time utilized in electrosorption for removal of anionic species the prepared carbonized eggshell membrane possessed an interconnected porous network with a uniform micrometer thickness and a hierarchical pore size ranging from several tens of microns to a few nanometers although cesm has low specific surface area it has high electric capacitance and realized surface area normalized ion adsorption capacity two orders of magnitude higher than activated carbon more importantly the cesm exhibited to date the highest selectivity for no3 against common competing anions including cl so4 2 and h2po4 dft calculations revealed the critical role of the abundant nitrogen containing functional groups on cesm in selective adsorption of no3 a great advantage of carbon materials derived from protein rich biowaste these findings are particularly encouraging because they not only suggest that nitrogen rich biomaterials are promising precursors for no3 selective electrodes but also provide an important direction for chemical modification of other material systems where selective no3 adsorption is needed from a practical application aspect the as synthesized cesm may not be an economical electrode material yet due to its low specific surface area further activation of the cesm or other nitrogen rich biomaterials can be performed to introduce micropores and increase specific surface area alternatively existing carbon electrode materials with high specific surface area can be functionalized to introduce nitrogen containing function groups e g by doping with n species to further enhance the no3 selectivity in addition the stability of the cesm also needs to be investigated during long term operation these nitrogen rich electrode materials have the potential to remove and recover no3 from water and wastewater through highly selective electrosorption

16128,hydroxylamine nh2oh has been verified to efficiently strengthen pollutants oxidation in fe ii peroxydisulfate pds and fe ii h2o2 systems however the different effects of hydroxylamine salts types were rarely recognized herein the effects of two commonly used hydroxylamine salts i e nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 on oxidation kinetics and reactive species composition were compared in fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems for the first time pseudo first order kinetics could only describe benzoic acid ba oxidation well in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system which was related to the different concentration changes of fe iii determined by oxidant n h 3 o h 2 hydroxylamine salts types influenced not kinetic rules but reaction rates of target compounds the empirical reaction rate constant of ba in fe ii nh2oh hcl pds system was 141 5 of that in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system under the same concentration of nh2oh 1 4 mm while the apparent reaction rate constant in fe ii nh2oh hcl h2o2 system was 68 of that in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system this opposite effect resulted from the differences in primary reactive species compositions and their interactions with cl reactive species identification indicated that cl would decrease the contribution of ferryl ion fe iv and transform sulfate radical so4 to hydroxyl radical oh in fe ii nh2oh pds system while it competitively consumed the only reactive species oh in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system this study highlights the importance of reductants types on strengthening fenton oxidation and offers a reference for reasonable construction of the relevant systems ga image graphical abstract keywords hydroxylamine peroxydisulfate hydrogen peroxide reactive species chloride ions 1 introduction since been discovered in 1894 fenton advanced oxidation processes aops based on the reactions between fe ii and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have been extensively used in water and wastewater treatments for persistent organic pollutants degradation liu et al 2021 pignatello et al 2006 in recent years peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms have been found as another effective fenton oxidants with the advantage of storage and transportation as well as the wide reaction ph ranges bokare and choi 2014 wacławek et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 considering the similar symmetric structures of one peroxy bond pds and h2o2 were usually studied together in previous scientific research however less attentions were paid to the significant differences in reactive species composition and its related influence on pollutants oxidation between fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems in fe ii h2o2 system hydroxyl radical oh is produced and contributed to pollutants oxidation at acidic medium while fe iv would form when raising the value of ph to near neutral conditions bataineh et al 2012 differently fe iv so4 and oh simultaneously exist and contribute to pollutants oxidation in fe ii pds system at ph 3 0 6 5 dong et al 2020 besides the difference in types of reactive species the diverse reactivities among fe iv so4 and oh also influence the oxidation efficiency of the system compared with fe iv oh and so4 usually have higher reaction rate constants but lower steady state concentrations with organic pollutants buxton et al 1988 jacobsen et al 1998 neta et al 1988 zhang et al 2020 moreover oh is considered as a non selective oxidant reacting with organic pollutants through hydrogen abstraction or radical addition lee et al 2020 pignatello et al 2006 while so4 and fe iv show higher selectivity through the reaction of electron abstraction and oxygen transformation with organic pollutants respectively lee et al 2020 pestovsky and bakac 2006 thus same target compounds reacting with oh so4 and fe iv could produce diverse reaction intermediates and achieve different oxidation efficiency the difference in selectivity also makes oh more easily influenced by background constituents than so4 and fe iv moreover the reactivity of fe iv is more ph depended than so4 and oh due to the reaction of fe oh 2 2 h2o fe oh 3 h pestovsky and bakac 2006 those different reactivities among oh so4 and fe iv implied the critical role of reactive species types and compositions on organic pollutants oxidation process thus despite the similarities in oxidant structures distinguishing the differences in types and relative contents of reactive species is crucial to choosing the more suitable reactive system between fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 for pollutants oxidation however those comparison based on different reactive species of the two systems was rarely systematically conducted especially under various treatment conditions with coexisting water constitutions besides the basic fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems strengthened fenton like systems have been developed to further improve the system oxidation efficiency one effective strategy is to introduce reductants e g hydroxylamine ascorbic acid metal sulfide and carbon materials to improve fe ii restoration fukuchi et al 2014 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 hydroxylamine nh2oh has shown significant acceleration effects on the oxidation of various organic pollutants e g sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen and atrazine in both fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems chen et al 2011 han et al 2014 hou et al 2017 jin et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2017 yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 zou et al 2013 making it a representative reductant for accelerating fenton and fenton like systems similar with fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems differences of reactive species types and relative contents are also needed to be distinguished in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems considering that treatment conditions changed by nh2oh might alter the constitution of reactive species as aforementioned li et al 2021 moreover types of hydroxylamine salts e g nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 might also influence the acceleration effect and change the constitutions of reactive species due to the coexisting anions e g cl as commonly existing in water cl was usually found to compete with pollutants to consume reactive species e g so4 and oh in fenton like systems xu and li 2010 during this process chlorine species e g hclo cl2 cl and cl2 might be produced and further react with pollutants or form chlorine by products fang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 those findings indicated that the presence of cl could change the types and constitutions of reactive species in fenton like systems in fe ii nh2oh pms systems our previous study found that cl could improve the produce cl and oh to accelerate dimethyl phthalate dmp oxidation because the mono coordinated intermediate between fe ii and pms was more likely formed with the present of cl li et al 2021 both pds and pms are commonly used oxidants to produce so4 in fenton like systems but they share different structures and reaction pathways with fe ii pms has the asymmetric structure and pds has the symmetrical structure which cause different combination mode with cl and fe ii during activation process and result in the different decomposition pathway to produce reactive species however the effect of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds system on the constitutions of reactive species is ignored and rarely compared with fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems as the commonly used reductants to accelerate fenton like systems it is necessary to provide a systematical comparison including the effects of nh2oh salts types on reactive species constitutions between fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems this would help to select suitable reaction systems and hydroxylamine salts types between fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems for pollutants oxidation in this study effects of two typical hydroxylamine salts i e nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 on reactive species constitution were deeply investigated through the comparison of reaction kinetics and the effects of cl in fe ii h2o2 and fe ii pds systems benzoic acid ba nitrobenzene nb and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso were chosen as probes to identify the types and constitutions of reactive species detailed reasons for choosing the target compounds in text s1 the main contents of this study are 1 to build the kinetic models and reveal the reason for kinetic differences in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 and fe ii nh2oh pds systems 2 to compare the effects of hydroxylamine salts types on reactive species constitutions and explore the inner interactions between reactive species and cl in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 and fe ii nh2oh pds systems this study could be a reference for further research in other reductants accelerated fenton and fenton like systems 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl benzoic acid ba dimethyl phthalate dmp n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd horseradish peroxidase hrp 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts and peroxydisulfate pds were supplied by sigma aldrich inc hydroxylamine sulfate nh2oh 2 h2so4 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 were provided by j k scientific ltd ferrous sulfate sodium hydroxide hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 v v tertbutyl alcohol tba and perchloric acid were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd nitrobenzene nb sodium chloride and acetone were obtained from tianjin guangfu technology development co ltd these chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification methanol meoh and acetonitrile both of hplc grade were supplied by tedia 2 2 experimental procedures batch scale experiments were conducted in 150 ml erlenmeyer flasks with a reaction solution of 100 ml reactions were initiated by adding stock solutions of oxidants pds or h2o2 into the reaction system containing a desired concentration of target compounds ba nb or pmso fe ii nh2oh hcl or nh2oh 2 h2so4 and nacl for alcohol scavenging experiments tba or meoh were added before the addition of stock solutions of oxidants initial values of ph were adjusted to 3 0 by hclo4 and naoh before the reaction started which was the optimal ph in both fe ii nh2oh h2o2 and fe ii nh2oh pds systems chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 the ph values dropped by less than 0 5 units during the whole reaction process data not shown samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and immediately quenched by excess methanol before hplc analysis all reaction solutions were prepared with ultrapure water during the reaction a magnetic stirrer was used with a stirring rate of 600 r min and the temperature was kept at 25 0 5 c all experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate average values and one standard deviation are reported in this work 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of ba nb dmp pmso and pmso2 were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 with a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 µm waters and a photo diode array detector pda waters 2998 ba was detected at 227 nm nb and dmp were detected at 263 nm the mobile phases consisted of methanol and water 1 acetic acid mixed at a ratio of 45 55 v v for ba and dmp and 60 40 v v for nb at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 pmso and pmso2 were detected by acetonitrile and water 1 acetic acid mixed at a ratio of 20 80 v v with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 and the detection wavelengths were 230 nm for pmso and 215 nm for pmso2 respectively the concentration of nh2oh was detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc agilent at the wavelength of 210 nm samples were withdrawn and reacted with acetone to produce acetone oxime before detection the mobile phases were comprised of methanol and water 0 2 formic acid mixed at a ratio of 30 70 v v with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 due to the presence of hydroxylamine the concentration of fe iii was directly measured at 300 nm without quenching zou et al 2013 and methanol was used to substitute ba as the target compound to avoid the absorbance interference of ba at 300 nm the concentration of pds was measured with a modified fe2 dpd method at 551 nm and the concentration of h2o2 was measured by a hrp abts method at 415 nm lee et al 2014 the uv vis spectrometer for concentrations of fe iii pds and h2o2 detection was from hach dr 5000 the presence of nh2oh showed a slight influence on the detection methods of pds and h2o2 figure s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hydroxylamine salts types on ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems to investigate the acceleration effects of different types of hydroxylamine salts oxidation of ba in fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems with nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 were studied respectively whatever types of hydroxylamine salt added ba showed a significant higher oxidation rate in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system than that in fe ii nh2oh pds system fig 1 a while the oxidation kinetic rules in the two systems were different with the addition of either nh2oh hcl or nh2oh 2 h2so4 the oxidation kinetics of ba had higher correlation coefficients with polynomial regression analysis than the pseudo first order kinetic models in fe ii pds system fig 1 b and table 1 which was proven in our previous study li et al 2020 differently the oxidation kinetics followed the pseudo first order kinetic model in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system fig 1 b and table 1 regardless of hydroxylamine salts types these kinetic differences between fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems was rarely found and discussed since oxidation kinetics could reflect the inner interaction of reactants and reactive species the reason for the kinetic difference between fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system was further explored to deeply elucidate system properties previous researches in fe ii nh2oh pds system indicated that fe ii and fe iii concentrations would influence the oxidation kinetics of target compounds by changing the activation rate of oxidants and the production rate of reactive species li et al 2020 thus changes of fe iii in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 and fe ii nh2oh pds systems were compared after the commonly fast accumulation in initial 30 s the concentration of fe iii reached a plateau to less than 3 µm in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system fig 1 d while it gradually increased from 3 µm to nearly 5 5 µm in fe ii nh2oh pds system regardless of hydroxylamine salts types fig 1 c studies once founded that the oxidation kinetics would change from the polynomial regression model to the pseudo first order reaction model when the concentration of fe iii gradually turned to be stable in fe ii nh2oh pds system li et al 2020 thus it could be deduced that the similar stable fe iii concentrations maintained the production rate of reactive species and contributed to the pseudo first order reaction kinetics of ba in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system the different changes of fe iii concentrations caused the kinetic differences in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems since fe iii was mainly produced from the activation of oxidants by fe ii and consumed by nh2oh as eqs 1 6 shown in both systems concentrations of nh2oh pds and h2o2 were detected to further explore the inner cause of different fe iii concentrations 1 nh3oh nh2oh h k1 bengtsson et al 2002 2 nh2oh fe3 fe nh2oh 3 β2 bengtsson et al 2002 3 fe nh2oh 3 nh2o h fe2 k 3 bengtsson et al 2002 4 2nh2o n2 2h2o k4 bengtsson et al 2002 5 fe ii s2o8 2 fe iii so4 2 so4 fe ii s2o8 2 h2o fe iv 2so4 2 2h k5 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 wang et al 2018 6 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh k6 pignatello et al 2006 the concentration of nh2oh used in experiments was 140 times of fe ii which indicated that fe iii was mainly reduced by nh2oh and the reaction between nh2o and fe iii could be ignored thus nh2o mainly went through dimerization reaction and n2 was considered as the only product to simplify analysis as eqs 1 4 showed li et al 2020 under this condition bengtsson once found the consumption rate of fe iii by nh2oh could be written as the form of eq 7 bengtsson et al 2002 7 d fe iii dt b fe iii 2 nh 3 oh 2 fe ii 2 h 4 where the coefficient b was 2k1 2 β2 2 k3 2 k4 k 3 2 which was equal to 2k1 2 β2 2 k3 2 k4 obtained from eqs 1 4 bengtsson et al 2002 as aforementioned the concentration of fe iii kept stable after the initial 30 s in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system indicating that the production and the consumption rate of fe iii should have the same values theoretically though reactive species i e fe iv so4 and oh produced by pds and h2o2 also consumed fe ii and fe iii the extremely low concentrations of these reactive species resulted in a minor contribution to the transformation of fe iii fe ii compared to reactants i e nh2oh pds and h2o2 thus only eqs 5 and 6 were considered as the route for fe iii production the production rate of fe iii could be written as eq 8 8 d fe iii dt d fe ii dt k fe ii oxi fe ii oxi where k f e i i o x i referred to k5 or k6 and oxi referred to pds or h2o2 as eqs 5 and 6 showed respectively when the production and the consumption rate of fe iii had the same values the relation of fe iii and fe ii concentrations vs oxidants and nh2oh concentrations could be obtained as eq 9 by combining eqs 7 and 8 9 fe iii 2 fe ii 3 k fe ii oxi h 4 oxi b nh 3 oh 2 since k fe ii oxi and b were constants and the value of ph changed slightly during the reaction process the concentrations of fe ii and fe iii were determined by the value of oxi n h 3 o h 2 based on changes of nh2oh pds and h2o2 concentrations during ba oxidation process figures s2 and s3 the values of oxi n h 3 o h 2 were calculated after the initial 30 s the value of pds n h 3 o h 2 gradually increased with the presence of both nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 while the value of h 2 o 2 nh 3 oh 2 was steady around 500 during the reaction process fig 2 thus the concentration of fe iii should keep increasing in fe ii nh2oh pds system but remain nearly unchanged in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems based on eq 9 which was in accordance with our experimental results the value of oxi n h 3 o h 2 determined the variation rules of fe iii concentrations eventually resulted in the kinetic difference of ba in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems since the initial concentrations of all reactants were same in the two systems these disparate consumption of pds and h2o2 were due to the different reaction rate constants of pds k f e i i p d s 26 m 1 s 1 brandt and eldik 1955 and h2o2 k f e i i h 2 o 2 78 m 1 s 1 de laat and le truong 2005 with fe ii though hydroxylamine salts types had no influence on the formation of kinetic rules fig 1 b oxidation efficiencies of ba were different with different types of hydroxylamine salts the oxidation efficiency of ba increased 24 6 with the addition of nh2oh hcl than nh2oh 2 h2so4 of the same nh2oh dosage in fe ii pds system while it slightly decreased 6 in fe ii h2o2 system under the same nh2oh addition condition fig 1 a the higher acceleration effects of nh2oh hcl than nh2oh 2 h2so4 were once found in fe ii pms system due to the additional acceleration of cl provided by nh2oh hcl li et al 2021 which was in accordance with our experimental results in fe ii pds system however the lower promotion of nh2oh hcl than nh2oh 2 h2so4 in fe ii h2o2 system indicated the existence of different pathways of cl from fe ii pds system which was ignored in previous research to provide a precise comparison of the function of hydroxylamine in fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems acceleration of different hydroxylamine salts and effects of cl were quantified with kinetic models built above and the inner mechanism was further explored 3 2 the effect of cl on ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems the effect of cl was comparatively studied by adding different concentrations of cl in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds and fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 systems during ba oxidation process cl promoted ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system fig 3 a but decreased it in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system fig 3 c with the increase of cl concentrations from 0 7 mm to 1 4 mm the oxidation efficiency of ba was at the ranges of 74 82 after 15 min in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system and was 84 90 after 5 min in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system which were nearly the same as that with nh2oh hcl in both systems 84 for pds and 88 for h2o2 as fig 1 a showed these further verified that cl caused the different acceleration effects between nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 in both fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems oxidation kinetic expressions of ba were calculated in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems to provide a precise analysis of the acceleration effects of cl as aforementioned the oxidation of ba followed the polynomial regression kinetic rule in fe ii nh2oh pds system both with and without the presence of cl fig 3 b thus the oxidation kinetic expression of ba in fe ii nh2oh pds system could be expressed as eq 10 and the reaction rate of ba could be obtained from eq 10 as eq 11 detailed calculation process in text s2 10 ln ba ba 0 b 1 t 2 b 2 t b 3 11 r ba 0 2 b 1 t b 2 e b 1 t 2 b 2 t b 3 where b1 b2 and b3 are coefficients obtained from polynomial regression analysis calculation based on eq 10 the apparent reaction rate constant changed during ba oxidation process to obtain the definite promotion effect of cl empirical reaction kinetic expressions of ba were calculated in fe ii nh2oh pds system thus the oxidation rate of ba could also be written as eq 12 with the presence of cl 12 r d ba dt k pds α nh 2 oh β fe ii γ cl δ ba ε where k represented the empirical reaction rate constant and coefficients α to ε represented the order of reactions of each reactant respectively to obtain the values of k and exponents α to ε the method of initial rates was used since the initial rate r0 represented the reaction rate shortly before any significant changes took place it could be written in the form of ba 0 b 2 e b 3 or eq 13 eq 14 based on eq 11 and eq 12 respectively 13 r 0 k pds 0 α nh 2 oh 0 β fe ii 0 γ cl 0 δ ba 0 ε 14 lg r 0 lg k α lg pds 0 β lg nh 2 oh 0 γ lg fe ii 0 δ lg cl 0 ε lg ba 0 when the concentration of one reactant changed a series of r0 could be obtained from eq 11 through polynomial regression analysis figure s4 a to e and table s1 and the corresponding reaction order of that reactant could be obtained from the slope of plot lg r0 vs lg c0 based on eq 14 figure s5 a to e finally the value of the empirical reaction rate constant k could be obtained based on eq 13 with the reaction orders of all reactants calculated with the presence of cl the reaction orders of pds fe ii nh2oh ba and cl were calculated to be 0 69 0 77 0 27 0 49 and 0 15 respectively and the value of k was 211 55 m 1 36 s 1 fig 4 a thus the empirical reaction kinetic expression of ba in fe ii nh2oh pds system in the presence of cl could be expressed as follow 15 r 211 55 3 27 pds 0 69 0 013 n h 2 oh 0 27 0 011 fe ii 0 77 0 065 c l 0 15 0 018 ba 0 48 0 058 with the absence of cl the value of δ was 0 and reaction orders of other reactants could be calculated in the same way as mentioned above figure s6 s7 and table s2 the value of k was 4 977 m 1 07 s 1 fig 4 b and the empirical reaction kinetic expression of ba in fe ii nh2oh pds system without cl could be expressed as eq 16 16 r 4 977 0 045 pds 0 81 0 061 n h 2 oh 0 20 0 039 fe ii 0 57 0 022 ba 0 49 0 081 based on these two empirical reaction kinetic expressions the value of empirical reaction rate constant k increased 41 5 times with the addition of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds system the reaction order of pds decreased but the reaction order of fe ii increased with the addition of cl while the reaction orders of nh2oh and ba changed slightly indicating that cl mainly influenced the reaction between pds and fe ii to accelerate ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds system the oxidation kinetics of ba in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system with and without cl were calculated as well different from fe ii nh2oh pds system the oxidation kinetics of ba followed the pseudo first order reaction kinetic rule in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system fig 3 d thus the apparent reaction rate constants could be calculated with the concentration of cl increasing from 0 to 1 4 mm the value of apparent reaction rate constant decreased 32 fig 4 c and table s3 which further indicated that cl inhibited ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system the calculation of oxidation kinetics further proved the opposite effect of cl on ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems besides the increased oxidation efficiency of ba with the addition of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds system also indicated the improvement of effective availabilities of nh2oh and pds i e δ ba δ n h 2 oh and δ ba δ pds table s4 though the consumption of nh2oh pds and h2o2 slightly changed with the addition of cl in both systems figures s8 s9 reaction orders of pds and fe ii were changed in fe ii nh2oh pds systems which might influence the activation of pds by fe ii and the production of reactive species thus to clearly elucidate the possible mechanism for the opposite effects of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems the reactive species contributing to ba oxidation were needed to be identified 3 3 comparing the interaction between cl and reactive species in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems 3 3 1 the different interactions between cl and free radicals scavenging experiments were conducted to identify the major reactive species for ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems with and without the presence of cl meoh k s o 4 meoh 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 and tba k s o 4 tba 8 105 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 were chosen to distinguish the participation of so4 the oxidation efficiency of ba decreased 29 with the addition of tba while only less than 10 of ba was oxidized with the addition of meoh in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system fig 5 a indicating the contribution of so4 to ba oxidation process however with the addition of cl the oxidation of ba was almost completely inhibited by both meoh and tba in fe ii nh2oh hcl pds and fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds systems fig 5 b and 5 c indicating that so4 hardly contributed to ba oxidation under these experimental conditions when cl was added in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system cl could be produced by reactions between so4 and cl eq 17 and oh was further produced from a serious reactions between cl and h2o with cloh as the intermediate eqs 18 20 besides cl2 could also be produced through the reaction between cl and cl eq 21 however since both meoh and tba could simultaneously capture cl k cl meoh 5 7 109 m 1 s 1

tba in fig 5 b and 5 c could only exclude the contribution of cl2 fang et al 2014 but could not discriminate the contribution of oh and cl to ba oxidation processes thus nb was used to further identify the contribution of oh nb reacted fast with oh k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 than with so4 k s o 4 nb 106 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 and hardly reacted with cl and cl2 frøsig et al 2000 the oxidation efficiency of nb was significantly increased from 57 2 to 90 in both fe ii nh2oh hcl pds and fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds systems with the addition of cl figure s10 indicating that cl promoted the production and contribution of oh to pollutants oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds system 17 so4 cl cl so4 2 neta et al 1988 18 cl h2o cloh h kläning and wolff 1985 19 cl oh cloh kläning and wolff 1985 20 cloh cl oh jayson et al 1973 21 cl cl cl2 different from fe ii nh2oh pds system the oxidation of ba in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system was completely inhibited by both meoh and tba fig 5 d indicating that oh was the only reactive species contributing to ba oxidation the addition of cl hardly changed the complete scavenging effects of meoh and tba on ba oxidation figs 5 e 5 f which meant that reactive species contributing to ba oxidation was still oh moreover the oxidation of nb was slightly inhibited with the addition of cl figure s10 indicating that cl decreased the concentration of oh in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system based on above analysis the addition of cl showed adverse influence on both ba oxidation and oh production in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems which resulted from the interaction between cl and different primary reactive species i e so4 for pds and oh for h2o2 concentrations of oh so4 and cl were calculated to provide a definite description of the influence of cl on reactive species since the apparent reaction rate constant of ba changed in fe ii nh2oh pds system the exposure values i e the product of concentrations and reaction time ct were used to describe the concentration changes of all three reactive species during ba oxidation process trace concentrations of nb and dmp were added during ba oxidation because dmp could react with both oh so4 and cl since the role of cl2 was excluded by scavenging experiments above the exposure values of oh so4 and cl could be obtained based on reaction rates of nb dmp and ba respectively as eqs 22 24 detailed calculation in text s3 22 ct oh 1 k oh nb ln nb nb 0 23 ct so 4 k cl ba k oh dmp k cl dmp k oh ba ln nb nb 0 k oh nb k cl dmp ln ba ba 0 k oh nb k cl ba ln dmp dmp 0

1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 respectively with concentrations of cl increasing from 0 05 mm to 1 mm the values of ct oh and ct so 4 increased 58 5 and 150 respectively fig 6 a and 6 b however when the concentrations of cl further increased to 5 mm the values of ct oh and ct so 4 decreased to nearly the same as when 0 05 mm cl was added fig 6 a and 6 b the value of ct cl was kept less than 20 of ct so 4 and 40 of ct oh indicating that cl formed but hardly contributed to ba oxidation when cl was more than 1 mm fig 6 c calculations based on exposure values and reaction rate constants showed that the contribution of so4 to ba oxidation was 20 37 with the presence of cl thus though cl showed the highest promotion effect on so4 the larger reaction rate constants between ba and oh cl than so4 made oh and cl major reactive species during ba oxidation process these results further verified the importance of cl on promoting oh production during ba oxidation process different from fe ii nh2oh pds system the oxidation of ba followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system indicating that the steady state concentration of oh could be obtained from apparent reaction rate constants the concentration of oh decreased 32 when the concentration of cl increased to 1 4 mm fig 7 based on above scavenging experiments oh was the only reactive species contributing to ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system since cl would react with oh through eqs 20 and 21 the addition of cl could compete with ba to consume oh resulting in the decrease of oh production and ba oxidation 3 3 2 the interaction between cl and fe iv in fe ii nh2oh pds system different primary reactive species and their interaction with cl caused adverse effect on the production and contribution of oh to ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems especially reactions between so4 and cl playing a crucial role however these reactions only involved the increase of oh from so4 and cl but could not explain the increase of so4 in fe ii nh2oh pds system as fig 6 b showed actually the increasing production of so4 might provide additional oh production pathways e g so4 h2o oh so4 2 h to provide an overall function of cl in promoting oh production in fe ii nh2oh pds system other possible interactions of cl should be considered as well besides so4 and oh fe iv also existed in fe ii activated pds system wang et al 2018 cl was once found to decrease fe iv production but increase so4 and oh production in fe ii nh2oh pms system li et al 2021 indicating that the interaction between cl and fe iv could influence the production and contribution of so4 and oh as well to provide an overall comparison of the interaction between cl and reactive species the effect of cl on fe iv production in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems were explored different from so4 and oh ba nb meoh and tba all had low reaction rate constants with fe iv in acidic medium k ba fe iv 80 m 1 s 1 jacobsen et al 1998 k nb fe iv 1 05 103 m 1 s 1 martire et al 2002 k meoh fe iv 5 72 102 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 and k tba fe iv 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 indicating that above scavenging experiments could not identify the function of fe iv in both pds and h2o2 systems thus pmso was chosen to discriminate fe iv and radicals through different oxidation products i e pmso2 for fe iv hydroxylation products for oh and biphenyl products for so4 wang et al 2018 addition of cl slightly promoted the oxidation of pmso 6 fig 8 a but significantly decreased the production and yield of pmso2 in fe ii nh2oh pds system figs 8 b and 8 c indicating the drop of fe iv contribution with the addition of cl moreover the yield of pmso2 would decrease to below 0 5 when the concentration of cl increased to more than 0 05 mm fig 8 c which indicated that the major reactive species for pmso oxidation changed from fe iv to radicals in fe ii nh2oh pds system in a word addition of cl decreased the contribution of fe iv but increased the contribution of so4 and oh during pollutants oxidation process and the increased so4 would partly transform to oh by reacting with cl with nb as the probe figure s11 the value of ct oh increased 22 with concentrations of cl increasing from 0 to 1 mm during pmso oxidation process fig 8 d further verifying that cl tended to transform the composition of reactive species from fe iv to oh in fe ii nh2oh pds system to compare the interactions between cl and reactive species the oxidation of pmso and the production of pmso2 were also investigated in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system though the oxidation of pmso hardly changed with increasing concentrations of cl figure s12 no pmso2 was detected in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system namely no fe iv was produced in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system at ph 3 previous studies suggested that fe iv could be produced at near neutral ph in fe ii h2o2 system and oh was produced in acidic medium bataineh et al 2012 which was in accordance with our experimental results thereby only oh was produced in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system at ph 3 and the addition of cl would competitively consume oh to decrease the oxidation of target compounds through these investigations on interactions between cl and primary species the overall comparison of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems could be presented fig 9 the adverse effects of cl on ba oxidation were in accordance with changes of oh concentrations in both systems which was resulted from the differences in primary reactive species types both so4 and fe iv were primary reactive species in fe ii nh2oh pds system while oh was the only reactive species produced in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system interactions between cl and so4 fe iv could increase the production and contribution of oh to ba oxidation process while the reaction between cl and oh was also a competitive reaction for ba oxidation since ba reacted faster with oh than so4 and fe iv the increase of oh would promote ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds system and the decrease of oh would inhibit ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system respectively 4 conclusion in this study the effect of hydroxylamine salts types in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems were systematically compared the use of nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 hardly influenced the oxidation kinetic rules in both systems but higher effective availabilities of pds and nh2oh as well as larger oxidation efficiencies of ba were achieved with nh2oh hcl than nh2oh 2 h2so4 only in fe ii nh2oh pds system the reason was the differences of primary species and their interactions with cl from nh2oh hcl in fe ii nh2oh pds system addition of cl decreased the composition of so4 and fe iv but increased the contribution of oh to ba oxidation while cl only competed with ba for consuming oh in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system similar with ba a large number of pollutants has higher reaction rate constants with oh than with so4 and fe iv thus the change of oh production by cl was important for achieving a high removal efficiency of various pollutants since cl ubiquitously existed in water environment understanding the effect of cl on changing reactive species constitutions in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems could deepen the understanding of differences between the two systems which would provide a reference for system selection and reaction conditions decision in practical wastewater treatment processes declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the

16128,hydroxylamine nh2oh has been verified to efficiently strengthen pollutants oxidation in fe ii peroxydisulfate pds and fe ii h2o2 systems however the different effects of hydroxylamine salts types were rarely recognized herein the effects of two commonly used hydroxylamine salts i e nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 on oxidation kinetics and reactive species composition were compared in fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems for the first time pseudo first order kinetics could only describe benzoic acid ba oxidation well in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system which was related to the different concentration changes of fe iii determined by oxidant n h 3 o h 2 hydroxylamine salts types influenced not kinetic rules but reaction rates of target compounds the empirical reaction rate constant of ba in fe ii nh2oh hcl pds system was 141 5 of that in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system under the same concentration of nh2oh 1 4 mm while the apparent reaction rate constant in fe ii nh2oh hcl h2o2 system was 68 of that in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system this opposite effect resulted from the differences in primary reactive species compositions and their interactions with cl reactive species identification indicated that cl would decrease the contribution of ferryl ion fe iv and transform sulfate radical so4 to hydroxyl radical oh in fe ii nh2oh pds system while it competitively consumed the only reactive species oh in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system this study highlights the importance of reductants types on strengthening fenton oxidation and offers a reference for reasonable construction of the relevant systems ga image graphical abstract keywords hydroxylamine peroxydisulfate hydrogen peroxide reactive species chloride ions 1 introduction since been discovered in 1894 fenton advanced oxidation processes aops based on the reactions between fe ii and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have been extensively used in water and wastewater treatments for persistent organic pollutants degradation liu et al 2021 pignatello et al 2006 in recent years peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms have been found as another effective fenton oxidants with the advantage of storage and transportation as well as the wide reaction ph ranges bokare and choi 2014 wacławek et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 considering the similar symmetric structures of one peroxy bond pds and h2o2 were usually studied together in previous scientific research however less attentions were paid to the significant differences in reactive species composition and its related influence on pollutants oxidation between fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems in fe ii h2o2 system hydroxyl radical oh is produced and contributed to pollutants oxidation at acidic medium while fe iv would form when raising the value of ph to near neutral conditions bataineh et al 2012 differently fe iv so4 and oh simultaneously exist and contribute to pollutants oxidation in fe ii pds system at ph 3 0 6 5 dong et al 2020 besides the difference in types of reactive species the diverse reactivities among fe iv so4 and oh also influence the oxidation efficiency of the system compared with fe iv oh and so4 usually have higher reaction rate constants but lower steady state concentrations with organic pollutants buxton et al 1988 jacobsen et al 1998 neta et al 1988 zhang et al 2020 moreover oh is considered as a non selective oxidant reacting with organic pollutants through hydrogen abstraction or radical addition lee et al 2020 pignatello et al 2006 while so4 and fe iv show higher selectivity through the reaction of electron abstraction and oxygen transformation with organic pollutants respectively lee et al 2020 pestovsky and bakac 2006 thus same target compounds reacting with oh so4 and fe iv could produce diverse reaction intermediates and achieve different oxidation efficiency the difference in selectivity also makes oh more easily influenced by background constituents than so4 and fe iv moreover the reactivity of fe iv is more ph depended than so4 and oh due to the reaction of fe oh 2 2 h2o fe oh 3 h pestovsky and bakac 2006 those different reactivities among oh so4 and fe iv implied the critical role of reactive species types and compositions on organic pollutants oxidation process thus despite the similarities in oxidant structures distinguishing the differences in types and relative contents of reactive species is crucial to choosing the more suitable reactive system between fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 for pollutants oxidation however those comparison based on different reactive species of the two systems was rarely systematically conducted especially under various treatment conditions with coexisting water constitutions besides the basic fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems strengthened fenton like systems have been developed to further improve the system oxidation efficiency one effective strategy is to introduce reductants e g hydroxylamine ascorbic acid metal sulfide and carbon materials to improve fe ii restoration fukuchi et al 2014 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 hydroxylamine nh2oh has shown significant acceleration effects on the oxidation of various organic pollutants e g sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen and atrazine in both fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems chen et al 2011 han et al 2014 hou et al 2017 jin et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2017 yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 zou et al 2013 making it a representative reductant for accelerating fenton and fenton like systems similar with fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems differences of reactive species types and relative contents are also needed to be distinguished in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems considering that treatment conditions changed by nh2oh might alter the constitution of reactive species as aforementioned li et al 2021 moreover types of hydroxylamine salts e g nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 might also influence the acceleration effect and change the constitutions of reactive species due to the coexisting anions e g cl as commonly existing in water cl was usually found to compete with pollutants to consume reactive species e g so4 and oh in fenton like systems xu and li 2010 during this process chlorine species e g hclo cl2 cl and cl2 might be produced and further react with pollutants or form chlorine by products fang et al 2014 yang et al 2014 those findings indicated that the presence of cl could change the types and constitutions of reactive species in fenton like systems in fe ii nh2oh pms systems our previous study found that cl could improve the produce cl and oh to accelerate dimethyl phthalate dmp oxidation because the mono coordinated intermediate between fe ii and pms was more likely formed with the present of cl li et al 2021 both pds and pms are commonly used oxidants to produce so4 in fenton like systems but they share different structures and reaction pathways with fe ii pms has the asymmetric structure and pds has the symmetrical structure which cause different combination mode with cl and fe ii during activation process and result in the different decomposition pathway to produce reactive species however the effect of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds system on the constitutions of reactive species is ignored and rarely compared with fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems as the commonly used reductants to accelerate fenton like systems it is necessary to provide a systematical comparison including the effects of nh2oh salts types on reactive species constitutions between fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems this would help to select suitable reaction systems and hydroxylamine salts types between fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems for pollutants oxidation in this study effects of two typical hydroxylamine salts i e nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 on reactive species constitution were deeply investigated through the comparison of reaction kinetics and the effects of cl in fe ii h2o2 and fe ii pds systems benzoic acid ba nitrobenzene nb and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso were chosen as probes to identify the types and constitutions of reactive species detailed reasons for choosing the target compounds in text s1 the main contents of this study are 1 to build the kinetic models and reveal the reason for kinetic differences in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 and fe ii nh2oh pds systems 2 to compare the effects of hydroxylamine salts types on reactive species constitutions and explore the inner interactions between reactive species and cl in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 and fe ii nh2oh pds systems this study could be a reference for further research in other reductants accelerated fenton and fenton like systems 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals hydroxylamine hydrochloride nh2oh hcl benzoic acid ba dimethyl

hydroxylamine sulfate nh2oh 2 h2so4 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso and methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 were provided by j k scientific ltd ferrous sulfate sodium hydroxide hydrogen peroxide h2o2 35 v v tertbutyl alcohol tba and perchloric acid were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd nitrobenzene nb sodium chloride and acetone were obtained from tianjin guangfu technology development co ltd these chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification methanol meoh and acetonitrile both of hplc grade were supplied by tedia 2 2 experimental procedures batch scale experiments were conducted in 150 ml erlenmeyer flasks with a reaction solution of 100 ml reactions were initiated by adding stock solutions of oxidants pds or h2o2 into the reaction system containing a desired concentration of target compounds ba nb or pmso fe ii nh2oh hcl or nh2oh 2 h2so4 and nacl for alcohol scavenging experiments tba or meoh were added before the addition of stock solutions of oxidants initial values of ph were adjusted to 3 0 by hclo4 and naoh before the reaction started which was the optimal ph in both fe ii nh2oh h2o2 and fe ii nh2oh pds systems chen et al 2011 zou et al 2013 the ph values dropped by less than 0 5 units during the whole reaction process data not shown samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and immediately quenched by excess methanol before hplc analysis all reaction solutions were prepared with ultrapure water during the reaction a magnetic stirrer was used with a stirring rate of 600 r min and the temperature was kept at 25 0 5 c all experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate average values and one standard deviation are reported in this work 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of ba nb dmp pmso and pmso2 were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 with a reversed phase c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 µm waters and a photo diode array detector pda waters 2998 ba was detected at 227 nm nb and dmp were detected at 263 nm the mobile phases consisted of methanol and water 1 acetic acid mixed at a ratio of 45 55 v v for ba and dmp and 60 40 v v for nb at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 pmso and pmso2 were detected by acetonitrile and water 1 acetic acid mixed at a ratio of 20 80 v v with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 and the detection wavelengths were 230 nm for pmso and 215 nm for pmso2 respectively the concentration of nh2oh was detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc agilent at the wavelength of 210 nm samples were withdrawn and reacted with acetone to produce acetone oxime before detection the mobile phases were comprised of methanol and water 0 2 formic acid mixed at a ratio of 30 70 v v with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 due to the presence of hydroxylamine the concentration of fe iii was directly measured at 300 nm without quenching zou et al 2013 and methanol was used to substitute ba as the target compound to avoid the absorbance interference of ba at 300 nm the concentration of pds was measured with a modified fe2 dpd method at 551 nm and the concentration of h2o2 was measured by a hrp abts method at 415 nm lee et al 2014 the uv vis spectrometer for concentrations of fe iii pds and h2o2 detection was from hach dr 5000 the presence of nh2oh showed a slight influence on the detection methods of pds and h2o2 figure s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of hydroxylamine salts types on ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems to investigate the acceleration effects of different types of hydroxylamine salts oxidation of ba in fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems with nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 were studied respectively whatever types of hydroxylamine salt added ba showed a significant higher oxidation rate in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system than that in fe ii nh2oh pds system fig 1 a while the oxidation kinetic rules in the two systems were different with the addition of either nh2oh hcl or nh2oh 2 h2so4 the oxidation kinetics of ba had higher correlation coefficients with polynomial regression analysis than the pseudo first order kinetic models in fe ii pds system fig 1 b and table 1 which was proven in our previous study li et al 2020 differently the oxidation kinetics followed the pseudo first order kinetic model in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system fig 1 b and table 1 regardless of hydroxylamine salts types these kinetic differences between fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems was rarely found and discussed since oxidation kinetics could reflect the inner interaction of reactants and reactive species the reason for the kinetic difference between fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system was further explored to deeply elucidate system properties previous researches in fe ii nh2oh pds system indicated that fe ii and fe iii concentrations would influence the oxidation kinetics of target compounds by changing the activation rate of oxidants and the production rate of reactive species li et al 2020 thus changes of fe iii in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 and fe ii nh2oh pds systems were compared after the commonly fast accumulation in initial 30 s the concentration of fe iii reached a plateau to less than 3 µm in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system fig 1 d while it gradually increased from 3 µm to nearly 5 5 µm in fe ii nh2oh pds system regardless of hydroxylamine salts types fig 1 c studies once founded that the oxidation kinetics would change from the polynomial regression model to the pseudo first order reaction model when the concentration of fe iii gradually turned to be stable in fe ii nh2oh pds system li et al 2020 thus it could be deduced that the similar stable fe iii concentrations maintained the production rate of reactive species and contributed to the pseudo first order reaction kinetics of ba in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system the different changes of fe iii concentrations caused the kinetic differences in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems since fe iii was mainly produced from the activation of oxidants by fe ii and consumed by nh2oh as eqs 1 6 shown in both systems concentrations of nh2oh pds and h2o2 were detected to further explore the inner cause of different fe iii concentrations 1 nh3oh nh2oh h k1 bengtsson et al 2002 2 nh2oh fe3 fe nh2oh 3 β2 bengtsson et al 2002 3 fe nh2oh 3 nh2o h fe2 k 3 bengtsson et al 2002 4 2nh2o n2 2h2o k4 bengtsson et al 2002 5 fe ii s2o8 2 fe iii so4 2 so4 fe ii s2o8 2 h2o fe iv 2so4 2 2h k5 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 wang et al 2018 6 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh k6 pignatello et al 2006 the concentration of nh2oh used in experiments was 140 times of fe ii which indicated that fe iii was mainly reduced by nh2oh and the reaction between nh2o and fe iii could be ignored thus nh2o mainly went through dimerization reaction and n2 was considered as the only product to simplify analysis as eqs 1 4 showed li et al 2020 under this condition bengtsson once found the consumption rate of fe iii by nh2oh could be written as the form of eq 7 bengtsson et al 2002 7 d fe iii dt b fe iii 2 nh 3 oh 2 fe ii 2 h 4 where the coefficient b was 2k1 2 β2 2 k3 2 k4 k 3 2 which was equal to 2k1 2 β2 2 k3 2 k4 obtained from eqs 1 4 bengtsson et al 2002 as aforementioned the concentration of fe iii kept stable after the initial 30 s in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system indicating that the production and the consumption rate of fe iii should have the same values theoretically though reactive species i e fe iv so4 and oh produced by pds and h2o2 also consumed fe ii and fe iii the extremely low concentrations of these reactive species resulted in a minor contribution to the transformation of fe iii fe ii compared to reactants i e nh2oh pds and h2o2 thus only eqs 5 and 6 were considered as the route for fe iii production the production rate of fe iii could be written as eq 8 8 d fe iii dt d fe ii dt k fe ii oxi fe ii oxi where k f e i i o x i referred to k5 or k6 and oxi referred to pds or h2o2 as eqs 5 and 6 showed respectively when the production and the consumption rate of fe iii had the same values the relation of fe iii and fe ii concentrations vs oxidants and nh2oh concentrations could be obtained as eq 9 by combining eqs 7 and 8 9 fe iii 2 fe ii 3 k fe ii oxi h 4 oxi b nh 3 oh 2 since k fe ii oxi and b were constants and the value of ph changed slightly during the reaction process the concentrations of fe ii and fe iii were determined by the value of oxi n h 3 o h 2 based on changes of nh2oh pds and h2o2 concentrations during ba oxidation process figures s2 and s3 the values of oxi n h 3 o h 2 were calculated after the initial 30 s the value of pds n h 3 o h 2 gradually increased with the presence of both nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 while the value of h 2 o 2 nh 3 oh 2 was steady around 500 during the reaction process fig 2 thus the concentration of fe iii should keep increasing in fe ii nh2oh pds system but remain nearly unchanged in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems based on eq 9 which was in accordance with our experimental results the value of oxi n h 3 o h 2 determined the variation rules of fe iii concentrations eventually resulted in the kinetic difference of ba in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems since the initial concentrations of all reactants were same in the two systems these disparate consumption of pds and h2o2 were due to the different reaction rate constants of pds k f e i i p d s 26 m 1 s 1 brandt and eldik 1955 and h2o2 k f e i i h 2 o 2 78 m 1 s 1 de laat and le truong 2005 with fe ii though hydroxylamine salts types had no influence on the formation of kinetic rules fig 1 b oxidation efficiencies of ba were different with different types of hydroxylamine salts the oxidation efficiency of ba increased 24 6 with the addition of nh2oh hcl than nh2oh 2 h2so4 of the same nh2oh dosage in fe ii pds system while it slightly decreased 6 in fe ii h2o2 system under the same nh2oh addition condition fig 1 a the higher acceleration effects of nh2oh hcl than nh2oh 2 h2so4 were once found in fe ii pms system due to the additional acceleration of cl provided by nh2oh hcl li et al 2021 which was in accordance with our experimental results in fe ii pds system however the lower promotion of nh2oh hcl than nh2oh 2 h2so4 in fe ii h2o2 system indicated the existence of different pathways of cl from fe ii pds system which was ignored in previous research to provide a precise comparison of the function of hydroxylamine in fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems acceleration of different hydroxylamine salts and effects of cl were quantified with kinetic models built above and the inner mechanism was further explored 3 2 the effect of cl on ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems the effect of cl was comparatively studied by adding different concentrations of cl in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds and fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 systems during ba oxidation process cl promoted ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system fig 3 a but decreased it in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system fig 3 c with the increase of cl concentrations from 0 7 mm to 1 4 mm the oxidation efficiency of ba was at the ranges of 74 82 after 15 min in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system and was 84 90 after 5 min in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system which were nearly the same as that with nh2oh hcl in both systems 84 for pds and 88 for h2o2 as fig 1 a showed these further verified that cl caused the different acceleration effects between nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 in both fe ii pds and fe ii h2o2 systems oxidation kinetic expressions of ba were calculated in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems to provide a precise analysis of the acceleration effects of cl as aforementioned the oxidation of ba followed the polynomial regression kinetic rule in fe ii nh2oh pds system both with and without the presence of cl fig 3 b thus the oxidation kinetic expression of ba in fe ii nh2oh pds system could be expressed as eq 10 and the reaction rate of ba could be obtained from eq 10 as eq 11 detailed calculation process in text s2 10 ln ba ba 0 b 1 t 2 b 2 t b 3 11 r ba 0 2 b 1 t b 2 e b 1 t 2 b 2 t b 3 where b1 b2 and b3 are coefficients obtained from polynomial regression analysis calculation based on eq 10 the apparent reaction rate constant changed during ba oxidation process to obtain the definite promotion effect of cl empirical reaction kinetic expressions of ba were calculated in fe ii nh2oh pds system thus the oxidation rate of ba could also be written as eq 12 with the presence of cl 12 r d ba dt k pds α nh 2 oh β fe ii γ cl δ ba ε where k represented the empirical reaction rate constant and coefficients α to ε represented the order of reactions of each reactant respectively to obtain the values of k and exponents α to ε the method of initial rates was used since the initial rate r0 represented the reaction rate shortly before any significant changes took place it could be written in the form of ba 0 b 2 e b 3 or eq 13 eq 14 based on eq 11 and eq 12 respectively 13 r 0 k pds 0 α nh 2 oh 0 β fe ii 0 γ cl 0 δ ba 0 ε 14 lg r 0 lg k α lg pds 0 β lg nh 2 oh 0 γ lg fe ii 0 δ lg cl 0 ε lg ba 0 when the concentration of one reactant changed a series of r0 could be obtained from eq 11 through polynomial regression analysis figure s4 a to e and table s1 and the corresponding reaction order of that reactant could be obtained from the slope of plot lg r0 vs lg c0 based on eq 14 figure s5 a to e finally the value of the empirical reaction rate constant k could be obtained based on eq 13 with the reaction orders of all reactants calculated with the presence of cl the reaction orders of pds fe ii nh2oh ba and cl were calculated to be 0 69 0 77 0 27 0 49 and 0 15 respectively and the value of k was 211 55 m 1 36 s 1 fig 4 a thus the empirical reaction kinetic expression of ba in fe ii nh2oh pds system in the presence of cl could be expressed as follow 15 r 211 55 3 27 pds 0 69 0 013 n h 2 oh 0 27 0 011 fe ii 0 77 0 065 c l 0 15 0 018 ba 0 48 0 058 with the absence of cl the value of δ was 0 and reaction orders of other reactants could be calculated in the same way as mentioned above figure s6 s7 and table s2 the value of k was 4 977 m 1 07 s 1 fig 4 b and the empirical reaction kinetic expression of ba in fe ii nh2oh pds system without cl could be expressed as eq 16 16 r 4 977 0 045 pds 0 81 0 061 n h 2 oh 0 20 0 039 fe ii 0 57 0 022 ba 0 49 0 081 based on these two empirical reaction kinetic expressions the value of empirical reaction rate constant k increased 41 5 times with the addition of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds system the reaction order of pds decreased but the reaction order of fe ii increased with the addition of cl while the reaction orders of nh2oh and ba changed slightly indicating that cl mainly influenced the reaction between pds and fe ii to accelerate ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds system the oxidation kinetics of ba in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system with and without cl were calculated as well different from fe ii nh2oh pds system the oxidation kinetics of ba followed the pseudo first order reaction kinetic rule in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system fig 3 d thus the apparent reaction rate constants could be calculated with the concentration of cl increasing from 0 to 1 4 mm the value of apparent reaction rate constant decreased 32 fig 4 c and table s3 which further indicated that cl inhibited ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system the calculation of oxidation kinetics further proved the opposite effect of cl on ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems besides the increased oxidation efficiency of ba with the addition of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds system also indicated the improvement of effective availabilities of nh2oh and pds i e δ ba δ n h 2 oh and δ ba δ pds table s4 though the consumption of nh2oh pds and h2o2 slightly changed with the addition of cl in both systems figures s8 s9 reaction orders of pds and fe ii were changed in fe ii nh2oh pds systems which might influence the activation of pds by fe ii and the production of reactive species thus to clearly elucidate the possible mechanism for the opposite effects of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems the reactive species contributing to ba oxidation were needed to be identified 3 3 comparing the interaction between cl and reactive species in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems 3 3 1 the different interactions between cl and free radicals scavenging experiments were conducted to identify the major reactive species for ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems with and without the presence of cl meoh k s o 4 meoh 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 and tba k s o 4 tba 8 105 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 were chosen to distinguish the participation of so4 the oxidation efficiency of ba decreased 29 with the addition of tba while only less than 10 of ba was oxidized with the addition of meoh in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system fig 5 a indicating the contribution of so4 to ba oxidation process however with the addition of cl the oxidation of ba was almost completely inhibited by both meoh and tba in fe ii nh2oh hcl pds and fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds systems fig 5 b and 5 c indicating that so4 hardly contributed to ba oxidation under these experimental conditions when cl was added in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds system cl could be produced by reactions between so4 and cl eq 17 and oh was further produced from a serious reactions between cl and h2o with cloh as the intermediate eqs 18 20 besides cl2 could also be produced through the reaction between cl and cl eq 21 however since both meoh and tba could simultaneously capture cl k cl meoh 5 7 109 m 1 s 1 chateauneuf 1990 k cl tba 3 108 m 1 s 1 mertens and von sonntag 1995 and oh k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 k oh tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 these complete inhibition by meoh and tba in fig 5 b and 5 c could only exclude the contribution of cl2 fang et al 2014 but could not discriminate the contribution of oh and cl to ba oxidation processes thus nb was used to further identify the contribution of oh nb reacted fast with oh k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 than with so4 k s o 4 nb 106 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 and hardly reacted with cl and cl2 frøsig et al 2000 the oxidation efficiency of nb was significantly increased from 57 2 to 90 in both fe ii nh2oh hcl pds and fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 pds systems with the addition of cl figure s10 indicating that cl promoted the production and contribution of oh to pollutants oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds system 17 so4 cl cl so4 2 neta et al 1988 18 cl h2o cloh h kläning and wolff 1985 19 cl oh cloh kläning and wolff 1985 20 cloh cl oh jayson et al 1973 21 cl cl cl2 different from fe ii nh2oh pds system the oxidation of ba in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system was completely inhibited by both meoh and tba fig 5 d indicating that oh was the only reactive species contributing to ba oxidation the addition of cl hardly changed the complete scavenging effects of meoh and tba on ba oxidation figs 5 e 5 f which meant that reactive species contributing to ba oxidation was still oh moreover the oxidation of nb was slightly inhibited with the addition of cl figure s10 indicating that cl decreased the concentration of oh in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system based on above analysis the addition of cl showed adverse influence on both ba oxidation and oh production in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems which resulted from the interaction between cl and different primary reactive species i e so4 for pds and oh for h2o2 concentrations of oh so4 and cl were calculated to provide a definite description of the influence of cl on reactive species since the apparent reaction rate constant of ba changed in fe ii nh2oh pds system the exposure values i e the product of concentrations and reaction time ct were used to describe the concentration changes of all three reactive species during ba oxidation process trace concentrations of nb and dmp were added during ba oxidation because dmp could react with both oh so4 and cl since the role of cl2 was excluded by scavenging experiments above the exposure values of oh so4 and cl could be obtained based on reaction rates of nb dmp and ba respectively as eqs 22 24 detailed calculation in text s3 22 ct oh 1 k oh nb ln nb nb 0 23 ct so 4 k cl ba k oh dmp k cl dmp k oh ba ln nb nb 0 k oh nb k cl dmp ln ba ba 0 k oh nb k cl ba ln dmp dmp 0

dmp k cl ba k oh nb where k oh nb k oh ba k s o 4 ba k cl ba k oh dmp k s o 4 dmp and k c l d m p represented the reaction rate constants between nb ba and dmp with oh so4 and cl and the values were 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 ma rtire et al 2001 3 7 109 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 4 9 108 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 and 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2020 respectively with concentrations of cl increasing from 0 05 mm to 1 mm the values of ct oh and ct so 4 increased 58 5 and 150 respectively fig 6 a and 6 b however when the concentrations of cl further increased to 5 mm the values of ct oh and ct so 4 decreased to nearly the same as when 0 05 mm cl was added fig 6 a and 6 b the value of ct cl was kept less than 20 of ct so 4 and 40 of ct oh indicating that cl formed but hardly contributed to ba oxidation when cl was more than 1 mm fig 6 c calculations based on exposure values and reaction rate constants showed that the contribution of so4 to ba oxidation was 20 37 with the presence of cl thus though cl showed the highest promotion effect on so4 the larger reaction rate constants between ba and oh cl than so4 made oh and cl major reactive species during ba oxidation process these results further verified the importance of cl on promoting oh production during ba oxidation process different from fe ii nh2oh pds system the oxidation of ba followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system indicating that the steady state concentration of oh could be obtained from apparent reaction rate constants the concentration of oh decreased 32 when the concentration of cl increased to 1 4 mm fig 7 based on above scavenging experiments oh was the only reactive species contributing to ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh 2 h2so4 h2o2 system since cl would react with oh through eqs 20 and 21 the addition of cl could compete with ba to consume oh resulting in the decrease of oh production and ba oxidation 3 3 2 the interaction between cl and fe iv in fe ii nh2oh pds system different primary reactive species and their interaction with cl caused adverse effect on the production and contribution of oh to ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems especially reactions between so4 and cl playing a crucial role however these reactions only involved the increase of oh from so4 and cl but could not explain the increase of so4 in fe ii nh2oh pds system as fig 6 b showed actually the increasing production of so4 might provide additional oh production pathways e g so4 h2o oh so4 2 h to provide an overall function of cl in promoting oh production in fe ii nh2oh pds system other possible interactions of cl should be considered as well besides so4 and oh fe iv also existed in fe ii activated pds system wang et al 2018 cl was once found to decrease fe iv production but increase so4 and oh production in fe ii nh2oh pms system li et al 2021 indicating that the interaction between cl and fe iv could influence the production and contribution of so4 and oh as well to provide an overall comparison of the interaction between cl and reactive species the effect of cl on fe iv production in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems were explored different from so4 and oh ba nb meoh and tba all had low reaction rate constants with fe iv in acidic medium k ba fe iv 80 m 1 s 1 jacobsen et al 1998 k nb fe iv 1 05 103 m 1 s 1 martire et al 2002 k meoh fe iv 5 72 102 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 and k tba fe iv 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2004 indicating that above scavenging experiments could not identify the function of fe iv in both pds and h2o2 systems thus pmso was chosen to discriminate fe iv and radicals through different oxidation products i e pmso2 for fe iv hydroxylation products for oh and biphenyl products for so4 wang et al 2018 addition of cl slightly promoted the oxidation of pmso 6 fig 8 a but significantly decreased the production and yield of pmso2 in fe ii nh2oh pds system figs 8 b and 8 c indicating the drop of fe iv contribution with the addition of cl moreover the yield of pmso2 would decrease to below 0 5 when the concentration of cl increased to more than 0 05 mm fig 8 c which indicated that the major reactive species for pmso oxidation changed from fe iv to radicals in fe ii nh2oh pds system in a word addition of cl decreased the contribution of fe iv but increased the contribution of so4 and oh during pollutants oxidation process and the increased so4 would partly transform to oh by reacting with cl with nb as the probe figure s11 the value of ct oh increased 22 with concentrations of cl increasing from 0 to 1 mm during pmso oxidation process fig 8 d further verifying that cl tended to transform the composition of reactive species from fe iv to oh in fe ii nh2oh pds system to compare the interactions between cl and reactive species the oxidation of pmso and the production of pmso2 were also investigated in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system though the oxidation of pmso hardly changed with increasing concentrations of cl figure s12 no pmso2 was detected in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system namely no fe iv was produced in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system at ph 3 previous studies suggested that fe iv could be produced at near neutral ph in fe ii h2o2 system and oh was produced in acidic medium bataineh et al 2012 which was in accordance with our experimental results thereby only oh was produced in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system at ph 3 and the addition of cl would competitively consume oh to decrease the oxidation of target compounds through these investigations on interactions between cl and primary species the overall comparison of cl in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems could be presented fig 9 the adverse effects of cl on ba oxidation were in accordance with changes of oh concentrations in both systems which was resulted from the differences in primary reactive species types both so4 and fe iv were primary reactive species in fe ii nh2oh pds system while oh was the only reactive species produced in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system interactions between cl and so4 fe iv could increase the production and contribution of oh to ba oxidation process while the reaction between cl and oh was also a competitive reaction for ba oxidation since ba reacted faster with oh than so4 and fe iv the increase of oh would promote ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh pds system and the decrease of oh would inhibit ba oxidation in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system respectively 4 conclusion in this study the effect of hydroxylamine salts types in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems were systematically compared the use of nh2oh hcl and nh2oh 2 h2so4 hardly influenced the oxidation kinetic rules in both systems but higher effective availabilities of pds and nh2oh as well as larger oxidation efficiencies of ba were achieved with nh2oh hcl than nh2oh 2 h2so4 only in fe ii nh2oh pds system the reason was the differences of primary species and their interactions with cl from nh2oh hcl in fe ii nh2oh pds system addition of cl decreased the composition of so4 and fe iv but increased the contribution of oh to ba oxidation while cl only competed with ba for consuming oh in fe ii nh2oh h2o2 system similar with ba a large number of pollutants has higher reaction rate constants with oh than with so4 and fe iv thus the change of oh production by cl was important for achieving a high removal efficiency of various pollutants since cl ubiquitously existed in water environment understanding the effect of cl on changing reactive species constitutions in fe ii nh2oh pds and fe ii nh2oh h2o2 systems could deepen the understanding of differences between the two systems which would provide a reference for system selection and reaction conditions decision in practical wastewater treatment processes declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the

16129,there have been many studies on the effects of eutrophication on beta diversity β diversity of species assemblages however few studies have focused on the effects of nutrient reduction on β diversity and community structure and long time series analyses are particularly scarce we conducted a 19 year case study on the impacts of management intervention on the temporal β diversity of aquatic grazers in a lake at the yangtze river basin in our study we compared the changes in temporal β diversity as well as its two components nestedness and turnover and the synchrony of the rotifer community after management intervention our results showed that while the abundance of some sensitive species increased there was no trend in species richness moreover both the seasonality and interannual stabilities of rotifer assemblages increased the species synchrony decreased in both spring and summer after management intervention we also found that management intervention significantly reduced nutrient concentrations but not water clarity and phytoplankton abundance the total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp ratio was reduced after management intervention causing an increase in the abundance of cyanobacteria that may contribute to the increase of rotifer synchrony in autumn our results imply that stable environmental fluctuations after management intervention may increase temporal β diversity and stability of herbivorous assemblages however imbalanced changes in tn and tp after management intervention may weaken the top down control of zooplankton on phytoplankton and slow down water clarity improvement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords temporal diversity management intervention eutrophication rotifers and crustaceans synchrony cyanobacteria 1 introduction aquatic ecosystems are usually limited by nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus elser et al 2007 disturbances to nutrient regimes in aquatic ecosystems can alter the ecosystem from a clear to a turbid state by shifting the competitive advantage of primary producers this has cascading effects on the food web resulting in the degeneration of ecosystem stability and or function peñuelas et al 2012 taranu et al 2015 smith and schindler 2009 diversity variation contains information about the response of biotic organisms to ecological filters e g nutrients disturbance and is being used to assess the effects of environmental stresses on ecosystems frasconi wendt et al 2021 mccann 2000 perrings et al 2010 among diversity indices β diversity depicts community compositional dissimilarity across space or time mainly including nestedness species loss or gain and turnover species replacement components anderson et al 2011 baselga 2010 temporal beta diversity β diversity reflects temporal patterns in community composition for instance across seasonal or annual time series perera et al 2021 importantly temporal β diversity contributes more information about temporal changes in biodiversity than α diversity lindholm et al 2021 although the relationship between diversity and stability is debated mccann 2000 ives and carpenter 2007 irregular temporal fluctuations in larger numbers of species probably result in changes in community stability and even ecosystem functioning in varying environments loreau et al 2001 tilman et al 2006 for example decreasing top predators influence temporal variability in community composition at other trophic levels which may alter ecosystem functioning by top down extinction estes et al 1989 the turnover pattern in species assemblages is related to the structural adjustment of biotic communities structural adjustment is usually more sensitive to environmental stress than biodiversity and serves as an early warning signal of ecosystem changes guttal and jayaprakash 2008 li et al 2021 furthermore structural adjustment of community succession reflects resistance to perturbations and can be used to judge community stability connell and slatyer 1977 hence studying temporal β diversity can help improve understanding of community stability and reveal changes in ecosystems the effects of eutrophication on β diversity generally show a unimodal pattern with nutrient variation over a large spatial scale li et al 2021 bini et al 2014 rosset et al 2014 the effects of eutrophication on temporal β diversity are inconclusive eutrophication caused by pulsed nutrient supply creates temporal dissimilarity in environmental conditions showing positive effects on temporal β diversity of the metacommunity of primary producers and grazers antonucci di carvalho and wickham 2019 however eutrophication is thought to reduce temporal β diversity greatly especially for species with short and synchronous life cycles e g some benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages by altering the seasonal patterns of succession cook et al 2018 in contrast to eutrophication management intervention of restoration is a remedial measure for damaged ecosystems palmer 2009 benayas et al 2009 palmer et al 2010 chittoor viswanathan and schirmer 2015 although biotic diversity can increase after ecosystem restoration for example benthic invertebrates benayas et al 2009 bullock et al 2011 the recovery of biotic communities usually lags behind nutrient reduction fu et al 2021 the indices used to assess the recovery of biotic communities are based on variations in sensitive species species richness or other α diversity indices e g the shannon wiener index benayas et al 2009 fu et al 2021 however few studies have focused on the effects of nutrient reduction on temporal β diversity and long time series analyses are particularly rare reduction of algal biomass is essential for effective management intervention and the efficiency of the top down effects on phytoplankton is an important indicator for aquatic ecosystems that control water quality paerl and otten 2013 vanni et al 1997 one consequence of eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems is a massive increase in algae caused by strong bottom up effects resource limited food web rather than top down effects predator limited food web lynam et al 2017 mcqueen et al 1989 mcqueen et al 1986 zooplankton are grazers in aquatic ecosystems and have short and synchronous life cycles they respond quickly to environmental changes e g climate change algal blooms and predation and play an important role in top down functions ye et al 2013 hays et al 2005 temporal β diversity of zooplankton provides insights into community assembly rules and may help assess the efficiency of the top down effects on phytoplankton as such it can be used to assess the outcomes of management intervention hence we focused on studying long term changes in rotifer zooplankton diversity community structure and the top down function of lake ecosystems subject to management intervention we tested two hypotheses a the temporal β diversity of rotifers increases after nutrient reduction and b top down effects increase after management intervention to do this we used 19 years of limnological data from a lake in eastern china and calculated the temporal β diversity of the rotifer community to understand the possible processes behind the observed trends we decomposed β diversity into temporal nestedness or temporal turnover of species assemblages we also analyzed the synchrony of the rotifer community to gain insights into the structural adjustment 2 methods 2 1 study area lake wuli is located on the lower section of the yangtze river eastern china it was previously connected to lake taihu but they have been separated by a sluice gate since 1990 the lake has a surface area of 5 0 km2 and a mean and maximum depth of 2 0 and 3 5 m respectively the lower section of the yangtze river experienced large floods in 1998 and 2008 since the 1990s lake wuli has become highly eutrophic owing to ever increasing human activities between 1998 and 2007 many protective measures were implemented to reduce nutrients in lake wuli from 1998 to 1999 the government closed major point sources e g discharges from wastewater treatment plants around the lake from 2002 to 2005 the government closed hotels restaurants and sanatoriums around the lake and conducted sediment dredging of the most polluted area from 2006 to 2007 the

estimated temporal β diversity using the sørensen similarity index of the baselga method baselga 2010 lima et al 2019 we focused on temporal β diversity by quantifying differences in species composition of rotifers at different times to calculate the temporal β diversity during two time periods 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 multiple site measures were used that is the sørensen dissimilarity equivalent for more than two surveys baselga 2010 we calculated the turnover βsim and nestedness βnes using simpson based multiple site dissimilarity and nestedness resultant multiple site dissimilarity respectively to discriminate species replacement and species loss or gain we calculated the sørensen based multiple site dissimilarity to represent the total β diversity βsor which is the sum of βsim and βnes baselga 2010 seasonal variability in β diversity of was calculated by data for each season 36 surveys during 1999 2007 and 40 surveys during 2008 2017 interannual β diversity variability was calculated by averaging data for each year 9 surveys during 1999 2007 and 10 surveys during 2008 2017 we compared the rotifer zooplankton data between the time points of all seasons and annual averages to represent the seasonal and interannual variations respectively temporal variations in β diversity cannot be disentangled from variation in α diversity because the two diversity components are interconnected and statistically dependent on one another ricotta 2010 to test whether temporal changes in β diversity result from changes in community structure or are simply due to differences in local α diversity we used a null model hallett et al 2014 harms et al 2001 based on the raup crick metric chase et al 2011 in which we randomly selected species from a known total species pool for each time series we calculated the number of species that the two time series shared in common this generated a null expectation in which a difference in β diversity deviates from random expectation given the changes in α diversity we repeated this randomization 9999 times to create a null distribution and compared our observed similarity among two communities against this null distribution we standardized the metric to range from 1 to 1 and then re scaled it to express it as a dissimilarity a value of 0 no difference a value of 1 communities completely more dissimilar or a value of 1 communities completely less dissimilar than expected by random chance when community assembly is highly stochastic and with high dispersal the raup crick metric among time periods will be close to 0 when the deterministic environmental filter is strong the raup crick metric among time periods will be close to 1 which creates highly similar communities chase 2007 2010 2 3 2 species synchrony to illuminate interactions among rotifer assemblages during 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 we calculated species synchrony for each of the four seasons according to loreau and de mazancourt 2008 the measure of synchrony is standardized to range from 0 to 1 where 0 denotes perfect asynchrony and 1 denotes perfect synchrony 2 4 statistical analyses principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the main environmental factors redundancy analysis rda was used to analyze the relationships among the main environmental factors forward selection with p 0 05 and zooplankton indices density of rotifera cladocera and copepoda and species richness of rotifers annual mean values were used for pca and rda and all data were logarithmically transformed before analysis according to the pca clustering results environmental factors were different for 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 we compared changes in β diversity and synchrony for 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 only with data from site 1 according to the pca clustering results we tested the differences in environmental and biotic factors between 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 using the non parametric mann whitney u test a structural equation model was used for the quantitative determination of factors influencing rotifer density the main parameters were selected based on the multiple linear regression coefficients wherein tn tp and density of calanoida and cyclopoida copepods were used as explanatory variables we transformed all predictors into z scores before the analysis all statistical analysis was performed using the r software r core team 2014 3 results 3 1 changes in rotifer community structures the abundance of rotifers in 2008 2017 was significantly lower than that in 1999 2007 with average values of 593 and 1936 ind l respectively table 1 the abundances of polyarthra trigla brachionus angularis and brachionus calyciflorus significantly decreased after 2007 fig 1 a c d the abundances of asplanchna sp significantly decreased after 2005 fig 1b the abundance of trichocerca similis and pompholyx sulcata significantly increased after 2005 fig 1i j moreover the peak appearance time of the main rotifer species changed significantly after management intervention keratella cochlearis conochinus unicornis and trichocerca pusilla showed clear and similar changes after 2005 when their appearance time changed from random to stable for example k cochlearis showed peaks in february august and november before 2005 but only peaked in november after 2005 fig 1e c unicornis showed peaks in may august and november before 2005 but only showed a peak in may after 2005 fig 1g t pusilla showed peaks in may august and november before 2005 but only showed a peak in august after 2005 fig 1h rda axis 1 explained 14 66 of the total variance and axis 2 explained 9 23 of the total variance the rda showed that rotifer density was positively related to nh4 n but negatively related to copepoda density and cyanobacteria density fig 2 b the structural equation model showed significant bottom up effects on rotifers tp positively influenced chl a chl a positively influenced rotifers the structural equation model showed that both calanoida and cyclopoida had no significant effects on rotifers fig 3 3 2 changes in environmental and phytoplankton parameters the average values of site 1 and site 2 showed that water clarity did not change significantly between the periods 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 annually averaging 0 65 and 0 62 m respectively table 1 the annual average for tn was 8 69 mg l in 1999 2007 but just 1 71 mg l in 2008 2017 the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n showed similar trends averaging 3 97 and 1 93 mg l in 1999 2007 respectively and significantly decreasing to 0 41 and 0 27 mg l in 2008 2017 respectively total phosphorus annually averaged 0 212 mg l during 1999 2007 but only 0 126 mg l during 2008 2017 the concentration of po4 p showed no significant change between 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 table 1 the winter tp of site 1 averaged 0 165 mg l during 1999 2007 but just 0 054 mg l during 2008 2017 the summer tp of site 1 averaged 0 176 mg l during 1999 2007 and 0 152 mg l during 2008 2017 the concentration of chl a in lake wuli averaged 59 83 μg l during 1999 2007 and significantly decreased to 30 97 μg l during 2008 2017 table 1 however the abundance of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria significantly increased after 2007 the abundance of phytoplankton averaged 20 27 106 cells l and ranged from 2 56 106 to 83 18 106 cells l during 1999 2007 whereas during 2008 2017 it averaged 89 49 106 cells l and ranged from 8 63 106 to 183 77 106 cells l the abundance of cyanobacteria averaged 8 67 106 cells l and ranged from 0 60 106 to 48 78 106 cells l during 1999 2007 it averaged 84 76 106 cells l and ranged from 7 16 106 to 164 97 106 cells l during 2008 2017 table 1 pca axis 1 explained 68 02 of the total variance and axis 2 explained 14 25 of the total variance fig 2a pca showed that all samples clustered into two stages 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 in the stage during management intervention 1999 2007 the lake had high tn nh4 n no3 n tp and tn tp ratio and environmental variance over time during 2008 2017 the lake had high cyanobacteria density and low environmental variance over time sd was negatively related to cyanobacteria density which was negatively correlated with the tn tp ratio the abundances of both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria exponentially increased with decreasing tn tp ratio and both were highly abundant when the tn tp ratio was 16 fig 4 3 3 changes in species richness temporal β diversity and synchrony in rotifers nmds for rotifer communities among time series showed that the degree of dispersal of rotifer communities increased in 2008 2017 compared with 1999 2007 fig 5 a the mean raup crick values in 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 were 0 although those in 2008 2017 were higher i e closer to 0 than those in 1999 2007 fig 5b however species richness showed no significant change after 2008 table 1 fig 5c rotifer richness was positively related to cyanobacteria density but negatively related to cladocera and rotifer densities fig 2b the seasonal variability of β diversity suggests that the estimated overall β diversity increased after 2005 with average values of 0 68 in 1999 2007 and 0 75 in 2008 2017 the species turnover component increased after 2005 with average values of 0 51 in 1999 2007 and 0 62 in 2008 2017 the species nestedness component decreased after 2007 with average values of 0 16 in 1999 2007 and 0 14 in 2008 2017 fig 5d the interannual variability of β diversity suggests that the estimated overall β diversity decreased after 2007 with average values of 0 43 in 1999 2007 and 0 38 in 2008 2017 the species nestedness component decreased after 2005 with average values of 0 11 in 1999 2007 and 0 08 in 2008 2017 fig 5d mean synchrony showed no significant difference between 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 with the maximum value of 0 5 synchrony in 2008 2017 decreased in both spring and summer and increased in both autumn and winter compared with that in 1999 2007 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 imbalanced changes in tn and tp after management intervention the decreased tn tp ratio caused by the more rapid increase in tp compared with tn promotes cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes elser et al 2007 conley et al 2009 paerl et al 2011 moreover after management intervention the decrease in n was faster than that of p first exogenous pollution from sewage discharge contributs the majority of n pollution to the water column this can reach 70 in urban rivers under dry conditions shen et al 2021 shi et al 2019 the immediate effect of sewage and diffuse pollution reduction accounts for the decrease in n in lake wuli furthermore denitrification of the sediment and water column further reduced n in the lake by releasing it as n2 saunders and kalff 2001 white et al 2019 second although p in the water column decreased after sewage and diffuse pollution reduction and dredging the decrease was disproportionate compared with n p release from sediments can maintain high levels of p in the water column for long time periods wang et al 2006 increases in temperature and nutrients are thought to be key factors promoting cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes worldwide elser et al 2007 paerl and otten 2013 conley et al 2009 gan and bryant 2015 from 1999 to 2017 lake wuli had an annual average water temperature of 18 5 c and an average water temperature of 29 9 c in summer which is suitable for cyanobacterial growth however cyanobacteria blooms did not happen between 1999 and 2007 although the lake was fertile with average tn and tp concentrations of 8 69 and 0 212 mg l respectively during this period in summer phytoplankton is dominated by the euglena species in hypertrophic subtropical shallow lakes where tn and tp are extremely high e g tp 0 49 mg l tn 5 38 mg l lv et al 2011 this differs from other eutrophic subtropical shallow lakes in which cyanobacteria fully dominate and cyanobacterial blooms appear from april to october tp varied from 0 06 to 0 10 mg l tn varied from 1 90 to 2 80 mg l yang et al 2016 unexpectedly cyanobacteria blooms occurred in lake wuli after nutrient reduction cyanobacteria are considered to be better nitrogen competitors than other algae for example smith 1983 proposed the n p hypothesis from the data of 17 lakes where cyanobacteria tended to dominate if the tn tp ratio was 29 by weight as among phytoplankton only cyanobacteria are capable of n fixation management intervention significantly lowered the nutrient concentration but the imbalanced changes in tn and tp led to a reduction in the tn tp ratio resulting in an increase in cyanobacteria which may have negatively influenced the rotifer community structural equation model showed that predation had a limited effect on rotifers but that chl a positively influenced rotifer abundance however cyanobacteria negatively influenced the abundance of cladocera and rotifers our results showed that the synchrony of the rotifer community decreased in spring and summer but increased in autumn and winter fig 4 the decrease in rotifer asynchrony may relate to cyanobacteria blooms in later summer and autumn in the field small zooplankton such as small sized cladocerans moina and bosmina rotifers and protozoans often coexist with cyanobacterial blooms as they are less sensitive to mechanical damage from cyanobacteria and feed on bacteria associated with cyanobacteria sun et al 2012 however cyanobacteria could only benefit some highly tolerant species but not benefit biodiversity or community function cyanobacteria are known to have negative effects on herbivorous zooplankton especially daphnia either by clogging the feeding apparatus being of low nutritional value or producing toxins muller navarra et al 2004 sarnelle et al 2010 eutrophic lakes have weaker top down effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton than bottom up effects of nutrients on phytoplankton li et al 2020 cyanobacteria may have acted as environmental filters repeated regularly in the subsequent years after management intervention and this created stable conditions for the development of only a few species of zooplankton reducing dissimilarity in the community but increasing the stable temporal pattern of zooplankton 4 2 seasonality and interannual stability the seasonal variability in β diversity of rotifer assemblages significantly increased and the interannual variability in β diversity significantly decreased after management intervention species showed specific life history adaptations and occupied different niches according to the environmental conditions in different seasons mcnamara and houston 2008 chase and myers 2011 seasonal changes in environmental conditions may benefit species diversity in a single habitat by staggering niches over different seasons and preventing competitive exclusion this results in temporally variable community patterns grubb 1977 a study showed that the temporal β diversity of aquatic species assemblages within years seasonal variation was found to be greater than that between years interannual variation korhonen et al 2010 although rotifer abundance significantly declined the dominant species exhibited a relatively stable temporal pattern after 2007 for example the abundances of b calyciflorus t pusilla t similis and p sulcata peaked in summer and the abundances of k cochlearis and c unicornis peaked in autumn and spring respectively the seasonal succession of plankton communities is mediated by external factors and internal interactions tonkin et al 2017 sommer et al 1986 most environmental conditions especially temperature and precipitation occur with seasonal fluctuations in which temporal environmental variation may favor different communities by driving available resources and species behaviors mcmeans et al 2015 in oligotrophic lakes nutrient limitation plays an important role in the seasonal succession of plankton however its importance diminished in eutrophic lakes sommer et al 2012 both eutrophication and elevated winter temperatures may result in unpredictable seasonal succession models of zooplankton by reducing the sexual reproduction of small herbivores advancing recruitment from sediment and altering prey predator relationships of herbivores and copepods owing to improved food conditions and higher growth rates zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 in addition to the effects of the abiotic environment the food mass food quality and predation have important influences on the seasonal succession of zooplankton with limited effects on biomass but strong effects on species turnover sommer et al 2012 our results showed that the stable temporal pattern of zooplankton might be disturbed when nutrients and environmental variation are high but recover after management intervention and the establishment of a stable environmental pattern regarding temporal community dissimilarity the patterns are jointly driven by geographical factors ecological properties and several physical factors wherein lake ecosystems and small organisms have a high degree of temporal turnover korhonen et al 2010 high temporal stability of zooplankton over a long period means less species gain or loss and is related to stable temporal patterns of abiotic factors feike and heerkloss 2008 matveev and matveeva 2005 for example in one study a hypertrophic brackish water lagoon was dominated by a comparably low number of zooplankton species k cochlearis b calyciflorus filinia sp t pusilla and t similis that showed stable abundance peaks in summer over 22 years feike and heerkloss 2008 seasonality and interannual stability of plants consumers and food webs shape temporal diversity and may benefit ecosystem stability tonkin et al 2017 moreover our results showed that the mean raup crick increased and species synchrony decreased in spring and summer which meant increased stochastic expectations in community establishment that may benefit higher β diversity species asynchrony is positively related to local community stability wilcox et al 2017 spatial heterogeneity and temporal stability of communities and ecosystem function are suggested to maintain the stability of ecosystem services wilcox et al 2017 our study implies that management intervention may decelerate a deterioration of ecosystem services 4 3 species turnover of the zooplankton community the species turnover component increasingly contributed to temporal β diversity after management intervention based on a 19 year timescale fig 5d our results were in agreement with a previous study focusing on stream invertebrate communities which demonstrated that nestedness dominated under unpredictable seasonality but turnover maximally contributed to temporal β diversity when seasonal conditions were highly predictable tonkin et al 2017 a previous study showed that spatial variation in β diversity was mainly controlled by the replacement component while the temporal variation in β diversity was mainly controlled by the nestedness component under the impact of climate change lima et al 2019 however this conclusion may have been limited by the study timescales processes that impact temporal turnover can be classified into sampling ecological and evolutionary factors which are driven by timescales preston 1960 intermediate timescales or longer timescales are necessary for temporal turnover studies because the sampling effect is the main driver of temporal turnover patterns over short timescales ecological factors such as colonization or extinction caused by temporal environmental variation or evolutionary factors demand long term data when examining temporal turnover korhonen et al 2010 according to a meta analysis at intermediate timescales small organisms e g plankton have faster temporal turnover than fish or zoobenthos in aquatic ecosystems owing to passive and efficient dispersal and short life history korhonen et al 2010 nestedness is less likely to be prevalent for temporal β diversity owing to ecological filtering species dispersal limitation and resting egg banks in lakes where species gain or loss is difficult bonada and resh 2013 sydenham et al 2017 gomez and carvalho 2000 like spatial β diversity local scale species clustering will result in the predominance of species replacement in spatial community dissimilarity wang et al 2018 temporal β diversity is predominantly accounted for by turnover and is primarily associated with species clustering caused by temporal continuity sensitive species are replaced by tolerant species under eutrophication stress as sensitive species have comparatively narrow environmental thresholds zhang et al 2019 our results show that some sensitive species e g t similis and p sulcata recovered after management intervention we further found that species synchrony in the rotifer community decreased in spring and summer smaller values of this synchrony correspond to greater temporal niche differentiation which means less interspecific competition and weaker species environmental responses loreau and de mazancourt 2008 our results imply that species recruitment in spring and summer was asynchronous which may reduce the synchrony effects of environmental filtering on species assemblages and promote the recovery of specialists specialists adapted to temporal environmental fluctuations with limited resources and occupied particular temporal niches beche et al 2006 when resource limitation decreased eutrophication shifted the community composition by promoting generalists with faster growth rates and lower seasonal turnover than specialists resulting in the reduction of temporal β diversity cook et al 2018 in contrast unpredictable resource pulses decreased after management intervention promoting the recovery of specialists 5 conclusions our results showed that the species richness of rotifers did not increase after management intervention the mean raup crick was close to zero which meant that the rotifer community structure was randomly regulated in 10 years after management intervention increased mean raup crick and decreased synchrony of the rotifer community in spring and summer after management intervention implies that the rotifer community developed in a way that promoted higher β diversity and stability nonetheless a reduction in nutrient inputs may not guarantee the expected positive outcomes in this case the different n and p dynamics in the lake lead to a decrease in the tn tp ratio which benefited cyanobacteria the shifts in the phytoplankton community caused changes in the temporal β diversity of rotifers i e smaller interannual variation but larger seasonality our results offer a reference for the managers of natural aquatic ecosystems and show that bottom up control may have been the dominant process in lake wuli after 10 years of management intervention declaration of

16129,there have been many studies on the effects of eutrophication on beta diversity β diversity of species assemblages however few studies have focused on the effects of nutrient reduction on β diversity and community structure and long time series analyses are particularly scarce we conducted a 19 year case study on the impacts of management intervention on the temporal β diversity of aquatic grazers in a lake at the yangtze river basin in our study we compared the changes in temporal β diversity as well as its two components nestedness and turnover and the synchrony of the rotifer community after management intervention our results showed that while the abundance of some sensitive species increased there was no trend in species richness moreover both the seasonality and interannual stabilities of rotifer assemblages increased the species synchrony decreased in both spring and summer after management intervention we also found that management intervention significantly reduced nutrient concentrations but not water clarity and phytoplankton abundance the total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp ratio was reduced after management intervention causing an increase in the abundance of cyanobacteria that may contribute to the increase of rotifer synchrony in autumn our results imply that stable environmental fluctuations after management intervention may increase temporal β diversity and stability of herbivorous assemblages however imbalanced changes in tn and tp after management intervention may weaken the top down control of zooplankton on phytoplankton and slow down water clarity improvement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords temporal diversity management intervention eutrophication rotifers and crustaceans synchrony cyanobacteria 1 introduction aquatic ecosystems are usually limited by nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus elser et al 2007 disturbances to nutrient regimes in aquatic ecosystems can alter the ecosystem from a clear to a turbid state by shifting the competitive advantage of primary producers this has cascading effects on the food web resulting in the degeneration of ecosystem stability and or function peñuelas et al 2012 taranu et al 2015 smith and schindler 2009 diversity variation contains information about the response of biotic organisms to ecological filters e g nutrients disturbance and is being used to assess the effects of environmental stresses on ecosystems frasconi wendt et al 2021 mccann 2000 perrings et al 2010 among diversity indices β diversity depicts community compositional dissimilarity across space or time mainly including nestedness species loss or gain and turnover species replacement components anderson et al 2011 baselga 2010 temporal beta diversity β diversity reflects temporal patterns in community composition for instance across seasonal or annual time series perera et al 2021 importantly temporal β diversity contributes more information about temporal changes in biodiversity than α diversity lindholm et al 2021 although the relationship between diversity and stability is debated mccann 2000 ives and carpenter 2007 irregular temporal fluctuations in larger numbers of species probably result in changes in community stability and even ecosystem functioning in varying environments loreau et al 2001 tilman et al 2006 for example decreasing top predators influence temporal variability in community composition at other trophic levels which may alter ecosystem functioning by top down extinction estes et al 1989 the turnover pattern in species assemblages is related to the structural adjustment of biotic communities structural adjustment is usually more sensitive to environmental stress than biodiversity and serves as an early warning signal of ecosystem changes guttal and jayaprakash 2008 li et al 2021 furthermore structural adjustment of community succession reflects resistance to perturbations and can be used to judge community stability connell and slatyer 1977 hence studying temporal β diversity can help improve understanding of community stability and reveal changes in ecosystems the effects of eutrophication on β diversity generally show a unimodal pattern with nutrient variation over a large spatial scale li et al 2021 bini et al 2014 rosset et al 2014 the effects of eutrophication on temporal β diversity are inconclusive eutrophication caused by pulsed nutrient supply creates temporal dissimilarity in environmental conditions showing positive effects on temporal β diversity of the metacommunity of primary producers and grazers antonucci di carvalho and wickham 2019 however eutrophication is thought to reduce temporal β diversity greatly especially for species with short and synchronous life cycles e g some benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages by altering the seasonal patterns of succession cook et al 2018 in contrast to eutrophication management intervention of restoration is a remedial measure for damaged ecosystems palmer 2009 benayas et al 2009 palmer et al 2010 chittoor viswanathan and schirmer 2015 although biotic diversity can increase after ecosystem restoration for example benthic invertebrates benayas et al 2009 bullock et al 2011 the recovery of biotic communities usually lags behind nutrient reduction fu et al 2021 the indices used to assess the recovery of biotic communities are based on variations in sensitive species species richness or other α diversity indices e g the shannon wiener index benayas et al 2009 fu et al 2021 however few studies have focused on the effects of nutrient reduction on temporal β diversity and long time series analyses are particularly rare reduction of algal biomass is essential for effective management intervention and the efficiency of the top down effects on phytoplankton is an important indicator for aquatic ecosystems that control water quality paerl and otten 2013 vanni et al 1997 one consequence of eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems is a massive increase in algae caused by strong bottom up effects resource limited food web rather than top down effects predator limited food web lynam et al 2017 mcqueen et al 1989 mcqueen et al 1986 zooplankton are grazers in aquatic ecosystems and have short and synchronous life cycles they respond quickly to environmental changes e g climate change algal blooms and predation and play an important role in top down functions ye et al 2013 hays et al 2005 temporal β diversity of zooplankton provides insights into community assembly rules and may help assess the efficiency of the top down effects on phytoplankton as such it can be used to assess the outcomes of management intervention hence we focused on studying long term changes in rotifer zooplankton diversity community structure and the top down function of lake ecosystems subject to management intervention we tested two hypotheses a the temporal β diversity of rotifers increases after nutrient reduction and b top down effects increase after management intervention to do this we used 19 years of limnological data from a lake in eastern china and calculated the temporal β diversity of the rotifer community to understand the possible processes behind the observed trends we decomposed β diversity into temporal nestedness or temporal turnover of species assemblages we also analyzed the synchrony of the rotifer community to gain insights into the structural adjustment 2 methods 2 1 study area lake wuli is located on the lower section of the yangtze river eastern china it was previously connected to lake taihu but they have been separated by a sluice gate since 1990 the lake has a surface area of 5 0 km2 and a mean and maximum depth of 2 0 and 3 5 m respectively the lower section of the yangtze river experienced large floods in 1998 and 2008 since the 1990s lake wuli has become highly eutrophic owing to ever increasing human activities between 1998 and 2007 many protective measures were implemented to reduce nutrients in lake wuli from 1998 to 1999 the government closed major point sources e g discharges from wastewater treatment plants around the lake from 2002 to 2005 the government closed hotels restaurants and sanatoriums around the lake and conducted sediment dredging of the most polluted area from 2006 to 2007 the government reduced external nutrient loading from diffuse pollutants e g livestock and poultry farm runoff inflow rivers forbade enclosure aquaculture around the lake and attempted unsuccessfully to reconstruct submerged macrophyte chen et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 we conducted long term monitoring at two sampling stations in lake wuli to test the changes in biotic communities after the reduction in

methods lorenzen 1967 we added 2 acetic lugol s solution to 1 l of depth mixture water samples which were sedimented and concentrated to 30 ml for further analyses of phytoplankton and rotifers the 7

rotifers cladocera and copepoda were counted and measured using an optical microscope olympus tokyo japan most species of zooplankton were identified to the species level according to wang 1961 koste and voigt 1978 shen et al 1979 and chiang and du 1979 phytoplankton identification was performed according to hu 2006 furthermore we counted measured and analyzed the biotic samples using the same method to ensure the accuracy and consistency of species identification of the long term data 2 3 main parameters 2 3 1 temporal β diversity we applied non metric multidimensional scaling nmds with bray curtis distance using abundance data to analyze the β diversity over time every survey event for rotifer communities firstly secondly to analyze turnover and nestedness of the β diversity we estimated temporal β diversity using the sørensen similarity index of the baselga method baselga 2010 lima et al 2019 we focused on temporal β diversity by quantifying differences in species composition of rotifers at different times to calculate the temporal β diversity during two time periods 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 multiple site measures were used that is the sørensen dissimilarity equivalent for more than two surveys baselga 2010 we calculated the turnover βsim and nestedness βnes using simpson based multiple site dissimilarity and nestedness resultant multiple site dissimilarity respectively to discriminate species replacement and species loss or gain we calculated the sørensen based multiple site dissimilarity to represent the total β diversity βsor which is the sum of βsim and βnes baselga 2010 seasonal variability in β diversity of was calculated by data for each season 36 surveys during 1999 2007 and 40 surveys during 2008 2017 interannual β diversity variability was calculated by averaging data for each year 9 surveys during 1999 2007 and 10 surveys during 2008 2017 we compared the rotifer zooplankton data between the time points of all seasons and annual averages to represent the seasonal and interannual variations respectively temporal variations in β diversity cannot be disentangled from variation in α diversity because the two diversity components are interconnected and statistically dependent on one another ricotta 2010 to test whether temporal changes in β diversity result from changes in community structure or are simply due to differences in local α diversity we used a null model hallett et al 2014 harms et al 2001 based on the raup crick metric chase et al 2011 in which we randomly selected species from a known total species pool for each time series we calculated the number of species that the two time series shared in common this generated a null expectation in which a difference in β diversity deviates from random expectation given the changes in α diversity we repeated this randomization 9999 times to create a null distribution and compared our observed similarity among two communities against this null distribution we standardized the metric to range from 1 to 1 and then re scaled it to express it as a dissimilarity a value of 0 no difference a value of 1 communities completely more dissimilar or a value of 1 communities completely less dissimilar than expected by random chance when community assembly is highly stochastic and with high dispersal the raup crick metric among time periods will be close to 0 when the deterministic environmental filter is strong the raup crick metric among time periods will be close to 1 which creates highly similar communities chase 2007 2010 2 3 2 species synchrony to illuminate interactions among rotifer assemblages during 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 we calculated species synchrony for each of the four seasons according to loreau and de mazancourt 2008 the measure of synchrony is standardized to range from 0 to 1 where 0 denotes perfect asynchrony and 1 denotes perfect synchrony 2 4 statistical analyses principal component analysis pca was used to analyze the main environmental factors redundancy analysis rda was used to analyze the relationships among the main environmental factors forward selection with p 0 05 and zooplankton indices density of rotifera cladocera and copepoda and species richness of rotifers annual mean values were used for pca and rda and all data were logarithmically transformed before analysis according to the pca clustering results environmental factors were different for 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 we compared changes in β diversity and synchrony for 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 only with data from site 1 according to the pca clustering results we tested the differences in environmental and biotic factors between 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 using the non parametric mann whitney u test a structural equation model was used for the quantitative determination of factors influencing rotifer density the main parameters were selected based on the multiple linear regression coefficients wherein tn tp and density of calanoida and cyclopoida copepods were used as explanatory variables we transformed all predictors into z scores before the analysis all statistical analysis was performed using the r software r core team 2014 3 results 3 1 changes in rotifer community structures the abundance of rotifers in 2008 2017 was significantly lower than that in 1999 2007 with average values of 593 and 1936 ind l respectively table 1 the abundances of polyarthra trigla brachionus angularis and brachionus calyciflorus significantly decreased after 2007 fig 1 a c d the abundances of asplanchna sp significantly decreased after 2005 fig 1b the abundance of trichocerca similis and pompholyx sulcata significantly increased after 2005 fig 1i j moreover the peak appearance time of the main rotifer species changed significantly after management intervention keratella cochlearis conochinus unicornis and trichocerca pusilla showed clear and similar changes after 2005 when their appearance time changed from random to stable for example k cochlearis showed peaks in february august and november before 2005 but only peaked in november after 2005 fig 1e c unicornis showed peaks in may august and november before 2005 but only showed a peak in may after 2005 fig 1g t pusilla showed peaks in may august and november before 2005 but only showed a peak in august after 2005 fig 1h rda axis 1 explained 14 66 of the total variance and axis 2 explained 9 23 of the total variance the rda showed that rotifer density was positively related to nh4 n but negatively related to copepoda density and cyanobacteria density fig 2 b the structural equation model showed significant bottom up effects on rotifers tp positively influenced chl a chl a positively influenced rotifers the structural equation model showed that both calanoida and cyclopoida had no significant effects on rotifers fig 3 3 2 changes in environmental and phytoplankton parameters the average values of site 1 and site 2 showed that water clarity did not change significantly between the periods 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 annually averaging 0 65 and 0 62 m respectively table 1 the annual average for tn was 8 69 mg l in 1999 2007 but just 1 71 mg l in 2008 2017 the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n showed similar trends averaging 3 97 and 1 93 mg l in 1999 2007 respectively and significantly decreasing to 0 41 and 0 27 mg l in 2008 2017 respectively total phosphorus annually averaged 0 212 mg l during 1999 2007 but only 0 126 mg l during 2008 2017 the concentration of po4 p showed no significant change between 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 table 1 the winter tp of site 1 averaged 0 165 mg l during 1999 2007 but just 0 054 mg l during 2008 2017 the summer tp of site 1 averaged 0 176 mg l during 1999 2007 and 0 152 mg l during 2008 2017 the concentration of chl a in lake wuli averaged 59 83 μg l during 1999 2007 and significantly decreased to 30 97 μg l during 2008 2017 table 1 however the abundance of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria significantly increased after 2007 the abundance of phytoplankton averaged 20 27 106 cells l and ranged from 2 56 106 to 83 18 106 cells l during 1999 2007 whereas during 2008 2017 it averaged 89 49 106 cells l and ranged from 8 63 106 to 183 77 106 cells l the abundance of cyanobacteria averaged 8 67 106 cells l and ranged from 0 60 106 to 48 78 106 cells l during 1999 2007 it averaged 84 76 106 cells l and ranged from 7 16 106 to 164 97 106 cells l during 2008 2017 table 1 pca axis 1 explained 68 02 of the total variance and axis 2 explained 14 25 of the total variance fig 2a pca showed that all samples clustered into two stages 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 in the stage during management intervention 1999 2007 the lake had high tn nh4 n no3 n tp and tn tp ratio and environmental variance over time during 2008 2017 the lake had high cyanobacteria density and low environmental variance over time sd was negatively related to cyanobacteria density which was negatively correlated with the tn tp ratio the abundances of both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria exponentially increased with decreasing tn tp ratio and both were highly abundant when the tn tp ratio was 16 fig 4 3 3 changes in species richness temporal β diversity and synchrony in rotifers nmds for rotifer communities among time series showed that the degree of dispersal of rotifer communities increased in 2008 2017 compared with 1999 2007 fig 5 a the mean raup crick values in 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 were 0 although those in 2008 2017 were higher i e closer to 0 than those in 1999 2007 fig 5b however species richness showed no significant change after 2008 table 1 fig 5c rotifer richness was positively related to cyanobacteria density but negatively related to cladocera and rotifer densities fig 2b the seasonal variability of β diversity suggests that the estimated overall β diversity increased after 2005 with average values of 0 68 in 1999 2007 and 0 75 in 2008 2017 the species turnover component increased after 2005 with average values of 0 51 in 1999 2007 and 0 62 in 2008 2017 the species nestedness component decreased after 2007 with average values of 0 16 in 1999 2007 and 0 14 in 2008 2017 fig 5d the interannual variability of β diversity suggests that the estimated overall β diversity decreased after 2007 with average values of 0 43 in 1999 2007 and 0 38 in 2008 2017 the species nestedness component decreased after 2005 with average values of 0 11 in 1999 2007 and 0 08 in 2008 2017 fig 5d mean synchrony showed no significant difference between 1999 2007 and 2008 2017 with the maximum value of 0 5 synchrony in 2008 2017 decreased in both spring and summer and increased in both autumn and winter compared with that in 1999 2007 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 imbalanced changes in tn and tp after management intervention the decreased tn tp ratio caused by the more rapid increase in tp compared with tn promotes cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes elser et al 2007 conley et al 2009 paerl et al 2011 moreover after management intervention the decrease in n was faster than that of p first exogenous pollution from sewage discharge contributs the majority of n pollution to the water column this can reach 70 in urban rivers under dry conditions shen et al 2021 shi et al 2019 the immediate effect of sewage and diffuse pollution reduction accounts for the decrease in n in lake wuli furthermore denitrification of the sediment and water column further reduced n in the lake by releasing it as n2 saunders and kalff 2001 white et al 2019 second although p in the water column decreased after sewage and diffuse pollution reduction and dredging the decrease was disproportionate compared with n p release from sediments can maintain high levels of p in the water column for long time periods wang et al 2006 increases in temperature and nutrients are thought to be key factors promoting cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes worldwide elser et al 2007 paerl and otten 2013 conley et al 2009 gan and bryant 2015 from 1999 to 2017 lake wuli had an annual average water temperature of 18 5 c and an average water temperature of 29 9 c in summer which is suitable for cyanobacterial growth however cyanobacteria blooms did not happen between 1999 and 2007 although the lake was fertile with average tn and tp concentrations of 8 69 and 0 212 mg l respectively during this period in summer phytoplankton is dominated by the euglena species in hypertrophic subtropical shallow lakes where tn and tp are extremely high e g tp 0 49 mg l tn 5 38 mg l lv et al 2011 this differs from other eutrophic subtropical shallow lakes in which cyanobacteria fully dominate and cyanobacterial blooms appear from april to october tp varied from 0 06 to 0 10 mg l tn varied from 1 90 to 2 80 mg l yang et al 2016 unexpectedly cyanobacteria blooms occurred in lake wuli after nutrient reduction cyanobacteria are considered to be better nitrogen competitors than other algae for example smith 1983 proposed the n p hypothesis from the data of 17 lakes where cyanobacteria tended to dominate if the tn tp ratio was 29 by weight as among phytoplankton only cyanobacteria are capable of n fixation management intervention significantly lowered the nutrient concentration but the imbalanced changes in tn and tp led to a reduction in the tn tp ratio resulting in an increase in cyanobacteria which may have negatively influenced the rotifer community structural equation model showed that predation had a limited effect on rotifers but that chl a positively influenced rotifer abundance however cyanobacteria negatively influenced the abundance of cladocera and rotifers our results showed that the synchrony of the rotifer community decreased in spring and summer but increased in autumn and winter fig 4 the decrease in rotifer asynchrony may relate to cyanobacteria blooms in later summer and autumn in the field small zooplankton such as small sized cladocerans moina and bosmina rotifers and protozoans often coexist with cyanobacterial blooms as they are less sensitive to mechanical damage from cyanobacteria and feed on bacteria associated with cyanobacteria sun et al 2012 however cyanobacteria could only benefit some highly tolerant species but not benefit biodiversity or community function cyanobacteria are known to have negative effects on herbivorous zooplankton especially daphnia either by clogging the feeding apparatus being of low nutritional value or producing toxins muller navarra et al 2004 sarnelle et al 2010 eutrophic lakes have weaker top down effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton than bottom up effects of nutrients on phytoplankton li et al 2020 cyanobacteria may have acted as environmental filters repeated regularly in the subsequent years after management intervention and this created stable conditions for the development of only a few species of zooplankton reducing dissimilarity in the community but increasing the stable temporal pattern of zooplankton 4 2 seasonality and interannual stability the seasonal variability in β diversity of rotifer assemblages significantly increased and the interannual variability in β diversity significantly decreased after management intervention species showed specific life history adaptations and occupied different niches according to the environmental conditions in different seasons mcnamara and houston 2008 chase and myers 2011 seasonal changes in environmental conditions may benefit species diversity in a single habitat by staggering niches over different seasons and preventing competitive exclusion this results in temporally variable community patterns grubb 1977 a study showed that the temporal β diversity of aquatic species assemblages within years seasonal variation was found to be greater than that between years interannual variation korhonen et al 2010 although rotifer abundance significantly declined the dominant species exhibited a relatively stable temporal pattern after 2007 for example the abundances of b calyciflorus t pusilla t similis and p sulcata peaked in summer and the abundances of k cochlearis and c unicornis peaked in autumn and spring respectively the seasonal succession of plankton communities is mediated by external factors and internal interactions tonkin et al 2017 sommer et al 1986 most environmental conditions especially temperature and precipitation occur with seasonal fluctuations in which temporal environmental variation may favor different communities by driving available resources and species behaviors mcmeans et al 2015 in oligotrophic lakes nutrient limitation plays an important role in the seasonal succession of plankton however its importance diminished in eutrophic lakes sommer et al 2012 both eutrophication and elevated winter temperatures may result in unpredictable seasonal succession models of zooplankton by reducing the sexual reproduction of small herbivores advancing recruitment from sediment and altering prey predator relationships of herbivores and copepods owing to improved food conditions and higher growth rates zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 in addition to the effects of the abiotic environment the food mass food quality and predation have important influences on the seasonal succession of zooplankton with limited effects on biomass but strong effects on species turnover sommer et al 2012 our results showed that the stable temporal pattern of zooplankton might be disturbed when nutrients and environmental variation are high but recover after management intervention and the establishment of a stable environmental pattern regarding temporal community dissimilarity the patterns are jointly driven by geographical factors ecological properties and several physical factors wherein lake ecosystems and small organisms have a high degree of temporal turnover korhonen et al 2010 high temporal stability of zooplankton over a long period means less species gain or loss and is related to stable temporal patterns of abiotic factors feike and heerkloss 2008 matveev and matveeva 2005 for example in one study a hypertrophic brackish water lagoon was dominated by a comparably low number of zooplankton species k cochlearis b calyciflorus filinia sp t pusilla and t similis that showed stable abundance peaks in summer over 22 years feike and heerkloss 2008 seasonality and interannual stability of plants consumers and food webs shape temporal diversity and may benefit ecosystem stability tonkin et al 2017 moreover our results showed that the mean raup crick increased and species synchrony decreased in spring and summer which meant increased stochastic expectations in community establishment that may benefit higher β diversity species asynchrony is positively related to local community stability wilcox et al 2017 spatial heterogeneity and temporal stability of communities and ecosystem function are suggested to maintain the stability of ecosystem services wilcox et al 2017 our study implies that management intervention may decelerate a deterioration of ecosystem services 4 3 species turnover of the zooplankton community the species turnover component increasingly contributed to temporal β diversity after management intervention based on a 19 year timescale fig 5d our results were in agreement with a previous study focusing on stream invertebrate communities which demonstrated that nestedness dominated under unpredictable seasonality but turnover maximally contributed to temporal β diversity when seasonal conditions were highly predictable tonkin et al 2017 a previous study showed that spatial variation in β diversity was mainly controlled by the replacement component while the temporal variation in β diversity was mainly controlled by the nestedness component under the impact of climate change lima et al 2019 however this conclusion may have been limited by the study timescales processes that impact temporal turnover can be classified into sampling ecological and evolutionary factors which are driven by timescales preston 1960 intermediate timescales or longer timescales are necessary for temporal turnover studies because the sampling effect is the main driver of temporal turnover patterns over short timescales ecological factors such as colonization or extinction caused by temporal environmental variation or evolutionary factors demand long term data when examining temporal turnover korhonen et al 2010 according to a meta analysis at intermediate timescales small organisms e g plankton have faster temporal turnover than fish or zoobenthos in aquatic ecosystems owing to passive and efficient dispersal and short life history korhonen et al 2010 nestedness is less likely to be prevalent for temporal β diversity owing to ecological filtering species dispersal limitation and resting egg banks in lakes where species gain or loss is difficult bonada and resh 2013 sydenham et al 2017 gomez and carvalho 2000 like spatial β diversity local scale species clustering will result in the predominance of species replacement in spatial community dissimilarity wang et al 2018 temporal β diversity is predominantly accounted for by turnover and is primarily associated with species clustering caused by temporal continuity sensitive species are replaced by tolerant species under eutrophication stress as sensitive species have comparatively narrow environmental thresholds zhang et al 2019 our results show that some sensitive species e g t similis and p sulcata recovered after management intervention we further found that species synchrony in the rotifer community decreased in spring and summer smaller values of this synchrony correspond to greater temporal niche differentiation which means less interspecific competition and weaker species environmental responses loreau and de mazancourt 2008 our results imply that species recruitment in spring and summer was asynchronous which may reduce the synchrony effects of environmental filtering on species assemblages and promote the recovery of specialists specialists adapted to temporal environmental fluctuations with limited resources and occupied particular temporal niches beche et al 2006 when resource limitation decreased eutrophication shifted the community composition by promoting generalists with faster growth rates and lower seasonal turnover than specialists resulting in the reduction of temporal β diversity cook et al 2018 in contrast unpredictable resource pulses decreased after management intervention promoting the recovery of specialists 5 conclusions our results showed that the species richness of rotifers did not increase after management intervention the mean raup crick was close to zero which meant that the rotifer community structure was randomly regulated in 10 years after management intervention increased mean raup crick and decreased synchrony of the rotifer community in spring and summer after management intervention implies that the rotifer community developed in a way that promoted higher β diversity and stability nonetheless a reduction in nutrient inputs may not guarantee the expected positive outcomes in this case the different n and p dynamics in the lake lead to a decrease in the tn tp ratio which benefited cyanobacteria the shifts in the phytoplankton community caused changes in the temporal β diversity of rotifers i e smaller interannual variation but larger seasonality our results offer a reference for the managers of natural aquatic ecosystems and show that bottom up control may have been the dominant process in lake wuli after 10 years of management intervention declaration of
