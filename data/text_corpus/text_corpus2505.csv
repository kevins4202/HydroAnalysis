12525,secondary settling tank sst models play a significant role in the simulation of a wastewater treatment system they can estimate effluent and underflow quality and thus help with the design management and optimization of wastewater treatment systems sst modeling consists of an empirical settling velocity function where parameter uncertainty could raise the performance of an sst model could suffer from parameter uncertainty which makes parameter uncertainty assessment valuable for sst modeling monte carlo simulation mcs is a classical technique for assessing uncertainty but it requires parameter distribution information and is computationally expensive to overcome these limitations arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce a novel approach has been adopted for the first time in this study the well recognized bürger diehl sst model is used and the uncertainties originating from five essential model parameters are assessed by the novel apce method with the mcs technique being used as a benchmark probabilistic estimations of the model output i e sludge blanket height sbh are generated by both apce and mcs the comparison results between apce and mcs suggest that the apce approach can be as effective as mcs in quantifying the uncertainties associated with sst model parameters while significantly reducing approximately 90 computational requirements this

blanket height simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction wastewater treatment that enables the reduction of water pollution is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for human society secondary settling tank sst which is the most common solid liquid separation facility plays a crucial role during the treatment of wastewater 1 2 sst is a vital part of the activated sludge process as it serves as both a clarifier and a thickener it allows biomass or solid particles in the treated wastewater to settle to the tank bottom while the clear water leaves the tank from the upper level 3 sludge will escape with the clear water if the settling tank fails as either clarifier or thickener in addition to delivering an effluent of poor quality loss of sludge could alter the behavior of the biological process by uncontrollably reducing the sludge age to values below those necessary for appropriate plant performance 4 therefore it is essential to unravel the behavior of sst mathematical models have been frequently employed as effective tools for understanding and analyzing various wastewater treatment processes 5 6 39 to adequately depict the clarification thickening process a number of sst models have been developed over the past few decades and the one dimensional secondary settling tank 1d sst model is the most widely used one in the wastewater industry due to its computational efficiency 7 8 the sludge settling process was first expressed as a one dimensional mass balance partial differential equation pde by kynch 9 based on experimental observations further studies were conducted petty 10 extended the kynch theory for continuous simulation takács et al 11 simulated the sst layer by layer and their model has been widely used in commercial modeling tools till today bürger et al 12 improved the model by considering compression settling diffusion effects and facilitating reliable simulations although these 1d sst models help with recognizing the settling characteristics of sludges model uncertainties could arise because of the imperfect calibration of empirical parameters and the natural variability of settling processes for example calibration of the parameters in empirical settling velocity functions can be highly uncertain and the settling characteristics of sludges vary radically depending on constituents in the influent and conditions imposed on the biological reactors to ensure the effective and reliable use of 1d sst models it is necessary to determine the scope and sources of uncertainty associated with model simulations this will help with understanding the simulated systems increasing the accuracy of model simulations and defining realistic values for potential risk assessments 13 14 monte carlo simulation mcs a time tested and brutal method for uncertainty analysis is the dominant method for estimating the uncertainty of 1d sst models in previous research for instance li and stenstrom 15 applied mcs to analyze uncertainties of non identifiable parameters in a 1d sst model the mcs approach typically consists of the following steps 1 static model generation 2 input distribution identification 3 random variable generation and 4 analysis and decision making 16 mcs is simple and easily programmable but it is inadequate when the static model is complex 17 18 to achieve a certain level of precision the computational complexity of mcs would grow exponentially with the increase in the number of inputs or parameters meanwhile mcs assumes an exact probability density function for each uncertain variable and parameter in the modeling system which is often unknown in real world engineering applications as a result a more efficient and advanced method for uncertainty analyses is desired for complex sst models recently a number of alternative methods for uncertainty analysis have been developed for diverse applications 19 20 particularly arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce has attracted much attention and shown a superior efficiency apce is based on generalized polynomial chaos expansion pce and it decomposes the distribution of a variable into multiple distributions of independent variables 21 apce is a mathematically optimal way to construct and obtain a model response surface in the form of a high dimensional polynomial in uncertain model parameters 18 it can be regarded as a surrogate model which captures the relationship between a distribution of original model output and distributions of original model parameters in comparison with mcs apce does not require many repeated runs of original model which makes it more efficient for the uncertainty analysis of large and complex models more importantly apce creates polynomials from raw statistical moments of model parameters which means it is also suitable for models where parameter distributions are arbitrarily distributed 18 22 apce has been successfully adopted in various disciplines as an efficient approach for assessing uncertainty propagation 23 24 it has a significant potential for the uncertainty analysis of 1d sst models which are often complex models with empirical and hard to determine parameter distributions however the potential of apce for the uncertainty analysis of 1d sst models has not been investigated therefore the objective of this study is to for the first time apply apce to assess the model parameter uncertainty of a 1d sst model the proposed method will improve computing efficiency and address the issue of unknown parameter distributions while assessing the uncertainty of a 1d sst model this entails the following tasks 1 construct a state of the art 1d sst model i e the bürger diehl model with hypothetical data 2 define the model parameters and assess their uncertainty using the apce technique 3 compare the results from the apce method and the benchmark mcs method this work will discuss how apce can be used as a novel efficient and reliable uncertainty analysis method for sst models 2 methods and study system 2 1 arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion the core notion of pce is that the composition of independent variables described by orthogonal polynomials can be used to express the distribution of a random variable 25 27 the homogeneous function in the wiener theory serves as the basis for the polynomial chaos expansion pce approach 28 assume y f ξ is a model and ξ ξ i 1 ξ i n are uncertain model parameters in the format of random variables the random output variable y can be represented by a multivariate polynomial expansion as follows 21 1 y a 0 p 0 i 1 1 a i 1 p 1 ξ i 1 i 1 1 i 2 1 i 1 a i 1 i 2 p 2 ξ i 1 ξ i 2 i 1 1 i 2 1 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 a i 1 i 2 i 3 p 3 ξ i 1 ξ i 2 ξ i 3 where p n ξ i 1 ξ i n is the polynomials e g hermite orthogonal polynomials of order n in terms of the multi dimensional independent standard random variables ξ ξ i 1 ξ i n and a i 1 i r represents the pce coefficients in practice the mth order truncated polynomial expansion of y with respect to the d dimension vector ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ d can be expressed as eq 2 and the number of the pce coefficients can be counted as eq 3 2 y j 0 m a j ψ j ξ 3 r d m d m where a j and a i 1 i r have a one to one correspondence and ψ j ξ and p d ξ i 1 ξ d do as well obtaining polynomials p n ξ i 1 ξ i n of pce depends on known distributions of the random variables 29 thus applying the pce approach with arbitrary or unknown distributions of the random variables can be challenging which can be addressed by the adoption of apce instead of requiring complete knowledge of a probability density function apce generates polynomials from the existence of a finite number of moments of the variables making it ideal for modeling systems where the random variables are arbitrarily distributed 22 30 applying apce the polynomials p n ξ in eq 1 can be rewritten as 18 4 p n ξ p n ξ i 0 n p i n ξ i 5 μ 0 μ 1 μ 1 μ 2 μ n μ n 1 μ n 1 0 μ n 0 μ 2 n 1 1 p 0 n p 1 n p n 1 n p n n 0 0 0 1 where p i n are coefficients of apce μ 2k 1 represents the 2k 1th raw moment of ξ to establish the apce model raw moment of ξ is the only required information a mth order apce model can be expressed as eq 6 6 y i 0 j 0 m a j p i m ξ i and a j estimation in terms of n samples which could be achieved by a non intrusive method i e least square regression is shown as eq 7 7 q argmin i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i is an observation and y i is a simulation output 2 2 1d sst model the bürger diehl model excluding hydrodynamic dispersion was used as an example to show the applicability of apce for uncertainty analysis 12 the model was selected for its reliability flexibility and availability 15 31 assume an ideal one dimensional sst schema as shown in fig 1 the bürger diehl model can be expressed as follows 8 c t z f c z t z d comp c c z q f t c f t a δ z where t is time z is the depth from feed level in sst a is the cross sectional area of sst c is the solid concentration in sst f is the convective flux function d comp is the compression function q f is the feed volumetric flow c f is the solid concentration of the feed flow δ is the dirac delta distribution the convective flux function for four different zones in sst can be expressed as eq 9 9 f c z t q e t a c e t for z h effluent zone v hs c c q e t a c for h z 0 clarification zone v hs c c q u t a c for 0 z b thickening zone q u t a c u t for z b underflow zone where the q e is the effluent flow rate and c e is the effluent solid concentration the q u is the underflow flow rate and c u is the underflow solid concentration v hs is the hindered settling velocity which is described by the vesilind formula that incorporates v 0 and r h which are the maximum theoretical settling velocity and the empirical parameter respectively 32 10 v hs c v 0 e r h c the compression function developed by bürger et al 31 33 can be expressed as eq 11 11 d comp c 0 for 0 c c c ρ s α v hs c g ρ s ρ f β c c c for c c c where α and β are empirical parameters ρ s is the solid mass density ρ f is the fluid mass density g is the gravity of acceleration and c c is a threshold concentration at which solid particles begin to physically contact one another as part of the 1d sst model output sludge blanket height sbh is the most commonly used indicator of sludge concentration profiles 34 in this study sbh is determined based on two commonly used sludge concentration threshold values i e 8 kg m3 and 10 kg m3 35 sbh8 and sbh10 are defined as the layer number index of the layer that has a sludge concentration of 8 and 10 kg m3 respectively 2 3 uncertainty analysis in this study the goal of uncertainty analysis is to analyze parameter uncertainties originating from five selected parameters in the 1d sst model the five parameters i e v 0 r h c c α β are selected because they govern the two most important processes settling velocity function and compression function in the model these five parameters are assumed independent and the parameter distributions used in this study are listed in table 1 the parameter distributions are estimated based on the literature 2 7 15 in practice the exact parameter distributions are not expected to be available instead only a set of calibrated model parameter values can be obtained the proposed apce method that does not require complete knowledge of the parameter distributions is built based on statistical moments of the parameters which can be calculated from a set of calibrated model parameter values the parameter distributions are pre defined in this study only because real world calibrated model parameter values are not available from the literature the pre defined parameter distributions are used to produce a set of hypothetical model parameter values which are reasonable substitutes for real world data fig 2 shows the procedures for uncertainty analysis for the 1d sst model using the apce approach after acknowledging the parameter distributions 1000 combinations of the five parameters are randomly sampled based on their distributions then all samples are iteratively fed to the hypothetical 1d sst model and the output results at a specific time step are labeled as sbh results from the mcs framework as for the apce framework the first 100 sbh results from mcs are obtained and transformed to a standard normal distribution by quantile transformation the distribution transformation is done to improve the performance of apce 36 37 following this treatment the 100 transformed sbh results with their corresponding model parameter samples are used to estimate the apce coefficients by regression 18 once the coefficients are calculated the apce equation for this specific time step is constructed the model parameter samples 101 to 1000 are then fed to the constructed apce equation for validation purposes and the corresponding inversed outputs of the apce model are labeled as sbh results from apce lastly distributions of sbh results from both mcs apce are compared and analyzed for the apce part the first 100 sbh results from mcs could be regarded as training samples while the rest 900 sbh results from mcs are validation samples all the results comparison shown below is on the validation samples in this study the apce is constructed with the 3rd order truncated polynomial expansion and the 5 dimension random variables it is implemented in julia and the code used is based on the work of oladyshkin and nowak 18 2 4 sst model setup to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed apce method a hypothetical case of the 1d sst model proposed by bürger et al 12 is used the model parameters and boundary conditions are as follows h 1 m b 3 m a 400 m2 at time t 0 the sst is full of sludge at the concentration c 2 0 kg m3 the volumetric flow rates q f 250 m3 h and q e 170 m3 h and q u 80 m3 h the total simulation period is 400 hours and the change of feed concentration in time is as below 12 c f 4 0 kg m 3 0 t 50 h 3 7 kg m 3 50 t 250 h 4 1 kg m 3 250 t 400 h additionally the tank is divided into 40 layers the layer j refers to the interval z j 1 z j where 13 z j j z h j 0 40 14 z b h 40 at the top and bottom of the tank which correspond to the effluent and underflow zones another two layers were added respectively 31 33 thus the computational domain of the tank has a total of 44 layers 3 results and discussion 3 1 data generation and preparation to construct the apce model for a specific time step the first 100 sets of valid sbh results from mcs at the time step were obtained to provide an example of the 100 sets of sbh results fig 3 shows the histograms of raw sbh8 and sbh10 values at the 400th simulation hour the mean values of sbh8 and sbh10 are approximately 26 and 37 as shown in fig 3a and 3b respectively with a layer height of 0 1 m this indicates an average of 1 1 m thickness between the two concentrations 8 kg m3 and 10 kg m3 the results validate the settling rule in sst at a lower position of the tank the solid concentration is supposed to be higher furthermore sbh8 spanning most layers of the tank as in fig 3a has a more extensive distributional range than sbh10 it implies that sbh8 is more susceptible to model parameters are associated with more uncertain 3 2 comparison of apce and mcs results at a single time step the 100 sets of sbh results in section 3 1 were transformed to fit standard normal distribution and then used along with their corresponding parameter values to estimate the apce coefficients for each time step a set of 100 equations was generated to determine the apce coefficients and construct the apce equation for each time step after running 1d sst at the chosen 100 parameter samples then a temporal series of apce equations was developed to quantify output uncertainties and produce probabilistic outputs fig 4 compares the apce and mcs results at the 400th simulation hour for both sbh8 and sbh10 the histogram produced by apce marked as red and that produced by mcs marked as grey are highly identical as shown in fig 4a and 4b this indicates that apce in this study can well replicate the uncertainty analysis results from mcs the probabilistic sbh outputs at the 400th simulation hour from apce were also compared with benchmark mcs results based on their mean and standard deviation values in fig 4c and 4d the notch of the box represents the median and the lower and upper of the box are the first quartile q1 and third quartile q3 respectively iqr is the interquartile range which equals q3 q1 the lower whisker extends to the first datum greater than q1 1 5 iqr while the upper whisker extends to the last datum less than q3 1 5 iqr the boxplots show that the medians and standard deviations obtained from mcs marked as grey are well replicated by apce marked as red for both sbh8 and sbh10 the differences between median values mcs versus apce are about only 1 layer which indicate a 0 1 m difference the lower whiskers of apce are slightly with a difference of 0 3 m below that of mcs the above comparisons at the 400th simulation hour imply that the probabilistic results from apce which requires 100 simulation runs are consistent with those from mcs which consists of 1000 simulation runs 3 3 comparison of apce and mcs at multiple time steps the apce results were also compared with mcs at more time steps 50th 150th 250th and 350th simulation hour to further demonstrate its performance throughout the whole simulation period fig 5 shows the comparison results at the four timestamps and the colored plots are for apce while the grey plots are for mcs the boxplots in fig 5 use the same legend as that in fig 4 it is observed that the distributions generated by apce are overall highly similar to that produced by mcs at all four timestamps fig 5c and 5d show that the sbh8 median values from apce are slightly smaller than those from mcs while the sbh10 median values of apce results are almost the same as those from mcs the sbh8 and sbh10 median values show a rising trend followed by a downward trend throughout the simulation timeline which reflects the dynamic settling process specifically sbh8 and sbh10 median values at the 150th and 250th simulation hours are a little higher than those at the 50th and 350th simulation hours this trend is consistent with the common settling dynamics described in the literature the solids in wastewater settle to the bottom of the tank over time resulting in a rising trend for sbh median values with the accumulation of sediment and an increase of feed concentration the thickened sediment layer then leads to a downward trend for sbh median values these results imply that apce can reproduce the probabilistic outputs from mcs at all four timestamps it can also capture the dynamic changes during the settling process to statistically compare the probabilistic outputs produced by apce with those produced by mcs at every time step of the whole simulation period a nonparametric two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was implemented 38 in the kolmogorov smirnov test the null hypothesis is the statistical identity between the two distributions and the test statistic is the largest absolute distance between the two cumulative distribution functions fig 6 shows the p values of the kolmogorov smirnov test at every time step it can be observed that p values are 0 01 at all timestamps and are 0 05 at most timestamps these results suggest that there is no strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions generated by apce and mcs are statistically identical it also implies that these distributions generated by apce and mcs are highly identical and apce can replace mcs at most time steps fig 7 shows the probability of sbh8 and sbh10 over time from apce results the darker color in fig 7a and 7b indicate a higher probability it is observed that sbh10 spreads a smaller range it may be because sediment layers with high concentrations are fixed at the relative bottom of the tank due to greater gravity fig 7c and 7d show the quantile for sbh8 and sbh10 locations from apce results respectively the results verify that sbh10 spreads a smaller range additionally there are clear changes after the 50th and 250th simulation hours due to the change in influent flow solid concentration eq 2 it implies that influent solid concentration could significantly affect the sbh location these findings illustrate that the proposed apce approach which requires only 100 simulation runs can generate probabilistic outputs that are highly close to those of 1000 mcs simulation runs this suggests that apce can be as successful as mcs simulation in estimating the uncertainties associated with parameters while greatly reducing the computing time by 90 in this study 4 conclusion in this study an arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce method is developed to assess model parameter uncertainty for a one dimensional secondary settling tank 1d sst model the conventional pce approach has been proven to be very efficient in quantifying parameter uncertainty however it can only be used when the distributions of model parameters are known which is not always a valid assumption in wastewater modeling in this improved apce approach polynomials are built based on the raw moments of model parameters which makes apce more applicable when prior distributions are not available the results demonstrate that the apce approach can be as effective as monto carlo simulation mcs in quantifying the uncertainties associated with 1d sst model parameters while significantly reducing the computational loads 90 in this study comparing the probabilistic distributions obtained from apce and mcs it is found that they have similar median mean and variance in addition the kolmogorov smirnov test results suggest that the two distributions generated by apce and mcs are very likely to be statistically identical the proposed apce approach provides a reliable efficient and promising alternative for analyzing the uncertainty of model parameters in sst models it could provide valuable technical support for wastewater risk assessment and management in this study apce is used based on the assumption that all uncertain parameters are independent variables for future work apce can be modified and tested for the analysis of dependent parameters and for more complex wastewater models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

concentration profiles 34 in this study sbh is determined based on two commonly used sludge concentration threshold values i e 8 kg m3 and 10 kg m3 35 sbh8 and sbh10 are defined as the layer number index of the layer that has a sludge concentration of 8 and 10 kg m3 respectively 2 3 uncertainty analysis in this study the goal of uncertainty analysis is to analyze parameter uncertainties originating from five selected parameters in the 1d sst model the five parameters i e v 0 r h c c α β are selected because they govern the two most important processes settling velocity function and compression function in the model these five parameters are assumed independent and the parameter distributions used in this study are listed in table 1 the parameter distributions are estimated based on the literature 2 7 15 in practice the exact parameter distributions are not expected to be available instead only a set of calibrated model parameter values can be obtained the proposed apce method that does not require complete knowledge of the parameter distributions is built based on statistical moments of the parameters which can be calculated from a set of calibrated model parameter values the parameter distributions are pre defined in this study only because real world calibrated model parameter values are not available from the literature the pre defined parameter distributions are used to produce a set of hypothetical model parameter values which are reasonable substitutes for real world data fig 2 shows the procedures for uncertainty analysis for the 1d sst model using the apce approach after acknowledging the parameter distributions 1000 combinations of the five parameters are randomly sampled based on their distributions then all samples are iteratively fed to the hypothetical 1d sst model and the output results at a specific time step are labeled as sbh results from the mcs framework as for the apce framework the first 100 sbh results from mcs are obtained and transformed to a standard normal distribution by quantile transformation the distribution transformation is done to improve the performance of apce 36 37 following this treatment the 100 transformed sbh results with their corresponding model parameter samples are used to estimate the apce coefficients by regression 18 once the coefficients are calculated the apce equation for this specific time step is constructed the model parameter samples 101 to 1000 are then fed to the constructed apce equation for validation purposes and the corresponding inversed outputs of the apce model are labeled as sbh results from apce lastly distributions of sbh results from both mcs apce are compared and analyzed for the apce part the first 100 sbh results from mcs could be regarded as training samples while the rest 900 sbh results from mcs are validation samples all the results comparison shown below is on the validation samples in this study the apce is constructed with the 3rd order truncated polynomial expansion and the 5 dimension random variables it is implemented in julia and the code used is based on the work of oladyshkin and nowak 18 2 4 sst model setup to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed apce method a hypothetical case of the 1d sst model proposed by bürger et al 12 is used the model parameters and boundary conditions are as follows h 1 m b 3 m a 400 m2 at time t 0 the sst is full of sludge at the concentration c 2 0 kg m3 the volumetric flow rates q f 250 m3 h and q e 170 m3 h and q u 80 m3 h the total simulation period is 400 hours and the change of feed concentration in time is as below 12 c f 4 0 kg m 3 0 t 50 h 3 7 kg m 3 50 t 250 h 4 1 kg m 3 250 t 400 h additionally the tank is divided into 40 layers the layer j refers to the interval z j 1 z j where 13 z j j z h j 0 40 14 z b h 40 at the top and bottom of the tank which correspond to the effluent and underflow zones another two layers were added respectively 31 33 thus the computational domain of the tank has a total of 44 layers 3 results and discussion 3 1 data generation and preparation to construct the apce model for a specific time step the first 100 sets of valid sbh results from mcs at the time step were obtained to provide an example of the 100 sets of sbh results fig 3 shows the histograms of raw sbh8 and sbh10 values at the 400th simulation hour the mean values of sbh8 and sbh10 are approximately 26 and 37 as shown in fig 3a and 3b respectively with a layer height of 0 1 m this indicates an average of 1 1 m thickness between the two concentrations 8 kg m3 and 10 kg m3 the results validate the settling rule in sst at a lower position of the tank the solid concentration is supposed to be higher furthermore sbh8 spanning most layers of the tank as in fig 3a has a more extensive distributional range than sbh10 it implies that sbh8 is more susceptible to model parameters are associated with more uncertain 3 2 comparison of apce and mcs results at a single time step the 100 sets of sbh results in section 3 1 were transformed to fit standard normal distribution and then used along with their corresponding parameter values to estimate the apce coefficients for each time step a set of 100 equations was generated to determine the apce coefficients and construct the apce equation for each time step after running 1d sst at the chosen 100 parameter samples then a temporal series of apce equations was developed to quantify output uncertainties and produce probabilistic outputs fig 4 compares the apce and mcs results at the 400th simulation hour for both sbh8 and sbh10 the histogram produced by apce marked as red and that produced by mcs marked as grey are highly identical as shown in fig 4a and 4b this indicates that apce in this study can well replicate the uncertainty analysis results from mcs the probabilistic sbh outputs at the 400th simulation hour from apce were also compared with benchmark mcs results based on their mean and standard deviation values in fig 4c and 4d the notch of the box represents the median and the lower and upper of the box are the first quartile q1 and third quartile q3 respectively iqr is the interquartile range which equals q3 q1 the lower whisker extends to the first datum greater than q1 1 5 iqr while the upper whisker extends to the last datum less than q3 1 5 iqr the boxplots show that the medians and standard deviations obtained from mcs marked as grey are well replicated by apce marked as red for both sbh8 and sbh10 the differences between median values mcs versus apce are about only 1 layer which indicate a 0 1 m difference the lower whiskers of apce are slightly with a difference of 0 3 m below that of mcs the above comparisons at the 400th simulation hour imply that the probabilistic results from apce which requires 100 simulation runs are consistent with those from mcs which consists of 1000 simulation runs 3 3 comparison of apce and mcs at multiple time steps the apce results were also compared with mcs at more time steps 50th 150th 250th and 350th simulation hour to further demonstrate its performance throughout the whole simulation period fig 5 shows the comparison results at the four timestamps and the colored plots are for apce while the grey plots are for mcs the boxplots in fig 5 use the same legend as that in fig 4 it is observed that the distributions generated by apce are overall highly similar to that produced by mcs at all four timestamps fig 5c and 5d show that the sbh8 median values from apce are slightly smaller than those from mcs while the sbh10 median values of apce results are almost the same as those from mcs the sbh8 and sbh10 median values show a rising trend followed by a downward trend throughout the simulation timeline which reflects the dynamic settling process specifically sbh8 and sbh10 median values at the 150th and 250th simulation hours are a little higher than those at the 50th and 350th simulation hours this trend is consistent with the common settling dynamics described in the literature the solids in wastewater settle to the bottom of the tank over time resulting in a rising trend for sbh median values with the accumulation of sediment and an increase of feed concentration the thickened sediment layer then leads to a downward trend for sbh median values these results imply that apce can reproduce the probabilistic outputs from mcs at all four timestamps it can also capture the dynamic changes during the settling process to statistically compare the probabilistic outputs produced by apce with those produced by mcs at every time step of the whole simulation period a nonparametric two sample kolmogorov smirnov test was implemented 38 in the kolmogorov smirnov test the null hypothesis is the statistical identity between the two distributions and the test statistic is the largest absolute distance between the two cumulative distribution functions fig 6 shows the p values of the kolmogorov smirnov test at every time step it can be observed that p values are 0 01 at all timestamps and are 0 05 at most timestamps these results suggest that there is no strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions generated by apce and mcs are statistically identical it also implies that these distributions generated by apce and mcs are highly identical and apce can replace mcs at most time steps fig 7 shows the probability of sbh8 and sbh10 over time from apce results the darker color in fig 7a and 7b indicate a higher probability it is observed that sbh10 spreads a smaller range it may be because sediment layers with high concentrations are fixed at the relative bottom of the tank due to greater gravity fig 7c and 7d show the quantile for sbh8 and sbh10 locations from apce results respectively the results verify that sbh10 spreads a smaller range additionally there are clear changes after the 50th and 250th simulation hours due to the change in influent flow solid concentration eq 2 it implies that influent solid concentration could significantly affect the sbh location these findings illustrate that the proposed apce approach which requires only 100 simulation runs can generate probabilistic outputs that are highly close to those of 1000 mcs simulation runs this suggests that apce can be as successful as mcs simulation in estimating the uncertainties associated with parameters while greatly reducing the computing time by 90 in this study 4 conclusion in this study an arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apce method is developed to assess model parameter uncertainty for a one dimensional secondary settling tank 1d sst model the conventional pce approach has been proven to be very efficient in quantifying parameter uncertainty however it can only be used when the distributions of model parameters are known which is not always a valid assumption in wastewater modeling in this improved apce approach polynomials are built based on the raw moments of model parameters which makes apce more applicable when prior distributions are not available the results demonstrate that the apce approach can be as effective as monto carlo simulation mcs in quantifying the uncertainties associated with 1d sst model parameters while significantly reducing the computational loads 90 in this study comparing the probabilistic distributions obtained from apce and mcs it is found that they have similar median mean and variance in addition the kolmogorov smirnov test results suggest that the two distributions generated by apce and mcs are very likely to be statistically identical the proposed apce approach provides a reliable efficient and promising alternative for analyzing the uncertainty of model parameters in sst models it could provide valuable technical support for wastewater risk assessment and management in this study apce is used based on the assumption that all uncertain parameters are independent variables for future work apce can be modified and tested for the analysis of dependent parameters and for more complex wastewater models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12526,arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf can play important roles in pollutant removal in the terrestrial system however the functional role of amf in wetland systems is still unclear this study evaluated the effects of amf on the purification of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps containing wastewater in constructed wetlands cws filled with different substrate types sand perlite vermiculite or biochar results indicated that the removal efficiencies of total organic carbon toc phosphate po4 3 p and total nitrogen tn in cws with different substrates were in the following order biochar vermiculite perlite sand compared with sand systems the removal efficiencies of toc po4 3 p ammonium nh4 n and tn in cws filled with adsorptive substrates biochar vermiculite or perlite were enhanced by 3 8 11 4 11 6 30 6 16 5 31 2 and 6 2 34 6 respectively am symbiosis increased toc tn and po4 3 p removal in cws but the adsorptive substrates showed more significant influences on wastewater purification than amf symbiosis besides plant glyceria maxima presence also improved the performance of cws on wastewater purification overall all the findings indicated that the interaction effects of am symbiosis and adsorptive substrates e g biochar vermiculite or perlite could enhance the removal performance of pollutants from wastewater in planted cws graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords constructed wetlands ppcps treatment performance arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws have been wildly adapted for wastewater treatment because of the advantages of low energy requirement and easy operation and maintenance 1 2 however the ubiquitous pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in sewage may also adversely affect the operational stability of cws for example ppcps might reduce photosynthetic pigments in plants inhibit root development and reduce mature leaves number and size 3 díaz cubilla et al revealed that ppcps could produce microbial stress and irreversible cell damage to microbes influencing the anaerobic digestion process of anaerobic bioreactor and decreasing the removal efficiency of organic matters 4 therefore there is an urgent need to enhance plant tolerance to ppcps stress thus improving the performance and sustainability of cws arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf can establish a mutualistic symbiosis with the roots of most terrestrial plant species nearly 85 in terrestrial ecosystems 5 the plant mycorrhizal association can develop tree shaped subcellular structures within root cells and establish the extraradical mycelium beyond the root hair zone thus improving nutrient acquisition and plant tolerance to environmental stresses e g salinity cold drought heavy metals and organic contaminants 6 7 in addition to providing these benefits for the host plants amf also plays a significant role in boosting the development of rhizosphere microorganisms by stimulating the production of phenolic compounds phytoalexins and root exudates 8 9 for these reasons amf has been regarded as a critical phytoremediation approach to re establish degraded ecosystems including abandoned agricultural fields contaminated soils and grassland 6 nowadays numerous pieces of evidence have demonstrated that the am symbiosis can be found in various wetland habitats including fens swamps marshes shorelines bays floating wetland mats and natural wetlands 10 13 commonly mycorrhizal status e g frequency of mycorrhiza intensity of mycorrhizal colonization and the arbuscule abundance in the roots of wetland plants is invariably lower than that of terrestrial plants however recent evidence has proven that amf can also provide significant advantages for plants in wetland systems 14 palacios et al 15 investigated amf inoculation in two plant species ficinia nodosa and carex appressa grown in stormwater biofilters suggesting the positive impacts of amf on plant growth could directly improve nitrogen phosphorus and cr removal from stormwater leading to a better performance of biofilters recently our study demonstrated that amf had positive impacts on ppcps removal in sand systems but insignificant effects in perlite vermiculite or biochar systems 16 suggesting that the type of substrate may influence the role of amf in ppcps removal however few studies have focused on the combined impacts of substrate and amf on the performance of cws for treating ppcps contaminated wastewater therefore the aims of this study were to 1 evaluate the impacts of amf on the purification of pollutants in cws and 2 investigate the influence of interaction between substrates and amf on ppcps containing wastewater purification in cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials glyceria maxima were selected as the wetland plant plant roots were surface sterilized according to the protocol described in our previous study 16 the selected amf inoculum was rhizophagus irregularis beg140 17 the representative ppcps including ibuprofen diclofenac triclocarban triclosan gemfirozil furosemide chloramphenicol and furosemide were selected and then mixed into the synthetic wastewater the composition of synthetic wastewater and the added concentration of ppcps are shown in supporting information si table s1 2 2 experimental design a total of 48 mesocosms were used in this study each mesocosm consisted of the following layers a 15 cm layer of gravel at the bottom a 20 cm layer of the selected substrate in the middle and a 15 cm layer of sand on top sand expanded perlite expanded vermiculite or biochar were individually filled in the middle layer to perform four cw systems with different substrates for each cw system 12 mesocosms were used fig 1 then divided into four mesocosm treatments in triplicates based on plant presence planted with or without g maxima and amf inoculation amf or amf treatments full details of the experimental setup are described in our previous study 16 a flood drain water condition were adopted in this study because of the positive effects of fluctuating water regimes on amf colonization 18 the frequency of flood drain water condition was 2 l 4 d same as our previous study 19 which provided a 2 h flood phase and a 94 h drain phase for the present study cw systems were operated in a natural environment with rain protection from june to november to avoid disturbances to system performance 2 3 sample analysis water samples from the influent and effluent of each cw systems were collected regularly every eight days to investigate the impacts of amf on the performance of cw for wastewater purification total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp ph and electrical conductance ec were measured according to the methods as described in our previous study 17 2 4 data analysis the removal efficiency of conventional wastewater parameters was calculated by mass balance as described in our previous study 17 the student s t test was used to compare the impacts of amf on wastewater purification p 0 05 was set as a significant difference two way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the difference in conventional wastewater parameters and the physicochemical parameters amf and substrate were set as the primary factors and amf substrate was set as the interaction effect the results of physicochemical parameters do ec ph and orp and conventional wastewater parameters toc po4 3 p nh4 n tn no3 n and no2 n were conducted by principal component analysis pca to examine the differences between sample groups r software version 4 0 5 was used for statistical analyses and data visualization in this study 3 results 3 1 physiochemical parameters in the cws the physicochemical parameters including do ec ph and orp in each system are shown in fig 2 the average concentration of do in cws with adsorptive systems perlite 5 7 mg l vermiculite 7 1 mg l and biochar 4 7 mg l was higher than that in sand systems 2 3 mg l meanwhile the concentrations of do in the sand perlite vermiculite and biochar systems under planted treatments were higher than those under unplanted treatments with an increase of 4 5 21 3 14 8 15 5 0 2 9 3 and 15 8 45 9 respectively conversely the value of ec in the sand perlite vermiculite and biochar systems under planted treatments were 10 8 15 2 11 2 16 9 9 6 10 6 and 3 9 6 0 lower than that under unplanted treatments respectively compared with unplanted treatments the ph value in planted treatments was lower in sand and vermiculite systems but higher in perlite and biochar systems adsorptive substrate enhanced do and ph but decreased ec compared with sand systems under the same treatments meanwhile substrate had significant effects on do ec and ph in cws under both plant treatments planted or unplanted p 0 01 table 1 amf showed significant effects on do in cws under planted treatments p 0 01 but an insignificant effect on physicochemical parameters in cws under unplanted treatments p 0 05 3 2 wastewater parameters 3 2 1 toc removal the removal efficiency of toc in different cws is shown in fig 3a toc removal in cws with the various substrates was in the following order biochar vermiculite perlite sand toc removal in cws with adsorptive substrate under both non planted and planted treatments were enhanced by 3 8 7 12 and 5 7 11 4 respectively compared to sand systems meanwhile amf showed more positive effects on toc removal in planted cws 1 4 3 0 than non planted cws 0 1 1 0 in addition substrate had significant effects on toc removal in cws p 0 01 and amf showed significant impacts on toc removal in planted cws p 0 01 table 1 3 2 2 po4 3 p removal the removal efficiency of po4 3 p in different cws is shown in fig 3b the removal efficiencies of po4 3 p in cws with different substrates were in the following order biochar vermiculite perlite sand po4 3 p removal in adsorptive substrate systems was 11 6 30 6 and 14 2 23 4 higher than that in sand systems with non planted and planted treatments respectively compared with amf treatments the removal efficiencies of po4 3 p under amf treatments were increased 0 2 5 0 in planted cws but decreased in non planted cws meanwhile g maxima significantly enhanced po4 3 p removal which the removal efficiencies of po4 3 p in planted cws were 9 2 16 4 and 7 5 20 4 higher than that in non planted cws with amf and amf treatments respectively substrate had significant effects on po4 3 p removal in cws p 0 01 and amf showed significant effects on po4 3 p removal in planted cws p 0 01 table 1 3 2 3 nitrogen removal nh4 n removal in the sand system was 66 5 82 4 while the removal efficiencies of nh4 n in cws with adsorptive substrate were 16 5 31 2 higher than that in the sand system fig 3c the removal efficiencies of nh4 n in cws with different substrates were in the following order perlite vermiculite biochar sand meanwhile nh4 n removal in planted systems were 0 5 15 0 and 0 8 15 7 higher than that in non planted cws with both amf and amf treatments respectively in addition amf played more critical roles in removing nh4 n in sand systems than others nh4 n removal in planted sand systems under amf treatments was 6 7 lower than that under amf treatments while insignificant difference on nh4 n removal were observed between amf and amf treatments in other substrate systems the removal efficiency of tn in different cws is shown in fig 3d the removal efficiencies of tn in cws with different substrates were in the following order biochar vermiculite perlite sand tn removal in adsorptive substrate systems was 6 2 34 6 and 14 1 22 7 higher than that in sand systems with non planted and planted treatments respectively meanwhile the removal efficiencies of tn in planted cws were 11 8 32 5 and 7 5 33 4 higher than that in non planted cws with amf and amf treatments respectively compared with amf treatments the removal efficiencies of tn in cws with amf treatments were increased by 2 4 4 6 and 0 2 3 6 in both planted and non planted treatments respectively substrate had significant effects on nh4 n and tn in cws p 0 01 and amf showed significant impacts on nh4 n removal p 0 05 but insignificant effects on tn removal p 0 05 in planted cws table 1 the composition of nitrogen sources in the influent was 20 9 for nh4 n 29 0 for no3 n 0 16 for no2 n and 49 9 for other nitrogen sources si fig s2 in the effluent of all substrate systems a significant decline was found for the composition of nh4 n 0 3 5 8 and other nitrogen sources 20 2 35 5 whereas the composition of no3 n rose up to 48 2 76 6 fig 4 moreover the composition of other nitrogen sources in non planted cws was 23 6 36 7 and about 3 4 7 5 lower than that in planted cws on the contrary the composition of no3 n in planted cws was 59 8 74 8 and increased by 6 3 8 4 more than that in non planted cws however the differences in nitrogen source utilization showed insignificant between amf and amf treatments in both planted and unplanted systems 3 3 correlation between physicochemical parameters and conventional wastewater parameters as shown in fig 5 the relations between physicochemical parameters and conventional wastewaters were significantly different among the four substrates cws in sand systems the first two components of pca explained 71 6 of the total data variability the first principal component dim1 had negative correlations with orp and toc but positively related to no3 n no2 n nh4 n tn po4 3 p and ec fig 5a in perlite systems dim1 explained 75 5 of the variability which had high positive correlations r 0 8 for toc orp do and ph and negative correlations r 0 8 for tn no3 n po4 3 p and ec fig 5b in vermiculite systems dim1 accounted for 53 9 of the variance and had positive correlations r 0 8 for no3 n tn no2 n p and ec while the second principal component dim2 explained 20 1 of the variability and showed positive correlations r 0 8 for do and orp fig 5c in biochar systems dim1 and dim2 represent 57 5 and 20 2 variability respectively nh4 n no2 n tn po4 3 p and ec were highly dependent upon each other r 0 75 while do orp ph and toc had negative correlations r 0 6 on dim1 fig 5d in addition the pca score of each system is shown in fig 6 a clear distinction between planted and unplanted treatments is based on separation along dim1 meanwhile the difference between amf and amf treatments can also be found in planted cws but insignificant in non planted cws 4 discussion 4 1 effects of vegetation and substrate on pollutant removal in this study vegetation g maxima plays a vital role in wastewater purification compared to the unplanted cws similar results were reported by chand et al 20 they found that cws with planted typha sp treatments showed a better removal performance of pollutants e g nh4 n p and sulfate than that with unplanted treatments wetland plants play an essential role in removing contaminants in cws which can assimilate pollutants directly into their tissues and enhance the environmental diversity in the rhizosphere to promote a variety of physical chemical and biological reactions for contaminant removal 21 the pca analyses also confirmed that the physicochemical and conventional wastewater parameters showed significant differences between planted and unplanted cws fig 6 dordio and carvalho 22 reported that plant presence facilitated the release of oxygen thus providing favorable conditions for the growth of microorganisms and promoting the aerobic biodegradation of pollutants in cws as shown in fig 2 cws with vegetation showed better do conditions than that without vegetation since the concentration of tp in the aqueous phase is negatively correlated with oxygen levels 23 the enhancement of oxygen conditions in planted cws may also contribute to p removal meanwhile the presence of g maxima increased the do concentration which may also promote the nitrification process 24 in addition plant roots can provide direct attachment sites for microbes and suitable environments for microbial development and metabolism in the rhizosphere 25 26 thus promoting the microbial metabolic processes of pollutants in cws cws filled with adsorptive substrate showed better performance for wastewater purification compared with sand systems toc nh4 n tn and po4 3 p removal in adsorptive substrate systems with both planted and unplanted treatments were increased by 3 8 11 4 16 5 31 4 6 2 34 6 and 11 6 30 6 respectively fig 3 the substrate selection significantly affects pollutant removal in cws 27 this result also accords with our recent observations indicating that cws filled with these three adsorptive substrates had a better removal performance for ppcps than sand 16 this could be that sand has a lower sorption capacity for contaminants than these three substrates 28 29 which could promote the retention of pollutants in cws meanwhile the surface morphology characterization of substrate indicated that there are few cracks on the relatively smooth surface of quartz sand while the surface of perlite vermiculite and biochar are rough porous and multi cracked si fig s1 it was found that substrate with higher pore volume or specific surface area generally has higher adsorption and removal performance for pollutants in cws 29 besides the porous structure of the substrate could be used as perfect bio carriers for microbial growth in cws which benefits biofilm formation and the reproduction of microbial communities thus enhancing the bioaccumulation and biodegradation of pollutants 24 liu et al 30 also demonstrated that the rapid and stable removal of contaminants in zeolite based tidal flow cws could be mainly due to the combined effect of the high adsorption capacity of the specific substrate during the flooded phase and the fast biodegradation during the drained phase of each tidal operation in addition the differences in physicochemical parameters among the four substrate systems may significantly impact pollutant removal fig 2 it was confirmed by the pca analyses indicating that the correlation between physicochemical parameters and conventional wastewater parameters was significantly different among the four substrate systems fig 5 previous studies proved that the physiochemical parameters e g do ph orp and ec could directly influence microbial abundance and species 24 31 thus affecting the ultimate performance of wastewater purification in this study the average concentrations of do in adsorptive substrate systems under unplanted treatments were significantly higher than those of sand systems under the same conditions fig 2a consequently there was a better aerobic condition in perlite vermiculite and biochar systems for nitrification aerobic denitrification and biodegradation meanwhile the higher dissolved oxygen may also contribute to phosphorus accumulation inside cw systems 23 similar results also reported by bai et al 32 they observed that porous substrates could enhance oxygen transport and facilitate the growth and reproduction of microorganisms thus resulting in bioaccumulation and biodegradation of more organic compounds 33 fu et al 24 also demonstrated that using substrates with porous structures such as activated carbon could improve the dissolved oxygen supply and enhance the removal efficiency of pollutants in cws 4 2 effects of amf on contaminants purification in cws amf inoculation significantly enhanced the removal of toc nh4 n and p from wastewater in planted cws indicating that amf might have an essential role in wastewater purification in cws the reason could be that amf promotes plant growth and reduces the adverse effects of ppcps stress 19 in this study g maxima with amf treatments showed better performance such as root length shoot height and biomass than that with amf treatments si table s2 which might provide more sites for the development of microorganisms and a high oxygen release rate thereby beneficial for the biodegradation of the pollutants in cws 34 similar results also suggested that biofilters planted with inoculated ficinia nodosa had 10 higher removal of tn and 5 higher removal of tp than the non inoculated controls 15 in addition the extraradical hyphae of amf might also contribute to pollutant removal by facilitating the efficient uptake of immobile nutrients by the host plant 6 11 by using isotopic labeling techniques previous studies identified direct evidence that am symbiosis could develop extra radical hyphae beyond the root hair zone to provide the mycorrhizal pathway for the acquisition of p and n 35 36 resulting in a more efficiently accumulation of p and n in inoculated plants moreover amf might also influence pollutant removal by modifying root exudates to stimulate microbial activity biochemical transformations and enhancement of mineralization in the rhizosphere 37 in a previous study corgie et al 38 found that amf glomus mosseae increased the density of phenanthrene degrading bacteria and the activity of dioxygenase transcription in the rhizosphere of ryegrass lolium perenne l 4 3 effects of interactions between substrates and amf on wastewater purification in cws the functional role of amf in wastewater purification may also be affected by substrate types the interaction effects between amf and substrate showed significant effects on nitrogen forms e g nh4 n no3 n and no2 n in cws table 1 a possible reason is that substrate types could affect the development of amf symbiosis which indirectly affects plant growth resulting in the variability of pollution removal in cws with a different substrate fig s3 our previous study investigated amf colonization in planted cws with a different substrate confirming that mycorrhizal status e g frequency of mycorrhiza intensity of mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule abundance in plant roots showed significant differences among cws filled with different substrates 19 it is worth noting that the effects of am symbiosis on nh4 n removal were significant in sand systems but insignificant in adsorptive substrate systems fig 3 the possible explanation is that the drain phase was too short only 2 h cycle in the present study pollutants cannot be eliminated quickly from the aqueous phase through microbial degradation or plant uptake in such a short retention time 39 consequently the dominant removal pathway of pollutants might be attributed to the adsorption processes of substrates and attached microbes in the present study in sand systems therefore the impacts of amf on promoting pollutants removal could be more relatively significant than in adsorptive substrate systems by contrast the porous structure of adsorptive substrates in cws with flood and drain exchange could provide a more critical role in pollutant removal fig 3 and plant growth 19 than am symbiosis the results of two way anova also confirmed that substrate showed more significant effects on physicochemical parameters and pollutant removal than amf in tidal flow cws table 1 5 conclusion adsorptive substrates perlite vermiculite and biochar amf and g maxima significantly increased the pollutants toc tn po4 3 p and nh4 n removal from wastewater in cws the application of adsorptive substrates in cws showed a more critical role in pollutant removal than amf inoculation our results indicated that plant presence and adsorptive substrate addition could improve the performance of cws in purifying wastewater am symbiosis might potentially enhance pollutant removal in cws based on this study further studies are needed to reveal the impacts of amf on pollutant metabolic pathways in cws including

evaluated the effects of amf on the purification of the pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps containing wastewater in constructed wetlands cws filled with different substrate types sand perlite vermiculite or biochar results indicated that the removal efficiencies of total organic carbon toc phosphate po4 3 p and total nitrogen tn in cws with different substrates were in the following order biochar vermiculite perlite sand compared with sand systems the removal efficiencies of toc po4 3 p ammonium nh4 n and tn in cws filled with adsorptive substrates biochar vermiculite or perlite were enhanced by 3 8 11 4 11 6 30 6 16 5 31 2 and 6 2 34 6 respectively am symbiosis increased toc tn and po4 3 p removal in cws but the adsorptive substrates showed more significant influences on wastewater purification than amf symbiosis besides plant glyceria maxima presence also improved the performance of cws on wastewater purification overall all the findings indicated that the interaction effects of am symbiosis and adsorptive substrates e g biochar vermiculite or perlite could enhance the removal performance of pollutants from wastewater in planted cws graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords constructed wetlands ppcps treatment performance arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws have been wildly adapted for wastewater treatment because of the advantages of low energy requirement and easy operation and maintenance 1 2 however the ubiquitous pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in sewage may also adversely affect the operational stability of cws for example ppcps might reduce photosynthetic pigments in plants inhibit root development and reduce mature leaves number and size 3 díaz cubilla et al revealed that ppcps could produce microbial stress and irreversible cell damage to microbes influencing the anaerobic digestion process of anaerobic bioreactor and decreasing the removal efficiency of organic matters 4 therefore there is an urgent need to enhance plant tolerance to ppcps stress thus improving the performance and sustainability of cws arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf can establish a mutualistic symbiosis with the roots of most terrestrial plant species nearly 85 in terrestrial ecosystems 5 the plant mycorrhizal association can develop tree shaped subcellular structures within root cells and establish the extraradical mycelium beyond the root hair zone thus improving nutrient acquisition and plant tolerance to environmental stresses e g salinity cold drought heavy metals and organic contaminants 6 7 in addition to providing these benefits for the host plants amf also plays a significant role in boosting the development of rhizosphere microorganisms by stimulating the production of phenolic compounds phytoalexins and root exudates 8 9 for these reasons amf has been regarded as a critical phytoremediation approach to re establish degraded ecosystems including abandoned agricultural fields contaminated soils and grassland 6 nowadays numerous pieces of evidence have demonstrated that the am symbiosis can be found in various wetland habitats including fens swamps marshes shorelines bays floating wetland mats and natural wetlands 10 13 commonly mycorrhizal status e g frequency of mycorrhiza intensity of mycorrhizal colonization and the arbuscule abundance in the roots of wetland plants is invariably lower than that of terrestrial plants however recent evidence has proven that amf can also provide significant advantages for plants in wetland systems 14 palacios et al 15 investigated amf inoculation in two plant species ficinia nodosa and carex appressa grown in stormwater biofilters suggesting the positive impacts of amf on plant growth could directly improve nitrogen phosphorus and cr removal from stormwater leading to a better performance of biofilters recently our study demonstrated that amf had positive impacts on ppcps removal in sand systems but insignificant effects in perlite vermiculite or biochar systems 16 suggesting that the type of substrate may influence the role of amf in ppcps removal however few studies have focused on the combined impacts of substrate and amf on the performance of cws for treating ppcps contaminated wastewater therefore the aims of this study were to 1 evaluate the impacts of amf on the purification of pollutants in cws and 2 investigate the influence of interaction between substrates and amf on ppcps containing wastewater purification in cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials glyceria maxima were selected as the wetland plant plant roots were surface sterilized according to the protocol described in our previous study 16 the selected amf inoculum was rhizophagus irregularis beg140 17 the representative ppcps including ibuprofen diclofenac triclocarban triclosan gemfirozil furosemide chloramphenicol and furosemide were selected and then mixed into the synthetic wastewater the composition of synthetic wastewater and the added concentration of ppcps are shown in supporting information si table s1 2 2 experimental design a total of 48 mesocosms were used in this study each mesocosm consisted of the following layers a 15 cm layer of gravel at the bottom a 20 cm layer of the selected substrate in the middle and a 15 cm layer of sand on top sand expanded perlite expanded vermiculite or biochar were individually filled in the middle layer to perform four cw systems with different substrates for each cw system 12 mesocosms were used fig 1 then divided into four mesocosm treatments in triplicates based on plant presence planted with or without g maxima and amf inoculation amf or amf treatments full details of the experimental setup are described in our previous study 16 a flood drain water condition were adopted in this study because of the positive effects of fluctuating water regimes on amf colonization 18 the frequency of flood drain water condition was 2 l 4 d same as our previous study 19 which provided a 2 h flood phase and a 94 h drain phase for the present study cw systems were operated in a natural environment with rain protection from june to november to avoid disturbances to system performance 2 3 sample analysis water samples from the influent and effluent of each cw systems were collected regularly every eight days to investigate the impacts of amf on the performance of cw for wastewater purification total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn nh4 n no2 n no3 n po4 3 p dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp ph and electrical conductance ec were measured according to the methods as described in our previous study 17 2 4 data analysis the removal efficiency of conventional wastewater parameters was calculated by mass balance as described in our previous study 17 the student s t test was used to compare the impacts of amf on wastewater purification p 0 05 was set as a significant difference two way analysis of variance anova was used to compare the difference in conventional wastewater parameters and the physicochemical parameters amf and substrate were set as the primary factors and amf substrate was set as the interaction effect the results of physicochemical parameters do ec ph and orp and conventional wastewater parameters toc po4 3 p nh4 n tn no3 n and no2 n were conducted by principal component analysis pca to examine the differences between sample groups r software version 4 0 5 was used for statistical analyses and data visualization in this study 3 results 3 1 physiochemical parameters in the cws the physicochemical parameters including do ec ph and orp in each system are shown in fig 2 the average concentration of do in cws with adsorptive systems perlite 5 7 mg l vermiculite 7 1 mg l and biochar 4 7 mg l was higher than that in sand systems 2 3 mg l meanwhile the concentrations of do in the sand perlite vermiculite and biochar systems under planted treatments were higher than those under unplanted treatments with an increase of 4 5 21 3 14 8 15 5 0 2 9 3 and 15 8 45 9 respectively conversely the value of ec in the sand perlite vermiculite and biochar systems under planted treatments were 10 8 15 2 11 2 16 9 9 6 10 6 and 3 9 6 0 lower than that under unplanted treatments respectively compared with unplanted treatments the ph value in planted treatments was lower in sand and vermiculite systems but higher in perlite and biochar systems adsorptive substrate enhanced do and ph but decreased ec compared with sand systems under the same treatments meanwhile substrate had significant effects on do ec and ph in cws under both plant treatments planted or unplanted p 0 01 table 1 amf showed significant effects on do in cws under planted treatments p 0 01 but an insignificant effect on physicochemical parameters in cws under unplanted treatments p 0 05 3 2 wastewater parameters 3 2 1 toc removal the removal efficiency of toc in different cws is shown in fig 3a toc removal in cws with the various substrates was in the following order biochar vermiculite perlite sand toc removal in cws with adsorptive substrate under both non planted and planted treatments were enhanced by 3 8 7 12 and 5 7 11 4 respectively compared to sand systems meanwhile amf showed more positive effects on toc removal in planted cws 1 4 3 0 than non planted cws 0 1 1 0 in addition substrate had significant effects on toc removal in cws p 0 01 and amf showed significant impacts on toc removal in planted cws p 0 01 table 1 3 2 2 po4 3 p removal the removal efficiency of po4 3 p in different cws is shown in fig 3b the removal efficiencies of po4 3 p in cws with different substrates were in the following order biochar vermiculite perlite sand po4 3 p removal in adsorptive substrate systems was 11 6 30 6 and 14 2 23 4 higher than that in sand systems with non planted and planted treatments respectively compared with amf treatments the removal efficiencies of po4 3 p under amf treatments were increased 0 2 5 0 in planted cws but decreased in non planted cws meanwhile g maxima significantly enhanced po4 3 p removal which the removal efficiencies of po4 3 p in planted cws were 9 2 16 4 and 7 5 20 4 higher than that in non planted cws with amf and amf treatments respectively substrate had significant effects on po4 3 p removal in cws p 0 01 and amf showed significant effects on po4 3 p removal in planted cws p 0 01 table 1 3 2 3 nitrogen removal nh4 n removal in the sand system was 66 5 82 4 while the removal efficiencies of nh4 n in cws with adsorptive substrate were 16 5 31 2 higher than that in the sand system fig 3c the removal efficiencies of nh4 n in cws with different substrates were in the following order perlite vermiculite biochar sand meanwhile nh4 n removal in planted systems were 0 5 15 0 and 0 8 15 7 higher than that in non planted cws with both amf and amf treatments respectively in addition amf played more critical roles in removing nh4 n in sand systems than others nh4 n removal in planted sand systems under amf treatments was 6 7 lower than that under amf treatments while insignificant difference on nh4 n removal were observed between amf and amf treatments in other substrate systems the removal efficiency of tn in different cws is shown in fig 3d the removal efficiencies of tn in cws with different substrates were in the following order biochar vermiculite perlite sand tn removal in adsorptive substrate systems was 6 2 34 6 and 14 1 22 7 higher than that in sand systems with non planted and planted treatments respectively meanwhile the removal efficiencies of tn in planted cws were 11 8 32 5 and 7 5 33 4 higher than that in non planted cws with amf and amf treatments respectively compared with amf treatments the removal efficiencies of tn in cws with amf treatments were increased by 2 4 4 6 and 0 2 3 6 in both planted and non planted treatments respectively substrate had significant effects on nh4 n and tn in cws p 0 01 and amf showed significant impacts on nh4 n removal p 0 05 but insignificant effects on tn removal p 0 05 in planted cws table 1 the composition of nitrogen sources in the influent was 20 9 for nh4 n 29 0 for no3 n 0 16 for no2 n and 49 9 for other nitrogen sources si fig s2 in the effluent of all substrate systems a significant decline was found for the composition of nh4 n 0 3 5 8 and other nitrogen sources 20 2 35 5 whereas the composition of no3 n rose up to 48 2 76 6 fig 4 moreover the composition of other nitrogen sources in non planted cws was 23 6 36 7 and about 3 4 7 5 lower than that in planted cws on the contrary the composition of no3 n in planted cws was 59 8 74 8 and increased by 6 3 8 4 more than that in non planted cws however the differences in nitrogen source utilization showed insignificant between amf and amf treatments in both planted and unplanted systems 3 3 correlation between physicochemical parameters and conventional wastewater parameters as shown in fig 5 the relations between physicochemical parameters and conventional wastewaters were significantly different among the four substrates cws in sand systems the first two components of pca explained 71 6 of the total data variability the first principal component dim1 had negative correlations with orp and toc but positively related to no3 n no2 n nh4 n tn po4 3 p and ec fig 5a in perlite systems dim1 explained 75 5 of the variability which had high positive correlations r 0 8 for toc orp do and ph and negative correlations r 0 8 for tn no3 n po4 3 p and ec fig 5b in vermiculite systems dim1 accounted for 53 9 of the variance and had positive correlations r 0 8 for no3 n tn no2 n p and ec while the second principal component dim2 explained 20 1 of the variability and showed positive correlations r 0 8 for do and orp fig 5c in biochar systems dim1 and dim2 represent 57 5 and 20 2 variability respectively nh4 n no2 n tn po4 3 p and ec were highly dependent upon each other r 0 75 while do orp ph and toc had negative correlations r 0 6 on dim1 fig 5d in addition the pca score of each system is shown in fig 6 a clear distinction between planted and unplanted treatments is based on separation along dim1 meanwhile the difference between amf and amf treatments can also be found in planted cws but insignificant in non planted cws 4 discussion 4 1 effects of vegetation and substrate on pollutant removal in this study vegetation g maxima plays a vital role in wastewater purification compared to the unplanted cws similar results were reported by chand et al 20 they found that cws with planted typha sp treatments showed a better removal performance of pollutants e g nh4 n p and sulfate than that with unplanted treatments wetland plants play an essential role in removing contaminants in cws which can assimilate pollutants directly into their tissues and enhance the environmental diversity in the rhizosphere to promote a variety of physical chemical and biological reactions for contaminant removal 21 the pca analyses also confirmed that the physicochemical and conventional wastewater parameters showed significant differences between planted and unplanted cws fig 6 dordio and carvalho 22 reported that plant presence facilitated the release of oxygen thus providing favorable conditions for the growth of microorganisms and promoting the aerobic biodegradation of pollutants in cws as shown in fig 2 cws with vegetation showed better do conditions than that without vegetation since the concentration of tp in the aqueous phase is negatively correlated with oxygen levels 23 the enhancement of oxygen conditions in planted cws may also contribute to p removal meanwhile the presence of g maxima increased the do concentration which may also promote the nitrification process 24 in addition plant roots can provide direct attachment sites for microbes and suitable environments for microbial development and metabolism in the rhizosphere 25 26 thus promoting the microbial metabolic processes of pollutants in cws cws filled with adsorptive substrate showed better performance for wastewater purification compared with sand systems toc nh4 n tn and po4 3 p removal in adsorptive substrate systems with both planted and unplanted treatments were increased by 3 8 11 4 16 5 31 4 6 2 34 6 and 11 6 30 6 respectively fig 3 the substrate selection significantly affects pollutant removal in cws 27 this result also accords with our recent observations indicating that cws filled with these three adsorptive substrates had a better removal performance for ppcps than sand 16 this could be that sand has a lower sorption capacity for contaminants than these three substrates 28 29 which could promote the retention of pollutants in cws meanwhile the surface morphology characterization of substrate indicated that there are few cracks on the relatively smooth surface of quartz sand while the surface of perlite vermiculite and biochar are rough porous and multi cracked si fig s1 it was found that substrate with higher pore volume or specific surface area generally has higher adsorption and removal performance for pollutants in cws 29 besides the porous structure of the substrate could be used as perfect bio carriers for microbial growth in cws which benefits biofilm formation and the reproduction of microbial communities thus enhancing the bioaccumulation and biodegradation of pollutants 24 liu et al 30 also demonstrated that the rapid and stable removal of contaminants in zeolite based tidal flow cws could be mainly due to the combined effect of the high adsorption capacity of the specific substrate during the flooded phase and the fast biodegradation during the drained phase of each tidal operation in addition the differences in physicochemical parameters among the four substrate systems may significantly impact pollutant removal fig 2 it was confirmed by the pca analyses indicating that the correlation between physicochemical parameters and conventional wastewater parameters was significantly different among the four substrate systems fig 5 previous studies proved that the physiochemical parameters e g do ph orp and ec could directly influence microbial abundance and species 24 31 thus affecting the ultimate performance of wastewater purification in this study the average concentrations of do in adsorptive substrate systems under unplanted treatments were significantly higher than those of sand systems under the same conditions fig 2a consequently there was a better aerobic condition in perlite vermiculite and biochar systems for nitrification aerobic denitrification and biodegradation meanwhile the higher dissolved oxygen may also contribute to phosphorus accumulation inside cw systems 23 similar results also reported by bai et al 32 they observed that porous substrates could enhance oxygen transport and facilitate the growth and reproduction of microorganisms thus resulting in bioaccumulation and biodegradation of more organic compounds 33 fu et al 24 also demonstrated that using substrates with porous structures such as activated carbon could improve the dissolved oxygen supply and enhance the removal efficiency of pollutants in cws 4 2 effects of amf on contaminants purification in cws amf inoculation significantly enhanced the removal of toc nh4 n and p from wastewater in planted cws indicating that amf might have an essential role in wastewater purification in cws the reason could be that amf promotes plant growth and reduces the adverse effects of ppcps stress 19 in this study g maxima with amf treatments showed better performance such as root length shoot height and biomass than that with amf treatments si table s2 which might provide more sites for the development of microorganisms and a high oxygen release rate thereby beneficial for the biodegradation of the pollutants in cws 34 similar results also suggested that biofilters planted with inoculated ficinia nodosa had 10 higher removal of tn and 5 higher removal of tp than the non inoculated controls 15 in addition the extraradical hyphae of amf might also contribute to pollutant removal by facilitating the efficient uptake of immobile nutrients by the host plant 6 11 by using isotopic labeling techniques previous studies identified direct evidence that am symbiosis could develop extra radical hyphae beyond the root hair zone to provide the mycorrhizal pathway for the acquisition of p and n 35 36 resulting in a more efficiently accumulation of p and n in inoculated plants moreover amf might also influence pollutant removal by modifying root exudates to stimulate microbial activity biochemical transformations and enhancement of mineralization in the rhizosphere 37 in a previous study corgie et al 38 found that amf glomus mosseae increased the density of phenanthrene degrading bacteria and the activity of dioxygenase transcription in the rhizosphere of ryegrass lolium perenne l 4 3 effects of interactions between substrates and amf on wastewater purification in cws the functional role of amf in wastewater purification may also be affected by substrate types the interaction effects between amf and substrate showed significant effects on nitrogen forms e g nh4 n no3 n and no2 n in cws table 1 a possible reason is that substrate types could affect the development of amf symbiosis which indirectly affects plant growth resulting in the variability of pollution removal in cws with a different substrate fig s3 our previous study investigated amf colonization in planted cws with a different substrate confirming that mycorrhizal status e g frequency of mycorrhiza intensity of mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule abundance in plant roots showed significant differences among cws filled with different substrates 19 it is worth noting that the effects of am symbiosis on nh4 n removal were significant in sand systems but insignificant in adsorptive substrate systems fig 3 the possible explanation is that the drain phase was too short only 2 h cycle in the present study pollutants cannot be eliminated quickly from the aqueous phase through microbial degradation or plant uptake in such a short retention time 39 consequently the dominant removal pathway of pollutants might be attributed to the adsorption processes of substrates and attached microbes in the present study in sand systems therefore the impacts of amf on promoting pollutants removal could be more relatively significant than in adsorptive substrate systems by contrast the porous structure of adsorptive substrates in cws with flood and drain exchange could provide a more critical role in pollutant removal fig 3 and plant growth 19 than am symbiosis the results of two way anova also confirmed that substrate showed more significant effects on physicochemical parameters and pollutant removal than amf in tidal flow cws table 1 5 conclusion adsorptive substrates perlite vermiculite and biochar amf and g maxima significantly increased the pollutants toc tn po4 3 p and nh4 n removal from wastewater in cws the application of adsorptive substrates in cws showed a more critical role in pollutant removal than amf inoculation our results indicated that plant presence and adsorptive substrate addition could improve the performance of cws in purifying wastewater am symbiosis might potentially enhance pollutant removal in cws based on this study further studies are needed to reveal the impacts of amf on pollutant metabolic pathways in cws including

12527,oil leakage has caused great damage to the marine aquatic environment cellulose aerogels can be used to separate oil water mixture but the low strength and recyclability have restricted its application in order to improve the performance of cellulose based aerogels hydrophobic and magnetic modification with ultrasound enhancement was carried out firstly hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin aerogel cl aerogel was synthesized by combining hydroxyethyl cellulose with lignin through sol gel method with freeze drying the incorporation of lignin endowed the aerogel with a 3d porous network and enhanced mechanical properties then cl aerogel was modified with n dodecyl mercaptan ndm and fe3o4 nps through ultrasound enhancement to obtain hmcl aerogel the results disclosed that with the increase in ndm usage and ultrasound time the hydrophobicity and magnetic responsiveness of aerogel was enhanced furthermore hmcl aerogel had good oil absorption capacity with high selectivity the hmcl aerogel could be easily recycled by an external magnetic field and could be reused through a simple extrusion treatment meanwhile the aerogel exhibited effective separation of oil water mixture with a flux as high as 2986 l m 2 h 1 even in corrosive conditions and maintained over 99 separation efficiency after 10 separation cycles therefore the hydrophobic and magnetic hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin aerogel could potentially serve as an intriguing candidate for practical oil polluted wastewater remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin aerogel hydrophobic modification magnetic responsiveness ultrasound enhancement oil water separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the ever growing development of the world economy and the gradual improvement of human living standards the demand for oil has increased rapidly and oil leakage frequently occurs in the process of transportation and exploitation which has caused great damage to the marine aquatic environment 1 2 therefore developing more advanced technologies to decrease oil pollution is urgently needed typically oil absorbing materials are frequently used to tackle oil spills owing to their quick and efficient absorption in water synthetic polymers such as polyurethane sponge expanded polystyrene etc have been used for oil absorption 3 however they can stay in the environment for a long time due to difficulty in degrading what s more their accumulation in the soil makes this problem more serious other efficient absorbents commonly used are carbon based materials such as carbon nanotube sponges cnt 4 graphene oxide aerogels 5 etc however the carbon based materials are not only too expensive for commercial use but also the fabrication process is complicated hence it is desirable to develop affordable oil absorbing materials for oil leakage cleanup with high absorption low cost good environmental compatibility and biodegradation aerogels have been widely used to handle oil spill pollution in recent years for the reasons of low density rich pore structure high surface area 6 7 in particular bio based aerogel has attracted extensive attention because of its abundance renewability recyclability and environmental friendliness among various types of biomass cellulose is the most abundant and widely distributed in nature 8 its hydroxyl group has good reactivity which can improve its oil selectivity by simple surface modification making it an ideal oil absorbing material so far various cellulose based materials have been successfully synthesized in different routes 9 12 cellulose based material especially cellulose nanocrystals and nanofibrilled cellulose have been extensively investigated in the field of oil water separation 13 14 cellulose molecular chains are prone to form intra and inter chain hydrogen bonds which make cellulose insoluble in water and thus its profit value will be severely limited hydroxyethyl cellulose hec is one of the leading soluble cellulose derivatives and is widely applied in several utilizations due to its high biocompatibility and low toxicity 15 16 the chemical composition of hec will allow to be occupied large amount of relatively easily accessible hydroxyl units that can be attached by a number of functional groups however hec based aerogels also have the common shortage of weak mechanical properties and low recyclability which have restricted industrial scale application the mechanical properties of hec based composites can be enhanced by adding hard phases such as cnf cnc and inorganic nanomaterials 17 19 lignin as the most abundant aromatic biopolymer in the world and plays an important role in reducing the permeability of water through plant cell walls for its hydrophobicity 20 21 as a by product of the paper making and bioethanol industry lignin is accumulated in large quantities or directly incinerated which leads to environmental pollution and waste of resources 22 23 in order to find the efficient use of lignin some researchers started to seek the application of lignin in aerogels 24 25 as a biopolymer with a three dimensional network structure and containing a large number of hydroxyl groups lignin is easily reacted with other material to enhance the mechanical property 26 therefore to improve the oil water separation performance of biopolymer based aerogels we proposed a facile strategy for the preparation of hydrophobic and magnetic hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin composite aerogel in this paper in this process the addition of lignin endowed the composite aerogel with a three dimensional porous network and simultaneously enhanced its mechanical properties moreover the incorporation of fe3o4 nps made the aerogel more hydrophobic and magnetically responsive so that it could be quickly collected by the magnet after the oil water separation moreover the effect of ndm usage and ultrasound time on the hydrophobicity and magnetic responsiveness of the hmcl aerogel were investigated this work not only promotes the high value utilization of lignin but also provides a promising new idea for oil containing wastewater disposal and water remediation it is also expected that this work could provide experimental basis and guideline for the subsequent large scale practical application of lignin in biomass hydrogel aerogel in oil spill cleanup 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials alkali lignin weight average molecule weight 4500 da polydispersity degree 2 20 were purchased from hunan xiangjiang

prepared cl aerogel was immersed in a mixture of ultrasonically dispersed n dodecyl mercaptan and an aqueous solution of dopamine hydrochloride containing fe3o4 nps sonicated for a period of time and then freeze dried a polydopamine pda coating was introduced in the process of constructing a hydrophobic material for oil water separation the reason is that the fascinating adhesion properties of pda with catechol groups could adhere n dodecyl mercaptan ndm and fe3o4 nps onto the surface of cl aerogel via the self polymerization of dopamine 27 furthermore the introduction of fe3o4 nps could increase the surface roughness and endow the cl aerogel with magnetic property in this paper the effect of ultrasound time on the performance of hmcl aerogel was investigated the samples with different ultrasound time of 10 20 30 40 50 min were marked as hmcl 10 aerogel hmcl 20 aerogel hmcl 30 aerogel hmcl 40 aerogel and hmcl 50 aerogel respectively the preparation of hcl aerogel was just the same as that of hmcl aerogel except for the addition of fe3o4 in the preparation process the effect of ndm usage on the performance of hcl aerogel was investigated the samples treated with different ndm usage of 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 ml were marked as hcl 0 1 aerogel hcl 0 2 aerogel hcl 0 3 aerogel hcl 0 4 aerogel and hcl 0 5 aerogel respectively in the preparation of hmcl aerogel and hcl aerogel the usage of hec and al was fixed at 0 15 g and 0 40 g respectively 3 2 structural characterization of the composite aerogels to illustrate the structure of the aerogels the cl aerogel hcl 0 4 aerogel hmcl 40 aerogel and c aerogel were selected as the representative samples in this section they were marked as cl aerogel hcl aerogel hmcl aerogel and c aerogel respectively 3 2 1 sem test scanning electron microscopy sem was employed to investigate the morphologies of aerogels as shown in fig 2a and fig 2b the c aerogel exhibited sheet like structure and smooth surface after the incorporation of lignin the cl aerogel had interconnected honeycomb like pore structures with the pore size of 200 500 μm from the inset digital pictures presented in fig 2a and c the color of the synthesized c aerogel was white while the color of the cl aerogel changed to dark brown which originated from the color of lignin in addition using the same mold the final freeze dried c aerogel had a sheet like structure while the cl aerogel showed a regular cubic structure without any collapse this was due to the low mechanical strength of c hydrogel which caused a certain degree of collapse after freeze drying and it was difficult to form a self standing 3d structure meanwhile the introduction of lignin could form regular shaped aerogels easily to enhance the hydrophobicity the cl aerogel was first immersed in an aqueous solution of dopamine then ndm was conjugated with pda through michael addition reaction 28 29 from the sem image of hcl aerogel shown in fig s1 it still maintained a porous structure after hydrophobic modification it was worth noting that the hydrophobic modification has no obvious effect on the original porous structure of the cl aerogel from the high magnification sem images presented in fig 2e it was clearly shown that fe3o4 nps were densely covered on the surface of the hmcl aerogel it could be seen from fig 2f that the interior of the hmcl aerogel also contained fe3o4 nps these fe3o4 nps 20 nm adhered tightly to the cl aerogel not only due to the strong adhesion of pda but also could be attributed to the hydrogen bonding interaction between fe3o4 and hydroxyl groups in hydroxyethyl cellulose 30 31 3 2 2 eds spectrum the eds spectrum and the content of different elements in hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel were shown in fig s2a and fig s2b respectively the s element originated from ndm and n cl elements came from dopamine hydrochloride and fe element came from fe3o4 respectively moreover the chemical composition and element distribution of hmcl aerogel were further investigated by edx elemental mapping fig s2c it was shown that six kinds of elements including c o n s cl and fe were uniformly distributed on the surface of hmcl aerogel comparing the edx results of the hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel table s1 the weight percentage of the grafted fe was 20 92 indicating that the surface of hmcl aerogel was successfully decorated with fe3o4 nps during the modification process in addition n element was not detected in the eds spectrum of hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel mainly due to the very low content in the composite aerogels 3 2 3 ftir spectrum the ftir spectra of hec al cl aerogel were depicted in fig s3 for hec the peaks at 3441 cm 1 assigned to the stretching of hydroxyl oh and the peaks at 1023 cm 1 referred to c o c stretching for al it could be seen that several characteristic peaks were located at 3441 cm 1 1604 cm 1 1515 cm 1 corresponding to oh c o benzene ring cc stretching vibration respectively 32 the absorption peak intensity of cl aerogel at 3441 cm 1 oh stretching vibration was weaker than that of hec and al which indicated that a cross linking reaction occurred between hydroxyethyl cellulose and lignin 33 another direct evidence of the cross linking reaction was the presence of aromatic ethers and fatty ethers in the cl aerogel spectrum there was an increase in the vibration absorption peaks of aryl ethers and alkyl ethers were at 1269 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 c o c stretching vibration and 1063 cm 1 co stretch from alkyl substituted ether respectively the characteristic peaks at 1269 cm 1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the c o c in phenolic ether bonds the band at 1123 cm 1 to the deformation vibration of ether linkages while the band at 1063 cm 1 was caused by primary and aliphatic ethers 34 the characteristic peaks of cl aerogel spectrum at 2875 cm 1 and 2928 cm 1 further confirmed the cross linking reaction between hec and al the spectrum of cl aerogel hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel all showed the key characteristic peaks of both substances proving the presence of al and hec in the matrix as shown in fig 3a for hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel the peaks at about 2927 cm 1 and 2853 cm 1 corresponded to ch stretching vibrations of methyl ch3 and methylene groups ch2 35 the intensity of the characteristic peaks in hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel were obviously higher than those of cl aerogel proving the presence of ndm the peaks at 1260 and 1598 cm 1 assigned to nh stretching vibrations and cc of aromatic ring stretching vibrations respectively which were the characteristic absorption peaks of pda the characteristic peaks appearing at 1463 and 716 cm 1 were attributed to cs stretching vibrations of reaction product s ch2 between ndm and pda after modification 29 indicating that the ndm and pda were introduced onto the surface of hcl aerogel moreover in the spectrum of hmcl aerogel the characteristic peaks appeared at 630 cm 1 and 580 cm 1 were the stretching vibration feo present in fe3o4 nps 36 the result implied that hmcl aerogel was modified by ndm and fe3o4 nps 3 2 4 xrd spectrum xrd was utilized to analyze the phase structure of the samples xrd patterns of c aerogel cl aerogel hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel were shown in fig 3b it could be seen that the xrd spectrum of the c aerogel only showed a single peak around at 2θ 20 2 indicating the semi crystalline structure of hec 37 the diffraction peaks of other composite aerogels were wider than that of c aerogel which demonstrated that the crystal structures of those composite aerogels were more amorphous 38 the xrd spectrum revealed that the addition of lignin increased the amorphous nature of composite aerogels besides there were six distinct diffraction peaks at 30 0 35 4 43 2 53 6 57 3 and 62 6 in hmcl aerogel which were assigned to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 crystal planes of fe3o4 jcpds card 19 0629 respectively 39 40 this result further confirmed the presence of fe3o4 in the hmcl aerogel and had no obvious effect on the structure of aerogel 3 2 5 thermal stability the thermal stability of the composite aerogels was evaluated by tga the tga and dtg curves for hec al c aerogel cl aerogel were displayed in fig 3c and fig 3d compared with hec al began to decompose at a lower temperature 175 c and had a higher maximum degradation temperature 386 c after the introduction of lignin the cl aerogel had a higher initial decomposition temperature about 244 c and higher residual content 40 8 at 900 c the main corresponding weight loss was about 43 which was significantly lower than that of c aerogel demonstrating that the incorporation of lignin improved the thermal stability of cl aerogel 3 2 6 xps spectrum furthermore xps was executed to characterize the surface chemical compositions of the aerogels as shown in the full xps spectrum of c aerogel cl aerogel hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel fig 3e the binding energy at 284 ev 400 ev 532 ev 163 ev and 711 ev were ascribed to the species of c 1s n 1s o 1s s 2p and fe 2p respectively the result also indicated that the elements of c n o and s coexisted in hcl aerogel whereas only c and o presented in cl aerogel the n 1s signal at 400 1 ev and the s 2p signal at 163 2 ev were detected on the surface of the hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel this was mainly due to the introduction of pda and ndm in the hydrophobic modification process thereby introducing n and s for the hmcl aerogel there were extra doublet peaks displayed with the binding energies of 710 7 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 2 ev fe 2p1 2 fig 3f which corresponded to the fe 2p peaks for fe3o4 40 41 confirming the presence of fe3o4 nps in the hmcl aerogel therefore the xps result is consistent with the obtained xrd result indicating the existence of fe3o4 s and fe element in cl aerogel hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel were analyzed by xps measurements and the surface element contents were listed in table s2 it could be found that the s element content on the surface of cl aerogel was 0 74 which was introduced in the pulping process the characteristic absorption peak of fe did not appear on the surface of cl aerogel the hmcl aerogel showed the characteristic absorption peak of fe 2p and the surface fe content was 3 58 which further indicated that the fe3o4 nanoparticles were successfully loaded onto the aerogel in hcl aerogel the s element content on the surface was increased from 0 74 to 1 87 which also verified the successful hydrophobic modification with ndm 3 3 hydrophobic modification of cl aerogel 3 3 1 the compression strength of hcl aerogel the mechanical performances of aerogels were characterized by compression tests and the stress strain curves were illustrated in fig 4a the cl aerogel presented about 17 50 kpa of compressive stress at 80 strain and this value was higher than that of c aerogel 7 60 kpa the result proved that the addition of lignin improved the mechanical property of the c aerogel what s more after hydrophobic modification the compression stress of hcl aerogel increased obviously presenting about 54 26 kpa at 80 strain indicating that the fabrication by ndm helped improving the mechanical strength of the aerogel moreover the high compressive stress facilitates the integrity maintenance in practical applications 3 3 2 effect of the usage of ndm on the apparent density of hcl aerogel the apparent density of the prepared hcl aerogel was shown in fig 4b and table s3 compared with the density of the cl aerogel 0 0282 g cm3 the apparent density of all hcl aerogels increased which was due to the shrinkage of the pore size after being immersed in ndm and freeze dried again during the modification process this resulted in a decrease in the apparent volume of the modified aerogel despite this the hcl aerogel could still be supported by a dry grass inset in fig 4b the results showed that the apparent density of hcl aerogels with different ndm usage did not show obvious regularity distributed in the range of 0 0443 g cm3 to 0 0718 g cm3 3 3 3 effect of the usage of ndm on the wettability of hcl aerogel the wettability of hcl aerogel was studied by contact angle measurement as depicted in fig 5a the water contact angle of hlc aerogel increased with the increase of the usage of ndm when the amount of ndm increased from 0 1 ml to 0 5 ml the water contact angle of the porous material increased the contact angle increased from 86 42 to 111 18 which was due to the fact that the grafted ndm reduced the surface energy of the aerogel thereby increasing the water contact angle meanwhile the water contact angle of cl aerogel gradually decreased from 36 27 to 0 within 3 s fig s5 which was ascribed to the abundant of hydrophilic oxygen containing groups of the hec and al the results indicated that the grafting of ndm had changed the aerogel from strong hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity the water contact angle of hcl aerogel as a function of time was shown in fig 5b it could be seen that water droplet still could not be absorbed by the aerogel within 30 s which further indicated that the hcl aerogel had good hydrophobicity 3 3 4 effect of the usage of ndm on the oil adsorption capacity of hcl aerogel in order to clarify the effect of ndm usage on the oil adsorption capacity of hcl aerogel the oil adsorption tests were conducted and the amount of oil blended oil absorbed by hcl aerogel was listed in table s4 it could be seen from the table s4 that the difference in the hydrophobicity of hcl aerogel had no obvious regularity in the influence of the absorption of pure oil the difference in hydrophobicity mainly affected the mechanical strength of the aerogel the absorption of blended oil by different hcl aerogels was distributed between 20 70 g g and 25 91 g g indicating that the hydrophobically modified aerogels had good oil absorption capacity from the above studies it could be seen that hcl 0 4 aerogel had better oil absorption capacity and hydrophobicity therefore this sample was used to test the recyclability of hcl aerogel and the results were shown in fig s4 the original mass of hcl 0 4 aerogel was 0 085 mg the mass after the first saturated oil absorption was 2 112 g the mass after the second saturated oil absorption decreased to 1 750 g and that after the fifth saturated oil absorption was 1 685 g the results suggested that the pore structure was slightly damaged by the oil discharge via extrusion however the hydrophobic aerogel could still maintain a good absorption effect within five absorption and extrusion cycles 3 3 5 oil water separation performance of hcl aerogel to further investigate the oil water separation performance of hcl aerogel the oil water separation experimental process of cl aerogel and hcl aerogel was displayed in fig 6a blended oil was dyed with sudan red iii dripped on the surface of water to form an oil water mixture and the aerogel was placed in it to test the oil water separation ability within 30 s fig 6ai was a diagram of the oil water separation process of cl aerogel it could be found that compared with hcl aerogel due to the stronger hydrophilicity cl aerogel could selectively absorb water in the oil water mixture no oil absorption could be observed and the oil still floated on the water after 30 s fig 6aii presented the oil water separation process diagram of five hcl aerogel samples it could be clearly found that hcl 0 3 aerogel hcl 0 4 aerogel and hcl 0 5 aerogel had good oil water separation effect and almost no red oil could be observed on the water surface after 30 s for hcl 0 1 aerogel and hcl 0 2 aerogel oil droplets could also be observed to be absorbed but after 30 s a little red oil stains could still be found floating on the water surface in the case of hcl 0 1 aerogel and hcl 0 2 aerogel in order to test the oil water separation ability of the hydrophobically modified aerogel in the seawater environment simulated oily seawater was prepared by 10 ml of nacl solution 3 5 w v and 0 2 ml of blended oil dyed with sudan iii the oil water separation and recycling performance of hcl 0 4 aerogel in the simulated oily seawater were tested and the results were shown in fig 6b as illustrated in fig 6b hydrophobic modified aerogel can still maintain good oil water separation performance and recyclability in seawater environment oil could still be selectively absorbed after three cycles of separation however in the fourth cycle the structure was damaged due to repeated use resulting in weaker oil water separation effect 3 4 hydrophobic and magnetic modification of cl aerogel 3 4 1 effect of ultrasonic time on the magnetic responsiveness performance of hmcl aerogel in this section the ndm usage was fixed at 0 4 ml the magnetic hysteresis loops of hmcl aerogel measured at room temperature at different ultrasonic times were shown in fig 7a it could be clearly seen that with the increase of ultrasonic time the magnetization of hmcl aerogel increased which indicated that the longer the ultrasonic time was the more fe3o4 nanoparticles are loaded in the aerogel although the saturated magnetization of hmcl aerogel was much lower than that of nano fe3o4 particles fig s6 it was still stronger than most magnetic aerogels reported in previous research 42 43 what s more the magnetic responsiveness of all hmcl aerogels was strong as shown in fig 7b which were easy to be recycled by the magnet it could also be seen that almost no hysteresis loop was found in the magnetization curve indicating the superparamagnetic characteristic of hmcl aerogels 44 45 the hmcl 40 aerogel was selected to study the magnetic responsiveness after oil absorption fig 7c showed the process of being attracted by a magnet after hmcl 40 aerogel saturated absorption of five pure oils vacuum pump oil blended oil liquid paraffin ethyl acetate and petroleum ether fig 7d displayed the process of hmcl 40 aerogel saturated by blended oil stained with sudan iii in the oil water mixture and then being attracted by a magnet from the experimental results it could be found that after hydrophobic and magnetic modification hmcl aerogel still has excellent magnetic responsiveness in the oil water mixture environment and can be recovered easily by the magnet after saturated adsorption video s1 the hmcl 40 aerogel was selected to study the magnetic responsiveness after oil absorption fig 7c showed the process of being attracted by a magnet after hmcl 40 aerogel saturated absorption of five pure oils vacuum pump oil blended oil liquid paraffin ethyl acetate and petroleum ether fig 7d displayed the process of hmcl 40 aerogel saturated by blended oil stained with sudan iii in the oil water mixture and then being attracted by a magnet from the experimental results it could be found that after hydrophobic and magnetic modification hmcl aerogel still has excellent magnetic responsiveness in the oil water mixture environment and can be recovered easily by the magnet after saturated adsorption video s1 3 4 2 effect of ultrasonic time on the apparent density of hmcl aerogel the apparent density of hmcl aerogel treated with different ultrasound time was shown in fig 8 from the fig 8 the apparent density of hmcl aerogel increased with the increase of ultrasonic time because the increase of ultrasonic time was beneficial to the loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles resulting in the increase of apparent density of hmcl aerogel despite the loading of fe3o4 nps the hmcl aerogel could still be supported by a dry grass inset in fig 8 3 4 3 effect of ultrasonic time on the wettability of hmcl aerogel the variation of the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel in air as a function of ultrasonic time was exhibited in fig 9a it can be seen from the figure that the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel increased with the increase of ultrasonic time which were 92 15 109 92 118 79 127 32 and 131 98 respectively video s2 this result further indicated that with the increase of ultrasonic time the fe3o4 nps loaded on the hmcl aerogel increased which made the surface of the aerogel rougher combined with the co effect of the hydrophobic modifier ndm the hydrophobicity of the hmcl aerogel was further enhanced as a result the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel as a function of time was further investigated and the results were shown in fig 9b it could be seen from the figure that a drop of water still could not be absorbed by hmcl aerogel within 30 s which further indicated that hmcl aerogel had excellent hydrophobicity the variation of the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel in air as a function of ultrasonic time was exhibited in fig 9a it can be seen from the figure that the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel increased with the increase of ultrasonic time which were 92 15 109 92 118 79 127 32 and 131 98 respectively video s2 this result further indicated that with the increase of ultrasonic time the fe3o4 nps loaded on the hmcl aerogel increased which made the surface of the aerogel rougher combined with the co effect of the hydrophobic modifier ndm the hydrophobicity of the hmcl aerogel was further enhanced as a result the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel as a function of time was further investigated and the results were shown in fig 9b it could be seen from the figure that a drop of water still could not be absorbed by hmcl aerogel within 30 s which further indicated that hmcl aerogel had excellent hydrophobicity 3 5 oil absorption capacity of hmcl aerogel in this section the hmcl 40 aerogel was used to illustrate the oil adsorption performance of hmcl aerogel due to its specific hydrophobicity and magnetic responsivity the rapid oil removal process of the hmcl aerogel is revealed in fig s7 arising from its the aerogel was driven by an external magnet and quickly absorbed the dyed blended oil floating on the water surface leaving clean water fig s7a video s3 furthermore the aerogel also could selectively absorb the oil droplets instead of water instantaneously once it came into contact with the sunken heavy oil dyed trichloromethane fig s7b video s4 therefore these phenomena suggested that the as synthesized hmcl aerogel exhibited excellent selective sorption of oil from water due to its specific hydrophobicity and magnetic responsivity the rapid oil removal process of the hmcl aerogel is revealed in fig s7 arising from its the aerogel was driven by an external magnet and quickly absorbed the dyed blended oil floating on the water surface leaving clean water fig s7a video s3 furthermore the aerogel also could selectively absorb the oil droplets instead of water instantaneously once it came into contact with the sunken heavy oil dyed trichloromethane fig s7b video s4 therefore these phenomena suggested that the as synthesized hmcl aerogel exhibited excellent selective sorption of oil from water in order to further investigate the adsorption capacity of hmcl aerogel seven kinds of representative oils were used in this experiment including petroleum ether ethyl acetate liquid paraffin blended oil vacuum pump oil dichloromethane and trichloromethane due to the different densities and viscosities of oils the saturated absorption capacity of porous aerogels toward different types of oil varies as can be seen from fig 10 hmcl aerogels exhibited significantly improved adsorption capacity for seven kinds of representative oils compared with c aerogel the adsorption capacity of c aerogel ranged from 6 38 to 10 42 g g for the seven kinds of oils after the addition of lignin hydrophobic and magnetic modification the absorption ability of hmcl aerogel for the different oils were in the range of 18 92 32 11 g g just about three times of that of c aerogel more importantly the hydrophobic and magnetic modification had improved the recyclability of hmcl aerogel made it easier to be recovered by a magnet even after adsorbing oils a comparison of oil absorption performance with other magnetic aerogel materials reported in previous studies was listed in table 1 compared with other magnetic aerogel materials the hmcl aerogel prepared in this work not only had a relatively better oil absorption performance but were also cost effective therefore these results suggest that the as synthesized hmcl aerogel is a very intriguing oil absorbing material for practical oily wastewater treatment 3 6 oil desorption capacity and recyclability of hmcl aerogel the recyclability and reusability of the as prepared aerogels are two key considerations once applied to practical water treatment the recyclability of the composite aerogels can be achieved by simple mechanical squeezing to remove the absorbed oils in particular the composite aerogel could be recovered after removing the weight fig s8 showing excellent elasticity the introduction of alkali lignin could help to obtain composite aerogel with strong mechanical strength and better resilience which is beneficial to oil storage and improve reusability the repeated cycling tests were conducted for the magnetic porous hmcl aerogel through mechanical squeezing fig 11a the cyclic absorption squeezing test result indicated that the adsorption ability of hmcl aerogel still maintains 90 after 5 cycles the reduced adsorption capacity may be due to the presence of residual oils in the aerogel which cannot be completely removed by direct mechanical squeezing for its high viscosity furthermore the cyclic absorption experiment of hmcl aerogel in simulated oily seawater was further investigated and the results were shown in fig 11b after four cycles the adsorption capacity was only reduced by 9 79 it could be concluded from the experimental results that the aerogel also can maintain stable oil water adsorption performance and excellent recyclability in seawater environment in all the hmcl aerogel displayed remarkable oil water adsorption performance and superior recyclability in hazardous environment 3 7 oil water separation performance of hmcl aerogel the oil water separation tests of the hmcl aerogel were also systematically evaluated in fig 12 the as prepared hmcl aerogel was mounted between two glass tubes and 20 ml mixture of dichloromethane water 1 1 v v was poured into the glass tube the dyed oil could rapidly pass through the porous aerogel driven by gravity while water was blocked and retained on the upper separated glass due to the hydrophobic surfaces in addition as can be seen from the digital photograph after oil water separation test the filtered water was wholly transparent and there were no visible oil droplets fig 12c the hmcl aerogel could separate dichloromethane water mixture within 60 s and the separation flux was high to 2986 l m 2 h 1 video s5 however actual oily wastewater usually contains strong acid strong alkali or high salt which may be corrosive to the hmcl aerogel therefore the oil water separation experiments were also performed in corrosive conditions fig 12d showed the separation flux and separation efficiency of dichloromethane and water corrosive solutions 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl the composite aerogel maintained the separation flux of 2856 m 2 h 1 2879 l m 2 h 1 and 2925 l m 2 h 1 in 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl solution fig s9 meanwhile the separation efficiency of dichloromethane and water corrosive solutions were all over 99 demonstrating that the composite aerogel could resist harsh environment and displayed excellent separation stability moreover cyclic separation experiment of dichloromethane deionized water mixture was used to evaluate the recyclability of the hmcl aerogel after each separation cycle the contaminated aerogel was soaked in ethanol to remove the absorbed oil and dried at 50 c for 12 h for the next cycle as depicted in fig 12e after 10 consecutive separation cycles the separation efficiency of hmcl aerogel for dichloromethane deionized water remained above 99 therefore the results indicated that the as obtained hmcl aerogel had excellent oil water separating property and good reusability the hmcl aerogel could separate dichloromethane water mixture within 60 s and the separation flux was high to 2986 l m 2 h 1 video s5 however actual oily wastewater usually contains strong acid strong alkali or high salt which may be corrosive to the hmcl aerogel therefore the oil water separation experiments were also performed in corrosive conditions fig 12d showed the separation flux and separation efficiency of dichloromethane and water corrosive solutions 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl the composite aerogel maintained the separation flux of 2856 m 2 h 1 2879 l m 2 h 1 and 2925 l m 2 h 1 in 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl solution fig s9 meanwhile the separation efficiency of dichloromethane and water corrosive solutions were all over 99 demonstrating that the composite aerogel could resist harsh environment and displayed excellent separation stability moreover cyclic separation experiment of dichloromethane deionized water mixture was used to evaluate the recyclability of the hmcl aerogel after each separation cycle the contaminated aerogel was soaked in ethanol to remove the absorbed oil and dried at 50 c for 12 h for the next cycle as depicted in fig 12e after 10 consecutive separation cycles the separation efficiency of hmcl aerogel for dichloromethane deionized water remained above 99 therefore the results indicated that the as obtained hmcl aerogel had excellent oil water separating property and good reusability to further study the oil water separation performance of the porous hmcl aerogel we also prepared span80 stabilized oil in water emulsion cyclohexane as the oil phase through vigorously mixing oil and water in 1 10 v v with the addition of 0 1 wt span 80 from the optical image and size distribution of oil droplets it is can be clearly observed a large number of oil droplets average size 67 55 μm were dispersed in the o w emulsion before filtration fig 12f after the filtration without any oil droplets could be observed in the optical microscopy image different from the pristine milky white emulsion the collected filtrate became transparent indicating successful removal of cyclohexane from water the excellent separation performance of hmcl aerogel on oil in water emulsion can be attributed to the surface rough microstructure when the o w emulsion was poured onto the aerogel the emulsified droplets first contacted with the high density fe3o4 nps on the surface of the aerogel to achieve demulsification owing to the hydrophobic lipophilic property the micro oil droplets continuously passed through the aerogel while the water phase was repelled and thus achieving o w emulsion separation consistent with the separation results of oil water mixture presented by the hmcl aerogel the porous aerogel also has a good separation performance on o w emulsion 4 conclusions in summary hydrophobic magnetic hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin composite aerogels were successfully prepared by a facile approach owing to the introduction of lignin cl aerogel exhibited highly porous structure increasing the ndm usage and ultrasound time could effectively increase the hydrophobicity and magnetic responsiveness of the aerogel the fabricated hmcl aerogel showed fairly high absorption capacity 18 92 32 11 g g toward varieties of oils furthermore it could be quickly recovered by a magnet after saturation adsorption and be reused by simple mechanical squeezing for several times in addition the obtained hmcl aerogel also displayed high separation flux of 2986 l m 2 h 1 for oil water separation and maintained high flux and separation efficiency 99 even in corrosive conditions including acidic alkaline or salty environments the outstanding performance and simple preparation method could make the hmcl aerogel to be a promising candidate for oily sewage treatment and seawater oil spill decontamination moreover this work will also broaden the application field of lignin although we have designed cellulose lignin aerogels for the oil water separation we still did not carry out the research on the large scale oily wastewater treatment in the future work we will mainly focus on the scale up preparation of cellulose lignin aerogels and the performance of large scale oily wastewater treatment abbreviations c aerogel hydroxyethyl cellulose aerogel cl

12527,oil leakage has caused great damage to the marine aquatic environment cellulose aerogels can be used to separate oil water mixture but the low strength and recyclability have restricted its application in order to improve the performance of cellulose based aerogels hydrophobic and magnetic modification with ultrasound enhancement was carried out firstly hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin aerogel cl aerogel was synthesized by combining hydroxyethyl cellulose with lignin through sol gel method with freeze drying the incorporation of lignin endowed the aerogel with a 3d porous network and enhanced mechanical properties then cl aerogel was modified with n dodecyl mercaptan ndm and fe3o4 nps through ultrasound enhancement to obtain hmcl aerogel the results disclosed that with the increase in ndm usage and ultrasound time the hydrophobicity and magnetic responsiveness of aerogel was enhanced furthermore hmcl aerogel had good oil absorption capacity with high selectivity the hmcl aerogel could be easily recycled by an external magnetic field and could be reused through a simple extrusion treatment meanwhile the aerogel exhibited effective separation of oil water mixture with a flux as high as 2986 l m 2 h 1 even in corrosive conditions and maintained over 99 separation efficiency after 10 separation cycles therefore the hydrophobic and magnetic hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin aerogel could potentially serve as an intriguing candidate for practical oil polluted wastewater remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin aerogel hydrophobic modification magnetic responsiveness ultrasound enhancement oil water separation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the ever growing development of the world economy and the gradual improvement of human living standards the demand for oil has increased rapidly and oil leakage frequently occurs in the process of transportation and exploitation which has caused great damage to the marine aquatic environment 1 2 therefore developing more advanced technologies to decrease oil pollution is urgently needed typically oil absorbing materials are frequently used to tackle oil spills owing to their quick and efficient absorption in water synthetic polymers such as polyurethane sponge expanded polystyrene etc have been used for oil absorption 3 however they can stay in the environment for a long time due to difficulty in degrading what s more their accumulation in the soil makes this problem more serious other efficient absorbents commonly used are carbon based materials such as carbon nanotube sponges cnt 4 graphene oxide aerogels 5 etc however the carbon based materials are not only too expensive for commercial use but also the fabrication process is complicated hence it is desirable to develop affordable oil absorbing materials for oil leakage cleanup with high absorption low cost good environmental compatibility and biodegradation aerogels have been widely used to handle oil spill pollution in recent years for the reasons of low density rich pore structure high surface area 6 7 in particular bio based aerogel has attracted extensive attention because of its abundance renewability recyclability and environmental friendliness among various types of biomass cellulose is the most abundant and widely distributed in nature 8 its hydroxyl group has good reactivity which can improve its oil selectivity by simple surface modification making it an ideal oil absorbing material so far various cellulose based materials have been successfully synthesized in different routes 9 12 cellulose based material especially cellulose nanocrystals and nanofibrilled cellulose have been extensively investigated in the field of oil water separation 13 14 cellulose molecular chains are prone to form intra and inter chain hydrogen bonds which make cellulose insoluble in water and thus its profit value will be severely limited hydroxyethyl cellulose hec is one of the leading soluble cellulose derivatives and is widely applied in several utilizations due to its high biocompatibility and low toxicity 15 16 the chemical composition of hec will allow to be occupied large amount of relatively easily accessible hydroxyl units that can be attached by a number of functional groups however hec based aerogels also have the common shortage of weak mechanical properties and low recyclability which have restricted industrial scale application the mechanical properties of hec based composites can be enhanced by adding hard phases such as cnf cnc and inorganic nanomaterials 17 19 lignin as the most abundant aromatic biopolymer in the world and plays an important role in reducing the permeability of water through plant cell walls for its hydrophobicity 20 21 as a by product of the paper making and bioethanol industry lignin is accumulated in large quantities or directly incinerated which leads to environmental pollution and waste of resources 22 23 in order to find the efficient use of lignin some researchers started to seek the application of lignin in aerogels 24 25 as a biopolymer with a three dimensional network structure and containing a large number of hydroxyl groups lignin is easily reacted with other material to enhance the mechanical property 26 therefore to improve the oil water separation performance of biopolymer based aerogels we proposed a facile strategy for the preparation of hydrophobic and magnetic hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin composite aerogel in this paper in this process the addition of lignin endowed the composite aerogel with a three dimensional porous network and simultaneously enhanced its mechanical properties moreover the incorporation of fe3o4 nps made the aerogel more hydrophobic and magnetically responsive so that it could be quickly collected by the magnet after the oil water separation moreover the effect of ndm usage and ultrasound time on the hydrophobicity and magnetic responsiveness of the hmcl aerogel were investigated this work not only promotes the high value utilization of lignin but also provides a promising new idea for oil containing wastewater disposal and water remediation it is also expected that this work could provide experimental basis and guideline for the subsequent large scale practical application of lignin in biomass hydrogel aerogel in oil spill cleanup 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials alkali lignin weight average molecule weight 4500 da polydispersity degree 2 20 were purchased from hunan xiangjiang

naoh 95 and sodium chloride nacl 99 5 were purchased from guangzhou chemical reagent factory guangzhou china 2 2 preparation methods hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin composite aerogel cl aerogel was prepared via a simple chemical cross linking reaction typically hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin solution was prepared by dissolving 0 15 g hydroxyethyl cellulose hec and 0 40 g alkali lignin al in 10 ml naoh 10 w v solution and stirring vigorously for 6 h at room temperature to form a homogeneous suspension subsequently 0 6 ml epichlorohydrin ech was added to the above solution and stirred vigorously the resulting mixture was slowly poured into a mold and the cross linking reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h and then the hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin hydrogel was prepared the obtained hydrogel were soaked in ethanol for 12 h at room temperature first and then in distilled water for two days to remove unreacted cross linker and reactants completely finally the prepared hydrogels were freeze dried in a lyophilizer for 48 h to obtain the porous cl aerogel for comparison c aerogel was prepared by the same experimental method as above without adding lignin to fabricate hydrophobic magnetic hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin aerogel hmcl aerogel certain amount of n dodecyl mercaptan ndm was dispersed in 10 ml ethanol water solution 1 1 v v and 50 mg of fe3o4 nps were added to 10 ml dopamine hydrochloride solution the two solutions were blended to form a mixture solution and then the previously prepared cl aerogel was immersed in the above mixture under ultrasonic dispersion for certain time after freeze drying at 60 c for 4 h hmcl aerogel was obtained the preparation of hydrophobic hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin aerogel hcl aerogel was carried out according to the fabrication method of hmcl aerogel just without the addition of fe3o4 2 3 characterization 2 3 1 fourier transform infrared spectra ftir ft ir spectrometer nicolet is50 usa was used to identify the chemical structure of those aerogels in the wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 dried samples were mixed with kbr 1 100 w w and pressed into pellets under 5 mpa for 1 min beforehand 2 3 2 scanning

ml min 2 3 8 dynamic light scattering dls dls analysis 90plus brookhaven instruments corporation was used to determine the size distribution of oil droplets the compressive properties of the aerogels were conducted on a universal testing machine instron 5967 instron corp usa with compressive strain of 80 of its original height at a compression speed of 5 mm min three measurements were performed for each sample photomicrographs of the emulsion and the collected filtrate were observed using an optical microscope vmc250s 3dfamily co ltd the ultrasound step was performed using an ultrasonic cleaner kq3200de china with operating power of 150 w and frequency of 40 khz 2 4 test of oil absorption capacity the absorption capacities of aerogel for different oils were evaluated by dropping a piece of aerogel into certain oil liquids for some time to reach the absorption equilibrium at room temperature then take it out of the oil and place it on filter paper to remove excess oil the absorption capacity was calculated by the eq 1 1 c m 1 m 0 m 0 where c g g represents the absorption capacity and m 0 g and m 1 g refer to the weight of the aerogel before and after saturated absorption respectively furthermore the oil absorption capacity and reusability of hmcl aerogel in simulated oily seawater was also investigated 10 ml of nacl solution 3 5 w v and 0 2 ml of blended oil dyed with sudan iii were added into a petri dish using simple squeezing method to evaluate the reusability of hmcl aerogel the aerogel samples tested after squeezing desorption were used for the next absorption squeezing cycle without any treatment 2 5 test of oil water separation capacity to investigate the oil water separation performance of the aerogels the separation ability was tested by immobilizing an aerogel sample in a simple filter device to separate oil water mixture 20 ml of dichloromethane water 1 1 v v mixture was taken as the target separation solution dichloromethane dyed with sudan iii and directly poured into the apparatus for separation under gravity in addition separation experiments of dichloromethane corrosive solutions such as 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl were also carried out to assess the separation stability of hmcl aerogel the separation flux f and separation efficiency η were calculated according to the following eqs 2 and 3 2 f v a t where v l represents the permeated volume of oil a m2 represents the effective filtration area t h represents the penetration time 3 η m i m 0 100 where m 0 and m i represent the weight of oil before and after separation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of the composite aerogels schematic illustration of the preparation of hmcl aerogel was shown in fig 1 in a typical experiment the as prepared cl aerogel was immersed in a mixture of ultrasonically dispersed n dodecyl mercaptan and an aqueous solution of dopamine hydrochloride containing fe3o4 nps sonicated for a period of time and then freeze dried a polydopamine pda coating was introduced in the process of constructing a hydrophobic material for oil water separation the reason is that the fascinating adhesion properties of pda with catechol groups could adhere n dodecyl mercaptan ndm and fe3o4 nps onto the surface of cl aerogel via the self polymerization of dopamine 27 furthermore the introduction of fe3o4 nps could increase the surface roughness and endow the cl aerogel with magnetic property in this paper the effect of ultrasound time on the performance of hmcl aerogel was investigated the samples with different ultrasound time of 10 20 30 40 50 min were marked as hmcl 10 aerogel hmcl 20 aerogel hmcl 30 aerogel hmcl 40 aerogel and hmcl 50 aerogel respectively the preparation of hcl aerogel was just the same as that of hmcl aerogel except for the addition of fe3o4 in the preparation process the effect of ndm usage on the performance of hcl aerogel was investigated the samples treated with different ndm usage of 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 ml were marked as hcl 0 1 aerogel hcl 0 2 aerogel hcl 0 3 aerogel hcl 0 4 aerogel and hcl 0 5 aerogel respectively in the preparation of hmcl aerogel and hcl aerogel the usage of hec and al was fixed at 0 15 g and 0 40 g respectively 3 2 structural characterization of the composite aerogels to illustrate the structure of the aerogels the cl aerogel hcl 0 4 aerogel hmcl 40 aerogel and c aerogel were selected as the representative samples in this section they were marked as cl aerogel hcl aerogel hmcl aerogel and c aerogel respectively 3 2 1 sem test scanning electron microscopy sem was employed to investigate the morphologies of aerogels as shown in fig 2a and fig 2b the c aerogel exhibited sheet like structure and smooth surface after the incorporation of lignin the cl aerogel had interconnected honeycomb like pore structures with the pore size of 200 500 μm from the inset digital pictures presented in fig 2a and c the color of the synthesized c aerogel was white while the color of the cl aerogel changed to dark brown which originated from the color of lignin in addition using the same mold the final freeze dried c aerogel had a sheet like structure while the cl aerogel showed a regular cubic structure without any collapse this was due to the low mechanical strength of c hydrogel which caused a certain degree of collapse after freeze drying and it was difficult to form a self standing 3d structure meanwhile the introduction of lignin could form regular shaped aerogels easily to enhance the hydrophobicity the cl aerogel was first immersed in an aqueous solution of dopamine then ndm was conjugated with pda through michael addition reaction 28 29 from the sem image of hcl aerogel shown in fig s1 it still maintained a porous structure after hydrophobic modification it was worth noting that the hydrophobic modification has no obvious effect on the original porous structure of the cl aerogel from the high magnification sem images presented in fig 2e it was clearly shown that fe3o4 nps were densely covered on the surface of the hmcl aerogel it could be seen from fig 2f that the interior of the hmcl aerogel also contained fe3o4 nps these fe3o4 nps 20 nm adhered tightly to the cl aerogel not only due to the strong adhesion of pda but also could be attributed to the hydrogen bonding interaction between fe3o4 and hydroxyl groups in hydroxyethyl cellulose 30 31 3 2 2 eds spectrum the eds spectrum and the content of different elements in hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel were shown in fig s2a and fig s2b respectively the s element originated from ndm and n cl elements came from dopamine hydrochloride and fe element came from fe3o4 respectively moreover the chemical composition and element distribution of hmcl aerogel were further investigated by edx elemental mapping fig s2c it was shown that six kinds of elements including c o n s cl and fe were uniformly distributed on the surface of hmcl aerogel comparing the edx results of the hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel table s1 the weight percentage of the grafted fe was 20 92 indicating that the surface of hmcl aerogel was successfully decorated with fe3o4 nps during the modification process in addition n element was not detected in the eds spectrum of hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel mainly due to the very low content in the composite aerogels 3 2 3 ftir spectrum the ftir spectra of hec al cl aerogel were depicted in fig s3 for hec the peaks at 3441 cm 1 assigned to the stretching of hydroxyl oh and the peaks at 1023 cm 1 referred to c o c stretching for al it could be seen that several characteristic peaks were located at 3441 cm 1 1604 cm 1 1515 cm 1 corresponding to oh c o benzene ring cc stretching vibration respectively 32 the absorption peak intensity of cl aerogel at 3441 cm 1 oh stretching vibration was weaker than that of hec and al which indicated that a cross linking reaction occurred between hydroxyethyl cellulose and lignin 33 another direct evidence of the cross linking reaction was the presence of aromatic ethers and fatty ethers in the cl aerogel spectrum there was an increase in the vibration absorption peaks of aryl ethers and alkyl ethers were at 1269 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 c o c stretching vibration and 1063 cm 1 co stretch from alkyl substituted ether respectively the characteristic peaks at 1269 cm 1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the c o c in phenolic ether bonds the band at 1123 cm 1 to the deformation vibration of ether linkages while the band at 1063 cm 1 was caused by primary and aliphatic ethers 34 the characteristic peaks of cl aerogel spectrum at 2875 cm 1 and 2928 cm 1 further confirmed the cross linking reaction between hec and al the spectrum of cl aerogel hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel all showed the key characteristic peaks of both substances proving the presence of al and hec in the matrix as shown in fig 3a for hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel the peaks at about 2927 cm 1 and 2853 cm 1 corresponded to ch stretching vibrations of methyl ch3 and methylene groups ch2 35 the intensity of the characteristic peaks in hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel were obviously higher than those of cl aerogel proving the presence of ndm the peaks at 1260 and 1598 cm 1 assigned to nh stretching vibrations and cc of aromatic ring stretching vibrations respectively which were the characteristic absorption peaks of pda the characteristic peaks appearing at 1463 and 716 cm 1 were attributed to cs stretching vibrations of reaction product s ch2 between ndm and pda after modification 29 indicating that the ndm and pda were introduced onto the surface of hcl aerogel moreover in the spectrum of hmcl aerogel the characteristic peaks appeared at 630 cm 1 and 580 cm 1 were the stretching vibration feo present in fe3o4 nps 36 the result implied that hmcl aerogel was modified by ndm and fe3o4 nps 3 2 4 xrd spectrum xrd was utilized to analyze the phase structure of the samples xrd patterns of c aerogel cl aerogel hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel were shown in fig 3b it could be seen that the xrd spectrum of the c aerogel only showed a single peak around at 2θ 20 2 indicating the semi crystalline structure of hec 37 the diffraction peaks of other composite aerogels were wider than that of c aerogel which demonstrated that the crystal structures of those composite aerogels were more amorphous 38 the xrd spectrum revealed that the addition of lignin increased the amorphous nature of composite aerogels besides there were six distinct diffraction peaks at 30 0 35 4 43 2 53 6 57 3 and 62 6 in hmcl aerogel which were assigned to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 crystal planes of fe3o4 jcpds card 19 0629 respectively 39 40 this result further confirmed the presence of fe3o4 in the hmcl aerogel and had no obvious effect on the structure of aerogel 3 2 5 thermal stability the thermal stability of the composite aerogels was evaluated by tga the tga and dtg curves for hec al c aerogel cl aerogel were displayed in fig 3c and fig 3d compared with hec al began to decompose at a lower temperature 175 c and had a higher maximum degradation temperature 386 c after the introduction of lignin the cl aerogel had a higher initial decomposition temperature about 244 c and higher residual content 40 8 at 900 c the main corresponding weight loss was about 43 which was significantly lower than that of c aerogel demonstrating that the incorporation of lignin improved the thermal stability of cl aerogel 3 2 6 xps spectrum furthermore xps was executed to characterize the surface chemical compositions of the aerogels as shown in the full xps spectrum of c aerogel cl aerogel hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel fig 3e the binding energy at 284 ev 400 ev 532 ev 163 ev and 711 ev were ascribed to the species of c 1s n 1s o 1s s 2p and fe 2p respectively the result also indicated that the elements of c n o and s coexisted in hcl aerogel whereas only c and o presented in cl aerogel the n 1s signal at 400 1 ev and the s 2p signal at 163 2 ev were detected on the surface of the hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel this was mainly due to the introduction of pda and ndm in the hydrophobic modification process thereby introducing n and s for the hmcl aerogel there were extra doublet peaks displayed with the binding energies of 710 7 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 2 ev fe 2p1 2 fig 3f which corresponded to the fe 2p peaks for fe3o4 40 41 confirming the presence of fe3o4 nps in the hmcl aerogel therefore the xps result is consistent with the obtained xrd result indicating the existence of fe3o4 s and fe element in cl aerogel hcl aerogel and hmcl aerogel were analyzed by xps measurements and the surface element contents were listed in table s2 it could be found that the s element content on the surface of cl aerogel was 0 74 which was introduced in the pulping process the characteristic absorption peak of fe did not appear on the surface of cl aerogel the hmcl aerogel showed the characteristic absorption peak of fe 2p and the surface fe content was 3 58 which further indicated that the fe3o4 nanoparticles were successfully loaded onto the aerogel in hcl aerogel the s element content on the surface was increased from 0 74 to 1 87 which also verified the successful hydrophobic modification with ndm 3 3 hydrophobic modification of cl aerogel 3 3 1 the compression strength of hcl aerogel the mechanical performances of aerogels were characterized by compression tests and the stress strain curves were illustrated in fig 4a the cl aerogel presented about 17 50 kpa of compressive stress at 80 strain and this value was higher than that of c aerogel 7 60 kpa the result proved that the addition of lignin improved the mechanical property of the c aerogel what s more after hydrophobic modification the compression stress of hcl aerogel increased obviously presenting about 54 26 kpa at 80 strain indicating that the fabrication by ndm helped improving the mechanical strength of the aerogel moreover the high compressive stress facilitates the integrity maintenance in practical applications 3 3 2 effect of the usage of ndm on the apparent density of hcl aerogel the apparent density of the prepared hcl aerogel was shown in fig 4b and table s3 compared with the density of the cl aerogel 0 0282 g cm3 the apparent density of all hcl aerogels increased which was due to the shrinkage of the pore size after being immersed in ndm and freeze dried again during the modification process this resulted in a decrease in the apparent volume of the modified aerogel despite this the hcl aerogel could still be supported by a dry grass inset in fig 4b the results showed that the apparent density of hcl aerogels with different ndm usage did not show obvious regularity distributed in the range of 0 0443 g cm3 to 0 0718 g cm3 3 3 3 effect of the usage of ndm on the wettability of hcl aerogel the wettability of hcl aerogel was studied by contact angle measurement as depicted in fig 5a the water contact angle of hlc aerogel increased with the increase of the usage of ndm when the amount of ndm increased from 0 1 ml to 0 5 ml the water contact angle of the porous material increased the contact angle increased from 86 42 to 111 18 which was due to the fact that the grafted ndm reduced the surface energy of the aerogel thereby increasing the water contact angle meanwhile the water contact angle of cl aerogel gradually decreased from 36 27 to 0 within 3 s fig s5 which was ascribed to the abundant of hydrophilic oxygen containing groups of the hec and al the results indicated that the grafting of ndm had changed the aerogel from strong hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity the water contact angle of hcl aerogel as a function of time was shown in fig 5b it could be seen that water droplet still could not be absorbed by the aerogel within 30 s which further indicated that the hcl aerogel had good hydrophobicity 3 3 4 effect of the usage of ndm on the oil adsorption capacity of hcl aerogel in order to clarify the effect of ndm usage on the oil adsorption capacity of hcl aerogel the oil adsorption tests were conducted and the amount of oil blended oil absorbed by hcl aerogel was listed in table s4 it could be seen from the table s4 that the difference in the hydrophobicity of hcl aerogel had no obvious regularity in the influence of the absorption of pure oil the difference in hydrophobicity mainly affected the mechanical strength of the aerogel the absorption of blended oil by different hcl aerogels was distributed between 20 70 g g and 25 91 g g indicating that the hydrophobically modified aerogels had good oil absorption capacity from the above studies it could be seen that hcl 0 4 aerogel had better oil absorption capacity and hydrophobicity therefore this sample was used to test the recyclability of hcl aerogel and the results were shown in fig s4 the original mass of hcl 0 4 aerogel was 0 085 mg the mass after the first saturated oil absorption was 2 112 g the mass after the second saturated oil absorption decreased to 1 750 g and that after the fifth saturated oil absorption was 1 685 g the results suggested that the pore structure was slightly damaged by the oil discharge via extrusion however the hydrophobic aerogel could still maintain a good absorption effect within five absorption and extrusion cycles 3 3 5 oil water separation performance of hcl aerogel to further investigate the oil water separation performance of hcl aerogel the oil water separation experimental process of cl aerogel and hcl aerogel was displayed in fig 6a blended oil was dyed with sudan red iii dripped on the surface of water to form an oil water mixture and the aerogel was placed in it to test the oil water separation ability within 30 s fig 6ai was a diagram of the oil water separation process of cl aerogel it could be found that compared with hcl aerogel due to the stronger hydrophilicity cl aerogel could selectively absorb water in the oil water mixture no oil absorption could be observed and the oil still floated on the water after 30 s fig 6aii presented the oil water separation process diagram of five hcl aerogel samples it could be clearly found that hcl 0 3 aerogel hcl 0 4 aerogel and hcl 0 5 aerogel had good oil water separation effect and almost no red oil could be observed on the water surface after 30 s for hcl 0 1 aerogel and hcl 0 2 aerogel oil droplets could also be observed to be absorbed but after 30 s a little red oil stains could still be found floating on the water surface in the case of hcl 0 1 aerogel and hcl 0 2 aerogel in order to test the oil water separation ability of the hydrophobically modified aerogel in the seawater environment simulated oily seawater was prepared by 10 ml of nacl solution 3 5 w v and 0 2 ml of blended oil dyed with sudan iii the oil water separation and recycling performance of hcl 0 4 aerogel in the simulated oily seawater were tested and the results were shown in fig 6b as illustrated in fig 6b hydrophobic modified aerogel can still maintain good oil water separation performance and recyclability in seawater environment oil could still be selectively absorbed after three cycles of separation however in the fourth cycle the structure was damaged due to repeated use resulting in weaker oil water separation effect 3 4 hydrophobic and magnetic modification of cl aerogel 3 4 1 effect of ultrasonic time on the magnetic responsiveness performance of hmcl aerogel in this section the ndm usage was fixed at 0 4 ml the magnetic hysteresis loops of hmcl aerogel measured at room temperature at different ultrasonic times were shown in fig 7a it could be clearly seen that with the increase of ultrasonic time the magnetization of hmcl aerogel increased which indicated that the longer the ultrasonic time was the more fe3o4 nanoparticles are loaded in the aerogel although the saturated magnetization of hmcl aerogel was much lower than that of nano fe3o4 particles fig s6 it was still stronger than most magnetic aerogels reported in previous research 42 43 what s more the magnetic responsiveness of all hmcl aerogels was strong as shown in fig 7b which were easy to be recycled by the magnet it could also be seen that almost no hysteresis loop was found in the magnetization curve indicating the superparamagnetic characteristic of hmcl aerogels 44 45 the hmcl 40 aerogel was selected to study the magnetic responsiveness after oil absorption fig 7c showed the process of being attracted by a magnet after hmcl 40 aerogel saturated absorption of five pure oils vacuum pump oil blended oil liquid paraffin ethyl acetate and petroleum ether fig 7d displayed the process of hmcl 40 aerogel saturated by blended oil stained with sudan iii in the oil water mixture and then being attracted by a magnet from the experimental results it could be found that after hydrophobic and magnetic modification hmcl aerogel still has excellent magnetic responsiveness in the oil water mixture environment and can be recovered easily by the magnet after saturated adsorption video s1 the hmcl 40 aerogel was selected to study the magnetic responsiveness after oil absorption fig 7c showed the process of being attracted by a magnet after hmcl 40 aerogel saturated absorption of five pure oils vacuum pump oil blended oil liquid paraffin ethyl acetate and petroleum ether fig 7d displayed the process of hmcl 40 aerogel saturated by blended oil stained with sudan iii in the oil water mixture and then being attracted by a magnet from the experimental results it could be found that after hydrophobic and magnetic modification hmcl aerogel still has excellent magnetic responsiveness in the oil water mixture environment and can be recovered easily by the magnet after saturated adsorption video s1 3 4 2 effect of ultrasonic time on the apparent density of hmcl aerogel the apparent density of hmcl aerogel treated with different ultrasound time was shown in fig 8 from the fig 8 the apparent density of hmcl aerogel increased with the increase of ultrasonic time because the increase of ultrasonic time was beneficial to the loading of fe3o4 nanoparticles resulting in the increase of apparent density of hmcl aerogel despite the loading of fe3o4 nps the hmcl aerogel could still be supported by a dry grass inset in fig 8 3 4 3 effect of ultrasonic time on the wettability of hmcl aerogel the variation of the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel in air as a function of ultrasonic time was exhibited in fig 9a it can be seen from the figure that the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel increased with the increase of ultrasonic time which were 92 15 109 92 118 79 127 32 and 131 98 respectively video s2 this result further indicated that with the increase of ultrasonic time the fe3o4 nps loaded on the hmcl aerogel increased which made the surface of the aerogel rougher combined with the co effect of the hydrophobic modifier ndm the hydrophobicity of the hmcl aerogel was further enhanced as a result the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel as a function of time was further investigated and the results were shown in fig 9b it could be seen from the figure that a drop of water still could not be absorbed by hmcl aerogel within 30 s which further indicated that hmcl aerogel had excellent hydrophobicity the variation of the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel in air as a function of ultrasonic time was exhibited in fig 9a it can be seen from the figure that the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel increased with the increase of ultrasonic time which were 92 15 109 92 118 79 127 32 and 131 98 respectively video s2 this result further indicated that with the increase of ultrasonic time the fe3o4 nps loaded on the hmcl aerogel increased which made the surface of the aerogel rougher combined with the co effect of the hydrophobic modifier ndm the hydrophobicity of the hmcl aerogel was further enhanced as a result the water contact angle of hmcl aerogel as a function of time was further investigated and the results were shown in fig 9b it could be seen from the figure that a drop of water still could not be absorbed by hmcl aerogel within 30 s which further indicated that hmcl aerogel had excellent hydrophobicity 3 5 oil absorption capacity of hmcl aerogel in this section the hmcl 40 aerogel was used to illustrate the oil adsorption performance of hmcl aerogel due to its specific hydrophobicity and magnetic responsivity the rapid oil removal process of the hmcl aerogel is revealed in fig s7 arising from its the aerogel was driven by an external magnet and quickly absorbed the dyed blended oil floating on the water surface leaving clean water fig s7a video s3 furthermore the aerogel also could selectively absorb the oil droplets instead of water instantaneously once it came into contact with the sunken heavy oil dyed trichloromethane fig s7b video s4 therefore these phenomena suggested that the as synthesized hmcl aerogel exhibited excellent selective sorption of oil from water due to its specific hydrophobicity and magnetic responsivity the rapid oil removal process of the hmcl aerogel is revealed in fig s7 arising from its the aerogel was driven by an external magnet and quickly absorbed the dyed blended oil floating on the water surface leaving clean water fig s7a video s3 furthermore the aerogel also could selectively absorb the oil droplets instead of water instantaneously once it came into contact with the sunken heavy oil dyed trichloromethane fig s7b video s4 therefore these phenomena suggested that the as synthesized hmcl aerogel exhibited excellent selective sorption of oil from water in order to further investigate the adsorption capacity of hmcl aerogel seven kinds of representative oils were used in this experiment including petroleum ether ethyl acetate liquid paraffin blended oil vacuum pump oil dichloromethane and trichloromethane due to the different densities and viscosities of oils the saturated absorption capacity of porous aerogels toward different types of oil varies as can be seen from fig 10 hmcl aerogels exhibited significantly improved adsorption capacity for seven kinds of representative oils compared with c aerogel the adsorption capacity of c aerogel ranged from 6 38 to 10 42 g g for the seven kinds of oils after the addition of lignin hydrophobic and magnetic modification the absorption ability of hmcl aerogel for the different oils were in the range of 18 92 32 11 g g just about three times of that of c aerogel more importantly the hydrophobic and magnetic modification had improved the recyclability of hmcl aerogel made it easier to be recovered by a magnet even after adsorbing oils a comparison of oil absorption performance with other magnetic aerogel materials reported in previous studies was listed in table 1 compared with other magnetic aerogel materials the hmcl aerogel prepared in this work not only had a relatively better oil absorption performance but were also cost effective therefore these results suggest that the as synthesized hmcl aerogel is a very intriguing oil absorbing material for practical oily wastewater treatment 3 6 oil desorption capacity and recyclability of hmcl aerogel the recyclability and reusability of the as prepared aerogels are two key considerations once applied to practical water treatment the recyclability of the composite aerogels can be achieved by simple mechanical squeezing to remove the absorbed oils in particular the composite aerogel could be recovered after removing the weight fig s8 showing excellent elasticity the introduction of alkali lignin could help to obtain composite aerogel with strong mechanical strength and better resilience which is beneficial to oil storage and improve reusability the repeated cycling tests were conducted for the magnetic porous hmcl aerogel through mechanical squeezing fig 11a the cyclic absorption squeezing test result indicated that the adsorption ability of hmcl aerogel still maintains 90 after 5 cycles the reduced adsorption capacity may be due to the presence of residual oils in the aerogel which cannot be completely removed by direct mechanical squeezing for its high viscosity furthermore the cyclic absorption experiment of hmcl aerogel in simulated oily seawater was further investigated and the results were shown in fig 11b after four cycles the adsorption capacity was only reduced by 9 79 it could be concluded from the experimental results that the aerogel also can maintain stable oil water adsorption performance and excellent recyclability in seawater environment in all the hmcl aerogel displayed remarkable oil water adsorption performance and superior recyclability in hazardous environment 3 7 oil water separation performance of hmcl aerogel the oil water separation tests of the hmcl aerogel were also systematically evaluated in fig 12 the as prepared hmcl aerogel was mounted between two glass tubes and 20 ml mixture of dichloromethane water 1 1 v v was poured into the glass tube the dyed oil could rapidly pass through the porous aerogel driven by gravity while water was blocked and retained on the upper separated glass due to the hydrophobic surfaces in addition as can be seen from the digital photograph after oil water separation test the filtered water was wholly transparent and there were no visible oil droplets fig 12c the hmcl aerogel could separate dichloromethane water mixture within 60 s and the separation flux was high to 2986 l m 2 h 1 video s5 however actual oily wastewater usually contains strong acid strong alkali or high salt which may be corrosive to the hmcl aerogel therefore the oil water separation experiments were also performed in corrosive conditions fig 12d showed the separation flux and separation efficiency of dichloromethane and water corrosive solutions 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl the composite aerogel maintained the separation flux of 2856 m 2 h 1 2879 l m 2 h 1 and 2925 l m 2 h 1 in 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl solution fig s9 meanwhile the separation efficiency of dichloromethane and water corrosive solutions were all over 99 demonstrating that the composite aerogel could resist harsh environment and displayed excellent separation stability moreover cyclic separation experiment of dichloromethane deionized water mixture was used to evaluate the recyclability of the hmcl aerogel after each separation cycle the contaminated aerogel was soaked in ethanol to remove the absorbed oil and dried at 50 c for 12 h for the next cycle as depicted in fig 12e after 10 consecutive separation cycles the separation efficiency of hmcl aerogel for dichloromethane deionized water remained above 99 therefore the results indicated that the as obtained hmcl aerogel had excellent oil water separating property and good reusability the hmcl aerogel could separate dichloromethane water mixture within 60 s and the separation flux was high to 2986 l m 2 h 1 video s5 however actual oily wastewater usually contains strong acid strong alkali or high salt which may be corrosive to the hmcl aerogel therefore the oil water separation experiments were also performed in corrosive conditions fig 12d showed the separation flux and separation efficiency of dichloromethane and water corrosive solutions 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl the composite aerogel maintained the separation flux of 2856 m 2 h 1 2879 l m 2 h 1 and 2925 l m 2 h 1 in 1 m hcl 1 m naoh and 1 m nacl solution fig s9 meanwhile the separation efficiency of dichloromethane and water corrosive solutions were all over 99 demonstrating that the composite aerogel could resist harsh environment and displayed excellent separation stability moreover cyclic separation experiment of dichloromethane deionized water mixture was used to evaluate the recyclability of the hmcl aerogel after each separation cycle the contaminated aerogel was soaked in ethanol to remove the absorbed oil and dried at 50 c for 12 h for the next cycle as depicted in fig 12e after 10 consecutive separation cycles the separation efficiency of hmcl aerogel for dichloromethane deionized water remained above 99 therefore the results indicated that the as obtained hmcl aerogel had excellent oil water separating property and good reusability to further study the oil water separation performance of the porous hmcl aerogel we also prepared span80 stabilized oil in water emulsion cyclohexane as the oil phase through vigorously mixing oil and water in 1 10 v v with the addition of 0 1 wt span 80 from the optical image and size distribution of oil droplets it is can be clearly observed a large number of oil droplets average size 67 55 μm were dispersed in the o w emulsion before filtration fig 12f after the filtration without any oil droplets could be observed in the optical microscopy image different from the pristine milky white emulsion the collected filtrate became transparent indicating successful removal of cyclohexane from water the excellent separation performance of hmcl aerogel on oil in water emulsion can be attributed to the surface rough microstructure when the o w emulsion was poured onto the aerogel the emulsified droplets first contacted with the high density fe3o4 nps on the surface of the aerogel to achieve demulsification owing to the hydrophobic lipophilic property the micro oil droplets continuously passed through the aerogel while the water phase was repelled and thus achieving o w emulsion separation consistent with the separation results of oil water mixture presented by the hmcl aerogel the porous aerogel also has a good separation performance on o w emulsion 4 conclusions in summary hydrophobic magnetic hydroxyethyl cellulose lignin composite aerogels were successfully prepared by a facile approach owing to the introduction of lignin cl aerogel exhibited highly porous structure increasing the ndm usage and ultrasound time could effectively increase the hydrophobicity and magnetic responsiveness of the aerogel the fabricated hmcl aerogel showed fairly high absorption capacity 18 92 32 11 g g toward varieties of oils furthermore it could be quickly recovered by a magnet after saturation adsorption and be reused by simple mechanical squeezing for several times in addition the obtained hmcl aerogel also displayed high separation flux of 2986 l m 2 h 1 for oil water separation and maintained high flux and separation efficiency 99 even in corrosive conditions including acidic alkaline or salty environments the outstanding performance and simple preparation method could make the hmcl aerogel to be a promising candidate for oily sewage treatment and seawater oil spill decontamination moreover this work will also broaden the application field of lignin although we have designed cellulose lignin aerogels for the oil water separation we still did not carry out the research on the large scale oily wastewater treatment in the future work we will mainly focus on the scale up preparation of cellulose lignin aerogels and the performance of large scale oily wastewater treatment abbreviations c aerogel hydroxyethyl cellulose aerogel cl

12528,arsenic as is a common aquatic pollutant that enters the environment from anthropogenic sources and causes serious public health issues various conventional techniques have been applied for as removal from drinking water however those conventional techniques could not meet the requirement of the as discharge standard of 10 mg l in drinking water set by the world health organization who to deal with this bottleneck membrane distillation md offers a complete as removal from an aqueous solution due to its higher rejection rate with less energy consumption than thermal techniques that require high thermal energy this article reviews the recent progress of md configurations membrane modules and membrane materials employed for as removal this work also uncovers the technological solutions of md in tackling a variety of bottlenecks in removing as from aqueous solutions this includes integrating md with alternative energy sources and or forward osmosis fo to incorporate its hybrid systems with less energy consumption or a high separation rate limitations challenges and opportunities of md systems for as removal were highlighted with a technological solution to these bottlenecks the md systems can effectively remove as iii and as v with 100 as rejection using hydrophobic ceramic and polymeric membranes overall md could play a role in helping the water industry meet the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs such as clean water affordable energy and climate change mitigation keywords arsenic as drinking water fouling freshwater physico chemical techniques data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a crucial component in maintaining the living system freshwater is a limited resource distributed unequally on the earth 1 while 97 4 of the earth s surface is covered with ocean and saline lake water about 2 6 is only freshwater fig 1 2 fig 1 shows the total fraction of available freshwater resources including groundwater at 0 592 ice caps and glaciers at 1 984 and readily accessible freshwater at 0 014 in addition the available amount of readily accessible freshwater has been classified into atmospheric water vapour of 0 001 rivers of 0 0001 lakes of 0 007 and soil moisture of 0 005 due to a tiny fraction of freshwater worldwide many areas lack access to safe and clean drinking water and desperately need cost efficient dependable and successful ways of treating local raw water sources water pollution due to arsenic as contamination has been a growing public concern as it can affect surface water the surface water contains inorganic and organic impurities such as as classified as a toxic element to living organisms 3 water contamination due to as originates from various sources such as physico chemical and microbiological processes from rocks and minerals or human made substances such as pesticides fertilizers and industrial waste discharge 4 as a result this brings grave implications for living organisms and the environment global water consumption growth also continuously rises due to rapid population growth industrialization and agricultural demand 5 as a result the pressure on the restricted supply of safe drinking water increases water prices rising operational expenses in various industries that rely on water in large quantities although resources are allocated toward developing technologies for cleaning up contaminated environments contaminated sites still exist in sensitive locations because of the prohibitive cost of environmental remediation or the lack of a cost effective technology to clean up sites to a level required by regulators consequently an extensive scientific effort is directed toward developing novel efficient and inexpensive technologies for as removal as is not a free element and cannot be eliminated however it can be converted into various forms or mixed with other elements to produce insoluble compounds 6 in addition to soluble and particulate as trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate are the two common inorganic forms of soluble as in groundwater and drinking water while methyl and dimethyl as compounds are the common organic forms in groundwater and drinking water arsenate v and arsenite iii are the most common insoluble forms of as in groundwater 7 the as acid results from arsenate v oxidation at a ph higher than 7 as iii and as v are the most prevalent oxidation states in drinking water with four oxidation states 3 0 3 5 8 in contrast as acid results from as v reduction at a ph lower than 7 because of its toxicity even at low concentrations as represents a global health concern and poses a substantial danger to the environment and public health 9 10 the global organization for research on cancer iarc has classified as compounds as carcinogenic in category 1 9 as exposure through drinking water air and food has been recorded due to pollution from industrial activities while excessive groundwater removal for agriculture results in rising as levels in drinking water 11 the as concentration in drinking water in contaminated areas ranges from 50 to over 3000 mg l 12 according to the who the concentrations must be reduced to 10 mg l 13 due to the absence of suitable treatment countries use 10 mg l as an effluent standard for safe drinking water 12 considering the as contamination of the aquatic environment finding clean water sources free of as becomes a global challenge the sustainable separation process plays a critical role in enabling sustainability s economic and environmental aspects 14 separation technologies such as traditional thermal processes can be energy intensive and cost prohibitive sustainable separation is key to addressing the associated high cost and or energy demand and the life cycle environmental impact benefits such as greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the fourth industrial revolution 4ir era water treatment and resource recovery from liquid waste requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing a diverse array of physico chemical and biological solutions including technological aspects in the domain of water research novel technologies and hybrid solutions are required to facilitate an efficient treatment of contaminated water therefore selecting a proper treatment technique for as removal depends on the composition and chemistry of as in the drinking water 15 fig 2 shows conventional treatment technologies such as pressure driven membrane treatment 16 oxidation ion exchange 17 coagulation flocculation 18 and adsorption 19 that have been used to mitigate as from drinking water sources two types of pressure driven membrane processes have been used to remove as from water first high pressure processes include nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 16 20 second low pressure processes include ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf 16 using mf and uf processes as independent separation processes for as removal from water is ineffective because of their large membrane pores 21 however nf and ro processes are more appropriate for removing compounds dissolved in water with a molecular weight of over 300 g mol 22 when the feed is free of suspended solids and the as is present as arsenate pressure driven membrane techniques can significantly decrease the dissolved as level in the water to the recommended value of 10 mg l 23 the advantages and disadvantages of this technique are presented in table 1 oxidation technique for as removal generally includes the conversion of solvable arsenite to arsenate this independent process is also ineffective in removing as from water to the recommended value due to its disadvantages mentioned in table 1 therefore this process must be followed by another process such as coagulation ion exchange or adsorption 24 oxidation of as is a very slow process r and requires a long time for as to complete the required separation 25 furthermore presented chemicals for example ozone and chlorine can quickly oxidize the as iii to as v recently the most commonly used oxidants are atmospheric oxygen hypochlorite and permanganate coagulation and flocculation are common processes used for as removal from water 24 in the coagulation process the negative charge of colloids is reduced by the positive charge of coagulants such as ferric chloride fecl3 and aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 causing particle collision and enlargement however adding an anionic flocculant to the flocculation process leads to charge neutralization or bridging between the large particles formed resulting in floc formation 26 through coagulation and flocculation processes the dissolved as in water transform into an insoluble solid by the chemical materials and precipitates later as slurry 20 the formation of slurry is one of the common drawbacks of this technique as shown in table 1 the adsorption process is a commonly used method for as removal from water because of its several advantages as reported in table 1 this process generally uses a solid medium adsorbent to remove as from water 27 the as removal by this method strongly relies on the ph and as concentrations in water this method is considered more favourable at low as ph where the highest adsorption can be achieved when the as ph ranges from 4 to 9 28 the adsorption effectiveness of the as also depends on the type of adsorbent itself however most adsorbents have shown low specific surface area and asymmetrical pore structures which usually results in a low as adsorption capacity by this method 24 ion exchange is another alternative method for removing as from water water is continually passed under pressure through one or more columns filled with strong base anion sba exchange resin to accomplish elimination 25 these resins are unaffected by ph levels ranging from 6 5 to 9 0 the capacity of as removal by this method relies on the nitrate and sulfate contents in water where nitrate and sulfate ions are exchanged before as ions 29 this process can directly immobilize as ions but requires a long time for separation as stated in table 1 the effectiveness of the ion exchange process can be enhanced via pre oxidation of as iii to as v however the extra oxidants must be eliminated before the ion exchange step to avoid sensitive resin damage 6 developing ion specific resin for as removal can make the process highly appealing 25 these conventional methods for as removal from water have been reported in detail by nicomel et al 24 in their review article according to mondal et al 20 using the conventional techniques separately for as removal is inadequate to reach the maximum contaminant limit mcl of 10 mg l table 2 compares the separation performance for all conventional techniques used to remove as from water all conventional techniques showed a high as v removal performance of about 95 except the oxidation process of higher than 80 as for as iii removal performance membrane processes reported the highest as iii removal performance of up to 95 as iii which is much higher than other processes adsorption showed up to 60 as iii removal performance while the ion exchange and coagulation flocculation processes showed 30 however the as iii removal performance by the oxidation process has not been reported in the literature generally membrane technologies such as ro nf and membrane distillation md have demonstrated technological strengths for as removals such as high removal less chemical required for treatment no pretreatment required and ease of operation 36 fig 3 demonstrates the characteristics of membrane technologies used for as removal from water in terms of porous structure pore size pure flux and pressure applied the mf membranes show higher pure flux ranging from 500 to 10 000 l m2h compared to md and ro and lower pressure required from 0 5 to 5 atm compared to ro from 20 to 100 atm regarding the pore size the md demonstrates a lower pore size ranging from 0 1 to 100 μm several investigations based on as removal by membrane processes focused on the current and alternative methods to improve as removal such as polyamide intercalated nf membranes 37 38 however as removal is commonly undertaken by a pressure driven membrane including four pressure driven membranes mf nf ro and uf are widely used for as removal ro has low as iii and as v removal while nf has low as iii removal and excellent as v removal 36 39 41 uf and mf are unsuitable for dissolved as in water in addition solution ph and the membrane type influence as removal efficiency by ro and nf 36 they are costly due to the requirement of high energy demand due to operating pressures and prone to membrane fouling issues recent investigations proposed hydrophobic membranes with md processes to mitigate the drawbacks of conventional methods problems md has become competitive with other separation methods as an emerging technique in recent years md has emerged to mitigate the difficulties of the conventional separation processes of the thermal and pressure driven separation techniques md technique has several advantages such as indefinite osmotic pressure continuous separation process high rejection rates reasonable permeation rates low operational pressures simple equipment and less consumption of chemicals 42 other benefits include its ability to use renewable energy such as solar energy and heat wasted from thermal processes as alternate heat sources to produce the required heat energy for separation resulting in less operational costs and eco friendly processes 43 in addition md has a low fouling accumulation due to the hydrophobicity of the membrane used unlike conventional techniques that use hydrophilic membranes 42 as a result md can produce drinking water free of as elements however combining conventional techniques with md is an advanced and effective method to remove as from water according to 44 as treatment processes are successful if they use an advanced two step strategy consisting of as iii oxidation to as v subsequently followed by arsenate removal using md table 3 compares the performance of the md process with other conventional processes to remove as from water the significant observation from table 3 is that the md process always uses the hydrophobic membranes compared to other process based membranes which uses hydrophilic membranes moreover the md process demonstrated higher as iii and as v removal to higher than 99 compared to either processes which showed high as iii removal and low as v removal despite the processes based on membranes have several advantages for as removal from water such as high as removal performance they also showed several disadvantages when used as an independent process as reported in table 1 therefore several studies as shown in fig 4 proposed integrating these processes with other as removal processes such as forward osmosis fo ion exchange and coagulation flocculation as a primary step to reduce the as concentrations in water to improve the as removal efficiency and make the as removal process economically feasible fig 4 provide an overview of integrated membrane technologies with other separation techniques to improve contaminants removal performances from water this review will discuss the integration of the md process with the fo process and alternative energy sources earlier review articles have covered the hazards of as elements in drinking water on public health 45 53 sources of as elements 54 55 and conventional removal techniques 24 56 despite their novelty to our knowledge none of the works has reviewed extensive investigations about the applicability of advanced md to remove as from drinking water to reflect its novelty this work reviews recent progress bottlenecks and recent technical solution that represent state of the art md technique for as removal from water this review also highlights future opportunities the way forward and perspectives for md systems to improve as removal from drinking water 2 as removal by md md is a promising technology for removing as elements from water and reducing global health concerns about as hazards in drinking water md technology has technological advantages that attract water purification applications such as a continuous separation process easy improvement separation under reasonable conditions less energy demand less fouling and fewer additives than conventional distillation in addition it can be easily integrated with other water treatment processes 57 md is a hybrid technology that integrates membrane and thermal techniques in one process the principle of the as separation process by the md technique depends on the thermal driving force concept generated due to the vapour pressure difference resulting from the temperature difference between the hot feed and cold permeation sides of the md system the separation of as by md is also based on the principle of a vapour liquid interface at each pore entrance 58 the unique characterization of the md technique uses a hydrophobic membrane with pore sizes ranging from 0 1 to 1 μm 59 the role of the hydrophobic surface is to repel water drops on the hot side of the membrane to avoid the membrane wetting while allowing vapour to pass through the pores to the permeate side several studies have successfully applied md processes as independent processes to remove as from water according to our survey in the web of science database as shown in fig 5 about 19 real studies have used the md for as removal from water since 2009 although the md process successfully treated the as laden wastewater containing as compounds in some areas such as pani para village in bangladesh the publication number of md related studies is still limited the unstable progress for the use of md to remove as was observed where the highest number of studies of 5 was found in 2016 while in the last three years of 2019 2020 and 2021 the number of studies reduced to 2 in each year this literature survey was necessary to provide researchers with a recent update about the limited number of published studies on this critical issue and the necessity of more investigations about using the md processes to treat water polluted by as since it confirmed its success in some areas to remove as to the recommended value with high efficiency and lower costs other studies have successfully integrated the md processes with alternative energy sources and other studies integrated the fo process as a primary step for md to improve the as separation performance as demonstrated in fig 6 the number of studies used md processes as independent processes for as removal was dominant with 19 studies as for integrating other techniques with the md process 3 studies have successfully integrated solar energy with md processes to reduce energy consumption during the separation process whereas 2 studies used the fo process as a primary step to reduce the as concentration in water before treating in the md process 2 1 as removal process by the md system in the as separation process by the md water polluted by as is fed to the md system at varying rates from 1 5 to 3 l min feed pressure from 1 to 2 bar and temperature ranging from 50 to 90 c to vaporize volatile compounds in the feed solution 36 38 60 61 the temperature difference between both sides of the microporous hydrophobic membrane induces a vapour pressure difference and facilitates vapour movement from the hot feed side to the cold permeate side in a counter current circulation 58 the condensation of the vapours occurs on the permeation side at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 c 58 62 producing pure liquid water it is worth mentioning that the condensation of water vapour in the permeation side of the md depends on the configuration of the md system i e dcmd agmd sgmd and vmd applied during the separation in addition the md process continually operates at a moderate temperature 62 a sketch diagram of as removal by the md process is shown in fig 7 3 recent progress in md membrane types materials modules and fabrication methods polymeric and ceramic membranes are the most common membranes applied in md for as removal from water fig 8 shows the types of hydrophobic membranes used for as removal from water there were only two hydrophobic md membrane types polymeric membranes with 21 studies and ceramic with 2 studies in the literature hydrophobic polymeric membranes are frequently used for as removal these membranes were fabricated using different polymeric materials including ptfe pp polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyethersulfone pes 63 other studies used a mixture of these polymeric materials such as ptfe with pp to fabricate composite microporous membranes with improved properties of the fabricated membranes 51 64 65 abass et al 64 fabricated a composite microporous polymeric membrane of ptfe and pp and tested it to remove high as concentrations from groundwater using an integrated system of dcmd and an acid purged zero valent iron apz the experiment was conducted at varied feed temperatures from 50 to 80 c and varied cold and hot side stream flow rates of 0 85 and 1 30 l min and 0 22 and 0 76 l min respectively they reported that the integrated system quickly adsorbed and immobilized as compounds from groundwater on the apz at t1 2 30 min and showed a high as rejection performance of over 95 water flux up to 55 5 kg m2 h besides it exhibited a high electrochemical decrease of as v and or as iii to low soluble as 0 furthermore fig 8 shows that the most widely used polymeric materials for fabricating polymeric membranes for as removal are pvdf which accounts for 6 studies of the total published studies the reason behind the high application of pvdf to fabricate polymeric materials is its outstanding properties such as high thermal chemical abrasion high stress non toxic and excellent mechanical properties and low water absorption hydrophobic 66 however these membranes are unsuitable for resistance against strong acid solutions the ptfe is the second highest publication among polymeric materials with 4 studies the fabricated membranes using this material are typically preferred when dealing with aggressive media because the ptfe has a higher resistance to strong acid solutions and lower surface free energy than the pvdf 67 in contrast the pes and pp are less attractive for as removal from water the published studies of the pp account for 2 of the total studies while the pes accounts for about 1 study the few publications using these polymeric materials could be due to the associated disadvantages such as flammability unsuitability in aromatic and chlorinated media poor mechanical strength and difficulty bonding some materials increase their oxidation degradation 68 the rest represents the membranes of ptfe and pp generally the hydrophobic polymeric membranes showed a high rejection performance ranging from 95 to 100 using different md configurations table 4 table 4 shows several hydrophobic polymer membranes tested in different md configurations polymeric membranes fabricated by pvdf represent the most hydrophobic membrane used in the md processes however the dcmd configuration represents the most md configuration used for testing polymeric membranes than the agmd and vmd modules the use of other polymeric membranes such as ptfe pp ptfe pp in the md configurations was low compared to the pvdf moreover the pp and ptfe membranes were the only polymeric membranes tested in the vmd module while the pvdf and ptfe membranes were the only polymeric membranes tested in the agmd leaper et al 77 reported the fabrication method of the polymeric membrane for as removal they used the electrospun technique to prepare the pvdf membrane the dope solution was prepared first by mixing pvdf powder and n ndimethylformamide dmf acetone with a ratio of 1 2 at 40 c for 24 h to ensure a complete polymer dissolving then the doping solution was placed into a syringe pump and the spinning process formed the virgin pvdf membrane fig 9 the precursor pvdf membrane was dried for 24 h at room temperature before sintering in the oven at 170 c for 1 h to enhance its mechanical strength after sintering the fabricated pvdf membrane was used in their study for as removal from water the results showed a complete as rejection and a steady flux of 28 l m2 h over 5 days fig 10 shows the surface of the pvdf hydrophobic membrane after being tested in the md system for as removal for 24 h it is worth mentioning that the electrospinning technique has become the most attractive technique for fabricating polymeric membranes for md systems because it can control the membrane morphology and pore size ranging from nano to micrometres 43 in addition it can produce fibres continuously in large amounts due to the strong electric field applied to the polymeric dope suspension 43 although ceramic membranes have superior advantages over polymeric membranes such as excellent thermal and chemical stabilities resistance to chemicals and organic solvents mechanical strength and temperature resistance pressure resistance life term operation of a decade they are still limited in terms of publications on as removal by md systems 42 58 on the other hand the number of ceramic membranes used for as removal from water by md systems accounts for about 11 due to the high fabrication costs of ceramic membranes 42 although conventional ceramic materials such as alumina silica and zirconia as well as low cost ceramic materials such as natural clay kaoline mullite and waste materials palm oil fuel ash and rice husk ash have been used to fabricate ceramic membranes with excellent properties and high rejection rate up to 100 for other applications such as water treatment and separation 42 the only two ceramic materials used to fabricate the hydrophobic ceramic membranes for as removal by the md systems were agricultural rice husks 79 and kaolin 38 the as rejection rate by these two ceramic membranes was high as seen in table 5 the as rejection performance in drinking water reached 100 less than the recommended limit of as in drinking water these two ceramic membranes were fabricated by phase inversion and sintering techniques the phase inversion method has been widely used to fabricate ceramic membranes due to its superior advantages over other fabrication methods such as slip casting tape casting pressing and extrusion 57 this single step method generates an asymmetric structure with finger like and sponge like voids that improve its ability to separate produce high volumes and fabricate the membranes in a flat disc or hollow fibre form 80 the required structure can be obtained by changing a few fabrication parameters such as air gap distance and bore fluid flow rate fig 11 shows the phase inversion method used for ceramic membrane fabrication hubadillah et al 38 used phase inversion and sintering techniques to fabricate a hydrophobic ceramic hollow fibre membrane using kaolin as a ceramic material the membrane was tested to remove as iii and as v with a concentration of 1000 mg l from water by the dcmd system the feed solution temperature ranged from 40 to 80 c while the permeate side temperature was 10 c the hydrophobic membrane showed complete as removal with a 100 rejection rate hubadillah et al 79 fabricated another ceramic hollow fibre membrane in the same year for as removal using a dcmd system using agricultural rice husk as a ceramic material the phase inversion and sintering technique were also adapted for the fabrication process the fabricated membrane was also tested for as iii and as v with a concentration of 1000 mg l feed temperatures ranged from 50 to 80 c whereas the permeate temperature was maintained at 15 c the membrane achieved high as removal performance up to 100 according to our literature survey in fig 9 only three polymeric and ceramic membrane modules were used in md systems to remove as from water these membrane modules were flat sheet tubular and hollow fibre the flat sheet module was the most frequently used md module as reflected by the 16 studies in the literature in spite of the advantages of the hollow fibre module such as higher rejection performance of up to 99 60 higher surface area to volume ratio lower energy consumption and higher packing density over the flat sheet and tubular modules 79 they only accounted for 3 studies the comparison between these modules is presented in table 6 4 bottlenecks of md for as removal 4 1 hydrophobicity of md membranes the md membranes must be hydrophobic for all md processes since polymeric membranes are hydrophobic in nature while ceramic membranes are hydrophilic in nature thus the surface of the ceramic membranes needs to be modified to hydrophobic properties before being used 79 generally physical and chemical methods are applied to modify the md ceramic membrane surface surface modification by physical methods is achieved by physical processes such as coating or adsorption 42 meanwhile the surface modification by chemical methods comprises applying a chemical reaction on the membrane surface in the existence of a low energy material such as fluoroalkylsilane fas to remove the hydroxyl groups on the membrane surface and reduce the adhesive force between water drops and the membrane surface 81 however the hydrophobic membrane surface is usually exposed to fouling wetting issues due to the high adhesion force between water drops and membrane surfaces which easily accumulate foulants during the long as removal operation the fouling type and the rate of foulants accumulation on the md membrane surface depend on many factors such as operational conditions properties of the hydrophobic layer foulants and feed solution as a result of accumulation fouling on the membrane surface wetting issues occur on the membrane surface and into the membrane pores especially in the existing of low surface tension compounds in the water feed solution causing significant as and other compounds passage affecting the separation function of the md process 42 in addition this critical issue leads to flux reduction a permeate decline an increment of the chemical materials and energy requests increasing the total costs 82 according to our literature survey the preparation of the hydrophobic hollow fibre membrane for as removal from the water by md systems was reported in one publication hubadillah et al 38 fabricated low cost kaolin hollow fibre membrane by phase inversion sintering technique followed by a surface modification to hydrophobic through membrane surface grafting by fas using the immersion grafted technique the membrane was tested in the dcmd system at a feed solution temperature from 40 c to 80 c and a permeate temperature of 10 c the results showed that the hydrophobic hollow fibre membrane had a good liquid entry pressure lep of 2 bar and a good water contact angle of 145 furthermore this hydrophobic membrane demonstrated a high rejection rate for as elements and permeate flux of 28 and 25 kg m2 h for as iii and as v respectively as a result the as concentration in produced water was less than the effluent limit of 10 mg l set by the who 4 2 effect of as concentration and feed solution temperature on the permeation flow in md pal and manna 51 experimentally studied the effects of as concentration in the feed solution on permeation flow during the as removal process they used three hydrophobic membranes flat sheet membranes namely ms3220 ms3020 and ms7020 they were tested by direct contact membrane distillation dcmd at 60 c feed solution temperature their properties are listed in table 7 the results demonstrated that the permeate flow for all membranes was reduced by increasing as concentration in the feed solution from 0 to 1 2 ppm the permeation flow of the ms3220 membrane was reduced by 14 from 27 52 to 23 61 kg m2 h and the permeation flow of the ms3220 membrane was reduced by 13 from 25 23 to 21 85 kg m2 h and the permeation flow of the ms7020 membrane were reduced by 10 from 15 12 to 13 5 kg m2 h moreover the reduction in the permeation flow was attributed to the high accumulation rate of the arsic elements due to their high concentration in the feed solution as well as the accumulation of other heavy contaminations presented in the feed solution on the membrane surface this phenomenon is called concentration polarization concentration polarization is a common issue for membrane based processes this phenomenon usually occurs when the concentration of the rejected solutes gradually increases on the membrane surface causing the concentration accumulation on the membrane bulk side the diffusing flow back to the bulk solution in the membrane bulk side may happen and steady state conditions can be attained due to the gradual reduction of the flow back 83 in addition it was due to the relationship between water activity and the vapour pressure generated in the md this phenomenon was attributed to the as removal process by md increasing the as concentration reduces the water activity of the feed solution and the vapour pressure driving force in addition as elements in the feed solution that shifted boundary layers close to the membrane surface reduced the permeation flow pal 59 also reported that the permeation flux was slightly reduced compared to the permeation flow reduction in the dcmd system for seawater solution in which the salt concentration can reach over 20 000 mg l as a result a pretreatment process is required to remove contaminations from the feed solution and reduce the concentration of the as elements before treatment by the md process to ensure a high as rejection rate however pal et al 52 studied the effects of the feed solution with as elements on the permeation flow using the membrane sheets by dcmd configuration they used different feed temperatures ranging from 303 to 344 k with a distillate temperature of 278 k and distillate velocity of 0 123 m s the as concentration measurement in the feed solution and permeate flow was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 100 perkin elmer waltham massachusetts they reported that the permeation flow exponentially increased with the feed solution temperature increased according to the antoine equation increasing the temperatures from 30 to 60 c gradually increased the permeation flow by 81 8 from 2 3 to 23 kg m2 h however increasing the feed temperatures also increased the accumulation of as and other contaminations on the hydrophobic membrane surface as fouling reduced the water permeation flow for a long operation time 4 3 energy consumption by md configurations many md configurations have been applied to produce drinkable water using various ceramic and polymeric membranes generally md configurations have been classified into four categories regarding the permeation collection agmd dcmd vmd and sgmd sweeping gas membrane distillation fig 12 61 the liquid feed is in direct contact with the hot side of the hydrophobic membrane surface during the separation process by all md configurations however the surface condensation where the pure water is collected depends on the md configuration type in the dcmd system the surface condensation is directly in contact with the hydrophobic membrane surface in contrast in the agmd system an air gap separates the surface condensation from the membrane surface nevertheless the surface condensation is separated from the membrane surface by a vacuum in the vmd system while a sweep gas separates surface condensation from the membrane surface in the sgmd system 84 according to the data collected from the web of science three md configurations such as dcmd agmd and vmd have been applied to remove as from water the number of studies that used the dcmd configuration was 19 published studies this number of studies is considerably high compared to agmd and vmd which was with 2 and 1 study respectively the dcmd configuration is preferable due to its outstanding advantages such as a simple module easy control reasonable flux rate and less fouling accumulation during the separation process 58 on the other hand this configuration has a common drawback such as high heat loss by conduction limiting its applications in the as removal process 67 other investigations proposed other md configurations such as agmd and vmd to remove as from water the technological advantage of these configurations is that the air gap and the vacuum provide thermal insulation between the hot and the cold sides decreasing the heat losses by conduction via the membrane matrix and energy consumption during the as separation compared to the dcmd system 67 in contrast the agmd and vmd configurations were more complicated to handle than the dcmd system generally the heat energy consumption by these md systems is still considered high therefore alternative energy sources such as solar energy or waste heat from power plants were proposed to reduce the dcmd dependence on electricity generated from non renewable energy sources and minimize the operational cost 60 as seen in table 8 the dcmd configuration has higher energy consumption than other configurations of agmd and vmd due to the high heat loss by conduction during the separation process it also has higher operating costs due to its higher energy consumption however the agmd and vmd configurations have moderate energy consumption and lower operating costs due to the existing air gap in the agmd and the vacuum in the vmd which work as heat insulation layers reducing the heat loss by conduction 5 technological solutions of md for as removal 5 1 mitigation of fouling on hydrophobic md membrane surface md membranes applied in the as removal processes must have a hydrophobic surface with a high water contact angle and low surface energy 85 however the hydrophobic surface is usually exposed to fouling and wetting during a long md system operation for as removal in addition the loss or damage of the hydrophobic layer on the membrane surface through the as removal process results in high foulants accumulation on the membrane surface 80 these two problems make md less desirable for long time operation therefore to mitigate these issues the hydrophobic md membrane surfaces must be developed with omniphobic or superhydrophobic properties to ensure a long operation with a high as rejection rate in general many techniques have been used to modify the hydrophobic membranes to superhydrophobic omniphobic surfaces including laser processing 86 chemical vapour deposition cvd 87 sol gel 88 chemical etching 89 spray coating 90 and hydrothermal technique 91 the hydrophobic md membrane surface modification also required reducing the membrane surface energy by low surface energy material such as fas to improve the hydrophobicity and the omniphobicity of the md membrane the hydrothermal method is a novel method for membrane surface modification with outstanding properties such as simple low cost easy to control membrane surface appearance by controlling the reaction time and temperature 42 according to our literature survey only one study reported modification of the hydrophobic md membrane surface to a superhydrophobic membrane hubadillah et al 79 modified the hydrophobic md membrane to the superhydrophobic membrane the low cost crystalline rice husk ash csh and amorphous rice husk ash ash were used as ceramic material to fabricate two hydrophobic hollow fibre membranes by phase inversion sintering method and grafted by 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyl triethoxysilane using the immersion grafted method to form a superhydrophobic membranes surfaces the prepared membrane was evaluated via the dcmd system at different feed temperatures of 50 60 70 and 80 c with a permeate temperature of 15 c for 4 h they reported that increasing the feed solution temperature from 50 to 80 c increased the flux from 30 5 to 50 4 30 2 to 51 3 kg m2 h for as iii and as v respectively they also mentioned that the csh hollow fibre and ash hollow fibre membrane showed a high as rejection rate with contact angles of 161 and 157 the optimum as iii and as v flux were 50 4 and 51 3 kg m2 h respectively they also reported that these superhydrophobic membranes could reject the as elements from water to less than the required as contents level of 10 mg l fig 13 shows the sem images with a contact angle of cshfm and ashfm before and after membrane surface modification for as removal from water on the other hand no study has been reported modifying the hydrophobic md membranes to omniphobic properties for as removal despite the advantages of omniphobic membranes over hydrophobic and superhydrophobic membranes such as repelling all liquid drops in aqueous solution such as water low surface energy material oil and alcohol organics and solvents due to its ultra low surface energy and re entrant surface structure 9 moreover it usually shows higher fouling and wetting resistance in long md operating processes due to its self cleaning and strong biofouling resistance 9 67 besides the omniphobic surfaces have oleophobic superhydrophobic properties that improve their stability against fouling and wetting issues 90 compared to conventional hydrophobic superhydrophobic md membranes omniphobic membranes exhibited more robust and stable md in many applications 42 5 2 mitigation of as concentration and feed solution temperature effects on the permeation flow in md by integrating md systems with another as removal technique because md systems are inappropriate for removing high as concentrations in water due to the quick foulants accumulation on the membrane surfaces thus the pretreatment process is required the high costs of the md systems are typically attributed to pretreatment processes required to remove impurities and primarily reduce the as concentration in the feed solution before treating it in the md system the high impurities in the feed solution typically reduce the water permeation flow through the hydrophobic membranes due to their accumulation as fouling on the membrane surface resulting from high as contents and low feed temperature 59 however the pretreatment processes contribute about 60 of the total operational costs as alkhudhiri and hilal 92 reported therefore recently md systems have focused on improvements in the pretreatment process by reducing the high pretreatment costs by integrating with fo ion exchange mf nf or uf as a primary step before separation and treatment by the md system 70 however the fo system was only integrated with the md to form a hybrid md fo system for as removal from water fo md system is more efficient for as removal compared to other membrane methods such as mf nf etc because the feature of the md process which is a hybrid process can remove as iii and as v with about 100 as hubadillah 38 reported thus the advantage of fo in the process is a pretreatment to reduce the concentration of as element and other contaminants before passing to the md process to mitigate the fouling on the membrane surface that could be resulted from the accumulation of as and other elements however integrating the fo with other membrane processes such as mf nf etc is less efficient because for example mf membranes are not highly efficient for arsenic removal because they allow multivalent as and other elements to pass through the membrane pores while the nf have succeeded in arsenate as v ions removal from water almost completely but have not yet performed alone arsenite as iii ion rejection as worou et al 93 reported only two studies have used a hybrid md fo system for as removal from water the md fo hybrid system has several advantages compared to individual use of fo or md systems such as mitigating fouling and wetting due to the removal of target contaminants from the feed at fo upstream continuous flux due to the recovery of the draw solution by the md downstream produced water quality due to the high as removal by md and fo processes and the ambient pressure 94 the as removal using the fo md hybrid system was reported by husnain et al 70 they investigated the effectiveness of a three channel fo md system with pp hydrophobic membrane and flat sheet membrane module to remove as from wastewater the fo was used for pretreatment to eliminate target pollutants in the feed solution whereas md was applied as a recovery system for the solutes drawn from the fo the experiment was performed at a feed temperature of 20 c whereas the temperatures of permeate and draw were varied from 15 to 30 c and 40 70 c respectively the results showed steady water flux for md and fo with high water purity ge et al 69 used the fo md system with pvdf hydrophobic membrane and hollow fibre membranes module to remove as iii with the concentration of 1000 mg l for 48 h operation the feed solution temperature was 20 c whereas the permeate and draw temperatures were 20 c and 50 c respectively they reported a high as rejection rate with effluent of 10 mg l set by the who for drinking water fig 14 shows the diagram of the integrated fo with the md system 5 3 mitigation of high energy consumption by md configurations by integrating md systems with alternative energy sources md is a promising technology for applying alternative energy sources to form integral systems with less energy consumption and a high as removal rate 96 many alternative energy sources can be applied to supply the required energy for the md processes waste heat from plants such as hot gases exhausted from boilers heaters furnaces and heat exchangers can be effectively utilized as alternative heat sources for providing the required heat for md systems besides solar energy types of non concentrating and concentrating collectors can be another possible choice as an alternative energy source various types of solar energy collectors are available in marketplaces 97 98 fixed solar collectors including evacuated solar tubes and flat plates are the most feasible choices as an alternative heat source regarding temperature ranges and costs these types have been effectively applied in many water treatment applications 97 99 100 in addition geothermal energy has been successfully applied to provide thermal heat energy as an alternative to the conventional energy source geothermal energy is usually obtained from the commercially available heat exchangers in the plants such as shell and tube exchanger and plate heat exchangers 97 101 102 all these energy sources can also be integrated with md systems according to the literature solar energy was the only alternative energy source used with the md system for as removal from water md systems driven by solar energy are a practical solution to conventional md systems for removing as with a maximum rejection rate for small scale treatment 51 the solar driven membrane distillation sdmd has been operational in water desalination since the 1960s 59 the first study that used the sdmd system to remove as from the water was reported by pal and manna 51 they used the sdmd system with three flat sheet hydrophobic polymeric membranes and a crossflow to remove as from polluted groundwater all hydrophobic membranes demonstrated a high as removal and the ptfe membrane showed the best flux of 49 80 kg m2 h manna et al 72 used an sdmd system consisting of a dcmd system a pvdf hydrophobic tubular module and a flat sheet cross flow to remove as from the groundwater their study used varied feed solution and distillate temperatures ranging from 30 to 61 c and 12 42 c respectively the sdmd system showed a total as removal with a 100 rejection rate the hydrophobic membrane showed a high flux of 74 and 95 kg m2 h at 40 and 60 c feed solution temperatures pal et al 52 also developed a new sdmd improvement flux system to remove as elements from contaminated groundwater they used different feed temperatures ranging from 30 to 71 c with a distillate temperature of 5 c and distillate velocity of 0 123 m s the new module had a high rejection performance with over 99 as removal and flux of over 50 l m2 h the module could be employed effectively in southeast asia where solar energy is abundantly available manna and pal 71 also proposed a new crossflow flash vaporization md module installed with a hydrophobic ptfe flat sheet membrane in a dcmd system to remove as from groundwater the experiments were performed at different feed solution temperatures from 40 to 71 c via solar heater and 100 l h feed flow rate while permeating side temperature was 21 c the module illustrated as rejection of over 99 and a high flux of 52 94 kg m2 h fig 15 shows the diagram of integrated solar energy with the md system fig 16 summarizes the recent bottlenecks of the md for as removal from water and the recent technological solutions to mitigate these bottlenecks 6 limitations and challenges of md for as removal md separation technique has become a promising and attractive technique due to its remarkable effectiveness in removing as from the surface and the groundwater however the long operation of the md as a separation process is critical and dependent on its economic feasibility md is a non isothermal distillation process requiring low grade heat to generate the driving force some studies have reported that the cost to heat the feed solution is less than the energy cost in other processes such as mf and uf which usually results from the high operating pressures required for the separation process besides md can treat polluted water with higher as concentrations and is less prone to membrane fouling issues which makes it more attractive for economic as removal by distillation processes the high concentration of as in the feed solution decreases the permeation flow and reduces the performance of md for as removal the as concentration level in the feed solution significantly affects the permeation flow the feed solution with a high as concentration usually results in a high as accumulation on the membrane surface as a result the md is inappropriate for treating a feed solution with a high as the concentration of over 2000 mg l 51 the md treated water was polluted by as with concentrations ranging from 40 to 2000 mg l to 10 mg l furthermore treating retentate with the as element represents another challenge due to as toxicity these retentates are environmentally harmful and increase the md s operational costs however unlike the md for seawater desalination of which salt concentration can reach over 20 000 mg l the use of md for as removal is more feasible and appropriate because of the low concentration of as of 1000 mg l the selection of a proper md module depends on the energy consumption by the md module through the as separation the dcmd modules are frequently used in most md applications however they consume higher energy than other md modules due to the high heat loss by conduction as a result new md modules such as agmd and vmd were developed to mitigate this drawback these new modules effectively reduced the heat loss by conduction the unavailability of proper md modules becomes one of its limitations and challenges for commercialization purposes recently integrating the md process with solar energy for as removal from water is not economically attractive for large scale as removal due to the large solar panels required which increases production costs further attempts are required to investigate the possibility of designing new simple md systems with high energy performance and less conduction heat loss in addition using hybrid processes consisting of md with other conventional as removals techniques have increased the production rates purity and rejection performance however the hybrid processes have limitations due to increasing operational and capital costs caused by the additional equipment and chemical materials required for as removal as a result integrating the md with other conventional processes has become challenging due to the need to reduce operational costs while maintaining high as removal the md membrane materials and modules also play important roles in as removal by md selecting appropriate membrane material and modules can effectively increase as rejection and reduce operational costs despite the outstanding properties of ceramic membranes such as high chemical thermal stability high to harsh operating conditions resistance and long operating time they were not widely used for as removal most md membranes were fabricated from polymeric materials additional investigations are required to characterize and understand the properties of ceramic materials to produce ceramic membranes with superior properties for as removal by md comparative studies need to be performed on the ceramic membranes fabricated from low cost alternative materials to determine whether a proper membrane can fulfil the demands of as removal for full scale processes moreover md membrane surfaces with superhydrophobic or omniphobic properties were not applied to the md membranes for as removal as a result md membranes are exposed to fouling and wetting due to their hydrophobicity membrane fouling is difficult to treat when the as concentration is high the drawbacks cause the failure of md modules in the long term and increase the operational costs with respect to washing and cleaning membranes from fouling to overcome the limitations behaviors main causes and treatment of membrane fouling and wetting on the md surfaces need to be completely understood the hollow fibre membrane module has recently been widely applied in an industrial setting this md module can increase the attractiveness of md processes for as removal due to its high production rates low energy consumption and high performance this can also mitigate the limitations of flat sheet modules for as removal conversely applying md systems to full scale as removal elements is still challenging the flow rates of current md systems are low and not applicable to remove as in large amounts therefore heat transfer resistance and vapour transport through md membrane pores need to be developed to improve the permeation flow in md systems 7 opportunities and the way forward of as removal by md technique as removal from water by md techniques has shown slow progress recently due to significant limitations and challenges that restrict their performance mitigating the limitations with technological solutions offers the md system opportunities to effectively remove as from wastewater in areas where polluted water due to as elements are abundantly available integrating md systems with solar energy is a very effective technique for reducing the consumed energy and opens the path for md systems to remove as from water solving clean water crises in poor and countryside areas with inadequate energy sources hybrid md systems are expected to provide clean water in areas that have contaminated water with low as concentrations hybrid md systems could align with the un s sustainability development goal sdg on clean water for all by providing clean water in poor and countryside areas and remote areas as systems for small scale water treatment 8 conclusion this review has demonstrated that md systems have been one of the most effective techniques in as removal to less than recommended concentrations of 10 mg l because of their high rejection rate md systems also require less energy consumption and can be integrated with solar energy to reduce energy consumption furthermore they can be integrated with conventional as removal techniques to form hybrid systems to facilitate high as rejection performance it is evident from the literature survey of 19 published studies 2009 2022 that common md systems applied for as removal were dcmd agmd and vmd the dcmd was the most widely used system due to its simple design and high rejection rates despite its high energy consumption the common hydrophobic membrane material used in md systems was polymers the hydrophobic membranes were usually exposed to fouling and wetting during a long time operation hollow fibre membrane modules were not frequently used for as removal in md systems although they have excellent advantages over flat sheet modules although efforts to improve the md systems for as removal was undertaken by integrating the md systems with conventional techniques using new membrane materials and modules other limitations and challenges still require further investigations and a better understanding of the limitations as most md systems were applied on a laboratory scale additional investigations are required to evaluate the performance of md systems in actual as separation with respect to membrane materials and modules for further improvement declaration of competing

12528,arsenic as is a common aquatic pollutant that enters the environment from anthropogenic sources and causes serious public health issues various conventional techniques have been applied for as removal from drinking water however those conventional techniques could not meet the requirement of the as discharge standard of 10 mg l in drinking water set by the world health organization who to deal with this bottleneck membrane distillation md offers a complete as removal from an aqueous solution due to its higher rejection rate with less energy consumption than thermal techniques that require high thermal energy this article reviews the recent progress of md configurations membrane modules and membrane materials employed for as removal this work also uncovers the technological solutions of md in tackling a variety of bottlenecks in removing as from aqueous solutions this includes integrating md with alternative energy sources and or forward osmosis fo to incorporate its hybrid systems with less energy consumption or a high separation rate limitations challenges and opportunities of md systems for as removal were highlighted with a technological solution to these bottlenecks the md systems can effectively remove as iii and as v with 100 as rejection using hydrophobic ceramic and polymeric membranes overall md could play a role in helping the water industry meet the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs such as clean water affordable energy and climate change mitigation keywords arsenic as drinking water fouling freshwater physico chemical techniques data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a crucial component in maintaining the living system freshwater is a limited resource distributed unequally on the earth 1 while 97 4 of the earth s surface is covered with ocean and saline lake water about 2 6 is only freshwater fig 1 2 fig 1 shows the total fraction of available freshwater resources including groundwater at 0 592 ice caps and glaciers at 1 984 and readily accessible freshwater at 0 014 in addition the available amount of readily accessible freshwater has been classified into atmospheric water vapour of 0 001 rivers of 0 0001 lakes of 0 007 and soil moisture of 0 005 due to a tiny fraction of freshwater worldwide many areas lack access to safe and clean drinking water and desperately need cost efficient dependable and successful ways of treating local raw water sources water pollution due to arsenic as contamination has been a growing public concern as it can affect surface water the surface water contains inorganic and organic impurities such as as classified as a toxic element to living organisms 3 water contamination due to as originates from various sources such as physico chemical and microbiological processes from rocks and minerals or human made substances such as pesticides fertilizers and industrial waste discharge 4 as a result this brings grave implications for living organisms and the environment global water consumption growth also continuously rises due to rapid population growth industrialization and agricultural demand 5 as a result the pressure on the restricted supply of safe drinking water increases water prices rising operational expenses in various industries that rely on water in large quantities although resources are allocated toward developing technologies for cleaning up contaminated environments contaminated sites still exist in sensitive locations because of the prohibitive cost of environmental remediation or the lack of a cost effective technology to clean up sites to a level required by regulators consequently an extensive scientific effort is directed toward developing novel efficient and inexpensive technologies for as removal as is not a free element and cannot be eliminated however it can be converted into various forms or mixed with other elements to produce insoluble compounds 6 in addition to soluble and particulate as trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate are the two common inorganic forms of soluble as in groundwater and drinking water while methyl and dimethyl as compounds are the common organic forms in groundwater and drinking water arsenate v and arsenite iii are the most common insoluble forms of as in groundwater 7 the as acid results from arsenate v oxidation at a ph higher than 7 as iii and as v are the most prevalent oxidation states in drinking water with four oxidation states 3 0 3 5 8 in contrast as acid results from as v reduction at a ph lower than 7 because of its toxicity even at low concentrations as represents a global health concern and poses a substantial danger to the environment and public health 9 10 the global organization for research on cancer iarc has classified as compounds as carcinogenic in category 1 9 as exposure through drinking water air and food has been recorded due to pollution from industrial activities while excessive groundwater removal for agriculture results in rising as levels in drinking water 11 the as concentration in drinking water in contaminated areas ranges from 50 to over 3000 mg l 12 according to the who the concentrations must be reduced to 10 mg l 13 due to the absence of suitable treatment countries use 10 mg l as an effluent standard for safe drinking water 12 considering the as contamination of the aquatic environment finding clean water sources free of as becomes a global challenge the sustainable separation process plays a critical role in enabling sustainability s economic and environmental aspects 14 separation technologies such as traditional thermal processes can be energy intensive and cost prohibitive sustainable separation is key to addressing the associated high cost and or energy demand and the life cycle environmental impact benefits such as greenhouse gas ghg emissions in the fourth industrial revolution 4ir era water treatment and resource recovery from liquid waste requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing a diverse array of physico chemical and biological solutions including technological aspects in the domain of water research novel technologies and hybrid solutions are required to facilitate an efficient treatment of contaminated water therefore selecting a proper treatment technique for as removal depends on the composition and chemistry of as in the drinking water 15 fig 2 shows conventional treatment technologies such as pressure driven membrane treatment 16 oxidation ion exchange 17 coagulation flocculation 18 and adsorption 19 that have been used to mitigate as from drinking water sources two types of pressure driven membrane processes have been used to remove as from water first high pressure processes include nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 16 20 second low pressure processes include ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf 16 using mf and uf processes as independent separation processes for as removal from water is ineffective because of their large membrane pores 21 however nf and ro processes are more appropriate for removing compounds dissolved in water with a molecular weight of over 300 g mol 22 when the feed is free of suspended solids and the as is present as arsenate pressure driven membrane techniques can significantly decrease the dissolved as level in the water to the recommended value of 10 mg l 23 the advantages and disadvantages of this technique are presented in table 1 oxidation technique for as removal generally includes the conversion of solvable arsenite to arsenate this independent process is also ineffective in removing as from water to the recommended value due to its disadvantages mentioned in table 1 therefore this process must be followed by another process such as coagulation ion exchange or adsorption 24 oxidation of as is a very slow process r and requires a long time for as to complete the required separation 25 furthermore presented chemicals for example ozone and chlorine can quickly oxidize the as iii to as v recently the most commonly used oxidants are atmospheric oxygen hypochlorite and permanganate coagulation and flocculation are common processes used for as removal from water 24 in the coagulation process the negative charge of colloids is reduced by the positive charge of coagulants such as ferric chloride fecl3 and aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 causing particle collision and enlargement however adding an anionic flocculant to the flocculation process leads to charge neutralization or bridging between the large particles formed resulting in floc formation 26 through coagulation and flocculation processes the dissolved as in water transform into an insoluble solid by the chemical materials and precipitates later as slurry 20 the formation of slurry is one of the common drawbacks of this technique as shown in table 1 the adsorption process is a commonly used method for as removal from water because of its several advantages as reported in table 1 this process generally uses a solid medium adsorbent to remove as from water 27 the as removal by this method strongly relies on the ph and as concentrations in water this method is considered more favourable at low as ph where the highest adsorption can be achieved when the as ph ranges from 4 to 9 28 the adsorption effectiveness of the as also depends on the type of adsorbent itself however most adsorbents have shown low specific surface area and asymmetrical pore structures which usually results in a low as adsorption capacity by this method 24 ion exchange is another alternative method for removing as from water water is continually passed under pressure through one or more columns filled with strong base anion sba exchange resin to accomplish elimination 25 these resins are unaffected by ph levels ranging from 6 5 to 9 0 the capacity of as removal by this method relies on the nitrate and sulfate contents in water where nitrate and sulfate ions are exchanged before as ions 29 this process can directly immobilize as ions but requires a long time for separation as stated in table 1 the effectiveness of the ion exchange process can be enhanced via pre oxidation of as iii to as v however the extra oxidants must be eliminated before the ion exchange step to avoid sensitive resin damage 6 developing ion specific resin for as removal can make the process highly appealing 25 these conventional methods for as removal from water have been reported in detail by nicomel et al 24 in their review article according to mondal et al 20 using the conventional techniques separately for as removal is inadequate to reach the maximum contaminant limit mcl of 10 mg l table 2 compares the separation performance for all conventional techniques used to remove as from water all conventional techniques showed a high as v removal performance of about 95 except the oxidation process of higher than 80 as for as iii removal performance membrane processes reported the highest as iii removal performance of up to 95 as iii which is much higher than other processes adsorption showed up to 60 as iii removal performance while the ion exchange and coagulation flocculation processes showed 30 however the as iii removal performance by the oxidation process has not been reported in the literature generally membrane technologies such as ro nf and membrane distillation md have demonstrated technological strengths for as removals such as high removal less chemical required for treatment no pretreatment required and ease of operation 36 fig 3 demonstrates the characteristics of membrane technologies used for as removal from water in terms of porous structure pore size pure flux and pressure applied the mf membranes show higher pure flux ranging from 500 to 10 000 l m2h compared to md and ro and lower pressure required from 0 5 to 5 atm compared to ro from 20 to 100 atm regarding the pore size the md demonstrates a lower pore size ranging from 0 1 to 100 μm several investigations based on as removal by membrane processes focused on the current and alternative methods to improve as removal such as polyamide intercalated nf membranes 37 38 however as removal is commonly undertaken by a pressure driven membrane including four pressure driven membranes mf nf ro and uf are widely used for as removal ro has low as iii and as v removal while nf has low as iii removal and excellent as v removal 36 39 41 uf and mf are unsuitable for dissolved as in water in addition solution ph and the membrane type influence as removal efficiency by ro and nf 36 they are costly due to the requirement of high energy demand due to operating pressures and prone to membrane fouling issues recent investigations proposed hydrophobic membranes with md processes to mitigate the drawbacks of conventional methods problems md has become competitive with other separation methods as an emerging technique in recent years md has emerged to mitigate the difficulties of the conventional separation processes of the thermal and pressure driven separation techniques md technique has several advantages such as indefinite osmotic pressure continuous separation process high rejection rates reasonable permeation rates low operational pressures simple equipment and less consumption of chemicals 42 other benefits include its ability to use renewable energy such as solar energy and heat wasted from thermal processes as alternate heat sources to produce the required heat energy for separation resulting in less operational costs and eco friendly processes 43 in addition md has a low fouling accumulation due to the hydrophobicity of the membrane used unlike conventional techniques that use hydrophilic membranes 42 as a result md can produce drinking water free of as elements however combining conventional techniques with md is an advanced and effective method to remove as from water according to 44 as treatment processes are successful if they use an advanced two step strategy consisting of as iii oxidation to as v subsequently followed by arsenate removal using md table 3 compares the performance of the md process with other conventional processes to remove as from water the significant observation from table 3 is that the md process always uses the hydrophobic membranes compared to other process based membranes which uses hydrophilic membranes moreover the md process demonstrated higher as iii and as v removal to higher than 99 compared to either processes which showed high as iii removal and low as v removal despite the processes based on membranes have several advantages for as removal from water such as high as removal performance they also showed several disadvantages when used as an independent process as reported in table 1 therefore several studies as shown in fig 4 proposed integrating these processes with other as removal processes such as forward osmosis fo ion exchange and coagulation flocculation as a primary step to reduce the as concentrations in water to improve the as removal efficiency and make the as removal process economically feasible fig 4 provide an overview of integrated membrane technologies with other separation techniques to improve contaminants removal performances from water this review will discuss the integration of the md process with the fo process and alternative energy sources earlier review articles have covered the hazards of as elements in drinking water on public health 45 53 sources of as elements 54 55 and conventional removal techniques 24 56 despite their novelty to our knowledge none of the works has reviewed extensive investigations about the applicability of advanced md to remove as from drinking water to reflect its novelty this work reviews recent progress bottlenecks and recent technical solution that represent state of the art md technique for as removal from water this review also highlights future opportunities the way forward and perspectives for md systems to improve as removal from drinking water 2 as removal by md md is a promising technology for removing as elements from water and reducing global health concerns about as hazards in drinking water md technology has technological advantages that attract water purification applications such as a continuous separation process easy improvement separation under reasonable conditions less energy demand less fouling and fewer additives than conventional distillation in addition it can be easily integrated with other water treatment processes 57 md is a hybrid technology that integrates membrane and thermal techniques in one process the principle of the as separation process by the md technique depends on the thermal driving force concept generated due to the vapour pressure difference resulting from the temperature difference between the hot feed and cold permeation sides of the md system the separation of as by md is also based on the principle of a vapour liquid interface at each pore entrance 58 the unique characterization of the md technique uses a hydrophobic membrane with pore sizes ranging from 0 1 to 1 μm 59 the role of the hydrophobic surface is to repel water drops on the hot side of the membrane to avoid the membrane wetting while allowing vapour to pass through the pores to the permeate side several studies have successfully applied md processes as independent processes to remove as from water according to our survey in the web of science database as shown in fig 5 about 19 real studies have used the md for as removal from water since 2009 although the md process successfully treated the as laden wastewater containing as compounds in some areas such as pani para village in bangladesh the publication number of md related studies is still limited the unstable progress for the use of md to remove as was observed where the highest number of studies of 5 was found in 2016 while in the last three years of 2019 2020 and 2021 the number of studies reduced to 2 in each year this literature survey was necessary to provide researchers with a recent update about the limited number of published studies on this critical issue and the necessity of more investigations about using the md processes to treat water polluted by as since it confirmed its success in some areas to remove as to the recommended value with high efficiency and lower costs other studies have successfully integrated the md processes with alternative energy sources and other studies integrated the fo process as a primary step for md to improve the as separation performance as demonstrated in fig 6 the number of studies used md processes as independent processes for as removal was dominant with 19 studies as for integrating other techniques with the md process 3 studies have successfully integrated solar energy with md processes to reduce energy consumption during the separation process whereas 2 studies used the fo process as a primary step to reduce the as concentration in water before treating in the md process 2 1 as removal process by the md system in the as separation process by the md water polluted by as is fed to the md system at varying rates from 1 5 to 3 l min feed pressure from 1 to 2 bar and temperature ranging from 50 to 90 c to vaporize volatile compounds in the feed solution 36 38 60 61 the temperature difference between both sides of the microporous hydrophobic membrane induces a vapour pressure difference and facilitates vapour movement from the hot feed side to the cold permeate side in a counter current circulation 58 the condensation of the vapours occurs on the permeation side at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 c 58 62 producing pure liquid water it is worth mentioning that the condensation of water vapour in the permeation side of the md depends on the configuration of the md system i e dcmd agmd sgmd and vmd applied during the separation in addition the md process continually operates at a moderate temperature 62 a sketch diagram of as removal by the md process is shown in fig 7 3 recent progress in md membrane types materials modules and fabrication methods polymeric and ceramic membranes are the most common membranes applied in md for as removal from water fig 8 shows the types of hydrophobic membranes used for as removal from water there were only two hydrophobic md membrane types polymeric membranes with 21 studies and ceramic with 2 studies in the literature hydrophobic polymeric membranes are frequently used for as removal these membranes were fabricated using different polymeric materials including ptfe pp polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polyethersulfone pes 63 other studies used a mixture of these polymeric materials such as ptfe with pp to fabricate composite microporous membranes with improved properties of the fabricated membranes 51 64 65 abass et al 64 fabricated a composite microporous polymeric membrane of ptfe and pp and tested it to remove high as concentrations from groundwater using an integrated system of dcmd and an acid purged zero valent iron apz the experiment was conducted at varied feed temperatures from 50 to 80 c and varied cold and hot side stream flow rates of 0 85 and 1 30 l min and 0 22 and 0 76 l min respectively they reported that the integrated system quickly adsorbed and immobilized as compounds from groundwater on the apz at t1 2 30 min and showed a high as rejection performance of over 95 water flux up to 55 5 kg m2 h besides it exhibited a high electrochemical decrease of as v and or as iii to low soluble as 0 furthermore fig 8 shows that the most widely used polymeric materials for fabricating polymeric membranes for as removal are pvdf which accounts for 6 studies of the total published studies the reason behind the high application of pvdf to fabricate polymeric materials is its outstanding properties such as high thermal chemical abrasion high stress non toxic and excellent mechanical properties and low water absorption hydrophobic 66 however these membranes are unsuitable for resistance against strong acid solutions the ptfe is the second highest publication among polymeric materials with 4 studies the fabricated membranes using this material are typically preferred when dealing with aggressive media because the ptfe has a higher resistance to strong acid solutions and lower surface free energy than the pvdf 67 in contrast the pes and pp are less attractive for as removal from water the published studies of the pp account for 2 of the total studies while the pes accounts for about 1 study the few publications using these polymeric materials could be due to the associated disadvantages such as flammability unsuitability in aromatic and chlorinated media poor mechanical strength and difficulty bonding some materials increase their oxidation degradation 68 the rest represents the membranes of ptfe and pp generally the hydrophobic polymeric membranes showed a high rejection performance ranging from 95 to 100 using different md configurations table 4 table 4 shows several hydrophobic polymer membranes tested in different md configurations polymeric membranes fabricated by pvdf represent the most hydrophobic membrane used in the md processes however the dcmd configuration represents the most md configuration used for testing polymeric membranes than the agmd and vmd modules the use of other polymeric membranes such as ptfe pp ptfe pp in the md configurations was low compared to the pvdf moreover the pp and ptfe membranes were the only polymeric membranes tested in the vmd module while the pvdf and ptfe membranes were the only polymeric membranes tested in the agmd leaper et al 77 reported the fabrication method of the polymeric membrane for as removal they used the electrospun technique to prepare the pvdf membrane the dope solution was prepared first by mixing pvdf powder and n ndimethylformamide dmf acetone with a ratio of 1 2 at 40 c for 24 h to ensure a complete polymer dissolving then the doping solution was placed into a syringe pump and the spinning process formed the virgin pvdf membrane fig 9 the precursor pvdf membrane was dried for 24 h at room temperature before sintering in the oven at 170 c for 1 h to enhance its mechanical strength after sintering the fabricated pvdf membrane was used in their study for as removal from water the results showed a complete as rejection and a steady flux of 28 l m2 h over 5 days fig 10 shows the surface of the pvdf hydrophobic membrane after being tested in the md system for as removal for 24 h it is worth mentioning that the electrospinning technique has become the most attractive technique for fabricating polymeric membranes for md systems because it can control the membrane morphology and pore size ranging from nano to micrometres 43 in addition it can produce fibres continuously in large amounts due to the strong electric field applied to the polymeric dope suspension 43 although ceramic membranes have superior advantages over polymeric membranes such as excellent thermal and chemical stabilities resistance to chemicals and organic solvents mechanical strength and temperature resistance pressure resistance life term operation of a decade they are still limited in terms of publications on as removal by md systems 42 58 on the other hand the number of ceramic membranes used for as removal from water by md systems accounts for about 11 due to the high fabrication costs of ceramic membranes 42 although conventional ceramic materials such as alumina silica and zirconia as well as low cost ceramic materials such as natural clay kaoline mullite and waste materials palm oil fuel ash and rice husk ash have been used to fabricate ceramic membranes with excellent properties and high rejection rate up to 100 for other applications such as water treatment and separation 42 the only two ceramic materials used to fabricate the hydrophobic ceramic membranes for as removal by the md systems were agricultural rice husks 79 and kaolin 38 the as rejection rate by these two ceramic membranes was high as seen in table 5 the as rejection performance in drinking water reached 100 less than the recommended limit of as in drinking water these two ceramic membranes were fabricated by phase inversion and sintering techniques the phase inversion method has been widely used to fabricate ceramic membranes due to its superior advantages over other fabrication methods such as slip casting tape casting pressing and extrusion 57 this single step method generates an asymmetric structure with finger like and sponge like voids that improve its ability to separate produce high volumes and fabricate the membranes in a flat disc or hollow fibre form 80 the required structure can be obtained by changing a few fabrication parameters such as air gap distance and bore fluid flow rate fig 11 shows the phase inversion method used for ceramic membrane fabrication hubadillah et al 38 used phase inversion and sintering techniques to fabricate a hydrophobic ceramic hollow fibre membrane using kaolin as a ceramic material the membrane was tested to remove as iii and as v with a concentration of 1000 mg l from water by the dcmd system the feed solution temperature ranged from 40 to 80 c while the permeate side temperature was 10 c the hydrophobic membrane showed complete as removal with a 100 rejection rate hubadillah et al 79 fabricated another ceramic hollow fibre membrane in the same year for as removal using a dcmd system using agricultural rice husk as a ceramic material the phase inversion and sintering technique were also adapted for the fabrication process the fabricated membrane was also tested for as iii and as v with a concentration of 1000 mg l feed temperatures ranged from 50 to 80 c whereas the permeate temperature was maintained at 15 c the membrane achieved high as removal performance up to 100 according to our literature survey in fig 9 only three polymeric and ceramic membrane modules were used in md systems to remove as from water these membrane modules were flat sheet tubular and hollow fibre the flat sheet module was the most frequently used md module as reflected by the 16 studies in the literature in spite of the advantages of the hollow fibre module such as higher rejection performance of up to 99 60 higher surface area to volume ratio lower energy consumption and higher packing density over the flat sheet and tubular modules 79 they only accounted for 3 studies the comparison between these modules is presented in table 6 4 bottlenecks of md for as removal 4 1 hydrophobicity of md membranes the md membranes must be hydrophobic for all md processes since polymeric membranes are hydrophobic in nature while ceramic membranes are hydrophilic in nature thus the surface of the ceramic membranes needs to be modified to hydrophobic properties before being used 79 generally physical and chemical methods are applied to modify the md ceramic membrane surface surface modification by physical methods is achieved by physical processes such as coating or adsorption 42 meanwhile the surface modification by chemical methods comprises applying a chemical reaction on the membrane surface in the existence of a low energy material such as fluoroalkylsilane fas to remove the hydroxyl groups on the membrane surface and reduce the adhesive force between water drops and the membrane surface 81 however the hydrophobic membrane surface is usually exposed to fouling wetting issues due to the high adhesion force between water drops and membrane surfaces which easily accumulate foulants during the long as removal operation the fouling type and the rate of foulants accumulation on the md membrane surface depend on many factors such as operational conditions properties of the hydrophobic layer foulants and feed solution as a result of accumulation fouling on the membrane surface wetting issues occur on the membrane surface and into the membrane pores especially in the existing of low surface tension compounds in the water feed solution causing significant as and other compounds passage affecting the separation function of the md process 42 in addition this critical issue leads to flux reduction a permeate decline an increment of the chemical materials and energy requests increasing the total costs 82 according to our literature survey the preparation of the hydrophobic hollow fibre membrane for as removal from the water by md systems was reported in one publication hubadillah et al 38 fabricated low cost kaolin hollow fibre membrane by phase inversion sintering technique followed by a surface modification to hydrophobic through membrane surface grafting by fas using the immersion grafted technique the membrane was tested in the dcmd system at a feed solution temperature from 40 c to 80 c and a permeate temperature of 10 c the results showed that the hydrophobic hollow fibre membrane had a good liquid entry pressure lep of 2 bar and a good water contact angle of 145 furthermore this hydrophobic membrane demonstrated a high rejection rate for as elements and permeate flux of 28 and 25 kg m2 h for as iii and as v respectively as a result the as concentration in produced water was less than the effluent limit of 10 mg l set by the who 4 2 effect of as concentration and feed solution temperature on the permeation flow in md pal and manna 51 experimentally studied the effects of as concentration in the feed solution on permeation flow during the as removal process they used three hydrophobic membranes flat sheet membranes namely ms3220 ms3020 and ms7020 they were tested by direct contact membrane distillation dcmd at 60 c feed solution temperature their properties are listed in table 7 the results demonstrated that the permeate flow for all membranes was reduced by increasing as concentration in the feed solution from 0 to 1 2 ppm the permeation flow of the ms3220 membrane was reduced by 14 from 27 52 to 23 61 kg m2 h and the permeation flow of the ms3220 membrane was reduced by 13 from 25 23 to 21 85 kg m2 h and the permeation flow of the ms7020 membrane were reduced by 10 from 15 12 to 13 5 kg m2 h moreover the reduction in the permeation flow was attributed to the high accumulation rate of the arsic elements due to their high concentration in the feed solution as well as the accumulation of other heavy contaminations presented in the feed solution on the membrane surface this phenomenon is called concentration polarization concentration polarization is a common issue for membrane based processes this phenomenon usually occurs when the concentration of the rejected solutes gradually increases on the membrane surface causing the concentration accumulation on the membrane bulk side the diffusing flow back to the bulk solution in the membrane bulk side may happen and steady state conditions can be attained due to the gradual reduction of the flow back 83 in addition it was due to the relationship between water activity and the vapour pressure generated in the md this phenomenon was attributed to the as removal process by md increasing the as concentration reduces the water activity of the feed solution and the vapour pressure driving force in addition as elements in the feed solution that shifted boundary layers close to the membrane surface reduced the permeation flow pal 59 also reported that the permeation flux was slightly reduced compared to the permeation flow reduction in the dcmd system for seawater solution in which the salt concentration can reach over 20 000 mg l as a result a pretreatment process is required to remove contaminations from the feed solution and reduce the concentration of the as elements before treatment by the md process to ensure a high as rejection rate however pal et al 52 studied the effects of the feed solution with as elements on the permeation flow using the membrane sheets by dcmd configuration they used different feed temperatures ranging from 303 to 344 k with a distillate temperature of 278 k and distillate velocity of 0 123 m s the as concentration measurement in the feed solution and permeate flow was measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas 100 perkin elmer waltham massachusetts they reported that the permeation flow exponentially increased with the feed solution temperature increased according to the antoine equation increasing the temperatures from 30 to 60 c gradually increased the permeation flow by 81 8 from 2 3 to 23 kg m2 h however increasing the feed temperatures also increased the accumulation of as and other contaminations on the hydrophobic membrane surface as fouling reduced the water permeation flow for a long operation time 4 3 energy consumption by md configurations many md configurations have been applied to produce drinkable water using various ceramic and polymeric membranes generally md configurations have been classified into four categories regarding the permeation collection agmd dcmd vmd and sgmd sweeping gas membrane distillation fig 12 61 the liquid feed is in direct contact with the hot side of the hydrophobic membrane surface during the separation process by all md configurations however the surface condensation where the pure water is collected depends on the md configuration type in the dcmd system the surface condensation is directly in contact with the hydrophobic membrane surface in contrast in the agmd system an air gap separates the surface condensation from the membrane surface nevertheless the surface condensation is separated from the membrane surface by a vacuum in the vmd system while a sweep gas separates surface condensation from the membrane surface in the sgmd system 84 according to the data collected from the web of science three md configurations such as dcmd agmd and vmd have been applied to remove as from water the number of studies that used the dcmd configuration was 19 published studies this number of studies is considerably high compared to agmd and vmd which was with 2 and 1 study respectively the dcmd configuration is preferable due to its outstanding advantages such as a simple module easy control reasonable flux rate and less fouling accumulation during the separation process 58 on the other hand this configuration has a common drawback such as high heat loss by conduction limiting its applications in the as removal process 67 other investigations proposed other md configurations such as agmd and vmd to remove as from water the technological advantage of these configurations is that the air gap and the vacuum provide thermal insulation between the hot and the cold sides decreasing the heat losses by conduction via the membrane matrix and energy consumption during the as separation compared to the dcmd system 67 in contrast the agmd and vmd configurations were more complicated to handle than the dcmd system generally the heat energy consumption by these md systems is still considered high therefore alternative energy sources such as solar energy or waste heat from power plants were proposed to reduce the dcmd dependence on electricity generated from non renewable energy sources and minimize the operational cost 60 as seen in table 8 the dcmd configuration has higher energy consumption than other configurations of agmd and vmd due to the high heat loss by conduction during the separation process it also has higher operating costs due to its higher energy consumption however the agmd and vmd configurations have moderate energy consumption and lower operating costs due to the existing air gap in the agmd and the vacuum in the vmd which work as heat insulation layers reducing the heat loss by conduction 5 technological solutions of md for as removal 5 1 mitigation of fouling on hydrophobic md membrane surface md membranes applied in the as removal processes must have a hydrophobic surface with a high water contact angle and low surface energy 85 however the hydrophobic surface is usually exposed to fouling and wetting during a long md system operation for as removal in addition the loss or damage of the hydrophobic layer on the membrane surface through the as removal process results in high foulants accumulation on the membrane surface 80 these two problems make md less desirable for long time operation therefore to mitigate these issues the hydrophobic md membrane surfaces must be developed with omniphobic or superhydrophobic properties to ensure a long operation with a high as rejection rate in general many techniques have been used to modify the hydrophobic membranes to superhydrophobic omniphobic surfaces including laser processing 86 chemical vapour deposition cvd 87 sol gel 88 chemical etching 89 spray coating 90 and hydrothermal technique 91 the hydrophobic md membrane surface modification also required reducing the membrane surface energy by low surface energy material such as fas to improve the hydrophobicity and the omniphobicity of the md membrane the hydrothermal method is a novel method for membrane surface modification with outstanding properties such as simple low cost easy to control membrane surface appearance by controlling the reaction time and temperature 42 according to our literature survey only one study reported modification of the hydrophobic md membrane surface to a superhydrophobic membrane hubadillah et al 79 modified the hydrophobic md membrane to the superhydrophobic membrane the low cost crystalline rice husk ash csh and amorphous rice husk ash ash were used as ceramic material to fabricate two hydrophobic hollow fibre membranes by phase inversion sintering method and grafted by 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyl triethoxysilane using the immersion grafted method to form a superhydrophobic membranes surfaces the prepared membrane was evaluated via the dcmd system at different feed temperatures of 50 60 70 and 80 c with a permeate temperature of 15 c for 4 h they reported that increasing the feed solution temperature from 50 to 80 c increased the flux from 30 5 to 50 4 30 2 to 51 3 kg m2 h for as iii and as v respectively they also mentioned that the csh hollow fibre and ash hollow fibre membrane showed a high as rejection rate with contact angles of 161 and 157 the optimum as iii and as v flux were 50 4 and 51 3 kg m2 h respectively they also reported that these superhydrophobic membranes could reject the as elements from water to less than the required as contents level of 10 mg l fig 13 shows the sem images with a contact angle of cshfm and ashfm before and after membrane surface modification for as removal from water on the other hand no study has been reported modifying the hydrophobic md membranes to omniphobic properties for as removal despite the advantages of omniphobic membranes over hydrophobic and superhydrophobic membranes such as repelling all liquid drops in aqueous solution such as water low surface energy material oil and alcohol organics and solvents due to its ultra low surface energy and re entrant surface structure 9 moreover it usually shows higher fouling and wetting resistance in long md operating processes due to its self cleaning and strong biofouling resistance 9 67 besides the omniphobic surfaces have oleophobic superhydrophobic properties that improve their stability against fouling and wetting issues 90 compared to conventional hydrophobic superhydrophobic md membranes omniphobic membranes exhibited more robust and stable md in many applications 42 5 2 mitigation of as concentration and feed solution temperature effects on the permeation flow in md by integrating md systems with another as removal technique because md systems are inappropriate for removing high as concentrations in water due to the quick foulants accumulation on the membrane surfaces thus the pretreatment process is required the high costs of the md systems are typically attributed to pretreatment processes required to remove impurities and primarily reduce the as concentration in the feed solution before treating it in the md system the high impurities in the feed solution typically reduce the water permeation flow through the hydrophobic membranes due to their accumulation as fouling on the membrane surface resulting from high as contents and low feed temperature 59 however the pretreatment processes contribute about 60 of the total operational costs as alkhudhiri and hilal 92 reported therefore recently md systems have focused on improvements in the pretreatment process by reducing the high pretreatment costs by integrating with fo ion exchange mf nf or uf as a primary step before separation and treatment by the md system 70 however the fo system was only integrated with the md to form a hybrid md fo system for as removal from water fo md system is more efficient for as removal compared to other membrane methods such as mf nf etc because the feature of the md process which is a hybrid process can remove as iii and as v with about 100 as hubadillah 38 reported thus the advantage of fo in the process is a pretreatment to reduce the concentration of as element and other contaminants before passing to the md process to mitigate the fouling on the membrane surface that could be resulted from the accumulation of as and other elements however integrating the fo with other membrane processes such as mf nf etc is less efficient because for example mf membranes are not highly efficient for arsenic removal because they allow multivalent as and other elements to pass through the membrane pores while the nf have succeeded in arsenate as v ions removal from water almost completely but have not yet performed alone arsenite as iii ion rejection as worou et al 93 reported only two studies have used a hybrid md fo system for as removal from water the md fo hybrid system has several advantages compared to individual use of fo or md systems such as mitigating fouling and wetting due to the removal of target contaminants from the feed at fo upstream continuous flux due to the recovery of the draw solution by the md downstream produced water quality due to the high as removal by md and fo processes and the ambient pressure 94 the as removal using the fo md hybrid system was reported by husnain et al 70 they investigated the effectiveness of a three channel fo md system with pp hydrophobic membrane and flat sheet membrane module to remove as from wastewater the fo was used for pretreatment to eliminate target pollutants in the feed solution whereas md was applied as a recovery system for the solutes drawn from the fo the experiment was performed at a feed temperature of 20 c whereas the temperatures of permeate and draw were varied from 15 to 30 c and 40 70 c respectively the results showed steady water flux for md and fo with high water purity ge et al 69 used the fo md system with pvdf hydrophobic membrane and hollow fibre membranes module to remove as iii with the concentration of 1000 mg l for 48 h operation the feed solution temperature was 20 c whereas the permeate and draw temperatures were 20 c and 50 c respectively they reported a high as rejection rate with effluent of 10 mg l set by the who for drinking water fig 14 shows the diagram of the integrated fo with the md system 5 3 mitigation of high energy consumption by md configurations by integrating md systems with alternative energy sources md is a promising technology for applying alternative energy sources to form integral systems with less energy consumption and a high as removal rate 96 many alternative energy sources can be applied to supply the required energy for the md processes waste heat from plants such as hot gases exhausted from boilers heaters furnaces and heat exchangers can be effectively utilized as alternative heat sources for providing the required heat for md systems besides solar energy types of non concentrating and concentrating collectors can be another possible choice as an alternative energy source various types of solar energy collectors are available in marketplaces 97 98 fixed solar collectors including evacuated solar tubes and flat plates are the most feasible choices as an alternative heat source regarding temperature ranges and costs these types have been effectively applied in many water treatment applications 97 99 100 in addition geothermal energy has been successfully applied to provide thermal heat energy as an alternative to the conventional energy source geothermal energy is usually obtained from the commercially available heat exchangers in the plants such as shell and tube exchanger and plate heat exchangers 97 101 102 all these energy sources can also be integrated with md systems according to the literature solar energy was the only alternative energy source used with the md system for as removal from water md systems driven by solar energy are a practical solution to conventional md systems for removing as with a maximum rejection rate for small scale treatment 51 the solar driven membrane distillation sdmd has been operational in water desalination since the 1960s 59 the first study that used the sdmd system to remove as from the water was reported by pal and manna 51 they used the sdmd system with three flat sheet hydrophobic polymeric membranes and a crossflow to remove as from polluted groundwater all hydrophobic membranes demonstrated a high as removal and the ptfe membrane showed the best flux of 49 80 kg m2 h manna et al 72 used an sdmd system consisting of a dcmd system a pvdf hydrophobic tubular module and a flat sheet cross flow to remove as from the groundwater their study used varied feed solution and distillate temperatures ranging from 30 to 61 c and 12 42 c respectively the sdmd system showed a total as removal with a 100 rejection rate the hydrophobic membrane showed a high flux of 74 and 95 kg m2 h at 40 and 60 c feed solution temperatures pal et al 52 also developed a new sdmd improvement flux system to remove as elements from contaminated groundwater they used different feed temperatures ranging from 30 to 71 c with a distillate temperature of 5 c and distillate velocity of 0 123 m s the new module had a high rejection performance with over 99 as removal and flux of over 50 l m2 h the module could be employed effectively in southeast asia where solar energy is abundantly available manna and pal 71 also proposed a new crossflow flash vaporization md module installed with a hydrophobic ptfe flat sheet membrane in a dcmd system to remove as from groundwater the experiments were performed at different feed solution temperatures from 40 to 71 c via solar heater and 100 l h feed flow rate while permeating side temperature was 21 c the module illustrated as rejection of over 99 and a high flux of 52 94 kg m2 h fig 15 shows the diagram of integrated solar energy with the md system fig 16 summarizes the recent bottlenecks of the md for as removal from water and the recent technological solutions to mitigate these bottlenecks 6 limitations and challenges of md for as removal md separation technique has become a promising and attractive technique due to its remarkable effectiveness in removing as from the surface and the groundwater however the long operation of the md as a separation process is critical and dependent on its economic feasibility md is a non isothermal distillation process requiring low grade heat to generate the driving force some studies have reported that the cost to heat the feed solution is less than the energy cost in other processes such as mf and uf which usually results from the high operating pressures required for the separation process besides md can treat polluted water with higher as concentrations and is less prone to membrane fouling issues which makes it more attractive for economic as removal by distillation processes the high concentration of as in the feed solution decreases the permeation flow and reduces the performance of md for as removal the as concentration level in the feed solution significantly affects the permeation flow the feed solution with a high as concentration usually results in a high as accumulation on the membrane surface as a result the md is inappropriate for treating a feed solution with a high as the concentration of over 2000 mg l 51 the md treated water was polluted by as with concentrations ranging from 40 to 2000 mg l to 10 mg l furthermore treating retentate with the as element represents another challenge due to as toxicity these retentates are environmentally harmful and increase the md s operational costs however unlike the md for seawater desalination of which salt concentration can reach over 20 000 mg l the use of md for as removal is more feasible and appropriate because of the low concentration of as of 1000 mg l the selection of a proper md module depends on the energy consumption by the md module through the as separation the dcmd modules are frequently used in most md applications however they consume higher energy than other md modules due to the high heat loss by conduction as a result new md modules such as agmd and vmd were developed to mitigate this drawback these new modules effectively reduced the heat loss by conduction the unavailability of proper md modules becomes one of its limitations and challenges for commercialization purposes recently integrating the md process with solar energy for as removal from water is not economically attractive for large scale as removal due to the large solar panels required which increases production costs further attempts are required to investigate the possibility of designing new simple md systems with high energy performance and less conduction heat loss in addition using hybrid processes consisting of md with other conventional as removals techniques have increased the production rates purity and rejection performance however the hybrid processes have limitations due to increasing operational and capital costs caused by the additional equipment and chemical materials required for as removal as a result integrating the md with other conventional processes has become challenging due to the need to reduce operational costs while maintaining high as removal the md membrane materials and modules also play important roles in as removal by md selecting appropriate membrane material and modules can effectively increase as rejection and reduce operational costs despite the outstanding properties of ceramic membranes such as high chemical thermal stability high to harsh operating conditions resistance and long operating time they were not widely used for as removal most md membranes were fabricated from polymeric materials additional investigations are required to characterize and understand the properties of ceramic materials to produce ceramic membranes with superior properties for as removal by md comparative studies need to be performed on the ceramic membranes fabricated from low cost alternative materials to determine whether a proper membrane can fulfil the demands of as removal for full scale processes moreover md membrane surfaces with superhydrophobic or omniphobic properties were not applied to the md membranes for as removal as a result md membranes are exposed to fouling and wetting due to their hydrophobicity membrane fouling is difficult to treat when the as concentration is high the drawbacks cause the failure of md modules in the long term and increase the operational costs with respect to washing and cleaning membranes from fouling to overcome the limitations behaviors main causes and treatment of membrane fouling and wetting on the md surfaces need to be completely understood the hollow fibre membrane module has recently been widely applied in an industrial setting this md module can increase the attractiveness of md processes for as removal due to its high production rates low energy consumption and high performance this can also mitigate the limitations of flat sheet modules for as removal conversely applying md systems to full scale as removal elements is still challenging the flow rates of current md systems are low and not applicable to remove as in large amounts therefore heat transfer resistance and vapour transport through md membrane pores need to be developed to improve the permeation flow in md systems 7 opportunities and the way forward of as removal by md technique as removal from water by md techniques has shown slow progress recently due to significant limitations and challenges that restrict their performance mitigating the limitations with technological solutions offers the md system opportunities to effectively remove as from wastewater in areas where polluted water due to as elements are abundantly available integrating md systems with solar energy is a very effective technique for reducing the consumed energy and opens the path for md systems to remove as from water solving clean water crises in poor and countryside areas with inadequate energy sources hybrid md systems are expected to provide clean water in areas that have contaminated water with low as concentrations hybrid md systems could align with the un s sustainability development goal sdg on clean water for all by providing clean water in poor and countryside areas and remote areas as systems for small scale water treatment 8 conclusion this review has demonstrated that md systems have been one of the most effective techniques in as removal to less than recommended concentrations of 10 mg l because of their high rejection rate md systems also require less energy consumption and can be integrated with solar energy to reduce energy consumption furthermore they can be integrated with conventional as removal techniques to form hybrid systems to facilitate high as rejection performance it is evident from the literature survey of 19 published studies 2009 2022 that common md systems applied for as removal were dcmd agmd and vmd the dcmd was the most widely used system due to its simple design and high rejection rates despite its high energy consumption the common hydrophobic membrane material used in md systems was polymers the hydrophobic membranes were usually exposed to fouling and wetting during a long time operation hollow fibre membrane modules were not frequently used for as removal in md systems although they have excellent advantages over flat sheet modules although efforts to improve the md systems for as removal was undertaken by integrating the md systems with conventional techniques using new membrane materials and modules other limitations and challenges still require further investigations and a better understanding of the limitations as most md systems were applied on a laboratory scale additional investigations are required to evaluate the performance of md systems in actual as separation with respect to membrane materials and modules for further improvement declaration of competing

12529,one important way to break the bottleneck of energy conservation and consumption reduction in sewage treatment process is to attenuate the mass transfer resistance which is thought as one of key factors to determine the efficiency of activated sludge treatment system thus in this study two independent anacrobic oxic reactors were operated under low dissolved oxygen do condition to evaluate the effects of low frequency mechanical vibrations on the removal efficiency of pollutants results indicate that 40 hz low frequency mechanical vibration could greatly strengthen the efficiency of pollutants removal microelectrode mass transfer efficiency test platform revealed that 40 hz low frequency mechanical vibration could increase the oxygen transfer coefficient from gas to liquid by approximately 145 19 and oxygen diffusion coefficient from liquid to solid by 75 2 fractal dimension of flocs particle size and zeta potential analyses jointly suggested that low frequency mechanical vibrations treatment can form more adsorption points and mass transfer channels to enhance mass transfer efficiency of oxygen in floc in addition low frequency mechanical vibrations treatment further stimulated the biological activities associated with nitrogen metabolism i e specific metabolism rate metabolism enzyme activities but slightly alerted the overall microbial community the findings in this study suggest that low frequency mechanical vibrations could effectively accelerate the pollutants removal under low do condition by enhancing oxygen transfer coefficient and stimulating the associated biological activities collectively this study provides a new technical strategy for efficiency enhancement and energy conservation in the global sewage treatment industry graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mass transfer efficiency of oxygen low frequency mechanical vibrations lfmvs nitrogen removal specific metabolism rate metabolism enzyme activities data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction sewage treatment is an energy and cost intensive process and aeration accounts for 50 80 of the total energy consumption of the treatment plant 1 2 this high aeration demand in part resulted from the low mass transfer efficiency of non polar oxygen molecules in gas liquid solid systems a large amount of air directly emits from the water without being transferred into flocs resulting in the waste of energy resources furthermore the complex process of transferring oxygen from water into flocs would restrict the biological activity of microorganisms in view of this the sewage treatment plants have to prolong the retention time or enlarge sewage treatment facilities leading to increased construction investment 3 therefore how to reduce the mass transfer resistance of oxygen while strengthening the biological activity of microorganisms during wastewater treatment has always been a hot and difficult research focus in the sewage treatment industry according to the literature the increase of aeration can enhance the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen because high dissolved oxygen concentration at the water interface enables more oxygen molecules to diffuse into sludge floc and participate in the growth and metabolism of microorganisms 4 however this is not an energy efficient strategy alternatively the turbulence with excess air can also promote the mixing and contact between activated sludge and substances e g oxygen pollutants in the sewage 5 which is another strategy to enhance the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen in view of this yan et al used shear force produced from mechanical stirring to increase mass transfer efficiency of oxygen specifically with the shear force increasing from 1 5 10 2 n m2 1 to 5 0 10 2 n m2 1 the cod removal rate increased from 89 4 to 94 0 and the removal rate of nh4 n increased from 93 9 to 98 0 6 however although mechanical stirring could be used to improve the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen the shear force generated was likely to break the flocs resulting in the function detriments of sludge 7 therefore it is still necessary to develop suitable strategies to increase mass transfer efficiency of oxygen as well as improve the biological activity of microorganisms the previous studies showed that low frequency mechanical vibrations lfmvs could also produce disturbance in water forming a small scale turbulent flow in which the mass transfer coefficient could be higher than that in laminar flow or static state 8 9 in contrast to mechanical stirring lfmvs could overcome the detriments induced from the stirring shear force to sludge flocs besides inducing turbulence lfmvs were also able to stimulate cell metabolism 10 11 to illustrate the researchers from medical field applied lfmvs to stimulate the proliferation of human osteoblasts and found that the proliferation of cells was significantly accelerated 10 given these effects of lfmvs on both mass transfer and cell metabolism it is hypothesized that lfmvs could be applicable to the improve pollutants removal efficiency through attenuating mass transfer resistance and enhancing microbial activity however the feasibility and mechanism of application of lfmvs have been rarely reported to improve wastewater treatment efficiency in this study the two a o reactors under different low frequency mechanical vibrations treatment were operated and monitored the impacts of lfmvs on the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen in gas liquid solid systems the fractal dimension particle size and zeta potential of flocs were respectively determined in addition the effects of lfmvs on microbial community and biological activity e g specific metabolism rate metabolism enzyme activities were analyzed the aim of this study is to reveal the feasibility and mechanism to apply lfmvs for the enhancement of wastewater treatment efficiency and thus providing a new insight and theoretical basis for strengthening pollutant removal efficiency and reducing energy consumption in sewage treatment 2 materials and method 2 1 reactor configuration and operating conditions in this study two ao reactors were operated which consist of a 24 0 l anoxic tank 18 8 l working volume a 76 8 l aerobic tank 60 l working volume and a 21 1 l secondary sedimentation tank 15 8 l working volume respectively fig s1 the sludge was inoculated from chongqing jiguanshi sewage treatment plant the synthetic wastewater with the 350 mg l 1 cod table s1 was fed for 60 days until the ao reactor performance became stable hrts of anoxic tank and aerobic tank were 2 80 h and 9 10 h respectively and sludge retention time was maintained at 15 d during the operation the temperature in reactors was controlled at 20 0 1 0 c the aeration rate was approximately 1 0 0 50 l min i e 1 5 0 3 mg l 1 do once the ao reactors performed stably the vibration module was immersed in one of the ao reactors named as z1 given the general ground background with the vibration ranging from 10 hz 60 hz 12 13 thus lfmvs i e 0 hz 10 hz 20 hz 40 hz and 60 hz were applied in this study the corresponding stages were named as p0 p1 p2 p3 and p4 respectively at each stage the operation lasted for 30 days and there were 150 days in total the vibration generator is shown in fig s2 the other ao reactor was operated with the same parameters but the absence of vibration i e z0 the concentrations of cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn in the effluent were sampled every three days and measured triplicate according to the standard methods of american public health association apha 2005 aliquot 500 ml sludge mixture was sampled at the end of each stage for further evaluation 2 2 overall mass transfer of oxygen in sludge mixture 2 2 1 mass transfer coefficient of oxygen between gas liquid phases the overall mass transfer coefficient of oxygen between gas liquid phases k l a was evaluated to describe the gas liquid oxygen exchange rate as depicted in the previous study 14 15 briefly sludge mixture was collected in a 500 ml glass beaker and different lfmvs i e 0 10 20 40 60 hz were applied respectively a microelectrode with 50 μm diameter do 50 unisense denmark for do detection was then fixed in the middle of the glass beaker the initial do value was recorded at 20 c and then deoxidizer i e na2so3 was used to remove the do with 7 9 mg na2so3 1 mg l do ratio to speed up the do removal 1 09 mg l catalyzer i e cocl2 was also added with na2so3 in this study when do concentration reached approximately 0 05 mg l the sludge was aerated at the flow rate of 350 ml min the do content was recorded every 2 s until the do concentration achieved to saturation the variation measurements were conducted in triplicate after the assessment k l a i e 20 c was calculated in formula 15 as follows 1 dc dt k l a c s c where c s refers to the saturation value of stable dissolved oxygen mg l 1 c stands for the concentration of o2 in reactor mg l 1 and k l a represents the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen min 1 after integration there is 2 ln c c k l a t 2 2 2 mass transfer coefficient of oxygen between liquid solid phases the diffusivity of dissolved oxygen between liquid solid was also evaluated by measuring the oxygen concentration change curve as shown in the previous study 16 five milliliter floc was carefully taken out by using a wide mouth pipette which was then placed on the nylon net of the testing chamber as depicted in fig s3 a parallel uniform and upward flow in which a floc could be stabilized in suspension was achieved by using a nylon net tightly fixed in the center of the solution similarly different lfmvs i e 0 10 20 40 60 hz were applied respectively two do microelectrodes were placed in the center and the outer edge of the floc respectively two kinds of distillated water were used in this study including saturated water with oxygen and deoxygenated water with nitrogen before the test the saturated water flowed on the flocs for 30 min followed by deoxygenated water shortly for 5 min after that the water was replaced with saturated water the process was repeated once again and the dissolved oxygen concentration in the floc was recorded by using the micromotor test platform to obtain c in this study the activated sludge floc was perceived as a porous sphere in the diameter of d and the apparent diffusion rate of oxygen decreased the oxygen concentration on the surface of the sphere suddenly changed from c 0 to c 1 t 0 therefore the variation of oxygen concentration in the center of the sphere with time can be expressed as follows 17 3 ln c 0 c 2 c 0 c 1 4 π 2 d app d 2 t where c 0 and c 1 refer to the stable value of dissolved oxygen in floc surface as can be seen from this curve at the rising stage c 0 represents the low do value and c 1 represents the high one at the descending phase c 0 stands for the high do value and c 1 stands for the low one c refers to the dynamic value of do in the floc measured by electrode d app denotes the oxygen diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 d refers to the diameter of sludge nm t denotes the testing time s 2 3 evaluation of sludge physicochemical properties 2 3 1 fractal dimension of flocs at each experimental stage 10 ml of activated sludge from both ao reactors was diluted for 5 times with 1 pbs solution gibco pbs china respectively the morphology of sludge flocs was photographed by using electron microscope with 330 magnification olympus szx16 japan the photographs taken by using electron microscope were first processed using the image pro software and then area a and perimeter p of the flocs were measured based on fractal theory the two dimensional fractal dimension of the activated sludge flocs can be obtained by fitting ln a to ln p with the perimeter area fractal dimension equation 18 19 the details about measurement steps are shown in text s1 of si 2 3 2 eps content in sludge fifty milliliter sludge from section 2 1 was centrifuged at 4000g and 4 c for 5 min the pellet sludge was used to extract the eps based on cation exchange resin 70 g resin g vss sodium ion form 20 50 mesh dowex marathon c usa method as depicted in the previous studies 20 21 after extraction the protein content in eps was analyzed based on a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard 22 the polysaccharide content was determined by using the anthrone sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard 23 2 3 3 particle size distribution of sludge ten

malvern panalytical uk based on manufacturer s protocol 2 3 4 zeta potential of sludge ten milliliter sludge from section 2 1 was collected to measure the zeta potential by using a zetasizer nano mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical uk all the analyses were carried out in triplicate 2 4 assessment of the biological activity of sludge to evaluate the effects of lfmvs on the metabolism of sludge the specific oxygen uptake rate sour specific ammonia oxidation rate saor specific nitrate nitrogen oxidation rate snor specific nitrate reduction rate snrr and specific nitrate nitrogen reduction rate snirr in the denitrification process were measured respectively the measurement methods of these rates were described in detail in text s2 of si besides nitrate reductase nr activity nitrite reductase nir activity nitric oxide reductase nor activity ammonia monooxygenase amo activity and nitrite oxidasereductase nxr activity were measured respectively in triplicate based on a previous protocol 24 electron transport system activity etsa was assessed as described in the previous study 25 more details were described in texts s2 and s3 of si respectively 2 5 analysis of microbial community of sludge the microbial richness and diversity of activated sludge were analyzed by using high throughput sequencing in accordance with the previous study 26 aliquot 2 ml sludge was sampled at the end of each stage the total dna was extracted by using e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s both the quality and quantity of the extracted dna were checked by using nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometers thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments v3 v4 of the extracted dna were amplified by using primers 515f 5 illumina overhang gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa

two tailed t test or one way anova available in spss 2019 the null hypothesis was rejected at the confidence level of 95 i e p value 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 lfmvs improved the reactor performance the daily changes of total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and cod in both the influent and effluent were shown in figs 1 and s4 respectively it was found that lfmvs could distinctly enhance the tn removal to illustrate the tn removal rate at p1 stage in z1 was 65 04 which was 4 45 higher than that at p0 stage with the increase of frequency the average tn removal rate at p2 p3 and p4 stages of z1 reached 73 25 81 78 and 73 30 respectively fig 1a indicating that all lfmvs can enhance tn removal and 40 hz was the optimal value although z0 was found to show a similar enhancing trend it is still possible that nh4 n in the activated sludge system was oxidized by nitrifying bacteria under low oxygen conditions in a short period at the same time low oxygen environment is conducive to improving the denitrification efficiency in the system initiating the formation of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and improving the tn removal efficiency of z0 to a certain extent 31 32 through further comparison between the corresponding stages of z1 and z0 a net increased removal efficiency in tn was observed in z1 indicating that lfmvs have positive influence on reactor performance this observation further confirmed the enhancement of total nitrogen removal induced by vibrations in addition the average cod removal efficiency increased from 90 07 in z0 to 93 71 in z1 after loading lfmvs fig s4a for nitrite because the entire experiment was conducted at low do condition a gradual accumulation of nitrite nitrogen was observed after p2 stage of z0 in contrast the accumulation of nitrite nitrogen was greatly attenuated fig 1b the concentration peaked at 0 28 mg l 1 at p4 stage of z0 and the average concentration was 2 to 3 times of that at the stages of z1 all observations jointly indicated that lfmvs could effectively enhance the pollutants removal of ao reactor however the mechanism of this enhancement was still unclear as shown in the previous study the hydrodynamic shear stress could increase the oxygen diffusion and mitigate the nitrite accumulation 6 it is likely that the shear force caused by lfmvs contributed to the attenuation of nitrite accumulation in this study with both reactors operated at low dissolved oxygen concentration 1 5 0 3 mg l 1 it was reasonable to hypothesize that lfmvs could improve the oxygen utilization which in turn facilitates the biological activities to overcome the detriment of low oxygen content in the reactor 3 2 lfmvs altered mass transfer characteristic of sludge 3 2 1 lfmvs improved mass transfer coefficient of oxygen to verify the above mentioned hypothesis that lfmvs could enhance oxygen utilization the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen from gas to liquid and from liquid to solid under different lfmvs was evaluated as shown in fig 2a and b the time lapsed from the absence of dissolved oxygen to oxygen saturation at p0 stage i e without vibration was longer than these at p1 p4 stages indicating that lfmvs could accelerate the oxygen transfer between gas and liquid by further calculating the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen it can be found that the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen i e k l a from gas to liquid increased with the vibration frequency applied for instance the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen at different stages is sequenced as k l a p3 k l a p2 k l a p4 k l a p1 k l a p0 fig 2b and the p3 stage with the vibration at 40 hz could achieve the highest coefficient i e 0 66 min 1 which is 144 44 higher than that of p0 it is possible that these lfmvs e g 20 hz and 40 hz were close to the resonance frequency of water and the turbulence generated due to the coupling of water and vibration was the strongest thereby improving the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen in water 7 33 34 this observation was further supported by a recent study indicating that lfmvs i e 40 120 hz could enhance mass transfer efficiency of oxygen with reduced bubble size 35 in addition lfmvs also provided a favorable kinetic condition for the smooth entry of do into the activated sludge flocs 36 to illustrate the results of solid liquid diffusion test was shown in fig 2c and d compared with p0 all the diffusion coefficients were enhanced after loading lfmvs as shown in fig 2 the diffusion coefficients are sequenced as d app 40 hz d app 20 hz d app 10 hz d app 60 hz d app 0 hz in particular d app peaked at 4 38 10 12 m2 s 1 under 40 hz lfmvs i e d app p3 which was 1 75 times of that without vibration i e d app p0 similar to k l a evaluation it is also revealed by this d app assessment that the ability of do to pass through the solid liquid boundary region was strengthened under lfmvs and do can diffuse evenly including the probe inside the flocs 37 this enhancement observed may be resulted from the shear force induced by lfmvs yang et al found that shear stress was able to significantly reduce the oxygen transfer resistance within activated sludge flocs resulting in a homogeneous do distribution 8 the observation made by ellenberger et al was also repeated in this study 35 our results along with these findings of earlier studies suggested that lfmvs could efficiently enhance the oxygen transfer from gas to liquid and then to the solid phase i e floc sludge this also explained why no2 n accumulated in z0 instead of z1 the reason may be that the oxidation of no2 n was weakened due to the lack of sufficient oxygen inside the activated sludge flocs at low oxygen concentration for a long time 38 and lfmvs enhanced the oxygen transfer among gas liquid and solid phases which could overcome the low oxygen condition by promoting overall oxygen utilization and then offset the detriments of low aeration to denitrification process 7 33 the improvement of mass transfer efficiency of gas liquid solid systems by lfmvs resulted in higher removal efficiency of total nitrogen fig 1a 3 2 2 lfmvs increased surface roughness of flocs albeit lfmvs were found to be able to enhance the mt of oxygen fig 2 it is still unclear how lfmvs affect the oxygen transfer in gas liquid solid systems fractal dimension is the indicator of sludge floc surface roughness jin et al showed that the value of two dimensional fractal dimension decreased with the increase of the complexity of the geometric boundary of sludge flocs 40 accordingly there were more channels for oxygen and other substances to penetrate into the flocs 41 as shown in table 1 the fractal dimension of the activated sludge flocs under 20 hz i e p2 and 40 hz i e p3 treatment was 1 35 and 1 23 respectively which only accounted for 81 81 and 74 55 of the p0 stage in z1 table 1a this higher roughness under lfmvs could be attributed to the shear force acted on the microenvironment interface due to the fact that the acceleration and amplitude from the excitation source to the vibration receiving point were inconsistent in the liquid phase it can be seen that with the increase of the distance from the vibration source the phase difference will appear at different points and the corresponding acceleration value g will decrease forming a shear force at the microenvironment interface 8 35 yuan et al previously reported that shear force could stimulate the protein containing scaffolds inside eps resulting in the fluffy and porous flocs which could further increase the specific surface area 43 therefore the more complex the fractal the more mass transfer channels can be provided by the specific surface area of the flocs 44 45 in this study more protein in eps was also observed under lfmvs table 2 the surface morphology was reiterated visually by sem images indicating more pore structure on the sludge floc surface fig s5 3 2 3 lfmvs changed the particle size and zeta potential of sludge given that shear force induced by lfmvs could sharpen the sludge and impact the morphology table 1b it is hypothesized in this study that lfmvs would also disturb the particle size of sludge floc as shown in table 1 in accordance with our hypothesis the bulk diameter of the activated sludge in z0 was larger than that in z1 which was treated with lfmvs for example the average particle size of flocs was 134 77 μm under the vibration at 40 hz i e p3 in z1 compared with that in p0 the average particle size under 40 hz lfmv was decreased by 33 38 similarly the smaller particle size could also result in higher specific area of floc thereby benefiting oxygen and substrate distribution homogeneously in addition the smaller the particle size the shorter the mass transfer path and the more pores and adsorption points presented in the activated sludge flocs 9 therefore lfmvs could accelerate oxygen transfer by decreasing the sludge particle size besides particle size the zeta potential of sludge variation under different lfmvs was also assessed li et al suggested that the sludge floc driven by lfmvs turbulence would cut the magnetic field lines to generate electric current leading to more negative zeta potential in sludge 46 this is in agreement with our result and it was found that more negative zeta potential at each stage in z1 was observed in this study compared with the corresponding stage in z0 table 1c zeta potential of sludge plays a crucial role in capturing pollutants in water and thereby speeding up the transfer of substances to bacteria inside the flocs 19 in addition the previous studies have demonstrated that higher zeta potential absolute value could also enlarge the gap of activated sludge flocs due to the repelling of charges which is beneficial to the transfer of dissolved oxygen and substances 1 47 it is likely that this will ultimately increase the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen and improve the reactor performance figs 1 and 2 48 although lfmvs enhanced the metabolic activity of the system microorganisms promoting the substance transfer efficiency of the system further direct measurements of the relevant substance concentrations are still required to illustrate the effects of lfmvs on these metabolites 49 3 3 lfmvs enhanced the biological activity of sludge 3 3 1 lfmvs increased nitrification and denitrification rates considering that the lfmvs could enhance mass transfer coefficient of oxygen and strengthen the total nitrogen removal fig 1 it was hypothesized that the metabolism of the pollutants associated with nitrogen would be reinforced under lfmvs as shown in fig 3 and s6 the saor snor and sour in z0 remained stable during the entire operation process suggesting that the metabolism associated with oxygen and ammonia were consistent without any disturbance in contrast all of saor snor and sour significantly increased under lfmvs anova all p 0 05 and peaked at 40 hz treatment saor snor and sour were respectively 3 55 mg n g mlss h 3 57 mg n g mlss h and 34 41 mg o g mlss h at p3 stage i e 40 hz which were 87 83 26 15 61 63 higher than that of p0 stage i e 0 hz and 42 57 35 74 67 12 higher than that of z0 at the same stages it is likely that lfmvs improved the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen and substrate resulting in more oxygen and substrate i e ammonia permeating into sludge floc therefore higher saor snor and sour were obtained on the other hand it can be found that the metabolizable activity was frequency dependent at the optimal frequency of 40 hz likewise the similar trends of snrr and snirr in z1 were observed fig 3c and d that is 8 80 mg n g mlss h and 9 23 mg n g mlss h compared with that at the p0 stage the increase reached 49 31 and 128 47 respectively this increment could be explained by the more oxygen pretreated and participating in the nitrification process this observation reiterated that lfmvs could efficiently enhance oxygen transfer and promote the total nitrogen removal figs 1 and 2 in addition as shown in fig s6 the degradation rate of cod was 10 26 mg cod g mlss h 1 at 40 hz which was 31 03 higher than that at the initial p0 and 25 58 higher than that at the same stages of z0 respectively it suggested that lfmvs strengthened the ability of microbial metabolism to degrade cod providing more electron donors for the anoxic phase while promoting denitrification moreover the increase of sour and cod degradation rates indicated that lfmvs not only strengthened the metabolic capacity of microbe involved in nitrification and denitrification in activated sludge systems but also stimulated the metabolic activity of microorganisms responsible for organic carbon sources degradation however the results show that lfmvs have no direct strengthening effect on metabolism and the result of this study indicates that lfmvs at appropriate frequencies could promote the oxygen transfer efficiency in the system which further provides sufficient electron acceptors for the oxidative decomposition of organic matter or nitrification in activated sludge therefore it can be concluded that lfmvs could boost the electron transfer in the system favoring the corresponding metabolic activities 3 3 2 lfmvs enhanced functional enzymes activities and etsa microbial enzymatic activity plays a vital role in the determination of nitrification and denitrification rates of activated sludge 50 therefore it is essential to explore the changes of nr nir nor amo and nxr activities under lfmvs it was observed that the activity of the enzymes associated with denitrification i e nr nir and nor in z1 increased with the increase of lfmvs frequency fig 4 in specific the nr activity in z1 first increased from 47 36 u g 1 mlss at the initial stage i e p0 to 192 78 u g 1 mlss in p3 and then decreased to 133 01 u g 1 mlss in p4 likewise the similar enhancements by lfmvs were obtained for nir and nor fig 4b and c through further comparison between the same stages in z0 and z1 it was found that z1 was significantly higher than z0 at the stages of p1 p2 and p3 i e 10 hz 20 hz and 40 hz t test all p 0 05 these observations jointly revealed that lfmvs could effectively enhance the denitrification process it is interesting to see that the microbial enzyme activity for denitrification process in z0 also increased to a certain extent during the test this may be due to that the long term acclimation of denitrifying bacteria in low oxygen environment i e 2 00 mg l 1 the ability of denitrifying bacteria to reduce no3 n and no2 n through organic electron donors was enhanced 51 for oxidase similar enhancing trends on amo and nxr were also observed fig 4d and e however it is worth noting that unlike other enzymes there was a continue decrement of the activity of amo in z0 this decrement may be due to the insufficiency of do in the sewage of the aerobic tank conversely no such decrement but increment was observed under lfmvs in turn indicating that lfmvs could overcome insufficient do condition by enhancing oxygen transfer this result was in agreement with the evaluation of mass transfer efficiency of oxygen fig 2 and further explained the enhancement induced by lfmvs on pollutants removal fig 1 a similar observation was made by lu et al who demonstrated that lfmvs i e 3 hz could enhance respiratory rate electrical conductivity and ethylene biosynthesis related enzyme genes expression in apple 52 unfortunately no assessment was made to determine whether lfmvs could stimulate the enzyme activity in wastewater treatment system the electron transfer process in microbial metabolism would remarkably influence the nitrogen removal performance 53 it was found that with the increase of vibration frequency the etsa of the system increased gradually until reaching the peak at p3 stage however when being loaded with lfmv of 60 hz the etsa of z1 deteriorated fig 4f do acts as an electron acceptor in the systems due to the low do in z0 without lfmvs the produced no3 n and no2 n from the nitrification process were also relatively less resulting in low etsa value in contrast the mass transfer ability of do could be strengthened by using lfmvs higher do would promote the ability to reduce nitrate and nitrite by using organic matter as electron donor therefore the total amount of electron transfer in the system increases resulting in an increase of the etsa of the system coincidentally it was also reported that low current intensity within a certain range could effectively promote the metabolic rate of cod and also improve the metabolic activity of methanogenic bacteria 54 55 3 3 3 lfmvs had slight effects on microbial communities it can be seen from our results that lfmvs could enhance the activity of the enzymes associated with nitrogen fig 4 therefore it was inferred that lfmvs would alter the microbial community in this study the microbial diversity of activated sludge was also evaluated by high throughput sequencing similarities among microbial communities from z0 and z1 are represented graphically in a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plot fig s7 this plot displays each sample as a point in a two dimensional space based on a distance matrix applied to all samples the samples with higher similarity to one another are clustered closer on the mmds plot and vice versa in contrast to our hypothesis high similarity was obtained when comparing z0 and z1 at the same stage except for p4 all anosim r 0 50 fig s7 suggesting that lfmvs failed to change the overall microbial community our observation was different from that of the previous studies which indicated that vibration could change the microbial structure by promoting the accumulation of anammox bacteria e g candidatus kuenenia 33 this discrepancy in observations may be attributed to the different vibrations applied the stable microbial community together with our above mentioned results indicated lfmvs could enhance pollutant removal by increasing the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen and the high oxygen transfer rate further accelerates the microbial enzyme activity without disturbing the microbial community a lot although the enzyme activity has been stimulated implying that the nitrification denitrification pathways have been strengthened this study failed to evaluate the macro omics to elucidate the molecular mechanism of lfmvs on the enhancement of pollutants removal therefore this limitation should be considered in the future studies in addition the transfer efficiency of oxygen was considered only and whether lfmvs could enhance the transfer mechanism for other substrates e g ammonia phosphorus or organics was not included further studies need also conduct directly experiments to elucidate these knowledge gaps 3 4 application prospect using the ever present but neglected energy in nature to improve the efficiency of sewage treatment and thereby reducing the energy consumption is a new perspective and insight for the development of sewage treatment industry as a universal way of energy transmission in nature vibration always occurs around us to illustrate urban traffic or machine running could generate lfmvs suppose we can make use of these vibrations for example in the sewage treatment industry to improve the efficiency of sewage treatment it will be a major innovation in this field the results of this study preliminarily confirmed the feasibility of applying appropriate vibration frequency on sewage treatment and the possibility of conserving energy i e overcoming low do through vibration frequency with the progress of follow up research it will more scientifically and deeply reveal the mechanism providing the theoretical basis and key parameters for future engineering application and breaking the bottleneck of high energy consumption in sewage treatment overall this study provides a new potential solution and technical strategy for energy conservation and emission reduction in the global sewage treatment industry 4 conclusion the findings of this study suggest that lfmvs can be used as a potentially effective strategy to enhance nitrogen removal efficiency in sewage treatment process in the present of lfmvs the mass transfer of oxygen was enhanced the analyses of the physicochemical characteristics of activated sludge showed that higher roughness zeta potential and smaller particle size under lfmvs treatment jointly provided more adsorption points and mass transfer channels on the floc surface which explains the higher mass transferring efficiency of oxygen in addition our results further illustrated that lfmvs treatment could improve metabolism rate and the corresponding enzyme activities associated with nitrogen although there are no apparent effects on the microbial communities our observations collectively proved the potential

12529,one important way to break the bottleneck of energy conservation and consumption reduction in sewage treatment process is to attenuate the mass transfer resistance which is thought as one of key factors to determine the efficiency of activated sludge treatment system thus in this study two independent anacrobic oxic reactors were operated under low dissolved oxygen do condition to evaluate the effects of low frequency mechanical vibrations on the removal efficiency of pollutants results indicate that 40 hz low frequency mechanical vibration could greatly strengthen the efficiency of pollutants removal microelectrode mass transfer efficiency test platform revealed that 40 hz low frequency mechanical vibration could increase the oxygen transfer coefficient from gas to liquid by approximately 145 19 and oxygen diffusion coefficient from liquid to solid by 75 2 fractal dimension of flocs particle size and zeta potential analyses jointly suggested that low frequency mechanical vibrations treatment can form more adsorption points and mass transfer channels to enhance mass transfer efficiency of oxygen in floc in addition low frequency mechanical vibrations treatment further stimulated the biological activities associated with nitrogen metabolism i e specific metabolism rate metabolism enzyme activities but slightly alerted the overall microbial community the findings in this study suggest that low frequency mechanical vibrations could effectively accelerate the pollutants removal under low do condition by enhancing oxygen transfer coefficient and stimulating the associated biological activities collectively this study provides a new technical strategy for efficiency enhancement and energy conservation in the global sewage treatment industry graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mass transfer efficiency of oxygen low frequency mechanical vibrations lfmvs nitrogen removal specific metabolism rate metabolism enzyme activities data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction sewage treatment is an energy and cost intensive process and aeration accounts for 50 80 of the total energy consumption of the treatment plant 1 2 this high aeration demand in part resulted from the low mass transfer efficiency of non polar oxygen molecules in gas liquid solid systems a large amount of air directly emits from the water without being transferred into flocs resulting in the waste of energy resources furthermore the complex process of transferring oxygen from water into flocs would restrict the biological activity of microorganisms in view of this the sewage treatment plants have to prolong the retention time or enlarge sewage treatment facilities leading to increased construction investment 3 therefore how to reduce the mass transfer resistance of oxygen while strengthening the biological activity of microorganisms during wastewater treatment has always been a hot and difficult research focus in the sewage treatment industry according to the literature the increase of aeration can enhance the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen because high dissolved oxygen concentration at the water interface enables more oxygen molecules to diffuse into sludge floc and participate in the growth and metabolism of microorganisms 4 however this is not an energy efficient strategy alternatively the turbulence with excess air can also promote the mixing and contact between activated sludge and substances e g oxygen pollutants in the sewage 5 which is another strategy to enhance the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen in view of this yan et al used shear force produced from mechanical stirring to increase mass transfer efficiency of oxygen specifically with the shear force increasing from 1 5 10 2 n m2 1 to 5 0 10 2 n m2 1 the cod removal rate increased from 89 4 to 94 0 and the removal rate of nh4 n increased from 93 9 to 98 0 6 however although mechanical stirring could be used to improve the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen the shear force generated was likely to break the flocs resulting in the function detriments of sludge 7 therefore it is still necessary to develop suitable strategies to increase mass transfer efficiency of oxygen as well as improve the biological activity of microorganisms the previous studies showed that low frequency mechanical vibrations lfmvs could also produce disturbance in water forming a small scale turbulent flow in which the mass transfer coefficient could be higher than that in laminar flow or static state 8 9 in contrast to mechanical stirring lfmvs could overcome the detriments induced from the stirring shear force to sludge flocs besides inducing turbulence lfmvs were also able to stimulate cell metabolism 10 11 to illustrate the researchers from medical field applied lfmvs to stimulate the proliferation of human osteoblasts and found that the proliferation of cells was significantly accelerated 10 given these effects of lfmvs on both mass transfer and cell metabolism it is hypothesized that lfmvs could be applicable to the improve pollutants removal efficiency through attenuating mass transfer resistance and enhancing microbial activity however the feasibility and mechanism of application of lfmvs have been rarely reported to improve wastewater treatment efficiency in this study the two a o reactors under different low frequency mechanical vibrations treatment were operated and monitored the impacts of lfmvs on the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen in gas liquid solid systems the fractal dimension particle size and zeta potential of flocs were respectively determined in addition the effects of lfmvs on microbial community and biological activity e g specific metabolism rate metabolism enzyme activities were analyzed the aim of this study is to reveal the feasibility and mechanism to apply lfmvs for the enhancement of wastewater treatment efficiency and thus providing a new insight and theoretical basis for strengthening pollutant removal efficiency and reducing energy consumption in sewage treatment 2 materials and method 2 1 reactor configuration and operating conditions in this study two ao reactors were operated which consist of a 24 0 l anoxic tank 18 8 l working volume a 76 8 l aerobic tank 60 l working volume and a 21 1 l secondary sedimentation tank 15 8 l working volume respectively fig s1 the sludge was inoculated from chongqing jiguanshi sewage treatment plant the synthetic wastewater with the 350 mg l 1 cod table s1 was fed for 60 days until the ao reactor performance became stable hrts of anoxic tank and aerobic tank were 2 80 h and 9 10 h respectively and sludge retention time was maintained at 15 d during the operation the temperature in reactors was controlled at 20 0 1 0 c the aeration rate was approximately 1 0 0 50 l min i e 1 5 0 3 mg l 1 do once the ao reactors performed stably the vibration module was immersed in one of the ao reactors named as z1 given the general ground background with the vibration ranging from 10 hz 60 hz 12 13 thus lfmvs i e 0 hz 10 hz 20 hz 40 hz and 60 hz were applied in this study the corresponding stages were named as p0 p1 p2 p3 and p4 respectively at each stage the operation lasted for 30 days and there were 150 days in total the vibration generator is shown in fig s2 the other ao reactor was operated with the same parameters but the absence of vibration i e z0 the concentrations of cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn in the effluent were sampled every three days and measured triplicate according to the standard methods of american public health association apha 2005 aliquot 500 ml sludge mixture was sampled at the end of each stage for further evaluation 2 2 overall mass transfer of oxygen in sludge mixture 2 2 1 mass transfer coefficient of oxygen between gas liquid phases the overall mass transfer coefficient of oxygen between gas liquid phases k l a was evaluated to describe the gas liquid oxygen exchange rate as depicted in the previous study 14 15 briefly sludge mixture was collected in a 500 ml glass beaker and different lfmvs i e 0 10 20 40 60 hz were applied respectively a microelectrode with 50 μm diameter do 50 unisense denmark for do detection was then fixed in the middle of the glass beaker the initial do value was recorded at 20 c and then deoxidizer i e na2so3 was used to remove the do with 7 9 mg na2so3 1 mg l do ratio to speed up the do removal 1 09 mg l catalyzer i e cocl2 was also added with na2so3 in this study when do concentration reached approximately 0 05 mg l the sludge was aerated at the flow rate of 350 ml min the do content was recorded every 2 s until the do concentration achieved to saturation the variation measurements were conducted in triplicate after the assessment k l a i e 20 c was calculated in formula 15 as follows 1 dc dt k l a c s c where c s refers to the saturation value of stable dissolved oxygen mg l 1 c stands for the concentration of o2 in reactor mg l 1 and k l a represents the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen min 1 after integration there is 2 ln c c k l a t 2 2 2 mass transfer coefficient of oxygen between liquid solid phases the diffusivity of dissolved oxygen between liquid solid was also evaluated by measuring the oxygen concentration change curve as shown in the previous study 16 five milliliter floc was carefully taken out by using a wide mouth pipette which was then placed on the nylon net of the testing chamber as depicted in fig s3 a parallel uniform and upward flow in which a floc could be stabilized in suspension was achieved by using a nylon net tightly fixed in the center of the solution similarly different lfmvs i e 0 10 20 40 60 hz were applied respectively two do microelectrodes were placed in the center and the outer edge of the floc respectively two kinds of distillated water were used in this study including saturated water with oxygen and deoxygenated water with nitrogen before the test the saturated water flowed on the flocs for 30 min followed by deoxygenated water shortly for 5 min after that the water was replaced with saturated water the process was repeated once again and the dissolved oxygen concentration in the floc was recorded by using the micromotor test platform to obtain c in this study the activated sludge floc was perceived as a porous sphere in the diameter of d and the apparent diffusion rate of oxygen decreased the oxygen concentration on the surface of the sphere suddenly changed from c 0 to c 1 t 0 therefore the variation of oxygen concentration in the center of the sphere with time can be expressed as follows 17 3 ln c 0 c 2 c 0 c 1 4 π 2 d app d 2 t where c 0 and c 1 refer to the stable value of dissolved oxygen in floc surface as can be seen from this curve at the rising stage c 0 represents the low do value and c 1 represents the high one at the descending phase c 0 stands for the high do value and c 1 stands for the low one c refers to the dynamic value of do in the floc measured by electrode d app denotes the oxygen diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 d refers to the diameter of sludge nm t denotes the testing time s 2 3 evaluation of sludge physicochemical properties 2 3 1 fractal dimension of flocs at each experimental stage 10 ml of activated sludge from both ao reactors was diluted for 5 times with 1 pbs solution gibco pbs china respectively the morphology of sludge flocs was photographed by using electron microscope with 330 magnification olympus szx16 japan the photographs taken by using electron microscope were first processed using the image pro software and then area a and perimeter p of the flocs were measured based on fractal theory the two dimensional fractal dimension of the activated sludge flocs can be obtained by fitting ln a to ln p with the perimeter area fractal dimension equation 18 19 the details about measurement steps are shown in text s1 of si 2 3 2 eps content in sludge fifty milliliter sludge from section 2 1 was centrifuged at 4000g and 4 c for 5 min the pellet sludge was used to extract the eps based on cation exchange resin 70 g resin g vss sodium ion form 20 50 mesh dowex marathon c usa method as depicted in the previous studies 20 21 after extraction the protein content in eps was analyzed based on a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin as the standard 22 the polysaccharide content was determined by using the anthrone sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard 23 2 3 3 particle size distribution of sludge ten

malvern panalytical uk based on manufacturer s protocol 2 3 4 zeta potential of sludge ten milliliter sludge from section 2 1 was collected to measure the zeta potential by using a zetasizer nano mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical uk all the analyses were carried out in triplicate 2 4 assessment of the biological activity of sludge to evaluate the effects of lfmvs on the metabolism of sludge the specific oxygen uptake rate sour specific ammonia oxidation rate saor specific nitrate nitrogen oxidation rate snor specific nitrate reduction rate snrr and specific nitrate nitrogen reduction rate snirr in the denitrification process were measured respectively the measurement methods of these rates were described in detail in text s2 of si besides nitrate reductase nr activity nitrite reductase nir activity nitric oxide reductase nor activity ammonia monooxygenase amo activity and nitrite oxidasereductase nxr activity were measured respectively in triplicate based on a previous protocol 24 electron transport system activity etsa was assessed as described in the previous study 25 more details were described in texts s2 and s3 of si respectively 2 5 analysis of microbial community of sludge the microbial richness and diversity of activated sludge were analyzed by using high throughput sequencing in accordance with the previous study 26 aliquot 2 ml sludge was sampled at the end of each stage the total dna was extracted by using e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s both the quality and quantity of the extracted dna were checked by using nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometers thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments v3 v4 of the extracted dna were amplified by using primers 515f 5 illumina overhang gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa

two tailed t test or one way anova available in spss 2019 the null hypothesis was rejected at the confidence level of 95 i e p value 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 lfmvs improved the reactor performance the daily changes of total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and cod in both the influent and effluent were shown in figs 1 and s4 respectively it was found that lfmvs could distinctly enhance the tn removal to illustrate the tn removal rate at p1 stage in z1 was 65 04 which was 4 45 higher than that at p0 stage with the increase of frequency the average tn removal rate at p2 p3 and p4 stages of z1 reached 73 25 81 78 and 73 30 respectively fig 1a indicating that all lfmvs can enhance tn removal and 40 hz was the optimal value although z0 was found to show a similar enhancing trend it is still possible that nh4 n in the activated sludge system was oxidized by nitrifying bacteria under low oxygen conditions in a short period at the same time low oxygen environment is conducive to improving the denitrification efficiency in the system initiating the formation of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and improving the tn removal efficiency of z0 to a certain extent 31 32 through further comparison between the corresponding stages of z1 and z0 a net increased removal efficiency in tn was observed in z1 indicating that lfmvs have positive influence on reactor performance this observation further confirmed the enhancement of total nitrogen removal induced by vibrations in addition the average cod removal efficiency increased from 90 07 in z0 to 93 71 in z1 after loading lfmvs fig s4a for nitrite because the entire experiment was conducted at low do condition a gradual accumulation of nitrite nitrogen was observed after p2 stage of z0 in contrast the accumulation of nitrite nitrogen was greatly attenuated fig 1b the concentration peaked at 0 28 mg l 1 at p4 stage of z0 and the average concentration was 2 to 3 times of that at the stages of z1 all observations jointly indicated that lfmvs could effectively enhance the pollutants removal of ao reactor however the mechanism of this enhancement was still unclear as shown in the previous study the hydrodynamic shear stress could increase the oxygen diffusion and mitigate the nitrite accumulation 6 it is likely that the shear force caused by lfmvs contributed to the attenuation of nitrite accumulation in this study with both reactors operated at low dissolved oxygen concentration 1 5 0 3 mg l 1 it was reasonable to hypothesize that lfmvs could improve the oxygen utilization which in turn facilitates the biological activities to overcome the detriment of low oxygen content in the reactor 3 2 lfmvs altered mass transfer characteristic of sludge 3 2 1 lfmvs improved mass transfer coefficient of oxygen to verify the above mentioned hypothesis that lfmvs could enhance oxygen utilization the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen from gas to liquid and from liquid to solid under different lfmvs was evaluated as shown in fig 2a and b the time lapsed from the absence of dissolved oxygen to oxygen saturation at p0 stage i e without vibration was longer than these at p1 p4 stages indicating that lfmvs could accelerate the oxygen transfer between gas and liquid by further calculating the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen it can be found that the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen i e k l a from gas to liquid increased with the vibration frequency applied for instance the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen at different stages is sequenced as k l a p3 k l a p2 k l a p4 k l a p1 k l a p0 fig 2b and the p3 stage with the vibration at 40 hz could achieve the highest coefficient i e 0 66 min 1 which is 144 44 higher than that of p0 it is possible that these lfmvs e g 20 hz and 40 hz were close to the resonance frequency of water and the turbulence generated due to the coupling of water and vibration was the strongest thereby improving the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen in water 7 33 34 this observation was further supported by a recent study indicating that lfmvs i e 40 120 hz could enhance mass transfer efficiency of oxygen with reduced bubble size 35 in addition lfmvs also provided a favorable kinetic condition for the smooth entry of do into the activated sludge flocs 36 to illustrate the results of solid liquid diffusion test was shown in fig 2c and d compared with p0 all the diffusion coefficients were enhanced after loading lfmvs as shown in fig 2 the diffusion coefficients are sequenced as d app 40 hz d app 20 hz d app 10 hz d app 60 hz d app 0 hz in particular d app peaked at 4 38 10 12 m2 s 1 under 40 hz lfmvs i e d app p3 which was 1 75 times of that without vibration i e d app p0 similar to k l a evaluation it is also revealed by this d app assessment that the ability of do to pass through the solid liquid boundary region was strengthened under lfmvs and do can diffuse evenly including the probe inside the flocs 37 this enhancement observed may be resulted from the shear force induced by lfmvs yang et al found that shear stress was able to significantly reduce the oxygen transfer resistance within activated sludge flocs resulting in a homogeneous do distribution 8 the observation made by ellenberger et al was also repeated in this study 35 our results along with these findings of earlier studies suggested that lfmvs could efficiently enhance the oxygen transfer from gas to liquid and then to the solid phase i e floc sludge this also explained why no2 n accumulated in z0 instead of z1 the reason may be that the oxidation of no2 n was weakened due to the lack of sufficient oxygen inside the activated sludge flocs at low oxygen concentration for a long time 38 and lfmvs enhanced the oxygen transfer among gas liquid and solid phases which could overcome the low oxygen condition by promoting overall oxygen utilization and then offset the detriments of low aeration to denitrification process 7 33 the improvement of mass transfer efficiency of gas liquid solid systems by lfmvs resulted in higher removal efficiency of total nitrogen fig 1a 3 2 2 lfmvs increased surface roughness of flocs albeit lfmvs were found to be able to enhance the mt of oxygen fig 2 it is still unclear how lfmvs affect the oxygen transfer in gas liquid solid systems fractal dimension is the indicator of sludge floc surface roughness jin et al showed that the value of two dimensional fractal dimension decreased with the increase of the complexity of the geometric boundary of sludge flocs 40 accordingly there were more channels for oxygen and other substances to penetrate into the flocs 41 as shown in table 1 the fractal dimension of the activated sludge flocs under 20 hz i e p2 and 40 hz i e p3 treatment was 1 35 and 1 23 respectively which only accounted for 81 81 and 74 55 of the p0 stage in z1 table 1a this higher roughness under lfmvs could be attributed to the shear force acted on the microenvironment interface due to the fact that the acceleration and amplitude from the excitation source to the vibration receiving point were inconsistent in the liquid phase it can be seen that with the increase of the distance from the vibration source the phase difference will appear at different points and the corresponding acceleration value g will decrease forming a shear force at the microenvironment interface 8 35 yuan et al previously reported that shear force could stimulate the protein containing scaffolds inside eps resulting in the fluffy and porous flocs which could further increase the specific surface area 43 therefore the more complex the fractal the more mass transfer channels can be provided by the specific surface area of the flocs 44 45 in this study more protein in eps was also observed under lfmvs table 2 the surface morphology was reiterated visually by sem images indicating more pore structure on the sludge floc surface fig s5 3 2 3 lfmvs changed the particle size and zeta potential of sludge given that shear force induced by lfmvs could sharpen the sludge and impact the morphology table 1b it is hypothesized in this study that lfmvs would also disturb the particle size of sludge floc as shown in table 1 in accordance with our hypothesis the bulk diameter of the activated sludge in z0 was larger than that in z1 which was treated with lfmvs for example the average particle size of flocs was 134 77 μm under the vibration at 40 hz i e p3 in z1 compared with that in p0 the average particle size under 40 hz lfmv was decreased by 33 38 similarly the smaller particle size could also result in higher specific area of floc thereby benefiting oxygen and substrate distribution homogeneously in addition the smaller the particle size the shorter the mass transfer path and the more pores and adsorption points presented in the activated sludge flocs 9 therefore lfmvs could accelerate oxygen transfer by decreasing the sludge particle size besides particle size the zeta potential of sludge variation under different lfmvs was also assessed li et al suggested that the sludge floc driven by lfmvs turbulence would cut the magnetic field lines to generate electric current leading to more negative zeta potential in sludge 46 this is in agreement with our result and it was found that more negative zeta potential at each stage in z1 was observed in this study compared with the corresponding stage in z0 table 1c zeta potential of sludge plays a crucial role in capturing pollutants in water and thereby speeding up the transfer of substances to bacteria inside the flocs 19 in addition the previous studies have demonstrated that higher zeta potential absolute value could also enlarge the gap of activated sludge flocs due to the repelling of charges which is beneficial to the transfer of dissolved oxygen and substances 1 47 it is likely that this will ultimately increase the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen and improve the reactor performance figs 1 and 2 48 although lfmvs enhanced the metabolic activity of the system microorganisms promoting the substance transfer efficiency of the system further direct measurements of the relevant substance concentrations are still required to illustrate the effects of lfmvs on these metabolites 49 3 3 lfmvs enhanced the biological activity of sludge 3 3 1 lfmvs increased nitrification and denitrification rates considering that the lfmvs could enhance mass transfer coefficient of oxygen and strengthen the total nitrogen removal fig 1 it was hypothesized that the metabolism of the pollutants associated with nitrogen would be reinforced under lfmvs as shown in fig 3 and s6 the saor snor and sour in z0 remained stable during the entire operation process suggesting that the metabolism associated with oxygen and ammonia were consistent without any disturbance in contrast all of saor snor and sour significantly increased under lfmvs anova all p 0 05 and peaked at 40 hz treatment saor snor and sour were respectively 3 55 mg n g mlss h 3 57 mg n g mlss h and 34 41 mg o g mlss h at p3 stage i e 40 hz which were 87 83 26 15 61 63 higher than that of p0 stage i e 0 hz and 42 57 35 74 67 12 higher than that of z0 at the same stages it is likely that lfmvs improved the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen and substrate resulting in more oxygen and substrate i e ammonia permeating into sludge floc therefore higher saor snor and sour were obtained on the other hand it can be found that the metabolizable activity was frequency dependent at the optimal frequency of 40 hz likewise the similar trends of snrr and snirr in z1 were observed fig 3c and d that is 8 80 mg n g mlss h and 9 23 mg n g mlss h compared with that at the p0 stage the increase reached 49 31 and 128 47 respectively this increment could be explained by the more oxygen pretreated and participating in the nitrification process this observation reiterated that lfmvs could efficiently enhance oxygen transfer and promote the total nitrogen removal figs 1 and 2 in addition as shown in fig s6 the degradation rate of cod was 10 26 mg cod g mlss h 1 at 40 hz which was 31 03 higher than that at the initial p0 and 25 58 higher than that at the same stages of z0 respectively it suggested that lfmvs strengthened the ability of microbial metabolism to degrade cod providing more electron donors for the anoxic phase while promoting denitrification moreover the increase of sour and cod degradation rates indicated that lfmvs not only strengthened the metabolic capacity of microbe involved in nitrification and denitrification in activated sludge systems but also stimulated the metabolic activity of microorganisms responsible for organic carbon sources degradation however the results show that lfmvs have no direct strengthening effect on metabolism and the result of this study indicates that lfmvs at appropriate frequencies could promote the oxygen transfer efficiency in the system which further provides sufficient electron acceptors for the oxidative decomposition of organic matter or nitrification in activated sludge therefore it can be concluded that lfmvs could boost the electron transfer in the system favoring the corresponding metabolic activities 3 3 2 lfmvs enhanced functional enzymes activities and etsa microbial enzymatic activity plays a vital role in the determination of nitrification and denitrification rates of activated sludge 50 therefore it is essential to explore the changes of nr nir nor amo and nxr activities under lfmvs it was observed that the activity of the enzymes associated with denitrification i e nr nir and nor in z1 increased with the increase of lfmvs frequency fig 4 in specific the nr activity in z1 first increased from 47 36 u g 1 mlss at the initial stage i e p0 to 192 78 u g 1 mlss in p3 and then decreased to 133 01 u g 1 mlss in p4 likewise the similar enhancements by lfmvs were obtained for nir and nor fig 4b and c through further comparison between the same stages in z0 and z1 it was found that z1 was significantly higher than z0 at the stages of p1 p2 and p3 i e 10 hz 20 hz and 40 hz t test all p 0 05 these observations jointly revealed that lfmvs could effectively enhance the denitrification process it is interesting to see that the microbial enzyme activity for denitrification process in z0 also increased to a certain extent during the test this may be due to that the long term acclimation of denitrifying bacteria in low oxygen environment i e 2 00 mg l 1 the ability of denitrifying bacteria to reduce no3 n and no2 n through organic electron donors was enhanced 51 for oxidase similar enhancing trends on amo and nxr were also observed fig 4d and e however it is worth noting that unlike other enzymes there was a continue decrement of the activity of amo in z0 this decrement may be due to the insufficiency of do in the sewage of the aerobic tank conversely no such decrement but increment was observed under lfmvs in turn indicating that lfmvs could overcome insufficient do condition by enhancing oxygen transfer this result was in agreement with the evaluation of mass transfer efficiency of oxygen fig 2 and further explained the enhancement induced by lfmvs on pollutants removal fig 1 a similar observation was made by lu et al who demonstrated that lfmvs i e 3 hz could enhance respiratory rate electrical conductivity and ethylene biosynthesis related enzyme genes expression in apple 52 unfortunately no assessment was made to determine whether lfmvs could stimulate the enzyme activity in wastewater treatment system the electron transfer process in microbial metabolism would remarkably influence the nitrogen removal performance 53 it was found that with the increase of vibration frequency the etsa of the system increased gradually until reaching the peak at p3 stage however when being loaded with lfmv of 60 hz the etsa of z1 deteriorated fig 4f do acts as an electron acceptor in the systems due to the low do in z0 without lfmvs the produced no3 n and no2 n from the nitrification process were also relatively less resulting in low etsa value in contrast the mass transfer ability of do could be strengthened by using lfmvs higher do would promote the ability to reduce nitrate and nitrite by using organic matter as electron donor therefore the total amount of electron transfer in the system increases resulting in an increase of the etsa of the system coincidentally it was also reported that low current intensity within a certain range could effectively promote the metabolic rate of cod and also improve the metabolic activity of methanogenic bacteria 54 55 3 3 3 lfmvs had slight effects on microbial communities it can be seen from our results that lfmvs could enhance the activity of the enzymes associated with nitrogen fig 4 therefore it was inferred that lfmvs would alter the microbial community in this study the microbial diversity of activated sludge was also evaluated by high throughput sequencing similarities among microbial communities from z0 and z1 are represented graphically in a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plot fig s7 this plot displays each sample as a point in a two dimensional space based on a distance matrix applied to all samples the samples with higher similarity to one another are clustered closer on the mmds plot and vice versa in contrast to our hypothesis high similarity was obtained when comparing z0 and z1 at the same stage except for p4 all anosim r 0 50 fig s7 suggesting that lfmvs failed to change the overall microbial community our observation was different from that of the previous studies which indicated that vibration could change the microbial structure by promoting the accumulation of anammox bacteria e g candidatus kuenenia 33 this discrepancy in observations may be attributed to the different vibrations applied the stable microbial community together with our above mentioned results indicated lfmvs could enhance pollutant removal by increasing the mass transfer efficiency of oxygen and the high oxygen transfer rate further accelerates the microbial enzyme activity without disturbing the microbial community a lot although the enzyme activity has been stimulated implying that the nitrification denitrification pathways have been strengthened this study failed to evaluate the macro omics to elucidate the molecular mechanism of lfmvs on the enhancement of pollutants removal therefore this limitation should be considered in the future studies in addition the transfer efficiency of oxygen was considered only and whether lfmvs could enhance the transfer mechanism for other substrates e g ammonia phosphorus or organics was not included further studies need also conduct directly experiments to elucidate these knowledge gaps 3 4 application prospect using the ever present but neglected energy in nature to improve the efficiency of sewage treatment and thereby reducing the energy consumption is a new perspective and insight for the development of sewage treatment industry as a universal way of energy transmission in nature vibration always occurs around us to illustrate urban traffic or machine running could generate lfmvs suppose we can make use of these vibrations for example in the sewage treatment industry to improve the efficiency of sewage treatment it will be a major innovation in this field the results of this study preliminarily confirmed the feasibility of applying appropriate vibration frequency on sewage treatment and the possibility of conserving energy i e overcoming low do through vibration frequency with the progress of follow up research it will more scientifically and deeply reveal the mechanism providing the theoretical basis and key parameters for future engineering application and breaking the bottleneck of high energy consumption in sewage treatment overall this study provides a new potential solution and technical strategy for energy conservation and emission reduction in the global sewage treatment industry 4 conclusion the findings of this study suggest that lfmvs can be used as a potentially effective strategy to enhance nitrogen removal efficiency in sewage treatment process in the present of lfmvs the mass transfer of oxygen was enhanced the analyses of the physicochemical characteristics of activated sludge showed that higher roughness zeta potential and smaller particle size under lfmvs treatment jointly provided more adsorption points and mass transfer channels on the floc surface which explains the higher mass transferring efficiency of oxygen in addition our results further illustrated that lfmvs treatment could improve metabolism rate and the corresponding enzyme activities associated with nitrogen although there are no apparent effects on the microbial communities our observations collectively proved the potential and feasibility of the application of lfmvs in wastewater treatment for efficiency enhancement and energy conservation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
