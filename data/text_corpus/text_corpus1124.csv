proportional to rainfall however in catchments where infiltration occurs through the pavement surface this assumption may not be valid furthermore many researchers have concluded that the effect of rain impaction related to rain intensity should be considered as a separate model parameter to runoff rate to address this problem a semi deterministic stormwater quality model was developed which incorporated rain intensity directly in the exponential wash off equation the modified function was compared to the more classical wash off equation using a dataset of 18 storm events sampled from a separate pipe and gully system in dublin ireland the modified wash off equation showed a consistent improvement in the fit of observed ss fluxes at the outlet of the drainage system the nash sutcliffe

extensive research of soil erosion suggests that the two key energy inputs in solids wash off comprise of raindrop impaction and the shear stress of overland flow and these inputs should be considered separately shaw et al 2006 brodie and rosewell 2007 kinnell 2009 the rain kinetic energy ek available for particle detachment has been related to the rain intensity by a number of researchers and applied successfully to urban catchments wischmeier and smith 1978 proposed a logarithmic expression whereby increases in rain intensity reached an asymptotic value of ek van dijk et al 2002 reported a similar relationship using an exponential formulation brodie 2007 applied the concept of rain impaction energy in estimating stormwater wash off loads from small impervious plots where ek values derived from van dijk et al 2002 were well correlated with the sum of the 6 minute rain intensity squared i6 2 this value was factored by the peak 6 minute rain intensity of the event which accounted for overland flow the times of concentration of the catchments were approximately 6 min and divided by the event duration the resulting composite index referred to as the rainfall detachment index rdi was similar to the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 developed for soil erosion estimation the main difference being the rain interval considered was longer for the usle 30 vs 6 min indicative of the greater time of concentration of the natural catchments studied for the usle the rdi accounted for 86 93 of variability in wash off loads from roof car park and road surfaces measured in toowoomba australia brodie 2007 the authors concluded that the rdi provided a better representation of the wash off process of impaction and transport by overland flow compared to regression relationships derived from rain intensity only in the previous study an exponential decay relationship existed between rdi and event load whereby increases in rdi did not result in higher wash off loads this may have been indicative of a mass limited supply of solids from the surfaces monitored egodawatta et al 2007 hypothesised that exhaustion of solids could occur at constant rainfall intensity but further source material could be mobilised by increases in rain intensity the researchers thus added a capacity factor to eq 1 to account for rainfall intensity 3 p w t c f p 0

intensities greater than 40 mm hr the upper limit was relatively constant the authors also theorised that the capacity factor was related to the pavement type and the particle size of the deposits since fine particles are more susceptible to erosion al ali et al 2017 brodie and egodawatta 2011 subsequently modified eq 3 to account for storm duration and peak discharge noting the dual processes that govern solids wash off of particle detachment and particle transport the preceding research has provided insights on the dominant hydrological processes controlling urban particulate wash off these studies have been conducted on small scale plots less than 500 m2 to provide the high resolution data required and the models developed have generally provided summary rain event predictions such as total wash off load however the input of rainfall intensity as a unique variable in conjunction with overland flow rate has not been incorporated into the wash off routines of larger scale semi deterministic stormwater quality models such as swmm sutherland and jelen 2003 such dynamic models can provide temporal loading estimates which are useful for the design of mitigation strategies this study addresses this problem by factoring eq 2 referred to herein as the conventional wash off function cwf by a rain erosivity coefficient ic calculated from the sum of the preceding 4 minute rainfall squared 4 k i c r c r n 5 i c 1 i 4 t 2 where i c rainfall erosivity coefficient mm2 i 4 sum of preceding 4 minute rainfall depth mm eq 4 referred to herein as the modified wash off function mwf resembles that proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 and brodie 2007 in that the wash off fraction is related to the rain intensity squared multiplied by the runoff rate the choice of a 4 minute moving window for summation of rainfall was related to the time of concentration of the subcatchments delineated in this study shorter or longer windows may be selected to suit other catchments or climatic regions the form of eq 5 was such that i c had a value of unity during periods of zero rainfall this enabled the rain intensity term to be incorporated into a continuous model of solids build up and wash off in this study as with most urban stormwater models ss was modelled as a homogenous material with respect to size based on monitoring data from the study catchment there were variations in washoff characteristics across size fractions morgan et al 2017a however for clarity in comparing the cwf and mwf size effects were not investigated this will be addressed in future model development both wash off functions were coupled with a hydrological model which included infiltration subcatchment runoff and pipe network routing although implemented in matlab the hydrological routines mirrored those employed by swwm and allowed for prediction of ss loads at the catchment outlet these predictions were compared to multiple discrete samples collected over 18 rain events from an urban residential catchment the application of the mwf to a semi deterministic model of a medium size catchment and drainage system is an important development of the wash off formulations proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 brodie 2007 egodawatta egodawatta et al 2007 and others the comparison between the cwf and mwf integrated with the swmm runoff routines provided the opportunity to test whether the modification of the swwm wash off equation would improve model performance the aims of this study were to improve the accuracy of ss predictions at the catchment outlet and to identify the important model parameters 2 site description sampling and catchment representation the catchment is a 10 ha ha residential development 33 units ha located in kimmage a suburb of dublin ireland the drainage system is a separate stormwater pipe and gully system draining approximately 1 4 ha of impervious areas fig 1 stormwater flows were monitored for an 18 month period from march 2011 to august 2012 during which 18 rain events were sampled for ss flow was measured at 2 minute intervals using an isco 2150 area velocity probe rainfall intensity was also monitored at 2 minute intervals using a tipping bucket rain gauge isco 674 0 1 mm tip located on site the samples were retrieved using an automatic water sampler isco 6712 paced on equal flow volumes and multiple discrete samples were analysed for each rain event for details of the monitored storm events refer to morgan et al 2017a the data used for model calibration is provided in a data file available in the supplemental information online the file contains date time flow l s rain mm and ss mg l at 2 minute resolution the stormwater sewers were represented in the model as follows conduit c1 represented sewers along larkfield gardens and larkfield avenue fig 1 conduit c2 represented sewers along larkfield grove conduit c3 represented the sewer from the junction of c1 and c2 along priory road stormwater flow monitoring and sampling was conducted at the downstream end of c3 the catchment was sub divided between sub catchments s1 to s3 these areas comprising of 95 roads and footpaths were consistent in terms of land usage but there were minor differences in surface texture and pavement condition in the model s1 s3 discharged to the upstream nodes of conduits c1 c3 respectively 3 model development the model was run in two modules the runoff model was first calibrated using the observed flow dataset the modelled runoff was then input to the ss model this approach as adopted by other researchers e g zug et al 1999 mannina and viviani 2010 reduced the number of parameters which required simultaneous adjustment thus reducing calibration time 3 1 runoff model the runoff model comprised of three routines subcatchment infiltration subcatchment routing and pipe network routing the computational methods mostly followed those available in the storm water management model swmm rossman and huber 2016 however the model was implemented in matlab mathworks 2017 for flexibility in modifying the pipe routing and sediment wash off routines as well as to integrate directly with matlab solver functions used in auto calibration for pipe network routing the muskingum equation was used in preference to the navier stokes equations this facilitated much improved run speed for the model as several thousand model runs were required in calibration in any case the challenge of the runoff model was to replicate the infiltration characteristics of the surfacing which was carried out in the subcatchment routing stage for a detailed discussion of subcatchment infiltration and routing refer to huber and dickinson 1992 and rossman huber 2016 a summary of the runoff model components is provided in table 1 3 1 1 objective function the computed flows at the outlet of the drainage system were compared to observed flows using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index 6 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i observed flow l s at time t y i computed flow l s at time t y i mean of observed flow l s corresponding to n observations the typical range of nse values varies from 0 indicating computed flows which are as accurate as the mean of the observed data to 1 indicating a perfect match of computed and observed flows jain and sudheer 2008 the nse index was also used for evaluation of ss fluxes where observed and computed flows in eq 6 were substituted with values of ss in mg l 3 1 2 calibration the runoff model was calibrated by varying the input parameters listed in table 2 within the range recommended by huber and dickinson 1992 catchment properties could vary within subcatchments s1 s2 s3 which had the effect of increasing the number of calibration parameters and model runs to an unfeasible level therefore the most important processes were identified and calibrated in sequence for example the mean runoff coefficient calculated on hardstanding areas connected to the drainage system was just 0 29 for the 18 rain events sampled indicating significant runoff losses through pavement surfaces therefore the horton infiltration parameters f 0 f and α and the depression storage d p were calibrated first the remaining parameters were then calibrated subcatchment width muskingum routing coefficient and muskingum weighting factor manning s n and the subcatchment slope were not calibrated separately as their variability could be captured in the subcatchment width parameter huber and dickinson 1992 they were fixed at 0 015 and 0 1 respectively an auto calibration routine was implemented in matlab in which the input parameters were adjusted to maximise the nse index the routine employed the matlab multisearch algorithm 3 2 suspended solids model 3 2 1 sediment build up sediment build up on catchment surfaces was represented by a linear accumulation of solids over dry periods although exponential build up functions have been used for some urban catchments the linear function was found to be appropriate based on measurements of road deposited sediments across the study catchment morgan et al 2017b 7 l a t where l sediment load on catchment surface g m2 t dry period days a build up rate g m2 day 3 2 2 modified wash off function the modified wash off function mwf incorporated the sum of the preceding 4 minute rainfall depth in the calculation of k in eq 2 the sum of the previous 4 minute rainfall depth was found to marginally improve particle wash off prediction than the 2 or 6 minute rainfall totals for the catchment studied refer to table s1 supplementary information due to the size of subcatchments delineated in the model having a time of concentration of approximately 4 min the mass remaining on the catchment at the end of each time step was calculated by means of a finite difference scheme 8 p r t δ t p r t e k δ t 9 k i c r c r t n r t δ t n 0 5 where r t subcatchment runoff mm s δ t time step s importantly the mwf did not require any additional model parameters which would require greater calibration resources furthermore it would be straightforward to integrate this wash off function into widely used stormwater models such as swmm 3 2 3 ss routing in pipe network ss transport within the pipe segments was computed on the assumption of a fully mixed system chapra 1997 3 2 4 objective function an objective function was developed to estimate the deviation in observed and computed ss eq 10 the objective function compared observed and computed event total ss mass peak event ss concentration and instantaneous ss concentrations using the nse index following a similar scheme to barco et al 2008 this approach was chosen rather than using the nse index alone which is sensitive to the correct timing of peaks in ss in most applications event ss loads and peak ss concentrations are of primary interest for impact assessment and pollution mitigation crabtree et al 2008 10 e t e m e p nse where e t total error e m total mass error e p peak ss concentration error only the right most term in eq 6 was used for the calculation of nse in eq 10 as e t was minimised during

calibration using the subcatchment flow data from the calibrated runoff model the ss model was run continuously over an 18 month period during which the 18 sampled rain events occurred this included a one month initialisation period prior to the first sampled event to allow sufficient time for sediment build up and wash off processes to occur on the pavement surfaces 12 storm events were chosen for calibration and the remainder were used for verification water quality model performance can be sensitive to the selection of calibration data mourad et al 2005 therefore 12 out of the 18 events were selected at random for calibration in five different ways this resulted in 5 sets containing different selections of storm events used for calibration verification the motivation for this approach was to ensure impartial testing of the mwf it was possible that the random selection of a calibration verification set would favour the mwf over cwf the testing of 5 calibration sets and comparison of the average performance of the mwf and cwf minimised this possibility the ss model was calibrated by varying the wash off input parameters in table 3 to minimise et using the matlab multisearch algorithm 4 results and discussion 4 1 runoff model calibration the final calibrated values of the runoff model are shown in table 4 which corresponded to an nse index of 0 78 a plot of observed and computed flows for the 18 monitored events is shown in fig 2 and plots of the total event volumes and peak flows are included in the supplemental information figs s1 and s2 the calibrated depression storage value for s3 was at the model bound however relaxing of these limits had minimal impact on improving model fit the ability of the runoff model to accurately reproduce observed flows would have impacted on the predictive performance of the ss model as subcatchment runoff is an input of eq 2 however the focus of this study was on the wash off function only and the cwf and mwf were compared based on the same runoff model outputs 4 2 ss model calibration the results of the ss model calibration are shown in table 5 including the calibrated model parameters a n rc and the model performance indicators et and nse although each calibration set was chosen at random paired sets of calibration and verification events were used to compare the cwf and mwf the calibrated value of n for both the conventional and modified wash off models was towards the upper limit suggested by huber and dickinson 1992 of 2 6 indicative of a catchment where wash off of sediment during the middle of storms was common which was supported by the observed data there was a degree of variation in model fit between different calibration runs i e the performance of the model was sensitive to the selection of calibration events this reflected the ability of the calibration dataset to provide adequate training to the model in representing the physical phenomenon occurring on the catchment surface considering the multitude of processes which contribute to ss at the drain outlet such as dry weather sediment build up erosion and deposition by wind and traffic street cleaning and wash off processes it is unsurprising that not all observed ss fluxes could be accurately reproduced however in all calibration sets the mwf provided an improved fit of the observed data compared to the cwf also evident in table 5 was the large variation in rc for the different calibration sets this was due in part to the existence within calibration sets of a number of combinations of model parameters which produced similar performance this phenomenon of equifinality bevin 1993 can hinder the selection of the optimum parameter set in this case the variation of rc was not overly concerning since this model parameter is less sensitive than a or n and is known to vary over orders of magnitude in different urban catchments huber and dickinson 1992 arguably the most important parameter is the build up rate since it largely determines the annual yield of ss from the catchment this parameter did not vary significantly between the calibration sets other than calibration set 2 therefore it is reasonable to assume that this parameter will be consistent across viable model parameter sets the mean et for the mwf was 5 39 over the five calibration sets compared to 6 50 for the cwf correspondingly the mean nse for the mwf was 0 59 and 0 38 for the cwf this is further demonstrated in fig 3 where the observed and computed event ss loads are plotted for the cwf and mwf using calibration dataset 4 the computed values using the mwf were less biased closer to the 1 1 line and with reduced scatter compared to the cwf in both calibration and verification accordingly the linear correlation coefficients for the cwf and mwf were 0 75 and 0 89 calibration and 0 91 and 0 97 verification respectively plots of cwf and mwf performance in terms of event ss load are provided for all calibration sets in the supplemental information figs s3 s6 it is important to note that while the performance of the model varied between calibration sets e g some calibration sets performed less well in validation the mwf provided a consistently improved fit for each calibration set compared to the cwf the improved performance of the mwf was due to its incorporation of rainfall intensity separate to surface runoff as a model parameter this can be seen in the pollutographs for two storm events of different rainfall intensities shown in figs 4 and 5 drawn from calibration set 3 it is important to note that the modelled antecedent mass p r t was similar for the cwf and mwf in both events rain event 1 cwf 52 4 kg mwf 53 1 kg rain event 2 cwf 10 7 kg mwf 11 2 kg rain event 1 occurred over a long duration c 12 h with a low rainfall intensity average 1 3 mm hr peak 2 7 mm hr however there was sufficient rainfall volume to generate runoff due to the saturation of the pavement surface and sub grade material this is evident when comparing the two largest flow peaks the first peak of 9 4 l s was generated by 3 mm of rain falling in the previous hour with no antecedent rainfall occurring prior to this the second peak of 19 5 l s resulted from just 2 6 mm falling in the previous hour but with 8 6 mm of antecedent rain from previous research it is clear that long periods of low intensity rainfall are unlikely to wash off significant quantities of solids from pavement surfaces vaze and chiew 2002 accordingly the pollutograph of the mwf does not deviate significantly from that of the cwf in both cases the modelled ss is slightly higher than observed values during low flows but the observed peak of 96 mg l is reasonably estimated cwf 80 mg l mwf 82 mg l the timing of ss peaks are also well represented by both models rain event 2 consisted of shorter duration higher intensity rainfall average rain intensity 1 7 mm hr peak intensity 5 3 mm hr although no rain occurred in the previous 2 days the rainfall intensity was significantly higher than the infiltration rate through the pavement surface generating a peak flow of 34 l s during this event particle detachment by rain impaction and surface flow would have been influential in this case the mwf generated additional ss to the cwf which resulted in improved agreement of event ss loads observed 4 0 kg cwf 2 6 kg mwf 4 3 kg the shape of the mwf pollutograph followed the observed ss concentrations more closely although the mwf profile was somewhat flatter than the observed the comparison of rain events 1 and 2 demonstrated the ability of the mwf to distinguish in terms of ss wash off potential between runoff generated by long duration low intensity rainfall and short duration high intensity rainfall furthermore it is beneficial to separate wash off from rain impaction and soil erosion since these are the real world physical processes occurring on the catchment surface deletic et al 1997 shaw et al 2006 5 conclusion a modification of the classical exponential wash off function was developed which accounted directly for particle detachment by rain impaction the modified wash off function was integrated with a hydrological model using the routines employed by swmm for subcatchment infiltration and runoff thus allowing ss concentrations to be predicted at the catchment outlet the modified wash off model was tested on a dataset of 18 storm events sampled from a separate pipe and gully system the modified wash off function showed an improved fit of observed ss fluxes for all calibration sets in comparison to the classical wash off function the form of the modified wash off equation allows for simple integration into swmm without the need for additional model parameters credit

rainfall squared 4 k i c r c r n 5 i c 1 i 4 t 2 where i c rainfall erosivity coefficient mm2 i 4 sum of preceding 4 minute rainfall depth mm eq 4 referred to herein as the modified wash off function mwf resembles that proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 and brodie 2007 in that the wash off fraction is related to the rain intensity squared multiplied by the runoff rate the choice of a 4 minute moving window for summation of rainfall was related to the time of concentration of the subcatchments delineated in this study shorter or longer windows may be selected to suit other catchments or climatic regions the form of eq 5 was such that i c had a value of unity during periods of zero rainfall this enabled the rain intensity term to be incorporated into a continuous model of solids build up and wash off in this study as with most urban stormwater models ss was modelled as a homogenous material with respect to size based on monitoring data from the study catchment there were variations in washoff characteristics across size fractions morgan et al 2017a however for clarity in comparing the cwf and mwf size effects were not investigated this will be addressed in future model development both wash off functions were coupled with a hydrological model which included infiltration subcatchment runoff and pipe network routing although implemented in matlab the hydrological routines mirrored those employed by swwm and allowed for prediction of ss loads at the catchment outlet these predictions were compared to multiple discrete samples collected over 18 rain events from an urban residential catchment the application of the mwf to a semi deterministic model of a medium size catchment and drainage system is an important development of the wash off formulations proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 brodie 2007 egodawatta egodawatta et al 2007 and others the comparison between the cwf and mwf integrated with the swmm runoff routines provided the opportunity to test whether the modification of the swwm wash off equation would improve model performance the aims of this study were to improve the accuracy of ss predictions at the catchment outlet and to identify the important model parameters 2 site description sampling and catchment representation the catchment is a 10 ha ha residential development 33 units ha located in kimmage a suburb of dublin ireland the drainage system is a separate stormwater pipe and gully system draining approximately 1 4 ha of impervious areas fig 1 stormwater flows were monitored for an 18 month period from march 2011 to august 2012 during which 18 rain events were sampled for ss flow was measured at 2 minute intervals using an isco 2150 area velocity probe rainfall intensity was also monitored at 2 minute intervals using a tipping bucket rain gauge isco 674 0 1 mm tip located on site the samples were retrieved using an automatic water sampler isco 6712 paced on equal flow volumes and multiple discrete samples were analysed for each rain event for details of the monitored storm events refer to morgan et al 2017a the data used for model calibration is provided in a data file available in the supplemental information online the file contains date time flow l s rain mm and ss mg l at 2 minute resolution the stormwater sewers were represented in the model as follows conduit c1 represented sewers along larkfield gardens and larkfield avenue fig 1 conduit c2 represented sewers along larkfield grove conduit c3 represented the sewer from the junction of c1 and c2 along priory road stormwater flow monitoring and sampling was conducted at the downstream end of c3 the catchment was sub divided between sub catchments s1 to s3 these areas comprising of 95 roads and footpaths were consistent in terms of land usage but there were minor differences in surface texture and pavement condition in the model s1 s3 discharged to the upstream nodes of conduits c1 c3 respectively 3 model development the model was run in two modules the runoff model was first calibrated using the observed flow dataset the modelled runoff was then input to the ss model this approach as adopted by other researchers e g zug et al 1999 mannina and viviani 2010 reduced the number of parameters which required simultaneous adjustment thus reducing calibration time 3 1 runoff model the runoff model comprised of three routines subcatchment infiltration subcatchment routing and pipe network routing the computational methods mostly followed those available in the storm water management model swmm rossman and huber 2016 however the model was implemented in matlab mathworks 2017 for flexibility in modifying the pipe routing and sediment wash off routines as well as to integrate directly with matlab solver functions used in auto calibration for pipe network routing the muskingum equation was used in preference to the navier stokes equations this facilitated much improved run speed for the model as several thousand model runs were required in calibration in any case the challenge of the runoff model was to replicate the infiltration characteristics of the surfacing which was carried out in the subcatchment routing stage for a detailed discussion of subcatchment infiltration and routing refer to huber and dickinson 1992 and rossman huber 2016 a summary of the runoff model components is provided in table 1 3 1 1 objective function the computed flows at the outlet of the drainage system were compared to observed flows using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index 6 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i observed flow l s at time t y i computed flow l s at time t y i mean of observed flow l s corresponding to n observations the typical range of nse values varies from 0 indicating computed flows which are as accurate as the mean of the observed data to 1 indicating a perfect match of computed and observed flows jain and sudheer 2008 the nse index was also used for evaluation of ss fluxes where observed and computed flows in eq 6 were substituted with values of ss in mg l 3 1 2 calibration the runoff model was calibrated by varying the input parameters listed in table 2 within the range recommended by huber and dickinson 1992 catchment properties could vary within subcatchments s1 s2 s3 which had the effect of increasing the number of calibration parameters and model runs to an unfeasible level therefore the most important processes were identified and calibrated in sequence for example the mean runoff coefficient calculated on hardstanding areas connected to the drainage system was just 0 29 for the 18 rain events sampled indicating significant runoff losses through pavement surfaces therefore the horton infiltration parameters f 0 f and α and the depression storage d p were calibrated first the remaining parameters were then calibrated subcatchment width muskingum routing coefficient and muskingum weighting factor manning s n and the subcatchment slope were not calibrated separately as their variability could be captured in the subcatchment width parameter huber and dickinson 1992 they were fixed at 0 015 and 0 1 respectively an auto calibration routine was implemented in matlab in which the input parameters were adjusted to maximise the nse index the routine employed the matlab multisearch algorithm 3 2 suspended solids model 3 2 1 sediment build up sediment build up on catchment surfaces was represented by a linear accumulation of solids over dry periods although exponential build up functions have been used for some urban catchments the linear function was found to be appropriate based on measurements of road deposited sediments across the study catchment morgan et al 2017b 7 l a t where l sediment load on catchment surface g m2 t dry period days a build up rate g m2 day 3 2 2 modified wash off function the modified wash off function mwf incorporated the sum of the preceding 4 minute rainfall depth in the calculation of k in eq 2 the sum of the previous 4 minute rainfall depth was found to marginally improve particle wash off prediction than the 2 or 6 minute rainfall totals for the catchment studied refer to table s1 supplementary information due to the size of subcatchments delineated in the model having a time of concentration of approximately 4 min the mass remaining on the catchment at the end of each time step was calculated by means of a finite difference scheme 8 p r t δ t p r t e k δ t 9 k i c r c r t n r t δ t n 0 5 where r t subcatchment runoff mm s δ t time step s importantly the mwf did not require any additional model parameters which would require greater calibration resources furthermore it would be straightforward to integrate this wash off function into widely used stormwater models such as swmm 3 2 3 ss routing in pipe network ss transport within the pipe segments was computed on the assumption of a fully mixed system chapra 1997 3 2 4 objective function an objective function was developed to estimate the deviation in observed and computed ss eq 10 the objective function compared observed and computed event total ss mass peak event ss concentration and instantaneous ss concentrations using the nse index following a similar scheme to barco et al 2008 this approach was chosen rather than using the nse index alone which is sensitive to the correct timing of peaks in ss in most applications event ss loads and peak ss concentrations are of primary interest for impact assessment and pollution mitigation crabtree et al 2008 10 e t e m e p nse where e t total error e m total mass error e p peak ss concentration error only the right most term in eq 6 was used for the calculation of nse in eq 10 as e t was minimised during calibration 11 e m i 1 n o b s t m i m o d t m i o b s t m i 2 where obstm observed event total mass for event i kg modtm computed event total mass for event i kg n number of calibration events 12 e p

calibration using the subcatchment flow data from the calibrated runoff model the ss model was run continuously over an 18 month period during which the 18 sampled rain events occurred this included a one month initialisation period prior to the first sampled event to allow sufficient time for sediment build up and wash off processes to occur on the pavement surfaces 12 storm events were chosen for calibration and the remainder were used for verification water quality model performance can be sensitive to the selection of calibration data mourad et al 2005 therefore 12 out of the 18 events were selected at random for calibration in five different ways this resulted in 5 sets containing different selections of storm events used for calibration verification the motivation for this approach was to ensure impartial testing of the mwf it was possible that the random selection of a calibration verification set would favour the mwf over cwf the testing of 5 calibration sets and comparison of the average performance of the mwf and cwf minimised this possibility the ss model was calibrated by varying the wash off input parameters in table 3 to minimise et using the matlab multisearch algorithm 4 results and discussion 4 1 runoff model calibration the final calibrated values of the runoff model are shown in table 4 which corresponded to an nse index of 0 78 a plot of observed and computed flows for the 18 monitored events is shown in fig 2 and plots of the total event volumes and peak flows are included in the supplemental information figs s1 and s2 the calibrated depression storage value for s3 was at the model bound however relaxing of these limits had minimal impact on improving model fit the ability of the runoff model to accurately reproduce observed flows would have impacted on the predictive performance of the ss model as subcatchment runoff is an input of eq 2 however the focus of this study was on the wash off function only and the cwf and mwf were compared based on the same runoff model outputs 4 2 ss model calibration the results of the ss model calibration are shown in table 5 including the calibrated model parameters a n rc and the model performance indicators et and nse although each calibration set was chosen at random paired sets of calibration and verification events were used to compare the cwf and mwf the calibrated value of n for both the conventional and modified wash off models was towards the upper limit suggested by huber and dickinson 1992 of 2 6 indicative of a catchment where wash off of sediment during the middle of storms was common which was supported by the observed data there was a degree of variation in model fit between different calibration runs i e the performance of the model was sensitive to the selection of calibration events this reflected the ability of the calibration dataset to provide adequate training to the model in representing the physical phenomenon occurring on the catchment surface considering the multitude of processes which contribute to ss at the drain outlet such as dry weather sediment build up erosion and deposition by wind and traffic street cleaning and wash off processes it is unsurprising that not all observed ss fluxes could be accurately reproduced however in all calibration sets the mwf provided an improved fit of the observed data compared to the cwf also evident in table 5 was the large variation in rc for the different calibration sets this was due in part to the existence within calibration sets of a number of combinations of model parameters which produced similar performance this phenomenon of equifinality bevin 1993 can hinder the selection of the optimum parameter set in this case the variation of rc was not overly concerning since this model parameter is less sensitive than a or n and is known to vary over orders of magnitude in different urban catchments huber and dickinson 1992 arguably the most important parameter is the build up rate since it largely determines the annual yield of ss from the catchment this parameter did not vary significantly between the calibration sets other than calibration set 2 therefore it is reasonable to assume that this parameter will be consistent across viable model parameter sets the mean et for the mwf was 5 39 over the five calibration sets compared to 6 50 for the cwf correspondingly the mean nse for the mwf was 0 59 and 0 38 for the cwf this is further demonstrated in fig 3 where the observed and computed event ss loads are plotted for the cwf and mwf using calibration dataset 4 the computed values using the mwf were less biased closer to the 1 1 line and with reduced scatter compared to the cwf in both calibration and verification accordingly the linear correlation coefficients for the cwf and mwf were 0 75 and 0 89 calibration and 0 91 and 0 97 verification respectively plots of cwf and mwf performance in terms of event ss load are provided for all calibration sets in the supplemental information figs s3 s6 it is important to note that while the performance of the model varied between calibration sets e g some calibration sets performed less well in validation the mwf provided a consistently improved fit for each calibration set compared to the cwf the improved performance of the mwf was due to its incorporation of rainfall intensity separate to surface runoff as a model parameter this can be seen in the pollutographs for two storm events of different rainfall intensities shown in figs 4 and 5 drawn from calibration set 3 it is important to note that the modelled antecedent mass p r t was similar for the cwf and mwf in both events rain event 1 cwf 52 4 kg mwf 53 1 kg rain event 2 cwf 10 7 kg mwf 11 2 kg rain event 1 occurred over a long duration c 12 h with a low rainfall intensity average 1 3 mm hr peak 2 7 mm hr however there was sufficient rainfall volume to generate runoff due to the saturation of the pavement surface and sub grade material this is evident when comparing the two largest flow peaks the first peak of 9 4 l s was generated by 3 mm of rain falling in the previous hour with no antecedent rainfall occurring prior to this the second peak of 19 5 l s resulted from just 2 6 mm falling in the previous hour but with 8 6 mm of antecedent rain from previous research it is clear that long periods of low intensity rainfall are unlikely to wash off significant quantities of solids from pavement surfaces vaze and chiew 2002 accordingly the pollutograph of the mwf does not deviate significantly from that of the cwf in both cases the modelled ss is slightly higher than observed values during low flows but the observed peak of 96 mg l is reasonably estimated cwf 80 mg l mwf 82 mg l the timing of ss peaks are also well represented by both models rain event 2 consisted of shorter duration higher intensity rainfall average rain intensity 1 7 mm hr peak intensity 5 3 mm hr although no rain occurred in the previous 2 days the rainfall intensity was significantly higher than the infiltration rate through the pavement surface generating a peak flow of 34 l s during this event particle detachment by rain impaction and surface flow would have been influential in this case the mwf generated additional ss to the cwf which resulted in improved agreement of event ss loads observed 4 0 kg cwf 2 6 kg mwf 4 3 kg the shape of the mwf pollutograph followed the observed ss concentrations more closely although the mwf profile was somewhat flatter than the observed the comparison of rain events 1 and 2 demonstrated the ability of the mwf to distinguish in terms of ss wash off potential between runoff generated by long duration low intensity rainfall and short duration high intensity rainfall furthermore it is beneficial to separate wash off from rain impaction and soil erosion since these are the real world physical processes occurring on the catchment surface deletic et al 1997 shaw et al 2006 5 conclusion a modification of the classical exponential wash off function was developed which accounted directly for particle detachment by rain impaction the modified wash off function was integrated with a hydrological model using the routines employed by swmm for subcatchment infiltration and runoff thus allowing ss concentrations to be predicted at the catchment outlet the modified wash off model was tested on a dataset of 18 storm events sampled from a separate pipe and gully system the modified wash off function showed an improved fit of observed ss fluxes for all calibration sets in comparison to the classical wash off function the form of the modified wash off equation allows for simple integration into swmm without the need for additional model parameters credit

5621,this paper investigates the effect of cosolvent content and flushing velocity on the remediation of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl in double porosity medium using light transmission visualization technique ltv double porosity was created using local silica sand and sintered spheres of kaolin arranged in a periodic manner the flushing solution consisted of ethanol water mixtures with various ethanol concentrations ranging from 20 to 65 by volume the effect of contact time was investigated by changing the flow rates of the flushing solution the accuracy of the ltv technique was examined by comparing an actual injected volume of dnapl with the calculated volumes generated from image analysis the ltv results allowed for the visualization of the dnapl enhanced dissolution as well as its mobilization while the removal efficiency increased with the increase of the ethanol content the removal efficiency was negatively affected by the velocity of flushing solution image analysis revealed that the highest dnapl removal efficiency of 92 was obtained at 65 ethanol content and low flushing velocity this efficiency decreased to 85 in the case of high flushing velocity overall this study demonstrated that the ltv technique is a viable laboratory tool that can accurately depict enhanced dnapl dissolution and dnapl mobilization due to cosolvent flushing keywords cosolvent flushing dnapl double porosity media light transmission visualization groundwater contamination 1 introduction organic contaminants in non aqueous phase liquid napl form are among the main causes of groundwater and soil contamination in the last few decades more than 311 000 polluted sites have been cleaned in the us alone and many sites still need to be remediated epa 2004 most of these contaminants are immiscible with water due to their low aqueous solubility yang et al 2013 as a result the contamination of the subsurface by dnapls can persist for many years leading to the contamination of large portions of the groundwater chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce are the most commonly encountered dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls due to their widespread use in various industrial activities such as metal degreasing and cleaning agent stroo et al 2003 when a dnapl is released into the subsurface it first migrates within the unsaturated zone under the effect of the gravitational hydrodynamic and capillary forces if the released dnapl volume is sufficiently large it can penetrate down into the saturated zone and continue its downward movement until some hydraulic or capillary barrier is encountered understanding the dynamic behavior of the dnapl in subsurface multiphase system is essential for evaluating the impacts of pollution sources and for the design of proper remediation schemes zheng et al 2015 several factors affect dnapl migration in the subsurface which can be characterized into three groups i properties of porous media such as soil structure hydraulic conductivity capillary pressure and pore size ii fluid characteristics such as density viscosity wettability and interfacial tension and iii subsurface conditions such as soil water content and groundwater flow velocity mercer and cohen 1990 huling and weaver 1991 bourg et al 1992 in natural state many soil types have two distinct scales of porosity which give rise to the term double porosity soil structure carminati et al 2008 double porosity is a natural phenomenon that occurs when two separate pore systems emerge simultaneously in the structure of a soil warren and root 1963 lewallen and wang 1998 rock aquifers pao and lewis 2002 compacted soils romero et al 1999 and agricultural top soil el zein et al 2006 are examples of geomaterials that potentially exhibit double porosity characteristics due to the low solubility of dnapls and their relatively high capillary forces in the subsurface their remediation using conventional methods such as pump and treat has been noted to be ineffective under natural conditions encountered in the field aydin sarikurt et al 2016 childs et al 2006 therefore the need for alternative remediation techniques has led to the development of different technologies such as air sparging in situ cosolvent and surfactant flushing and soil vapor extraction soga et al 2004 oostrom et al 2007 cosolvent flushing involves chemical injection to enhance the napl solubility and instigate its mobility as a separate phase by reducing the interfacial tension of the dnapl and the groundwater phases dokou and karatzas 2013 dokou et al 2016 soil and groundwater flushing using reagent aqueous solutions is usually employed to enhance the dissolution of the contaminants the most common cosolvents considered for dnapl remediation are low molecular weight alcohols such as ethanol 1 propanol and 2 propanol which are highly soluble and water miscible resulting in the enhancement of solubilization and mobilization of dnapls entrapped in the subsurface oostrom et al 2006 sale and newell 2010 cosolvent flushing was proposed by several researchers in order to enhance the efficiency of contaminant remediation imhoff et al 1995 lunn and kueper 1999 brusseau et al 2002 aydin et al 2011 agaoglu et al 2012 atteia et al 2013 karaoglu et al 2019 the use of high cosolvent contents has been shown to lead to high dnapl recovery in laboratory experiments however the volume of injected product is very important to be economically sustainable atteia et al 2013 some researchers have proposed mixing cosolvents with surfactants in order to enhance the remediation efficiency of napl and to reduce the amounts of injected cosolvents childs et al 2006 jawitz et al 2000 these studies demonstrated that a multiple step remediation technique consisting of a series of floods can potentially optimize dnapl remediation there is a need for cost effective laboratory techniques to evaluate and optimize different remediation strategies prior to their application in the field image analysis techniques have emerged in recent years as effective tools for the visualization and investigation of dnapl transport as well as dnapl remediation in different types of porous media alazaiza et al 2017a 2017b 2018 bob et al 2008 for example light transmission visualization ltv was used by bob et al 2008 to investigate the efficiency of air sparging for the recovery of volatile organic compounds vocs in 2 d laboratory experiments bob et al 2008 concluded that the ltv is a viable method to evaluate changes in dnapl saturation during laboratory remediation process kaye et al 2008 used ltv to investigate the partial removal of dnapl using enhanced dissolution based on the relationship between reduction in dnapl mass and the corresponding reduction in contaminant mass flux they concluded that the ltv is capable of predicting the contaminant flux reduction and mass reduction relationships for distributed dnapl sources a major advantage of the ltv technique is that it allows to visualize the entire dnapl zone including both the entrapped dnapl and the mobile aqueous phase surrounding the dnapl in contrast traditional experimental techniques allow sample collection and analysis at few points only typically the effluent and in some instances few additional locations within the domain the objective of this study is to conduct a quantitative investigation of cosolvent flushing used to enhance the solubilization and mobilization of a dnapl in double porosity soil medium using the ltv technique while laboratory scale dnapl zone remediation studies involving single porosity soils are quite common studies investigating dnapl recovery from double porosity soils are quite rare the application of ltv to cosolvent flushing in dual porosity media has not been examined previously specifically a known amount of dnapl was injected in a 2 d saturated double porosity soil medium different cosolvent flushing solutions were applied and ltv was used to generate high resolution time dependent dnapl saturation maps and to evaluate the influence of cosolvent concentration on dnapl recovery mechanism after that the influence of cosolvent concentration on dnapl recovery mechanism was investigated using ltv technique the considered dnapl in this study was tce the flushing solution consisted of ethanol water mixtures with ethanol contents ranging between 20 and 65 by volume the impact of flushing solution velocity on dnapl behavior was also investigated for comparison purposes the experiment with the high ethanol content was repeated by filling the flow chamber with silica sand a single porosity medium in order to investigate the effect of double porosity on fluid flow this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the materials and methods used for preparing and conducting the flushing experiments image capturing and processing techniques for the determination of the dynamic dnapl distribution through the soil are also discussed in section 2 the results of the ltv application to dnapl and cosolvent flushing are presented and discussed in section 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 material characteristics in this study the materials used to create the double porosity soil structure are local silica sand and s300 kaolin the procedure used for the preparation of the double porosity medium is described in the following section before starting the experiments a general characterization including physical chemical and mineralogical tests was carried out for both materials all properties can be found in alazaiza et al 2017b trichloroethylene tce was used to represent the dnapl tce density is 1 46 g cm3 and its solubility in water is 1100 mg l at 25 c additional tce properties can be found in ruffino and zanetti 2009 2 2 composition of double porosity structure the double porosity structure consisted of sintered clay spheres and fine sand according to the method of lewandowska et al 2008 s300 kaolin was used to make the sintered clay spheres while the sand was commercial local silica sand the sintered clay spheres were formed manually by adding a sufficient amount of water to kaolin powder and mixing the clay spheres were then put inside a furnace and the temperature was increased gradually until it reached 1000 c this process was conducted to make the kaolin spheres hard in order to avoid their disintegration during saturation of the double porosity soil samples in the study the clay sphere diameter was about 6 mm while the average pore size in the clay spheres was around 5 µm scanning electron microscopy sem of the kaolin spheres showed that the kaolin spheres were almost homogeneous without skin effect due to reduced porosity alazaiza et al 2019 sand retained on the 212 µm sieve was used as the filler material distilled water was used to clean the sand from any fine residuals present the sand was subsequently oven dried for 48 h at 45 c in order to create the double porosity structure the clay spheres were put layer by layer in such a manner that they were touching each other between each clay sphere layer a layer of sand was carefully poured and then compacted by tapping a plastic hammer on the outer frame of the acrylic model the volumetric fractions of macro pores silica sand and micro pores clay spheres were 50 each the resultant total porosity of the double porosity structure was 0 42 fig 1 a shows the composition of sand and clay to create the double porosity structure 2 3 experimental setup a series of 2 d flushing experiments were conducted and the ltv technique to was used to visualize the performance of ethanol flushing of tce in total six 2 d flow flushing experiments were performed with double porosity and one experiment was performed with silica sand as a single porosity the experiments were used to study the effect of flushing solution composition on tce remediation using ltv as listed in table 1 the dimensions of the flow chamber were 45 cm height 30 cm width 1 cm depth the surfaces of the chamber were made of 10 mm thick acrylic plates the flow chamber was fixed inside a steel frame attached to a stainless steel lightbox that contained the light source different ports were installed on all sides of the flow chamber as shown in fig 1 b tce was injected from the upper ports for better visualization of the tce distribution while the bottom ports were used for water and co2 injection because it leads to less air entrapment three ports were installed on the left and right sides of the flow chambers the inner sides of these frames were milled with a 100 µm glass frit to allow the inflow and outflow of flushing solutions a peristaltic pump was used for ethanol flushing from the left side the effluent aqueous solution was captured by the three ports located on the right side of the chamber stainless steel tube lines from these three ports were merged into one stainless steel tube line that was connected to a teflon tube line which ran through a flow meter and then positioned at proper elevation to establish the required water table level in the chamber experiments were carried out using three different flushing solutions containing 20 50 and 65 ethanol by volume and two different flow velocities 1 m day low and 3 m d high these velocities are consistent with the actual groundwater velocities in the field under natural conditions the typical groundwater velocities are in the order of 0 1 to 1 m day salanitro et al 2000 aydin sarikurt et al 2016 the ltv system used to quantify tce saturation before and after ethanol flushing consisted mainly of a light source that had five 18 watt fluorescent tubes osram malaysia and a nikon d7100 digital camera nikon malaysia as described by alazaiza et al 2017a for light intensity homogenization a holographic light shaping diffuser lsd luminit usa was fixed behind the flow chamber and in front of the light source the camera was placed in a fixed position of 1 5 m from the flow chamber the image spatial resolution was 24 megapixels 6000 by 4000 pixels which corresponded to approximately 0 027 0 027 cm2 per pixel the dynamic range of the camera is 12 bit resulting in 4096 gy levels the nikon camera control pro software was used to control image acquisition in order to avoid the vibration of the camera during images collection all images were captured using a 600 nm center wavelength 10 nm band pass filter orientir inc china attached to a 67 mm lens nikkor 18 105 mm f 3 5 5 6g ed vr nikon malaysia the aperture setting of the lens was adjusted in order to fully utilize the dynamic range of the camera using exposure times of a few seconds the aperture of the lens was fixed at f 5 6 for all images and the exposure time was 2 s all images were collected inside a dark room and the environment surrounding the system was maintained at 23 1 c 2 4 experimental procedure for each experiment the flow chamber was dry packed with the double porosity soil medium as discussed in section 2 2 after the flow chamber was fully packed with the double porosity medium the top frame of the flow chamber was reattached and black silicon was used to seal all gaps the light source was switched on and after 30 min an image of the dry double porosity sample was collected to determine id the light intensity of the flow chamber under dry condition the flow chamber was then slowly purged with co2 gas for 40 min to remove any trapped air after injection of co2 distilled water was slowly introduced into the flow chamber from the bottom ports under a positive pressure after 1 h of saturating the flow chamber with water the saturated transmission image was captured and used to estimate is which is the light intensity of the flow chamber in the fully water saturated case before the start of each flushing experiment a volume of 10 ml tce was gradually injected into the flow chamber using a syringe through the top injection ports to enhance the spread of tce distribution the 10 ml dyed tce were added as follows 5 0 ml were released from the top center port and 2 5 ml were released from each of two ports located to the left and right of the center port tce injection was performed in five 2 ml increments and after the injection of each amount images were captured these successive incremental injections of dnapl and acquired multiple images during dnapl injection helps better calibrate the mass balance calculation the injection of tce was performed by inserting the needle to about 3 cm below the top of the tank at all three release locations in all experiments the tce was allowed to redistribute for 72 h and at least three ltv images were captured for each model prior to the injection of the flushing solution tce was dyed with oil red o 0 01 by weight before its injection for better visualization the use of low concentration of oil red o is not expected to significantly change the physical properties of tce taylor et al 2001 the tce saturation was calculated pixel by pixel using eq 1 alazaiza et al 2017b 1 s n ln i s ln i ln i s ln i n where sn is the tce saturation calculated pixel by pixel is is the light intensity of the flow chamber in the fully water saturated case i is the emergent light intensity and in is the light intensity of the flow chamber when it is considered fully saturated with napl in practice it is not feasible to fully saturate the flow chamber with napl each time the model is packed therefore in was calculated using the following theoretical expression based on the dnapl and porous media properties alazaiza et al 2017b 2 i n i s τ wn 2 k s

that are filled with dnapl for the case of clay and sand respectively k is the total number of the pores that are filled with dnapl which can be calculated using eq 3 3 k ln i s i d 2 ln τ sw τ sa id is the light intensity of the flow chamber when it is dry whereas do kc ks and τwn can be calculated as described in alazaiza et al 2017a τwn the transmission factor can be calculated using fresnel s law for any two phases by measuring the refractive index of these two phases ryer 1998 mass balance was then calculated to compare the calculated volume of tce based on image analysis and the actual tce volume added into the flow chamber after the tce injection the cosolvent flushing solution was applied from the inlet ports at the left side of the tank using the peristaltic pump for each experiment two pore volumes of flushing solution were injected into the flow chamber the flushing solution flow rate was maintained steady throughout the experiment samples were collected from the three outlet ports at the right side the effluent samples were analyzed using a uv 160a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 200 nm akyol et al 2011 during the injection of cosolvent flushing solution several images were captured in order to evaluate the change of tce saturation during the first 30 min of cosolvent flushing images were collected every 2 min after 30 min images were collected every 10 min the saturation distribution of the tce in the flow chamber was quantified without the need to develop a calibration curve following the ltv modified method as shown in eq 1 for this method the absorption of dyed tce α n was measured using a uv 160a uv vis spectrophotometer at the 600 nm wavelength 2 5 image analyzing and processing prior to image analysis image correction for temporal variations was conducted following a method described by bob et al 2008 specifically a reference image corresponding to the flow chamber fully saturated with water was first identified and this image was collected a small area in the flow chamber was used for temporal variation correction for light intensity and this area is referred to as the correction zone this zone should be always fully saturated with water in all images to correct a specific image the light intensity of each pixel in the image was multiplied by the ratio of the average light intensity of the correction zone for the reference image and the average light intensity of the correction zone for the image to be corrected at times designated for image collection at least three images were collected and the average light intensity values of the three images were used in the calculations to reduce errors in image capturing image analysis was conducted using image pro premier 9 1 software media cybernetics inc usa image analysis process contains different steps including conversion of the image from red green blue rgb version to gray level version and extraction of the light intensity pixel by pixel using image bitmap it is necessary when running the image analysis that all images have the same setting in terms of variables such as spatial calibration saturation calibration and area of interest aoi aoi refers to the area where all the measurements and calculations were performed within its boundaries and should be fixed for all images the last step was exporting all intensity values into ms excel to carry out the calculations for converting the light intensity to dnapl saturation a flowchart of the main procedures performed by ltv is shown in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial tce saturation in the double porosity medium as mentioned earlier the total volume of tce was injected into the flow chamber in 2 ml increments since the tce was dyed using oil red o it is important to take into consideration the effect of both light absorption and light refraction in the determination of tce saturations dying of tce resulted in reducing the light transmission in the flow chamber since the impact of dye on the light refraction at the tce water interface was unknown the transmission factor for the dyed tce water interface τ wn was calculated using mass balance calibration specifically images were captured during the incremental injection of tce and τ wn was adjusted such that the i n calculated with equation 2 yields initial dnapl volume that is consistent with actual injected tce volume this step was carried out for each experiment to account for any variations in compaction which may affect the value of transmission factor as the light intensity measured in each pixel is function of the numerous interfaces created by many pores within each pixel the value of τ wn was then used in all subsequent calculations key parameters determined from the initial tce saturation calculations are summarized in table 2 fig 3 shows the injected volume of tce plotted against the calculated volume of tce from image analysis a strong correlation was obtained between the injected and the calculated volumes of tce r2 0 987 for experiment 1 and r2 0 984 for experiment 2 the maximum error between the injected and the calculated volumes of tce were 8 4 and 9 6 for experiment 1 and 2 respectively errors were calculated by subtracting the calculated volume of tce from the injected volume and divided the difference by the calculated volume of tce from image analysis as follow 4 e v cal v inj v inj where vcal and vinj are the calculated and injected dnapl volumes respectively also the overall deviation of the calculated tce volumes from the injected volumes was calculated using the root mean square error rmse 5 rmse 1 n v cal v inj 2 where n is the number of tce increments different factors contribute to the error in the measurements of light intensity as reported by bob et al 2008 the main reasons of the errors are usually due to the variations in the intensity of light source as well as the resulted noise from camera opening as also reported by belfort et al 2017 2019 the stability of light source can be controlled by minimizing the number of turning on off of light source for the latter reason it is believed that the noise in the camera signal is present in each pixel thus the effect does not influence the mass balance calculation since it averages out in the summation of all pixels niemet and selker 2001 another factor contributing to the errors of the measurement of light intensity is the conceptual model it is assumed that in the conceptual model each pore in the flow chamber was either full or empty of tce which is not the exact case in reality some of the pore volume could be partially filled with tce which results in underestimation of tce volume obtained from image analysis this discrepancy is accounted for during model calibration 3 2 enhanced dissolution experiments experiment 1 and 2 depict the use of cosolvent flushing for the enhanced dissolution of tce the ethanol content of the flushing solution of experiments 1 and 2 was 20 experiment 1 was conducted under low velocity of cosolvent solution while the second experiment was carried out under high velocity of cosolvent solution fig 4 shows dnapl saturation images determined from the ltv technique at pv 0 1 and 2 for experiment 1 similar images were also determined for experiment 2 not shown here it was observed that the cosolvent flushing for both velocities had negligible impact on tce mobility at relatively low ethanol contents the interfacial tension between the dnapl and aqueous phases remains high preventing the mobility of the dnapl phases as a result enhanced dissolution is the only transport mechanism imhoff et al 1995 jawitz et al 2000 agaoglu et al 2012 a relatively small change in the tce saturation was observed after flushing the final pore volume of cosolvent solution particularly at the high rate flushing experiment 1 as shown in fig 3c this observation was consistent with the analysis of the effluent solution using spectrophotometer tce saturation in the flow chamber was analyzed pixel by pixel at 1 pore volume intervals the ltv images showed that the average tce volume decreased from 10 ml to 9 6 ml a decrease of 4 after two pore volumes of cosolvent flushing fig 5 shows the change of tce light intensity as a function of pore volume for experiment 1 and 2 the decrease in light intensity with the progress of the experiment confirmed that the cosolvent flushing gradually decreased tce saturation and the tce volume entrapped in the porous medium moreover fig 5 also shows a slight decrease in the light intensity and dnapl mass remaining in the flow chamber when a slower flushing solution velocity is used experiments 1 vs experiment 2 when the flushing solution velocity is decreased the contact time between the flushing solution and the entrapped dnapl increases leading to a greater dissolution rate into the aqueous phase for example agaoglu et al 2015 and hence a decrease in light intensity the effluent cumulative mass of tce observed after each pore volume of cosolvent flushing is presented in fig 6 a the tce mass recovery for low and high velocities are 360 mg and 85 mg respectively these results were determined from the effluent tce concentrations and confirmed by the ltv as shown in fig 4 the recovered dnapl mass fractions are relatively small because 20 ethanol content does not significantly enhance tce solubility aydin sarikurt et al 2016 the lower tce recovery at the higher velocity is due to the shorter contact time between the napl and flushing solution which limits the mass transfer from the napl to the aqueous phase 3 3 enhanced mobility experiments experiments 3 and 4 correspond to 50 ethanol contents with high and low velocities respectively fig 7 depicts the time dependent change in tce saturation due to flushing for experiment 3 at pore volume of 1 it was observed that the tce moved towards the bottom of the flow chamber which was not observed during the 20 ethanol content flushing this is due to significant decrease of the tce water interfacial tension ift from 34 5 n m to 5 6 n m for 50 ethanol aydin sarikurt et al 2016 causing a significant decrease in the capillary forces holding the dnapl in place as a result dnapl migrate downwards due to its higher density relative to that of the flushing solution the significantly decreased ift at ethanol contents higher than 50 indicates that such high ethanol content would induce tce mobility under normally encountered field conditions at lower ethanol contents the ift remains high and tce mobilization is not expected to occur image analysis showed that the tce saturation decreased rapidly with cosolvent flushing for both velocities the tce removal after 2 pore volumes of flushing was 58 for experiment 3 as shown in fig 7 this observation was consistent with the recovered cumulative tce mass determined from the collected effluent samples fig 6b furthermore it was observed that the tce plume migrated downstream about 8 cm relative to its original position as shown in fig 7 confirming that both mobilization and dissolution of tce occurred the results of the ltv images demonstrated that flushing efficiency depends on both ethanol content and flushing velocity for experiment 4 with the high flushing velocity the reduction of tce saturation was 48 compared to 58 for experiment 3 as noted in the discussion of experiments 1 and 2 the decrease in dnapl recovery is due to the higher flow rate and shorter contact time of experiment 4 relative to experiment 3 in experiments 5 and 6 the ethanol content was increased to 65 fig 8 shows the tce saturation due to cosolvent flushing corresponding to experiment 5 it was observed that the removal of tce took place at earlier times compared with the previous experiments specifically tce mobility was observed after only 25 min of flushing which corresponds to 0 7 pv as depicted in fig 8 b the cumulative reduction in tce saturation was 92 and 85 for the cases of low and high velocities respectively these values are consistent with the cumulative tce mass determined from the collected effluent samples as in the previous sets of experiments the cumulative mass removal of tce was higher for the case of low velocity as compared to the case of high velocity due to increased contact between the flushing solution and the dnapl fig 6c shows the increase in recovered tce mass as determined from the effluent concentrations for the case of low and high flushing velocities significant dnapl mobility was also observed at this high ethanol content overall the image results clearly show that the ltv technique is able to reveal the impact of velocity and ethanol content on the dnapl recovery the ltv results also show the potential dnapl migration at high ethanol contents whereas traditional effluent concentration analysis can show the recovered dnapl mass ltv results can additionally reveal and potentially quantify the dnapl migration both horizontally in the direction of flow and vertically downwards due to density effects 3 4 effect of double porosity on flushing the last experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of the double porosity medium on cosolvent flushing process the same procedure was followed as discussed in the previous sections the sole difference in this experiment was that a single porosity medium silica sand was used for filling the flow chamber silica sand representing a single porosity medium was used instead of the double porosity medium only one ethanol water content 65 was used since the aim of this experiment was to examine the effect of the double porosity results show similar behavior to that of experiments 5 but with a delayed breakthrough compared to the double porosity case this is attributed to the type of porosities present in the single and double porosity media the double porosity medium consists of two types of porosities macro pores and micro pores whereas the single porosity medium consists of macro pores only the net effect is that the effective pore volume of the single porosity medium is larger than that of the double porosity medium as a result relatively earlier breakthrough was observed with the double porosity media fig 9 shows the dnapl saturation in the flow cell at different times after two pore volumes of flushing solution a reduction in tce saturation of 53 was observed however the flushing solution takes a longer time to reach the exit point as compared to experiment 5 in recent studies alazaiza et al 2017a and ngien et al 2012 examined the influence of macro pores on dnapl behavior in double porosity media they observed that dnapl migration occurs mostly in the macro pores on the other hand minimal dnapl penetrates through the micro pores within the clay this indicates that double porosity media can have a significant effect on dnapl transport including the possibility of early breakthrough it is shown in this study that the ltv method can accurately capture the aqueous and dnapl transport mechanisms in both single and double porosity media 4 conclusion cosolvent flushing is often considered for the remediation of napl in subsurface for selecting the optimal system properties there is a need for effective and accurate evaluation techniques that can rapidly assess the performance of different remediation schemes in this paper six 2 d experiments with double porosity soil were carried out to investigate the influence of cosolvent flushing on dnapl removal the results were analyzed using the ltv method while single porosity media have been widely examined in the literature double porosity media have been much less examined although they are often encountered in the field double porosity was created using local silica sand and sintered spheres of kaolin arranged in a periodic manner the flushing solution consisted of ethanol water mixtures with ethanol content ranging from 20 to 65 by volume two different velocities low and high corresponding to 1 m day and 3 m d respectively were considered in the experiments to examine the effect of flushing solution velocity on dnapl removal the accuracy of the ltv technique was examined by comparing the actual injected volume of dnapl with the calculated volume of dnapl from image analysis before conducting the experiment results from the images showed that in all of the experiments the dnapl mass recovery depended strongly on the ethanol content and the velocity of the flushing solution as noted in previous studies specifically the findings of the study based on the interpreted ltv images indicated that the higher ethanol content leads to a higher removal percentage of napl while the higher velocity of flushing solution resulted in a lower removal percentage of napl the cumulative dnapl removal was highest for experiment 5 and 6 which corresponded to ethanol contents of 65 with removal percentage of 92 and 85 for low and high velocities respectively the ltv results also revealed the occurrence of dnapl transport downward due to gravity and in the direction of flow due to hydrodynamic forces selected flushing experiment was also repeated by filling the flow chamber with silica sand as a single porosity media to evaluate the relative effect of double porosity on remediation process comparable results to the experiments of double porosity were obtained however the time for breakthrough was different due to the presence of both macro pores and micro pores in the double porosity since the micro pores are less accessible to the dnapl and flushing solution the overall result is a higher flow velocity in the double porosity medium and therefore earlier breakthrough overall this study demonstrated that the ltv technique is a viable laboratory tool for accurate investigation of dnapl removal when enhanced dissolution and mobilization occurs in both single and double porosity media whereas effluent sample analyses can provide information about the recovered mass ltv can also provide valuable information about dnapl mobility in the direction of flow due to the hydrodynamic as well as vertically due to density effects the results of this study also show that the ltv techniques can be potentially used for the dynamic analysis of multiphase flow in porous media in other settings besides napl remediation credit authorship contribution statement motasem y d alazaiza conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

5621,this paper investigates the effect of cosolvent content and flushing velocity on the remediation of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl in double porosity medium using light transmission visualization technique ltv double porosity was created using local silica sand and sintered spheres of kaolin arranged in a periodic manner the flushing solution consisted of ethanol water mixtures with various ethanol concentrations ranging from 20 to 65 by volume the effect of contact time was investigated by changing the flow rates of the flushing solution the accuracy of the ltv technique was examined by comparing an actual injected volume of dnapl with the calculated volumes generated from image analysis the ltv results allowed for the visualization of the dnapl enhanced dissolution as well as its mobilization while the removal efficiency increased with the increase of the ethanol content the removal efficiency was negatively affected by the velocity of flushing solution image analysis revealed that the highest dnapl removal efficiency of 92 was obtained at 65 ethanol content and low flushing velocity this efficiency decreased to 85 in the case of high flushing velocity overall this study demonstrated that the ltv technique is a viable laboratory tool that can accurately depict enhanced dnapl dissolution and dnapl mobilization due to cosolvent flushing keywords cosolvent flushing dnapl double porosity media light transmission visualization groundwater contamination 1 introduction organic contaminants in non aqueous phase liquid napl form are among the main causes of groundwater and soil contamination in the last few decades more than 311 000 polluted sites have been cleaned in the us alone and many sites still need to be remediated epa 2004 most of these contaminants are immiscible with water due to their low aqueous solubility yang et al 2013 as a result the contamination of the subsurface by dnapls can persist for many years leading to the contamination of large portions of the groundwater chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce are the most commonly encountered dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls due to their widespread use in various industrial activities such as metal degreasing and cleaning agent stroo et al 2003 when a dnapl is released into the subsurface it first migrates within the unsaturated zone under the effect of the gravitational hydrodynamic and capillary forces if the released dnapl volume is sufficiently large it can penetrate down into the saturated zone and continue its downward movement until some hydraulic or capillary barrier is encountered understanding the dynamic behavior of the dnapl in subsurface multiphase system is essential for evaluating the impacts of pollution sources and for the design of proper remediation schemes zheng et al 2015 several factors affect dnapl migration in the subsurface which can be characterized into three groups i properties of porous media such as soil structure hydraulic conductivity capillary pressure and pore size ii fluid characteristics such as density viscosity wettability and interfacial tension and iii subsurface conditions such as soil water content and groundwater flow velocity mercer and cohen 1990 huling and weaver 1991 bourg et al 1992 in natural state many soil types have two distinct scales of porosity which give rise to the term double porosity soil structure carminati et al 2008 double porosity is a natural phenomenon that occurs when two separate pore systems emerge simultaneously in the structure of a soil warren and root 1963 lewallen and wang 1998 rock aquifers pao and lewis 2002 compacted soils romero et al 1999 and agricultural top soil el zein et al 2006 are examples of geomaterials that potentially exhibit double porosity characteristics due to the low solubility of dnapls and their relatively high capillary forces in the subsurface their remediation using conventional methods such as pump and treat has been noted to be ineffective under natural conditions encountered in the field aydin sarikurt et al 2016 childs et al 2006 therefore the need for alternative remediation techniques has led to the development of different technologies such as air sparging in situ cosolvent and surfactant flushing and soil vapor extraction soga et al 2004 oostrom et al 2007 cosolvent flushing involves chemical injection to enhance the napl solubility and instigate its mobility as a separate phase by reducing the interfacial tension of the dnapl and the groundwater phases dokou and karatzas 2013 dokou et al 2016 soil and groundwater flushing using reagent aqueous solutions is usually employed to enhance the dissolution of the contaminants the most common cosolvents considered for dnapl remediation are low molecular weight alcohols such as ethanol 1 propanol and 2 propanol which are highly soluble and water miscible resulting in the enhancement of solubilization and mobilization of dnapls entrapped in the subsurface oostrom et al 2006 sale and newell 2010 cosolvent flushing was proposed by several researchers in order to enhance the efficiency of contaminant remediation imhoff et al 1995 lunn and kueper 1999 brusseau et al 2002 aydin et al 2011 agaoglu et al 2012 atteia et al 2013 karaoglu et al 2019 the use of high cosolvent contents has been shown to lead to high dnapl recovery in laboratory experiments however the volume of injected product is very important to be economically sustainable atteia et al 2013 some researchers have proposed mixing cosolvents with surfactants in order to enhance the remediation efficiency of napl and to reduce the amounts of injected cosolvents childs et al 2006 jawitz et al 2000 these studies demonstrated that a multiple step remediation technique consisting of a series of floods can potentially optimize dnapl remediation there is a need for cost effective laboratory techniques to evaluate and optimize different remediation strategies prior to their application in the field image analysis techniques have emerged in recent years as effective tools for the visualization and investigation of dnapl transport as well as dnapl remediation in different types of porous media alazaiza et al 2017a 2017b 2018 bob et al 2008 for example light transmission visualization ltv was used by bob et al 2008 to investigate the efficiency of air sparging for the recovery of volatile organic compounds vocs in 2 d laboratory experiments bob et al 2008 concluded that the ltv is a viable method to evaluate changes in dnapl saturation during laboratory remediation process kaye et al 2008 used ltv to investigate the partial removal of dnapl using enhanced dissolution based on the relationship between reduction in dnapl mass and the corresponding reduction in contaminant mass flux they concluded that the ltv is capable of predicting the contaminant flux reduction and mass reduction relationships for distributed dnapl sources a major advantage of the ltv technique is that it allows to visualize the entire dnapl zone including both the entrapped dnapl and the mobile aqueous phase surrounding the dnapl in contrast traditional experimental techniques allow sample collection and analysis at few points only typically the effluent and in some instances few additional locations within the domain the objective of this study is to conduct a quantitative investigation of cosolvent flushing used to enhance the solubilization and mobilization of a dnapl in double porosity soil medium using the ltv technique while laboratory scale dnapl zone remediation studies involving single porosity soils are quite common studies investigating dnapl recovery from double porosity soils are quite rare the application of ltv to cosolvent flushing in dual porosity media has not been examined previously specifically a known amount of dnapl was injected in a 2 d saturated double porosity soil medium different cosolvent flushing solutions were applied and ltv was used to generate high resolution time dependent dnapl saturation maps and to evaluate the influence of cosolvent concentration on dnapl recovery mechanism after that the influence of cosolvent concentration on dnapl recovery mechanism was investigated using ltv technique the considered dnapl in this study was tce the flushing solution consisted of ethanol water mixtures with ethanol contents ranging between 20 and 65 by volume the impact of flushing solution velocity on dnapl behavior was also investigated for comparison purposes the experiment with the high ethanol content was repeated by filling the flow chamber with silica sand a single porosity medium in order to investigate the effect of double porosity on fluid flow this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the materials and methods used for preparing and conducting the flushing experiments image capturing and processing techniques for the determination of the dynamic dnapl distribution through the soil are also discussed in section 2 the results of the ltv application to dnapl and cosolvent flushing are presented and discussed in section 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 material characteristics in this study the materials used to create the double porosity soil structure are local silica sand and s300 kaolin the procedure used for the preparation of the double porosity medium is described in the following section before starting the experiments a general characterization including physical chemical and mineralogical tests was carried out for both materials all properties can be found in alazaiza et al 2017b trichloroethylene tce was used to represent the dnapl tce density is 1 46 g cm3 and its solubility in water is 1100 mg l at 25 c additional tce properties can be found in ruffino and zanetti 2009 2 2 composition of double porosity structure the double porosity structure consisted of sintered clay spheres and fine sand according to the method of lewandowska et al 2008 s300 kaolin was used to make the sintered clay spheres while the sand was commercial local silica sand the sintered clay spheres were formed manually by adding a sufficient amount of water to kaolin powder and mixing the clay spheres were then put inside a furnace and the temperature was increased gradually until it reached 1000 c this process was conducted to make the kaolin spheres hard in order to avoid their disintegration during saturation of the double porosity soil samples in the study the clay sphere diameter was about 6 mm while the average pore size in the clay spheres was around 5 µm scanning electron microscopy sem of the kaolin spheres showed that the kaolin spheres were almost homogeneous without skin effect due to reduced porosity alazaiza et al 2019 sand retained on the 212 µm sieve was used as the filler material distilled water was used to clean the sand from any fine residuals present the sand was subsequently oven dried for 48 h at 45 c in order to create the double porosity structure the clay spheres were put layer by layer in such a manner that they were touching each other between each clay sphere layer a layer of sand was carefully poured and then compacted by tapping a plastic hammer on the outer frame of the acrylic model the volumetric fractions of macro pores silica sand and micro pores clay spheres were 50 each the resultant total porosity of the double porosity structure was 0 42 fig 1 a shows the composition of sand and clay to create the double porosity structure 2 3 experimental setup a series of 2 d flushing experiments were conducted and the ltv technique to was used to visualize the performance of ethanol flushing of tce in total six 2 d flow flushing experiments were performed with double porosity and one experiment was performed with silica sand as a single porosity the experiments were used to study the effect of flushing solution composition on tce remediation using ltv as listed in table 1 the dimensions of the flow chamber were 45 cm height 30 cm width 1 cm depth the surfaces of the chamber were made of 10 mm thick acrylic plates the flow chamber was fixed inside a steel frame attached to a stainless steel lightbox that contained the light source different ports were installed on all sides of the flow chamber as shown in fig 1 b tce was injected from the upper ports for better visualization of the tce distribution while the bottom ports were used for water and co2 injection because it leads to less air entrapment three ports were installed on the left and right sides of the flow chambers the inner sides of these frames were milled with a 100 µm glass frit to allow the inflow and outflow of flushing solutions a peristaltic pump was used for ethanol flushing from the left side the effluent aqueous solution was captured by the three ports located on the right side of the chamber stainless steel tube lines from these three ports were merged into one stainless steel tube line that was connected to a teflon tube line which ran through a flow meter and then positioned at proper elevation to establish the required water table level in the chamber experiments were carried out using three different flushing solutions containing 20 50 and 65 ethanol by volume and two different flow velocities 1 m day low and 3 m d high these velocities are consistent with the actual groundwater velocities in the field under natural conditions the typical groundwater velocities are in the order of 0 1 to 1 m day salanitro et al 2000 aydin sarikurt et al 2016 the ltv system used to quantify tce saturation before and after ethanol flushing consisted mainly of a light source that had five 18 watt fluorescent tubes osram malaysia and a nikon d7100 digital camera nikon malaysia as described by alazaiza et al 2017a for light intensity homogenization a holographic light shaping diffuser lsd luminit usa was fixed behind the flow chamber and in front of the light source the camera was placed in a fixed position of 1 5 m from the flow chamber the image spatial resolution was 24 megapixels 6000 by 4000 pixels which corresponded to approximately 0 027 0 027 cm2 per pixel the dynamic range of the camera is 12 bit resulting in 4096 gy levels the nikon camera control pro software was used to control image acquisition in order to avoid the vibration of the camera during images collection all images were captured using a 600 nm center wavelength 10 nm band pass filter orientir inc china attached to a 67 mm lens nikkor 18 105 mm f 3 5 5 6g ed vr nikon malaysia the aperture setting of the lens was adjusted in order to fully utilize the dynamic range of the camera using exposure times of a few seconds the aperture of the lens was fixed at f 5 6 for all images and the exposure time was 2 s all images were collected inside a dark room and the environment surrounding the system was maintained at 23 1 c 2 4 experimental procedure for each experiment the flow chamber was dry packed with the double porosity soil medium as discussed in section 2 2 after the flow chamber was fully packed with the double porosity medium the top frame of the flow chamber was reattached and black silicon was used to seal all gaps the light source was switched on and after 30 min an image of the dry double porosity sample was collected to determine id the light intensity of the flow chamber under dry condition the flow chamber was then slowly purged with co2 gas for 40 min to remove any trapped air after injection of co2 distilled water was slowly introduced into the flow chamber from the bottom ports under a positive pressure after 1 h of saturating the flow chamber with water the saturated transmission image was captured and used to estimate is which is the light intensity of the flow chamber in the fully water saturated case before the start of each flushing experiment a volume of 10 ml tce was gradually injected into the flow chamber using a syringe through the top injection ports to enhance the spread of tce distribution the 10 ml dyed tce were added as follows 5 0 ml were released from the top center port and 2 5 ml were released from each of two ports located to the left and right of the center port tce injection was performed in five 2 ml increments and after the injection of each amount images were captured these successive incremental injections of dnapl and acquired multiple images during dnapl injection helps better calibrate the mass balance calculation the injection of tce was performed by inserting the needle to about 3 cm below the top of the tank at all three release locations in all experiments the tce was allowed to redistribute for 72 h and at least three ltv images were captured for each model prior to the injection of the flushing solution tce was dyed with oil red o 0 01 by weight before its injection for better visualization the use of low concentration of oil red o is not expected to significantly change the physical properties of tce taylor et al 2001 the tce saturation was calculated pixel by pixel using eq 1 alazaiza et al 2017b 1 s n ln i s ln i ln i s ln i n where sn is the tce saturation calculated pixel by pixel is is the light intensity of the flow chamber in the fully water saturated case i is the emergent light intensity and in is the light intensity of the flow chamber when it is considered fully saturated with napl in practice it is not feasible to fully saturate the flow chamber with napl each time the model is packed therefore in was calculated using the following theoretical expression based on the dnapl and porous media properties alazaiza et al 2017b 2 i n i s τ wn 2 k s k c exp α n d o k where α n is the absorption coefficient of the dyed dnapl which can be measured using spectrophotometer d o is the average pore diameter and kc and ks are the number of the pores that are filled with dnapl for the case of clay and sand respectively k is the total number of the pores that are filled with dnapl which can be calculated using eq 3 3 k ln i s i d 2 ln τ sw τ sa id is the light intensity of the flow chamber when it is dry whereas do kc ks and τwn can be calculated as described in alazaiza et al 2017a τwn the transmission factor can be calculated using fresnel s law for any two phases by measuring the refractive index of these two phases ryer 1998 mass balance was then calculated to compare the calculated volume of tce based on image analysis and the actual tce volume added into the flow chamber after the tce injection the cosolvent flushing solution was applied from the inlet ports at the left side of the tank using the peristaltic pump for each experiment two pore volumes of flushing solution were injected into the flow chamber the flushing solution flow rate was maintained steady throughout the experiment samples were collected from the three outlet ports at the right side the effluent samples were analyzed using a uv 160a uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 200 nm akyol et al 2011 during the injection of cosolvent flushing solution several images were captured in order to evaluate the change of tce saturation during the first 30 min of cosolvent flushing images were collected every 2 min after 30 min images were collected every 10 min the saturation distribution of the tce in the flow chamber was quantified without the need to develop a calibration curve following the ltv modified method as shown in eq 1 for this method the absorption of dyed tce α n was measured using a uv 160a uv vis spectrophotometer at the 600 nm wavelength 2 5 image analyzing and processing prior to image analysis image correction for temporal variations was conducted following a method described by bob et al 2008 specifically a reference image corresponding to the flow chamber fully saturated with water was first identified and this image was collected a small area in the flow chamber was used for temporal variation correction for light intensity and this area is referred to as the correction zone this zone should be always fully saturated with water in all images to correct a specific image the light intensity of each pixel in the image was multiplied by the ratio of the average light intensity of the correction zone for the reference image and the average light intensity of the correction zone for the image to be corrected at times designated for image collection at least three images were collected and the average light intensity values of the three images were used in the calculations to reduce errors in image capturing image analysis was conducted using image pro premier 9 1 software media cybernetics inc usa image analysis process contains different steps including conversion of the image from red green blue rgb version to gray level version and extraction of the light intensity pixel by pixel using image bitmap it is necessary when running the image analysis that all images have the same setting in terms of variables such as spatial calibration saturation calibration and area of interest aoi aoi refers to the area where all the measurements and calculations were performed within its boundaries and should be fixed for all images the last step was exporting all intensity values into ms excel to carry out the calculations for converting the light intensity to dnapl saturation a flowchart of the main procedures performed by ltv is shown in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial tce saturation in the double porosity medium as mentioned earlier the total volume of tce was injected into the flow chamber in 2 ml increments since the tce was dyed using oil red o it is important to take into consideration the effect of both light absorption and light refraction in the determination of tce saturations dying of tce resulted in reducing the light transmission in the flow chamber since the impact of dye on the light refraction at the tce water interface was unknown the transmission factor for the dyed tce water interface τ wn was calculated using mass balance calibration specifically images were captured during the incremental injection of tce and τ wn was adjusted such that the i n calculated with equation 2 yields initial dnapl volume that is consistent with actual injected tce volume this step was carried out for each experiment to account for any variations in compaction which may affect the value of transmission factor as the light intensity measured in each pixel is function of the numerous interfaces created by many pores within each pixel the value of τ wn was then used in all subsequent calculations key parameters determined from the initial tce saturation calculations are summarized in table 2 fig 3 shows the injected volume of tce plotted against the calculated volume of tce from image analysis a strong correlation was obtained between the injected and the calculated volumes of tce r2 0 987 for experiment 1 and r2 0 984 for experiment 2 the maximum error between the injected and the calculated volumes of tce were 8 4 and 9 6 for experiment 1 and 2 respectively errors were calculated by subtracting the calculated volume of tce from the injected volume and divided the difference by the calculated volume of tce from image analysis as follow 4 e v cal v inj v inj where vcal and vinj are the calculated and injected dnapl volumes respectively also the overall deviation of the calculated tce volumes from the injected volumes was calculated using the root mean square error rmse 5 rmse 1 n v cal v inj 2 where n is the number of tce increments different factors contribute to the error in the measurements of light intensity as reported by bob et al 2008 the main reasons of the errors are usually due to the variations in the intensity of light source as well as the resulted noise from camera opening as also reported by belfort et al 2017 2019 the stability of light source can be controlled by minimizing the number of turning on off of light source for the latter reason it is believed that the noise in the camera signal is present in each pixel thus the effect does not influence the mass balance calculation since it averages out in the summation of all pixels niemet and selker 2001 another factor contributing to the errors of the measurement of light intensity is the conceptual model it is assumed that in the conceptual model each pore in the flow chamber was either full or empty of tce which is not the exact case in reality some of the pore volume could be partially filled with tce which results in underestimation of tce volume obtained from image analysis this discrepancy is accounted for during model calibration 3 2 enhanced dissolution experiments experiment 1 and 2 depict the use of cosolvent flushing for the enhanced dissolution of tce the ethanol content of the flushing solution of experiments 1 and 2 was 20 experiment 1 was conducted under low velocity of cosolvent solution while the second experiment was carried out under high velocity of cosolvent solution fig 4 shows dnapl saturation images determined from the ltv technique at pv 0 1 and 2 for experiment 1 similar images were also determined for experiment 2 not shown here it was observed that the cosolvent flushing for both velocities had negligible impact on tce mobility at relatively low ethanol contents the interfacial tension between the dnapl and aqueous phases remains high preventing the mobility of the dnapl phases as a result enhanced dissolution is the only transport mechanism imhoff et al 1995 jawitz et al 2000 agaoglu et al 2012 a relatively small change in the tce saturation was observed after flushing the final pore volume of cosolvent solution particularly at the high rate flushing experiment 1 as shown in fig 3c this observation was consistent with the analysis of the effluent solution using spectrophotometer tce saturation in the flow chamber was analyzed pixel by pixel at 1 pore volume intervals the ltv images showed that the average tce volume decreased from 10 ml to 9 6 ml a decrease of 4 after two pore volumes of cosolvent flushing fig 5 shows the change of tce light intensity as a function of pore volume for experiment 1 and 2 the decrease in light intensity with the progress of the experiment confirmed that the cosolvent flushing gradually decreased tce saturation and the tce volume entrapped in the porous medium moreover fig 5 also shows a slight decrease in the light intensity and dnapl mass remaining in the flow chamber when a slower flushing solution velocity is used experiments 1 vs experiment 2 when the flushing solution velocity is decreased the contact time between the flushing solution and the entrapped dnapl increases leading to a greater dissolution rate into the aqueous phase for example agaoglu et al 2015 and hence a decrease in light intensity the effluent cumulative mass of tce observed after each pore volume of cosolvent flushing is presented in fig 6 a the tce mass recovery for low and high velocities are 360 mg and 85 mg respectively these results were determined from the effluent tce concentrations and confirmed by the ltv as shown in fig 4 the recovered dnapl mass fractions are relatively small because 20 ethanol content does not significantly enhance tce solubility aydin sarikurt et al 2016 the lower tce recovery at the higher velocity is due to the shorter contact time between the napl and flushing solution which limits the mass transfer from the napl to the aqueous phase 3 3 enhanced mobility experiments experiments 3 and 4 correspond to 50 ethanol contents with high and low velocities respectively fig 7 depicts the time dependent change in tce saturation due to flushing for experiment 3 at pore volume of 1 it was observed that the tce moved towards the bottom of the flow chamber which was not observed during the 20 ethanol content flushing this is due to significant decrease of the tce water interfacial tension ift from 34 5 n m to 5 6 n m for 50 ethanol aydin sarikurt et al 2016 causing a significant decrease in the capillary forces holding the dnapl in place as a result dnapl migrate downwards due to its higher density relative to that of the flushing solution the significantly decreased ift at ethanol contents higher than 50 indicates that such high ethanol content would induce tce mobility under normally encountered field conditions at lower ethanol contents the ift remains high and tce mobilization is not expected to occur image analysis showed that the tce saturation decreased rapidly with cosolvent flushing for both velocities the tce removal after 2 pore volumes of flushing was 58 for experiment 3 as shown in fig 7 this observation was consistent with the recovered cumulative tce mass determined from the collected effluent samples fig 6b furthermore it was observed that the tce plume migrated downstream about 8 cm relative to its original position as shown in fig 7 confirming that both mobilization and dissolution of tce occurred the results of the ltv images demonstrated that flushing efficiency depends on both ethanol content and flushing velocity for experiment 4 with the high flushing velocity the reduction of tce saturation was 48 compared to 58 for experiment 3 as noted in the discussion of experiments 1 and 2 the decrease in dnapl recovery is due to the higher flow rate and shorter contact time of experiment 4 relative to experiment 3 in experiments 5 and 6 the ethanol content was increased to 65 fig 8 shows the tce saturation due to cosolvent flushing corresponding to experiment 5 it was observed that the removal of tce took place at earlier times compared with the previous experiments specifically tce mobility was observed after only 25 min of flushing which corresponds to 0 7 pv as depicted in fig 8 b the cumulative reduction in tce saturation was 92 and 85 for the cases of low and high velocities respectively these values are consistent with the cumulative tce mass determined from the collected effluent samples as in the previous sets of experiments the cumulative mass removal of tce was higher for the case of low velocity as compared to the case of high velocity due to increased contact between the flushing solution and the dnapl fig 6c shows the increase in recovered tce mass as determined from the effluent concentrations for the case of low and high flushing velocities significant dnapl mobility was also observed at this high ethanol content overall the image results clearly show that the ltv technique is able to reveal the impact of velocity and ethanol content on the dnapl recovery the ltv results also show the potential dnapl migration at high ethanol contents whereas traditional effluent concentration analysis can show the recovered dnapl mass ltv results can additionally reveal and potentially quantify the dnapl migration both horizontally in the direction of flow and vertically downwards due to density effects 3 4 effect of double porosity on flushing the last experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of the double porosity medium on cosolvent flushing process the same procedure was followed as discussed in the previous sections the sole difference in this experiment was that a single porosity medium silica sand was used for filling the flow chamber silica sand representing a single porosity medium was used instead of the double porosity medium only one ethanol water content 65 was used since the aim of this experiment was to examine the effect of the double porosity results show similar behavior to that of experiments 5 but with a delayed breakthrough compared to the double porosity case this is attributed to the type of porosities present in the single and double porosity media the double porosity medium consists of two types of porosities macro pores and micro pores whereas the single porosity medium consists of macro pores only the net effect is that the effective pore volume of the single porosity medium is larger than that of the double porosity medium as a result relatively earlier breakthrough was observed with the double porosity media fig 9 shows the dnapl saturation in the flow cell at different times after two pore volumes of flushing solution a reduction in tce saturation of 53 was observed however the flushing solution takes a longer time to reach the exit point as compared to experiment 5 in recent studies alazaiza et al 2017a and ngien et al 2012 examined the influence of macro pores on dnapl behavior in double porosity media they observed that dnapl migration occurs mostly in the macro pores on the other hand minimal dnapl penetrates through the micro pores within the clay this indicates that double porosity media can have a significant effect on dnapl transport including the possibility of early breakthrough it is shown in this study that the ltv method can accurately capture the aqueous and dnapl transport mechanisms in both single and double porosity media 4 conclusion cosolvent flushing is often considered for the remediation of napl in subsurface for selecting the optimal system properties there is a need for effective and accurate evaluation techniques that can rapidly assess the performance of different remediation schemes in this paper six 2 d experiments with double porosity soil were carried out to investigate the influence of cosolvent flushing on dnapl removal the results were analyzed using the ltv method while single porosity media have been widely examined in the literature double porosity media have been much less examined although they are often encountered in the field double porosity was created using local silica sand and sintered spheres of kaolin arranged in a periodic manner the flushing solution consisted of ethanol water mixtures with ethanol content ranging from 20 to 65 by volume two different velocities low and high corresponding to 1 m day and 3 m d respectively were considered in the experiments to examine the effect of flushing solution velocity on dnapl removal the accuracy of the ltv technique was examined by comparing the actual injected volume of dnapl with the calculated volume of dnapl from image analysis before conducting the experiment results from the images showed that in all of the experiments the dnapl mass recovery depended strongly on the ethanol content and the velocity of the flushing solution as noted in previous studies specifically the findings of the study based on the interpreted ltv images indicated that the higher ethanol content leads to a higher removal percentage of napl while the higher velocity of flushing solution resulted in a lower removal percentage of napl the cumulative dnapl removal was highest for experiment 5 and 6 which corresponded to ethanol contents of 65 with removal percentage of 92 and 85 for low and high velocities respectively the ltv results also revealed the occurrence of dnapl transport downward due to gravity and in the direction of flow due to hydrodynamic forces selected flushing experiment was also repeated by filling the flow chamber with silica sand as a single porosity media to evaluate the relative effect of double porosity on remediation process comparable results to the experiments of double porosity were obtained however the time for breakthrough was different due to the presence of both macro pores and micro pores in the double porosity since the micro pores are less accessible to the dnapl and flushing solution the overall result is a higher flow velocity in the double porosity medium and therefore earlier breakthrough overall this study demonstrated that the ltv technique is a viable laboratory tool for accurate investigation of dnapl removal when enhanced dissolution and mobilization occurs in both single and double porosity media whereas effluent sample analyses can provide information about the recovered mass ltv can also provide valuable information about dnapl mobility in the direction of flow due to the hydrodynamic as well as vertically due to density effects the results of this study also show that the ltv techniques can be potentially used for the dynamic analysis of multiphase flow in porous media in other settings besides napl remediation credit authorship contribution statement motasem y d alazaiza conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

characteristics owing to the significant variations of hco3 and so4 in the groundwater samples piper 1944 diagram was used fig 2 a to evaluate the geochemical facies and water types no major difference in the cation clusters was observed whereas anions displayed predominant variations the water samples clearly denoted three different kinds of compositions and it was evident from the piper diagram that the groups represented a semi concentric tendency in the aquifer area fig 2b in general the plot discerned three major clusters of samples with respect to anions samples representing ca hco3 ca mg hco3 facies were referred to as group 1 n 23 samples of ca so4 facies were referred to as group 3 n 15 while the ones that fall between these two groups are categorized as group 2 n 32 spatial distribution of the samples denotes that group 3 fell in the northeastern part of the study area with few samples in the northwest whereas groups 1 and 2 are scattered in the west east and southern part of the study area fig 2b the overall statistical analysis of the samples representing these three groups showed that the average values of cations in the samples of group 1 were to be in the order of all values in mg l na 297 ca 228 mg 194 but the other two groups showed an order of ca na mg in the case of anions group 1 and group 3 presented an order of all values in mg l hco3 537 so4 53 cl 25 and so4 248 hco3 388 cl 44 64 respectively whereas group 2 samples fell in between these two groups with low values of hco3 312 mg l and high values of cl 26 mg l and so4 248 mg l than the group 1 samples the mean concentration of metals shows higher values of all values in μg l li 255 b 1624 v 16 58 mn 595 and mo 2 51 in group 1 cr 74 80 rb 1919 sr 1363 ce 61 and tl 29 in group 3

followed by group 1 samples table 1 hence in general the preliminary observation of the data would indicate that the composition of group 2 samples falls between group 1 and group 3 suggesting mixing in a different proportion 4 2 isotopic inferences the oxygen isotopes are used to study the periodicity of glacial cycles and it is inferred that a complete cycle of advance and retreat is defined by δ18o for every 41 000 years custodio and llamas 1983 this study also highlighted the importance of stable isotopes as an indicator to study the recharge and flow patterns also stable isotope studies complied with 14c ages in groundwater which could help in deciphering the climatic conditions of the groundwater recharge fontes matray 1993 for this study five samples from the periphery of the fault fracture system were analyzed for δ18o δd δ13c and 14c fig 3 the age of the groundwater was estimated to be from 35 830 yrs bp to 2 880 yrs bp pleistocene to holocene inferred by 14c analysis likewise δ13c ranging from 3 5 to 13 2 and was observed that δd and δ13c values increased with age table 2 the results of the radiometric ages were correlated with the periglacials events and with the pre malinche and malinche construction in puebla mexico table 2 precise correlations between the stages mi and miv of glaciation during the erection of la malinche volcano suggested that the groundwater found in the aquifer of puebla has been characterized by the late pleistocene to holocene precipitation however various records pointed out that the glaciation on the highest elevations occurred during the late pleistocene in the study area heine 1975 1988 1994 lorenzo and heine 2004 δ18o values that ranged between 9 8 and 9 4 corresponded to the precipitation phase in cold climates correspondingly according to the rayleigh distillation process the isotopic composition in the precipitation water is less while it is away from the steam source zone aguilar ramírez et al 2017 chivelet and muñoz garcía 2015 henceforth based on the values acquired for the present study it can be concluded that the recharge zone of the fluid is nearby the metropolitan zone the formation of la malinche volcano late pleistocene to holocene is subdivided into three phases phases 1 begins with the location of the layer known as huamantla pumicita 45 ka continuing 21 4 ka ago the malinche pumicita i record defines the beginning of phase 2 that culminates in the placement of a pumice rain called the malinche pumicita ii mpii originated 12 ka ago heine 1973 1994 this pumice unit represents the beginning of phase 3 whose last eruption occurred 3 1 ka ago castro govea siebe 2007 the glacial behaviour in la malinche has been divided into 5 stages through the quaternary where the oldest phase is called mi and is dated from 36 000 yrs bp heine 1988 1994 identified in the area by a moraine located 2550 m south of the volcanic structure heine 1973 thus it may be inferred that the sample from well 26 would have been recharged from the precipitation that occurred in this phase predominantly snowfall developing ice sheets and would be the product of the melting of this ice deposit and its subsequently infiltration into the adjacent and lateral region of the volcano being simultaneous the formation of the volcanic building to the glacial episodes the advanced event mi continued until approximately 26 000 yrs bp when there was an intense formation of soil coinciding with a gradual change in temperature passing from the extremely cold to a warm pattern this pattern favored the melting and deposit of fossil soil known in the literature as fb1 heine 1973 1988 which is also being deposited in the east of the iztaccihuatl volcano white 1956 1962 it can be deduced that the development of volcanic topography controls the geometry of the basin and contributed the volcano detritic sediments forming the aquifers while glacial episodes contributed significant amount of water that infiltrated to these aquifers cooler periods were observed by stable isotopic results of water samples representing miii miv and mv stages of glaciation the climatic fluctuation is witnessed by the sea level changes lambeck et al 2001 later siegel et al 1996 also witnessed dilution process due to the mixing of recent and old groundwater their study also inferred that stable isotope signatures do not bear the exact relevance to the age of recharge this due to the fact that waters can be affected by vertical and horizontal movement resulting in a mixing de melo et al 2001 reported enriched values of isotopes in late pleistocene waters as the isotopic signatures of well no 26 samples 44 and 71 corresponded to the late wisconsin period which had a decrease of 5 7 c and increased precipitation phillips et al 1986 the climatic inference resulted in the enrichment of δ18o and δd when compared to the younger groundwater zong et al 2006 reported an unstable climatic condition during the period from 12 to 7 ka bp and it is considered as a period of transition from pleistocene to holocene this was reflected in samples 44 and 71 the depleted isotopic values in the younger holocene sample indicated effective precipitation the study also deduced that the longer residence time of the water helped in the enrichment of stable isotope values puebla valley has an extensive record of the glacial events de la terra et al 1949 white 1954 1956 1962 1986 complemented by the archaeological remains found in the locality of valsequillo puebla which included fossils of mammoth mastodon camel horse four horned antelope saber toothed tiger ceballos 2010 urrutia fucugauchi 2014 the δ18o and δ13c presented a significant variation in the late pleistocene displaying an increase in the seasonal precipitation during the 30 000 years bp to 18 000 years bp stevens et al 2012 cruz y cruz et al 2016 in the recent period the slope of la malinche volcano has developed multiple fractures that facilitated a greater infiltration of rainwater and the resulting snow melt from the highest parts of the volcano this infiltration mechanism originated from the shallowest groundwater flows and thus of the infiltrated reserves which are discharged in the form of springs in the foothills of the volcano galicia 2015 4 2 1 gmwl global meteoric water line on the gmwl the composition of the stable isotopes of the present study fell between the samples of ages ranging from holocene 12 000 yrs bp to late pleistocene representing the different parts of the world fig 3 indicates that there is a wide range of isotopic values representing the holocene samples ranging from enriched to depleted except for the few of the pleistocene 30 000 36 000 yrs bp and wisconsin glaciation 8 000 7 000 yrs bp samples most of them fell close to that of the present study the pleistocene samples 26 and 171 fell below the gmwl whereas the holocene 44 171 and 137 and wisconsin samples were categorized separately and those ranging in age from 4 000 to 2 000 yrs bp were classified as recent late holocene the aforesaid samples on the gmwl reflect the enrichment of isotopic values during the pleistocene due to the levels of humidity and amount of rainfall received during the time of recharge it is also interesting to note that they fell along the trend of few other pleistocene groundwater samples of the world fig 3 similar to the other stable isotopes analyzed δ13c 13 to 3 5 presented an increasing trend from pleistocene to recent suggesting that the younger ground waters are more depleted due to the variations in the atmospheric co2 levels the enrichment of δ 13c may also indicate the influence of volcanic carbon kristmannsdottir et al 1999 a comparison of the analytical results with the samples of similar age around the world indicates that they fell within the range except for samples of age 13 140 16 400 yrs bp due to the local geological conditions altitude or the volcanic history that prevailed during the time of recharge 4 3 boron average boron b concentrations in the groundwater samples were found to be higher 5000 μg l than the who 2010 limit of 2500 μg l spatial distribution of b values indicated that the central part of puebla valley along the confluence of two major structural faults presented higher concentrations whereas the ne and sw parts displayed low concentrations fig 4 4 3 1 relationship between boron and chloride variations in b levels could probably be due to the heterogeneous interaction of evaporates in arid regions that are normally reflected in the cl b ratio and mostly cl is conservative with respect to geothermal environments hence the variation in b and cl concentration in groundwater would also help in determining the provenances the linearity of group 1 was seen to be different from group 3 and they formed two extremes as the lower and upper limit of cl and b values elevated b values in group 1 samples were due to the dissolution process and upwelling of hydrothermal fluids fig 5a group 2 samples displayed horizontal migrations between these two extremes as witnessed in piper plot the lesser values in groups 2 and 3 were due to the adsorption of b on clay surfaces at a specific ph temperature and salinity fig 5a shows that group 1 water is of ca hco3 type at different ranges of b and cl the horizontal positioning of the samples representing group 2 displayed an increase of cl with respect to b indicating that they have been initially enriched with cl and during the course of migration had been enriched in b this process is corroborated by the radiometric dates the younger ones were with lesser values and they were subsequently enriched in the older samples the higher concentration of boron was noted in thermal waters than that of saline water and thus showed variation in the b cl ratio this increase of b could also be due to the increase of reaction rates at a higher temperature which could have caused the release of an element from respective minerals dotsika et al 2006 higher values of the b cl ratio with less cl values indicated the influence of meteoric water the higher ratio is similar to the studies that stated the influence of hydrothermal impacts fig 5b group 1 water has a comparatively higher ratio than the other groups indicating the influence of recharged rainwater table 3 which dissolved b from the mineral matrix fig 5b presenting b cl ratio vs cl was attempted by dotsika et al 2006 classifying the samples with 1 lesser values of cl and the ratio of b cl and 2 higher values of cl and the ratio of b cl where the former signified meteoric origin and not seawater intrusion moreover the ratio increased potentially due to the impact of hydrothermal sources on the groundwater of meteoric origin the representation of all the samples in both the categories would imply that both the processes were predominant in the study area 4 4 correlation analysis correlation analysis fig 6 indicated that b showed a high correlation with ec tds ca mg k hco3 co2 rb and sr irrespective of the water type that normally would determine the basic association of these elements moreover significant correlation between b and sr indicated partial dissolution of different salts present in the evaporate lenses like celestite and other borates further the non association of no3 rules out the possibility of common anthropogenic sources dotsika et al 2006 additionally tectonic events may influence the depth of occurrence of boron deposits and the strong correlation of k with b could be due to the partial dissolution of potash feldspar and its association with authigenic boron which is noted in the tuffaceous basins stamatakis 1989 albeit each group has a characteristic relation of differents elements to boron apart from these common correlated elements like group 1 was also well correlated with mo and u group 2 showed good relationship of ce la mn and co with b and group 3 with na and so4 these correlations with b could be the characteristic of each group apart from these relations two groups have certain elements related to b in common like group 1 and group 2 shows a correlation of b with temperature and thallium similarly group 1 and group 3 samples show a good correlation of cl to b and group 2 shows a good correlation of zr as ge and li with b which is also observed in group 3 samples the observations made in kirka eskisehir turkey also fall in line with the present observation that the b concentrations are noted to be higher in ca hco3 water types and the relationship of these elements with sr and al would help infer the association of lacustrine deposits the relationship of al and sr are generally well correlated with b in the regions predominant with borate deposits gemici et al 2008 zheng and liu 2009 the positive correlation of b with as and a higher concentration of as 10 µg l in group 1 samples also leads to the probability of leaching from arsenic minerals in the boron layers also li b and as association in groundwater generally denote hydrothermal process rosas et al 1999 boron in group 2 samples were more related to mn and li that aided in the adsorption of thallium in an oxidation environment koschinsky and hein 2003 jacobson et al 2005 karlsson 2006 the association of ca na so4 with boron indicated dissolution of evaporite minerals leaching of boron from the saline alkaline deposits and is generally inferred by the association with li in groundwater xiyu 1984 the elevated values of mn as and mo reflected as weak sulfide mineralization strong positive correlation of boron with li na and so4 indicated the significance of buried evaporates like borates and sulfates as clearly revealed in samples of group 3 stamatakis et al 2009 frequent volcanic events especially in arid regions with tuffaceous rocks help in the formation of borate deposits mellor 1980 significant correlation of b ca and mg in group 3 samples specified the increase of so4 at the shallow depths with the relationship of b with na eventually leading to the inference that there is an increase of dissolution in group 3 samples yuce and yasin 2012 further b relation with ca so4 water type presented correlation with the sulfate deposits like gypsum anhydrite etc similarly ca and mg were related in the groundwater that underwent dissolution process in the tuff regions the predominant sources of ca are calcite aragonite and colemanite whereas mg was reported to be derived from dolomite or hydroboracite inferred by helvaci 1995 the relationship of b and li in group 2 and group 3 samples would signify the prevalence of clay in the region gemici et al 2008 additionally the association of sr and ca with b indicated the dissolution from tunellite and celestite respectively and the exchange between ca and sr in the minerals could be chiefly due to their similar ionic radius where sr concentrations in groundwater increased resulting in significant correlations with b boron could have a significant concentration during the interglacial period derived from the tendency of this metalloid to be absorbed onto the clays at low temperatures palmer et al 1987 battaglia and pennisi 2016 it may be deduced that there was not direct relationship between the paleo climate and boron concentration however it is a fact that the climate has an effect on the boron assimilation however during the interglacial period the increased volcanic activity formed the volcanic rocks that provide boron to the sediments also the hydrothermal activity being the main source of boron it is necessary to highlight that the pleistocene is the stage where the geothermal deposit were derived from the multiple calderas generated between 2 7 and 2 1 my 4 5 bi variate plots bi variate plots were attempted to infer the relationship of boron with ba li as sr v cs mo so4 and ge no clear coordination with respect to age in plots of b against v mo cs and ba was observed however an increasing trend of concentration with respect to age was noted in so4 rb sr as and li the variations with respect to li v sr rb ba and as are highlighted in fig 7 the higher concentration of b in sample 171 7 890 yrs bp of group 2 than in sample 44 8 070 yrs bp would represent the end of wisconsin relative to glaciation moreover sample 44 presented high li and low b concentrations due to the preferential adsorption on li bearing clays thereby reducing the concentration of b in groundwater during 8 070 yrs bp nearly 10 samples represented b values 5000 µg l and if these samples were further diluted and analyzed to obtain the exact concentration coupled along with a detailed chronological data it will aid us to conclude a more accurate relationship of age with respect to boron concentration and their association with other elements the analytical results indicated that there was a clear increase of b in relation to rb and sr also the samples of group 1 and group 2 could be related to temperature and thallium reflecting the influence of hydrothermal waters further the correlation of u and mo in the group 1 samples was noted in closed aquifer waters that possess high pco2 and less so4 when the hydrothermal water upwells thallium and b it might also be possibly adsorbed on the clay surface at definite ph and this process was witnessed in sample 44 simultaneously during the process of upwelling along the fault planes there was a decrease in po2 which enhanced the availability of more oxygen fig 8 hence the s2 upwelling from deeper regions hydrothermal fluids was converted to so4 at shallow depth or in open fractured aquifer due to the availability of more oxygen s 2 2 o 2 2 s o 4 the h2s of geothermal origin also interacted with the fresh water at shallower levels a fraction of h2s dissolves in the liquid phase so the fluid is enriched in sulfates gonzález et al 2001 conclusively irrespective of the age of ca hco3 water of group 1 it represented a closed aquifer whereas group 3 was an open aquifer with more so4 it is witnessed that the activity of the sulfate ion increases with the increase of pco2 values fig 9 the sources of so4 is the oxidation of upwelling s2 from the hydrothermal process and dissolution of gypsum present in the aquifers considering that two different trends were noted with respect to sulfates fig 9 this inference is also supported by the saturated states of sulfates minerals gypsum and anhydrite wherein the si of these sulfate minerals in group 1 minerals were seen to be very less and high in group 3 minerals fig 10 a and b the relationship of pco2 and po2 could explain the variations of so4 with respect to groups the groups were basically categorized depending upon the water types the group 1 samples were predominantly of ca hco3 type and those of group 3 were of the ca so4 type the b concentration was higher irrespective of the group indicating different mechanisms of evolution the variation of po2 indicated the availability of oxygen for the formation of sulfates as reflected by the saturation index those of group 1 indicate a closed system as the samples predominantly reflected higher values of pco2 and po2 hence the b from samples of group 3 are mainly derived from the dissolution of geothermal sulfates and those of group 1 are from the leaching of evaporitic minerals of adsorbed b from clays these two basic mechanism of b evolution is derived from the pco2 and po2 relation with respect to so4 5 conclusion this study integrates the hydrogeochemical characterization and geochemical evolution of groundwater with special emphasis on boron levels to decipher natural and anthropogenic contamination in the puebla valley groundwater of puebla valley can be categorized as ca hco3 type group1 ca so4 type group 3 and intermediate type group 2 radiocarbon dating detected the presence of pleistocene groundwater and the waters that were recharged during different stages of volcanic events and glaciation periods no definite relationship was identified between the age of the water and the water type the δ18o and δd plot indicated that the samples fell in line with the other pleistocene and holocene samples from different parts of the world the shift in climatic conditions was inferred by the difference in stable isotope values eight samples 26 27 50 94 111 179 189 190 presented b values higher than that of the limits 2500 μg l for human consumption metals rb sr as and li along with so4 showed a definite relationship to boron with respect to age indicating the fact that increase of residence time augmented the concentrations of metals in this study boron was mainly sourced from the local geological conditions volcanic activity and hydrothermal processes additionally the study also inferred that group 1 samples represented a closed system with lesser atmospheric interaction than that of group 3 the study validated that the groundwater wells from the southwestern region of the study area should be recommended for extraction of groundwater considering its quality and residence time whereas in the wells located in the central eastern zone of the metropolitan area it is recommended that exploitation must be gradually reduced this study also could attest the fact that the puebla valley aquifer was recharged as a result of the combination of the construction of a volcanic building that generated a new infiltration surface favoring the storage of interglacial rains of the pleistocene and holocene although the water older than 30 000 years did not participate in the hydrological cycle as have been observed in this work for the structural control of the aquifer reserved water will prove to be valuable for the future generations henceforth this study could be a unifying tool to understand the age of groundwater and hydrogeochemical characteristics to generate exploitation criteria and thereby assist decision makers for the development of public policies that would aid in the sustainable management of water

5622,the geochemical evolution of groundwater of the puebla aquifer was investigated using chemistry and isotopic data with special emphasis on the geochemistry of boron to decipher the natural and anthropogenic sources this study measured 70 groundwater samples that are potentially impacted by the urban and rural anthropic volcanic and glaciation activities based on the distribution of anions and cations water samples were classified into three groups using piper diagram group1 showed to have high hco3 than so4 group 3 high so4 than hco3 and group 2 revealed intermediate composition radiometric studies show the presence of pleistocene groundwater however there was no definite relationship between the radiometric dates to the groups except that enrichment in δd and δ13c values were noted with respect to age average boron concentrations in some wells were observed to be higher 5000 μg l than that of the permissible limit for human consumption results also indicated that the sources of boron were more natural than anthropogenic that comprised the local geological conditions volcanic activity and hydrothermal processes the study also validated that the groundwater wells from the southwestern part of the study area are suitable for extraction of groundwater considering its quality and residence time whereas in the wells located in the central eastern zone of the metropolitan area it is recommended that groundwater exploitation must be gradually reduced keywords groundwater water type radiometric ages boron oxidation hydrotermal 1 introduction throughout the

part of mexico is also an evident case of overexploitation of groundwater to suffice the region s urban and industrial needs exceeding the extraction recharge ratio by 12 mm3 flores márquez 2006 the aquifers of puebla valley are affected by the upwelling of deep aquifer waters due to the enrichment of total dissolved solids tds in shallow aquifers leading to the lowering of the piezometric level and altering the hydrogeochemical quality of the water caused by the intrusion of elements like fluorine and sodium contributed by the presence of thermal water flores marquez et al 2006 garfías et al 2010 the principal aim of the study was to evaluate the evolution of the groundwater in puebla aquifer and the geohydrological structure by using geochemistry and isotopic composition 18o 2h and 13c in particular the distribution pattern of boron was emphasized as a competent tool to decipher natural and anthropogenic contamination the completed study also highlighted the role of hydrogeochemical

physiographically the region is located in an endorheic type atoyac river basin 5250 km2 bordered by the la malinche volcano 4461 m in the northeast iztaccihuatl volcano in the west and the active popocatépetl volcano in the southwest yarza de de la torre 2003 that belong to the transmexican volcanic belt álvaro et al 2011 the regional geology is mainly composed of extrusive igneous rocks predominantly basic on the west side and acidic on the east comprising rhyolite andesite basalt tuff and volcanic breccias formed in the quaternary period the country is the leading exporter of

confined the hydraulic conductivity is high and its underlain by low permeable pliocene shale behaving as aquitard flores marquez et al 2006 the middle aquifer is underlined by shale marl and limestone acting as an aquitard and a connection exists between the middle and the deeper aquifer aided by fractures and fault planes salcedo sánchez et al 2013 flores marquez et al 2008 reported an upwelling process of mineralized water from the deeper aquifer through the faults and fractures the glacial chronology of la malinche volcano was studied in detail by heine 1971 1988 the first stage of glaciation was between 36 000 and 34 000 yrs bp m i the second stage m ii about 12 000 yrs bp and the third m iii between 10 000 to 8500 yrs bp later the neoglaciation period comprised of two stages m iv 3000 to 2000 yrs bp and m v which together are generally referred to as little ice age the moraines present in the study area permit the reconstruction of the glacial episodes that occurred in the central zone of mexico salcedo sánchez et al 2017 reported groundwater flow derived from the iztaccíhuatl and popocatépetl volcanic region in the west producing a nw se groundwater

characteristics owing to the significant variations of hco3 and so4 in the groundwater samples piper 1944 diagram was used fig 2 a to evaluate the geochemical facies and water types no major difference in the cation clusters was observed whereas anions displayed predominant variations the water samples clearly denoted three different kinds of compositions and it was evident from the piper diagram that the groups represented a semi concentric tendency in the aquifer area fig 2b in general the plot discerned three major clusters of samples with respect to anions samples representing ca hco3 ca mg hco3 facies were referred to as group 1 n 23 samples of ca so4 facies were referred to as group 3 n 15 while the ones that fall between these two groups are categorized as group 2 n 32 spatial distribution of the samples denotes that group 3 fell in the northeastern part of the study area with few samples in the northwest whereas groups 1 and 2 are scattered in the west east and southern part of the study area fig 2b the overall statistical analysis of the samples representing these three groups showed that the average values of cations in the samples of group 1 were to be in the order of all values in mg l na 297 ca 228 mg 194 but the other two groups showed an order of ca na mg in the case of anions group 1 and group 3 presented an order of all values in mg l hco3 537 so4 53 cl 25 and so4 248 hco3 388 cl 44 64 respectively whereas group 2 samples fell in between these two groups with low values of hco3 312 mg l and high values of cl 26 mg l and so4 248 mg l than the group 1 samples the mean concentration of metals shows higher values of all values in μg l li 255 b 1624 v 16 58 mn 595 and mo 2 51 in group 1 cr 74 80 rb 1919 sr 1363 ce 61 and tl 29 in group 3 it is interesting to note that the higher values of metals are not observed in the samples of group 2 higher ec 1264 µs cm and temperature 21 16 c with ph 7 33 was presented by the samples of group 3 followed by group 1 samples table 1 hence in general the preliminary observation of the data would indicate that the composition of group 2 samples falls between group 1 and group 3 suggesting mixing in a different proportion 4 2 isotopic inferences the oxygen isotopes are used to study the periodicity of glacial cycles and it is inferred that a complete cycle of advance and retreat is defined by δ18o for every 41 000 years custodio and llamas 1983 this study also highlighted the importance of stable isotopes as an indicator to study the recharge and flow patterns also stable isotope studies complied with 14c ages in groundwater which could help in deciphering the climatic conditions of the groundwater recharge fontes matray 1993 for this study five samples from the periphery of the fault fracture system were analyzed for δ18o δd δ13c and 14c fig 3 the age of the groundwater was estimated to be from 35 830 yrs bp to 2 880 yrs bp pleistocene to holocene inferred by 14c analysis likewise δ13c ranging from 3 5 to 13 2 and was observed that δd and δ13c values increased with age table 2 the results of the radiometric ages were correlated with the periglacials events and with the pre malinche and malinche construction in puebla mexico table 2 precise correlations between the stages mi and miv of glaciation during the erection of la malinche volcano suggested that the groundwater found in the aquifer of puebla has been characterized by the late pleistocene to holocene precipitation however various records pointed out that the glaciation on the highest elevations occurred during the late pleistocene in the study area heine 1975 1988 1994 lorenzo and heine 2004 δ18o values that ranged between 9 8 and 9 4 corresponded to the precipitation phase in cold climates correspondingly according to the rayleigh distillation process the isotopic composition in the precipitation water is less while it is away from the steam source zone aguilar ramírez et al 2017 chivelet and muñoz garcía 2015 henceforth based on the values acquired for the present study it can be concluded that the recharge zone of the fluid is nearby the metropolitan zone the formation of la malinche volcano late pleistocene to holocene is subdivided into three phases phases 1 begins with the location of the layer known as huamantla pumicita 45 ka continuing 21 4 ka ago the malinche pumicita i record defines the beginning of phase 2 that culminates in the placement of a pumice rain called the malinche pumicita ii mpii originated 12 ka ago heine 1973 1994 this pumice unit represents the beginning of phase 3 whose last eruption occurred 3 1 ka ago castro govea siebe 2007 the glacial behaviour in la malinche has been divided into 5 stages through the quaternary where the oldest phase is called mi and is dated from 36 000 yrs bp heine 1988 1994 identified in the area by a moraine located 2550 m south of the volcanic structure heine 1973 thus it may be inferred that the sample from well 26 would have been recharged from the precipitation that occurred in this phase predominantly snowfall developing ice sheets and would be the product of the melting of this ice deposit and its subsequently infiltration into the adjacent and lateral region of the volcano being simultaneous the formation of the volcanic building to the glacial episodes the advanced event mi continued until approximately 26 000 yrs bp when there was an intense formation of soil coinciding with a gradual change in temperature passing from the extremely cold to a warm pattern this pattern favored the melting and deposit of fossil soil known in the literature as fb1 heine 1973 1988 which is also being deposited in the east of the iztaccihuatl volcano white 1956 1962 it can be deduced that the development of volcanic topography controls the geometry of the basin and contributed the volcano detritic sediments forming the aquifers while glacial episodes contributed significant amount of water that infiltrated to these aquifers cooler periods were observed by stable isotopic results of water samples representing miii miv and mv stages of glaciation the climatic fluctuation is witnessed by the sea level changes lambeck et al 2001 later siegel et al 1996 also witnessed dilution process due to the mixing of recent and old groundwater their study also inferred that stable isotope signatures do not bear the exact relevance to the age of recharge this due to the fact that waters can be affected by vertical and horizontal movement resulting in a mixing de melo et al 2001 reported enriched values of isotopes in late pleistocene waters as the isotopic signatures of well no 26 samples 44 and 71 corresponded to the late wisconsin period which had a decrease of 5 7 c and increased precipitation phillips et al 1986 the climatic inference resulted in the enrichment of δ18o and δd when compared to the younger groundwater zong et al 2006 reported an unstable climatic condition during the period from 12 to 7 ka bp and it is considered as a period of transition from pleistocene to holocene this was reflected in samples 44 and 71 the depleted isotopic values in the younger holocene sample indicated effective precipitation the study also deduced that the longer residence time of the water helped in the enrichment of stable isotope values puebla valley has an extensive record of the glacial events de la terra et al 1949 white 1954 1956 1962 1986 complemented by the archaeological remains found in the locality of valsequillo puebla which included fossils of mammoth mastodon camel horse four horned antelope saber toothed tiger ceballos 2010 urrutia fucugauchi 2014 the δ18o and δ13c presented a significant variation in the late pleistocene displaying an increase in the seasonal precipitation during the 30 000 years bp to 18 000 years bp stevens et al 2012 cruz y cruz et al 2016 in the recent period the slope of la malinche volcano has developed multiple fractures that facilitated a greater infiltration of rainwater and the resulting snow melt from the highest parts of the volcano this infiltration mechanism originated from the shallowest groundwater flows and thus of the infiltrated reserves which are discharged in the form of springs in the foothills of the volcano galicia 2015 4 2 1 gmwl global meteoric water line on the gmwl the composition of the stable isotopes of the present study fell between the samples of ages ranging from holocene 12 000 yrs bp to late pleistocene representing the different parts of the world fig 3 indicates that there is a wide range of isotopic values representing the holocene samples ranging from enriched to depleted except for the few of the pleistocene 30 000 36 000 yrs bp and wisconsin glaciation 8 000 7 000 yrs bp samples most of them fell close to that of the present study the pleistocene samples 26 and 171 fell below the gmwl whereas the holocene 44 171 and 137 and wisconsin samples were categorized separately and those ranging in age from 4 000 to 2 000 yrs bp were classified as recent late holocene the aforesaid samples on the gmwl reflect the enrichment of isotopic values during the pleistocene due to the levels of humidity and amount of rainfall received during the time of recharge it is also interesting to note that they fell along the trend of few other pleistocene groundwater samples of the world fig 3 similar to the other stable isotopes analyzed δ13c 13 to 3 5 presented an increasing trend from pleistocene to recent suggesting that the younger ground waters are more depleted due to the variations in the atmospheric co2 levels the enrichment of δ 13c may also indicate the influence of volcanic carbon kristmannsdottir et al 1999 a comparison of the analytical results with the samples of similar age around the world indicates that they fell within the range except for samples of age 13 140 16 400 yrs bp due to the local geological conditions altitude or the volcanic history that prevailed during the time of recharge 4 3 boron average boron b concentrations in the groundwater samples were found to be higher 5000 μg l than the who 2010 limit of 2500 μg l spatial distribution of b values indicated that the central part of puebla valley along the confluence of two major structural faults presented higher concentrations whereas the ne and sw parts displayed low concentrations fig 4 4 3 1 relationship between boron and chloride variations in b levels could probably be due to the heterogeneous interaction of evaporates in arid regions that are normally reflected in the cl b ratio and mostly cl is conservative with respect to geothermal environments hence the variation in b and cl concentration in groundwater would also help in determining the provenances the linearity of group 1 was seen to be different from group 3 and they formed two extremes as the lower and upper limit of cl and b values elevated b values in group 1 samples were due to the dissolution process and upwelling of hydrothermal fluids fig 5a group 2 samples displayed horizontal migrations between these two extremes as witnessed in piper plot the lesser values in groups 2 and 3 were due to the adsorption of b on clay surfaces at a specific ph temperature and salinity fig 5a shows that group 1 water is of ca hco3 type at different ranges of b and cl the horizontal positioning of the samples representing group 2 displayed an increase of cl with respect to b indicating that they have been initially enriched with cl and during the course of migration had been enriched in b this process is corroborated by the radiometric dates the younger ones were with lesser values and they were subsequently enriched in the older samples the higher concentration of boron was noted in thermal waters than that of saline water and thus showed variation in the b cl ratio this increase of b could also be due to the increase of reaction rates at a higher temperature which could have caused the release of an element from respective minerals dotsika et al 2006 higher values of the b cl ratio with less cl values indicated the influence of meteoric water the higher ratio is similar to the studies that stated the influence of hydrothermal impacts fig 5b group 1 water has a comparatively higher ratio than the other groups indicating the influence of recharged rainwater table 3 which dissolved b from the mineral matrix fig 5b presenting b cl ratio vs cl was attempted by dotsika et al 2006 classifying the samples with 1 lesser values of cl and the ratio of b cl and 2 higher values of cl and the ratio of b cl where the former signified meteoric origin and not seawater intrusion moreover the ratio increased potentially due to the impact of hydrothermal sources on the groundwater of meteoric origin the representation of all the samples in both the categories would imply that both the processes were predominant in the study area 4 4 correlation analysis correlation analysis fig 6 indicated that b showed a high correlation with ec tds ca mg k hco3 co2 rb and sr irrespective of the water type that normally would determine the basic association of these elements moreover significant correlation between b and sr indicated partial dissolution of different salts present in the evaporate lenses like celestite and other borates further the non association of no3 rules out the possibility of common anthropogenic sources dotsika et al 2006 additionally tectonic events may influence the depth of occurrence of boron deposits and the strong correlation of k with b could be due to the partial dissolution of potash feldspar and its association with authigenic boron which is noted in the tuffaceous basins stamatakis 1989 albeit each group has a characteristic relation of differents elements to boron apart from these common correlated elements like group 1 was also well correlated with mo and u group 2 showed good relationship of ce la mn and co with b and group 3 with na and so4 these correlations with b could be the characteristic of each group apart from these relations two groups have certain elements related to b in common like group 1 and group 2 shows a correlation of b with temperature and thallium similarly group 1 and group 3 samples show a good correlation of cl to b and group 2 shows a good correlation of zr as ge and li with b which is also observed in group 3 samples the observations made in kirka eskisehir turkey also fall in line with the present observation that the b concentrations are noted to be higher in ca hco3 water types and the relationship of these elements with sr and al would help infer the association of lacustrine deposits the relationship of al and sr are generally well correlated with b in the regions predominant with borate deposits gemici et al 2008 zheng and liu 2009 the positive correlation of b with as and a higher concentration of as 10 µg l in group 1 samples also leads to the probability of leaching from arsenic minerals in the boron layers also li b and as association in groundwater generally denote hydrothermal process rosas et al 1999 boron in group 2 samples were more related to mn and li that aided in the adsorption of thallium in an oxidation environment koschinsky and hein 2003 jacobson et al 2005 karlsson 2006 the association of ca na so4 with boron indicated dissolution of evaporite minerals leaching of boron from the saline alkaline deposits and is generally inferred by the association with li in groundwater xiyu 1984 the elevated values of mn as and mo reflected as weak sulfide mineralization strong positive correlation of boron with li na and so4 indicated the significance of buried evaporates like borates and sulfates as clearly revealed in samples of group 3 stamatakis et al 2009 frequent volcanic events especially in arid regions with tuffaceous rocks help in the formation of borate deposits mellor 1980 significant correlation of b ca and mg in group 3 samples specified the increase of so4 at the shallow depths with the relationship of b with na eventually leading to the inference that there is an increase of dissolution in group 3 samples yuce and yasin 2012 further b relation with ca so4 water type presented correlation with the sulfate deposits like gypsum anhydrite etc similarly ca and mg were related in the groundwater that underwent dissolution process in the tuff regions the predominant sources of ca are calcite aragonite and colemanite whereas mg was reported to be derived from dolomite or hydroboracite inferred by helvaci 1995 the relationship of b and li in group 2 and group 3 samples would signify the prevalence of clay in the region gemici et al 2008 additionally the association of sr and ca with b indicated the dissolution from tunellite and celestite respectively and the exchange between ca and sr in the minerals could be chiefly due to their similar ionic radius where sr concentrations in groundwater increased resulting in significant correlations with b boron could have a significant concentration during the interglacial period derived from the tendency of this metalloid to be absorbed onto the clays at low temperatures palmer et al 1987 battaglia and pennisi 2016 it may be deduced that there was not direct relationship between the paleo climate and boron concentration however it is a fact that the climate has an effect on the boron assimilation however during the interglacial period the increased volcanic activity formed the volcanic rocks that provide boron to the sediments also the hydrothermal activity being the main source of boron it is necessary to highlight that the pleistocene is the stage where the geothermal deposit were derived from the multiple calderas generated between 2 7 and 2 1 my 4 5 bi variate plots bi variate plots were attempted to infer the relationship of boron with ba li as sr v cs mo so4 and ge no clear coordination with respect to age in plots of b against v mo cs and ba was observed however an increasing trend of concentration with respect to age was noted in so4 rb sr as and li the variations with respect to li v sr rb ba and as are highlighted in fig 7 the higher concentration of b in sample 171 7 890 yrs bp of group 2 than in sample 44 8 070 yrs bp would represent the end of wisconsin relative to glaciation moreover sample 44 presented high li and low b concentrations due to the preferential adsorption on li bearing clays thereby reducing the concentration of b in groundwater during 8 070 yrs bp nearly 10 samples represented b values 5000 µg l and if these samples were further diluted and analyzed to obtain the exact concentration coupled along with a detailed chronological data it will aid us to conclude a more accurate relationship of age with respect to boron concentration and their association with other elements the analytical results indicated that there was a clear increase of b in relation to rb and sr also the samples of group 1 and group 2 could be related to temperature and thallium reflecting the influence of hydrothermal waters further the correlation of u and mo in the group 1 samples was noted in closed aquifer waters that possess high pco2 and less so4 when the hydrothermal water upwells thallium and b it might also be possibly adsorbed on the clay surface at definite ph and this process was witnessed in sample 44 simultaneously during the process of upwelling along the fault planes there was a decrease in po2 which enhanced the availability of more oxygen fig 8 hence the s2 upwelling from deeper regions hydrothermal fluids was converted to so4 at shallow depth or in open fractured aquifer due to the availability of more oxygen s 2 2 o 2 2 s o 4 the h2s of geothermal origin also interacted with the fresh water at shallower levels a fraction of h2s dissolves in the liquid phase so the fluid is enriched in sulfates gonzález et al 2001 conclusively irrespective of the age of ca hco3 water of group 1 it represented a closed aquifer whereas group 3 was an open aquifer with more so4 it is witnessed that the activity of the sulfate ion increases with the increase of pco2 values fig 9 the sources of so4 is the oxidation of upwelling s2 from the hydrothermal process and dissolution of gypsum present in the aquifers considering that two different trends were noted with respect to sulfates fig 9 this inference is also supported by the saturated states of sulfates minerals gypsum and anhydrite wherein the si of these sulfate minerals in group 1 minerals were seen to be very less and high in group 3 minerals fig 10 a and b the relationship of pco2 and po2 could explain the variations of so4 with respect to groups the groups were basically categorized depending upon the water types the group 1 samples were predominantly of ca hco3 type and those of group 3 were of the ca so4 type the b concentration was higher irrespective of the group indicating different mechanisms of evolution the variation of po2 indicated the availability of oxygen for the formation of sulfates as reflected by the saturation index those of group 1 indicate a closed system as the samples predominantly reflected higher values of pco2 and po2 hence the b from samples of group 3 are mainly derived from the dissolution of geothermal sulfates and those of group 1 are from the leaching of evaporitic minerals of adsorbed b from clays these two basic mechanism of b evolution is derived from the pco2 and po2 relation with respect to so4 5 conclusion this study integrates the hydrogeochemical characterization and geochemical evolution of groundwater with special emphasis on boron levels to decipher natural and anthropogenic contamination in the puebla valley groundwater of puebla valley can be categorized as ca hco3 type group1 ca so4 type group 3 and intermediate type group 2 radiocarbon dating detected the presence of pleistocene groundwater and the waters that were recharged during different stages of volcanic events and glaciation periods no definite relationship was identified between the age of the water and the water type the δ18o and δd plot indicated that the samples fell in line with the other pleistocene and holocene samples from different parts of the world the shift in climatic conditions was inferred by the difference in stable isotope values eight samples 26 27 50 94 111 179 189 190 presented b values higher than that of the limits 2500 μg l for human consumption metals rb sr as and li along with so4 showed a definite relationship to boron with respect to age indicating the fact that increase of residence time augmented the concentrations of metals in this study boron was mainly sourced from the local geological conditions volcanic activity and hydrothermal processes additionally the study also inferred that group 1 samples represented a closed system with lesser atmospheric interaction than that of group 3 the study validated that the groundwater wells from the southwestern region of the study area should be recommended for extraction of groundwater considering its quality and residence time whereas in the wells located in the central eastern zone of the metropolitan area it is recommended that exploitation must be gradually reduced this study also could attest the fact that the puebla valley aquifer was recharged as a result of the combination of the construction of a volcanic building that generated a new infiltration surface favoring the storage of interglacial rains of the pleistocene and holocene although the water older than 30 000 years did not participate in the hydrological cycle as have been observed in this work for the structural control of the aquifer reserved water will prove to be valuable for the future generations henceforth this study could be a unifying tool to understand the age of groundwater and hydrogeochemical characteristics to generate exploitation criteria and thereby assist decision makers for the development of public policies that would aid in the sustainable management of water

5623,persistent risks of extreme weather events including droughts and floods due to climate change require precise and timely rainfall forecasting yet the naturally occurring non stationarity entrenched within the rainfall time series lowers the model performances and is an ongoing research endeavour for practicing hydrologists and drought risk evaluators in this paper an attempt is made to resolve the non stationarity challenges faced by rainfall forecasting models via a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd combined with random forest rf and kernel ridge regression krr algorithms in designing a hybrid ceemd rf krr model in forecasting rainfall at gilgit muzaffarabad and parachinar in pakistan at monthly time scale the rainfall time series data are simultaneously factorized into respective intrinsic mode functions imfs and a residual element using ceemd once the significant lags of each imf and the residual are identified both are forecasted using the rf algorithm finally the krr model is adopted where the forecasted imfs and the residual components are combined to generate the final forecasted rainfall the ceemd rf krr model shows the best performances at all three sites in comparison to the comparative models with maximum values of correlation coefficient 0 97 0 99 willmott s index 0 94 0 97 nash sutcliffe coefficient 0 94 0 97 and legates mccabe s index 0 74 0 81 furthermore the ceemd rf krr model generated the most accurate results for gilgit station considering the legate mccabe s index as base assessment criteria in addition to obtaining the lowest magnitudes of rmse 2 52 mm and mae 1 98 mm the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model attained better rainfall forecasting accuracy which is imperative for agriculture water resource management and early drought flooding warning systems keywords rainfall water resources drought ceemd random forest krr 1 introduction the rainfall p patterns are significantly affected by climate change that reshuffles agricultural crops water resources and natural extreme weather scenarios barredo 2007 such as droughts ali et al 2018a vörösmarty et al 2010 and flooding bhalme and mooley 1980 and in pakistan the 2010 monsoon rainfall news 2010 caused severe damages costing around 43 billion tarakzai 2010 hence the policymakers in conjunction with hydrologists must design new and reliable predictive tools to forecast p events for effective hydrological planning and to devise new strategies in managing rainfall risks the accuracy of current hydrological decision support systems which characterize different watersheds gebremariam et al 2014 romagnoli et al 2017 is contingent upon the physical conditions and proper calibrations as such a number of statistical modelling techniques have been explored including an empirical method chiew et al 1998 statistical non parametric probabilistic model sharma 2000 copula models nguyen huy et al 2017 and autoregressive moving averages arma model burlando et al 1993 gaussian copula methods showed huge improvements in the correlation coefficient and a decrease in root mean square error in estimating rainfall from satellite data in iran moazami et al 2014 for the case of pakistan only a handful of studies pertaining to rainfall forecasting have been performed an autoregressive integrated moving averaging arima model was developed to forecast precipitation trends salma et al 2012 while multiple linear regression models were designed for seasonal runoff archer and fowler 2008 additionally extreme rainfall events in indus river valley pakistan were estimated using the global data assimilation model reale et al 2012 later the thiessen polygon method was developed for precipitation forecasts faisal and gaffar 2012 the other issue is that these tools are generally built on regional scale sub models and the spatiotemporal aspects of the variables and require enormous spatial data with apt calibrations he et al 2014 prasad et al 2017 the artificial intelligence algorithms on the other hand do not require detailed information about physical or hydrological behaviours of the watershed in providing immense insights into a rainfall forecasting and forewarning system artificial intelligence models have been successfully applied in forecasting future p trends luk et al 2001 by dealing with non linear input features nasseri et al 2008 artificial neural networks ann were used to forecast rainfall in thailand hung et al 2009 ann was also used for a localized p forecasting system kashiwao et al 2017 using climatological data yet the forecasts were not significant in comparison to japan meteorological agency in australia monthly rainfall was forecasted using climate indices as inputs via the ann model abbot and marohasy 2014 in another study for spain the occurrence and amount of rainfall were forecasted with meteorological variables via hierarchical nominal ordinal support vector classifier sánchez monedero et al 2014 while support vector machines were utilized for p forecasts in taiwan lin et al 2009 again literature shows that for pakistan only one study with machine learning models has been explored whereby ali et al 2018b designed a markov chain monte carlo using the copula based machine learning model to forecast rainfall as such more studies in regard to rainfall forecasting need to be carried out for pakistan either using statistical or machine learning models in addition the past studies reveal that precipitation forecasting trends have been mostly based on climate data using the regression model or basic machine learning models it is also evident that the previous works have been done on large scales at either provincial or national levels but not for small areas hence more studies pertaining to designing data driven algorithms for accurate precipitation forecasting at a smaller spatial scale are required that will be undertaken in this study furthermore the above mentioned studies were beneficial to various stakeholders to develop machine learning models for a reasonably accurate forecast of precipitation but all these studies were not able to handle the non stationarity and non linearity issues that arise in the rainfall data ali et al 2018b sánchez monedero et al 2014 the naturally abrupt p trends compounded by changing climate conditions that have been observed for the last few years in pakistan and in other regions need to be aptly considered and captured by such models particularly for pakistan there is no study performed on the development of an advanced data intelligent model that tackles the issues of non stationarity and non linearity of rainfall data to address these gaps there is a dire need for developing data driven models for accurate p forecasting at a much better scale than endeavoured beforehand that is able to ameliorate non stationarity and non linearity issues which is the novelty of this current study to overcome these issues an apt multi resolution analytical tool is used to extract the embedded features from the rainfall time series data that inherently has embedded climate induced variability the extracted features form a suite of non static time series signals that help to improve a standalone data intelligent model to deal with this issue the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd which is an advanced form of empirical mode decomposition huang et al 1998 can act as a useful tool in improving the accuracy that is lacking in the existing models the ceemd is able to clearly resolve and isolate the large fluctuating signals into respective smaller frequency components after the inception of ceemd method it gained attention because of its completely data dependent and self adaptability characteristics alvanitopoulos et al 2014 thus ceemd is able to extract pertinent features while preserving the physical structure of the temporal input wu et al 2011 in this work ceemd is integrated with a robust bootstrap aggregation approach i e random forest rf model and kernel ridge regression krr to develop the ceemd rf krr model for rainfall forecasting the key objectives of this study include 1 the application of ceemd to decompose the predictor variables into respective imfs and a residual factor to resolve the non stationarity and non linearity problems 2 to integrate the rf model to ceemd in order to forecast the respective imfs with residual component 3 to aggregate the forecasted imfs and residuals using the krr to forecast p values 4 to validate the forecasting capability of ceemd rf krr model in rainfall forecasting of diverse climatic regions in pakistan for comparison the results are benchmarked with standalone krr rf and ceemd rf models the developed ceemd rf krr approach is evaluated to forecast precise point based rainfall in gilgit muzaffarabad and kurrum agency parachinar districts in pakistan 2 theoretical background 2 1 complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd method the ceemd data decomposition technique addresses the non stationarity and non linearity of input data torres et al 2011 in the decomposition process gaussian white noise is added to the original data to construct a uniform reference frame which eventually is removed by averaging of the respective imfs and residue a short description of the ceemd process for an undecomposed input x t is presented below torres et al 2011 1 supply some white noise ω t to the time series x t such that x t x t ω t 2 decompose x t via emd the original ensemble mode decomposition technique to obtain the first decomposed component 3 follow steps 1 and 2 with distinct number of realizations this process is usually repeated with τ numbers of times ensemble number each with different realizations 4 then compute the mean of all imf1 as below 1 imf 1 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ω k t where ψ 1 is the computation of kth imf and ε specifies the amplitude regulation which is necessary to obtain an appropriate signal 5 hence the first residual component or the remaining component results as follows 2 r 1 t x t i m f 1 t 6 next the extraction of imf2 from the original signal x t can be extracted as 3 imf 2 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ψ 1 ω k t 7 the above steps are repeated to acquire the β 1 th imf factor as 4 imf β 1 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ψ β ω k t 8 finally the residuals are averaged which generally is the trend display a gradual variation around the long term average 2 2 random forest rf model the building blocks of decision tree based modelling approach i e the rf model is bootstrapping and aggregation called bagging breiman 1996 schapire et al 1998 the rf model randomly adopts a bagging approach in identifying features whereby each node is randomly separated by choosing the most dominant possible predictors that would improve the model accuracy without causing overfitting breiman 2001 the following steps are adopted in designing rf models 1 using the input predictor variables n trees of bootstrapping ensembles are generated where n is the number of trees 2 an unpruned regression tree is built by choosing maximum predictors splitting creating a randomized input predictors sample denoted m try 3 the predictions from n trees are aggregated to forecast future rainfall the rf model has been applied in forecasting soil moisture prasad et al 2018 shallow water table koch et al 2019 as well as for hydrological moore et al 1991 and environmental management ascough ii et al 2008 applications interested readers may refer to breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 for a comprehensive background on rf modelling 2 3 kernel ridge regression krr model the krr is based on the kernel approach combined with ridge regressions zhang et al 2013 a key advantage is that the krr uses a regularization and kernel technique in capturing the non linear relationship overcoming the over fitting issues in the regression you et al 2018 the krr can be expressed in mathematical form as 5 arg min 1 m i 1 m f i y i 2 λ f 2 h 6 f i j 1 m α j φ x j x i where h is the hilbert normed space the eq 5 can concisely be rewritten for an m m kernel matrix k as follows 7 k λ n i y 8 y i 1 m α i φ x i x during the training stage the krr algorithm approximates α by finding solutions for eq 7 it then searches for an optimum α and λ from the parameter set for optimized performances the α is then used in the testing stage to calculate the regressand of the newer samples x as in eq 8 in this study the linear polynomial and gaussian kernels were used to get the best accuracy alaoui and mahoney 2015 you et al 2018 the ridge regression reduces the sum of squared errors sse with constraint fulfillment providing an estimate to penalize it you et al 2018 the feature s estimate does not perform arbitrarily in case we have very large estimates the sse will reduce with the increment in penalty term thus krr selects the less influential features to undergo more penalization estimates zhang et al 2013 if the number of independent predictors is too many where it is not easy to determine which predictor influences more the target response variable the krr handles the situation better than others alaoui and mahoney 2015 in krr there might be a possibility of the case where the number of dimensions can be higher or even infinitely greater than the number of data and the inverse is not easy to compute this problem can be handled with the help of eq 8 to perform the inverse either by the dimension of feature space or the number of data cases welling 2013 the solution must exist in the span of the data even the dimension is very large which shows the algorithm is linear in the feature space 3 materials and methods 3 1 rainfall p data as the data driven models highly depend on prognostic features from the past the rainfall data from 1962 to 2013 was collated from the pakistan meteorological department pmd 2016 for gilgit muzaffarabad parachinar as shown in fig 1 to assess the adaptability of the ceemd rf krr for p forecasting in pakistan the selected locations were broadly the main representative of the diverse climatic regions gilgit 35 281 n 74 841 e is the capital of gilgit baltistan province in pakistan which is located in a broad valley adjacent to the confluence of the gilgit river and hunza river the climate of gilgit has sharp variations due to surrounding mountains and hills pmd 2016 with an average temperature of 20 25 c across the valleys and a drop in temperature in january with an average of 10 to 0 c normally may is the rainiest month approximately 25 1 mm while november considered being the driest month 2 4 mm rainfall the capital of azad kashmir is muzaffarabad 34 359 n 73 471 e situated near

features a humid subtropical climate with much higher rainfall the snowfall is common in the winter season and frost occurs on most mornings the average annual rainfall is 781 7 mm while the average mean temperature is 15 3 c table 1 shows some descriptive statistics of rainfall for the selected study zones 3 2 design of the hybrid ceemd rf krr and comparison models the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model was established in matlab r2016b the math works inc usa running on pentium 4 dual core central processing unit with 2 93 ghz of processing speed the rainfall data were incorporated to design the hybrid ceemd rf krr ceemd rf standalone rf and standalone krr models the steps involved in establishing the ceemd rf krr are step 1 the ceemd method was employed to resolve the rainfall p into imfs and residuals the parameters defined in constructing ceemd are the number of realizations of the gaussian noise τ 500 and the provided amplitude in terms of added white noise ε 0 2 ouyang et al 2016 ren et al 2015 wang et al 2013 wu and huang 2009 for gilgit and muzaffarabad the ceemd method decomposed the p time series into nine imfs imf1 imf2 imf9 and a residual part whereas parachinar has eight imfs imf1 imf2 imf8 with a residual factor fig 2 and table 2 illustrates the ceemd decomposed imfs and residuals with p data for all locations step 2 the statistically significant lag time series computed by partial autocorrelation function pacf of imfs and residual components presented in fig 3 step 3 the normalization was established using eq 9 for the purpose of data fluctuation and spikes hsu et al 2003 as below 9 norm min max min where indicates input target min is the minimum point max denotes the maximum point and norm is the anticipated normalized value step 4 the normalized significant lags of imfs and the residual factors were incorporated as inputs to the rf model to forecast imfs and residuals one by one the number of trees ntrees 1000 and the number of predictors 5 were the predefined parameters used in the rf model at this stage basically these parameters were determined by the trial and error technique taking different combinations after several times of trial and error the optimum results with these parameters were obtained step 5 the krr model was finally applied to eventuate the ceemd rf krr model to forecast p where the forecasted imfs and residuals were utilized as input predictors krr models use different types of kernels gaussian polynomial and linear in this study the polynomial kernel appeared to be the most suitable choice after a comparative study of the respective kernels were performed the performance of ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial was evaluated against ceemd rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone krr based on each kernel type and rf models table 3 describes the parameters used in the ceemd rf krr model vs ceemd rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone krr and standalone rf models fig 4 illustrates a schematic view of the hybrid ceemd rf krr model 3 3 model assessment criteria the performance of ceemd rf krr vs ceemd rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone rf and the standalone krr models in rainfall forecasting were assessed utilizing a number of statistical and standardized metrics yen 1995 the description of these assessment criteria is discussed below dawson et al 2007 legates and mccabe 1999 willmott 1984 i correlation coefficient r is formulated as 10 r j 1 n p obs j p obs j p for j p for j j 1 n p obs j p obs j 2 j 1 n p for j p for j 2 ii

j 1 n p obs j 100 where p obs j and p for j are the observed and forecasted j th values of p p obs j and p for j are the average of p and n is the entire number of tested values in addition the computation of the rmse is based on the aggregation of residuals between observed and forecasted p nourani et al 2011 the higher p values are largely captured by the rmse which ranges from 0 ideal value to positive infinity however this metric should not essentially be used to compare model performance at geographically diverse sites hora and campos 2015 as these are in their absolute terms as such the relative values of root mean squared error rrmse were utilized dawson et al 2007 for this purpose 4 results the ceem rf krr model is undertaken to forecast rainfall for three highly geographically diverse regions of pakistan the hybrid ceemd rf krr based on polynomial kernel model is appraised with respect to standalone rf krr and ceemd rf models to establish parsimonious models pacf played a vital role in deciding the most relevant lags of p the arithmetical metrics discussed in eqs 9 15 are utilized to explain the results in terms of numerical model quantification the performance of the ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial model is evaluated against the counterparts in table 4 it is evident that the hybrid ceemd rf krr performed better at all three sites in achieving lower errors rmse and mae and very high pearson s correlation coefficient r while the standalone krr model performed poorly at all the three sites under consideration ideally the magnitudes of rmse and mae must be as small as possible to reflect the lowest deviations of forecasted values from the observed ones for the case of muzaffarabad and parachinar high error values were apparent from all models the competing models ceem rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone rf and standalone krr based on each kernel registered higher error values with mae ranging between 25 03 mm and 195 18 mm and rmse ranged between 35 51 mm and 222 07 mm yet the hybrid ceemd rf krr model outperformed with mae of 13 65 mm parachinar and 19 99 mm muzaffarabad and least rmse as well in comparison to the standalone krr worst performing model a two fold increase in r is noted at parachinar percentage increase 93 and a huge over three fold increase is seen for muzaffarabad percentage increase 160 and gilgit sites percentage increase 171 even with a comparison to the ceemd rf second best performing model the high percentage decrease in mae range 17 to 80 and rmse range 25 to 82 was achieved by the ceemd rf krr model further depicting its suitability in forecasting monthly p to holistically evaluate the model performances the correlation coefficient r is plotted in the form of a taylor diagram that provides a more detailed appraisal of the model performances xu et al 2016 the taylor diagram fig 5 portrays a more tangible and convincing statistical relation between the forecasted and observed monthly p depending on r with respect to standard deviations it is clearly displayed that the standalone krr and standalone rf models are not appropriate as the r to sd points were highly parted from the ideal observed point the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model was lying close to the observed p which confirms the forecasting accuracy was significantly higher at all three sites than the other three comparing models ceemd rf standalone rf and standalone krr in this study the model evaluation was also undertaken with the normalized metrics ewi ens and elm for the three sites in forecasting monthly rainfall which ideally must be equal to unity for perfectly fitting models table 5 the normalized metrics also justified a better utility of the ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial model as there was a significant increase in these values at all three study sites the ceemd rf models at all sites did perform equally well however was not able to outperform the proposed ceemd rf krr models at all sites the ceemd rf krr model attained the highest values of normalized metrics ewi ens and elm with percentage increase in ewi ranging between 3 6 and 5 7 ens ranging between 4 and 6 and elm ranging between 7 and 13 in comparison to the competing ceemd krr model which has the second best performance it must be noted that models with ens below 0 800 are unsatisfactory those between 0 800 and 0 900 are fairly good and ens values greater than 0 900 are considered to be very satisfactory shamseldin 1997 hence according to the abovementioned criteria the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr models at all sites could be regarded as very satisfactory when applied for precipitation forecasting at these three sites in pakistan more precisely table 5 examines the ceemd rf krr efficiency in predicting p using ewi ens and elm criterion for gilgit ewi 0 966 ens 0 972 and elm 0 810 muzaffarabad ewi 0 938 ens 0 941 and elm 0 739 and parachinar ewi 0 950 ens 0 950 and elm 0 759 the outcomes of benchmark models table 5 confirms the supremacy of the ceemd rf krr for all study sites in this paper hence based on the above criteria the proposed model could be regarded as satisfactory for p forecasting at these sites in pakistan in addition the model appraisal was undertaken using diagnostic plots prior to making the box plots forecasting errors fe were computed during the testing period the fe ideally needs to be zero hence when plotted on box plots the distribution of fe needs to be as close to zero as possible for best performing models the absolute fe f e values were plotted for ease of comprehension in accordance with tables 4 and 5 fig 6 ceemd rf krr models at all sites registered smaller fe distributions revealing its better forecasting capability according to the normalized metrics ewi ens and elm the ceemd rf models seemed to have a very close performance to that of ceemd rf krr models contrariwise the box plots make a clear distinction of performances since the distribution of f e generated from ceemd rf models for muzaffarabad and parachinar were fairly scattered with a large number of outlier points likewise for site 1 gilgit the ceemd rf krr model had a narrower f e distribution bounded near zero with very fewer outliers additionally the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf plots of f e were also plotted in fig 7 to get a clearer picture of the forecast error distributions for sites 2 muzaffarabad and 3 parachinar the ecdf line plots of ceemd krr standalone rf and standalone krr displayed a very close profile while at site 1 gilgit the ecdf profiles of standalone rf and standalone krr were very similar on the other hand at all three sites the ecdf profile of ceemd rf krr displayed a remarkable narrow profile confined within the least f e range hence the box plots fig 6 together with the ecdf plots fig 7 for all three sites further ascertain better performance of the ceemd rf krr model in forecasting monthly p compared to the competing models ceemd rf standalone rf and standalone krr a further diagnostic was performed with bar graph plots fig 8 based on correlation coefficient r note that the interest here is to evaluate all models in examining the percentages of p values that can be effectively forecasted by the respective models ceemd rf krr ceemd krr and standalone krr and standalone rf the standalone krr models at all sites performed poorly registering lower r values evidently the ceemd rf krr model exhibits larger r values at all three sites in comparison with the competing models consequently over 90 of forecasted values are directly associated with the observed values in the testing period specifically results reflected that for the case of gilgit r 0 986 muzaffarabad r 0 971 and parachinar r 0 976 which concur with the results in tables 4 and 5 from the outcomes of the numerical metrics tables 4 and 5 a difference in performances of models at the three distinctive sites is apparent the key limitation of these metrics is their inability to compare models at geographically disparate sites the relative performance table 6 suitably discovered that the ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial models exhibit the lowest values of rrmse in comparison with ceemd rf standalone rf and krr models for all three sites more accurately the rrmse magnitudes when comparing ceemd rf krr with the second best performing model ceemd rf in the combination ceemd rf krr ceemd rf were as follows gilgit 19 20 29 40 muzaffarabad 21 50 29 60 and parachinar 18 20 24 40 consequently the rrmse exhibited that the ceemd rf krr accomplished the best accuracy for site 3 parachinar followed by site 1 gilgit and site 2 muzaffarabad 5 discussion this study has designed a hybrid ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial model using the historical significant lags of rainfall p data to forecast monthly p in pakistan at three sites that experience a differing annual climate pattern the model utilized the ceemd algorithm to factorize the p into respective imfs and residuals components the pacf is used to compute the statistically relevant lags of imfs with residuals that are utilized into the rf model to predict each imf and the residue finally the krr model was applied to forecast and aggregate the p by incorporating the forecasted imfs and residuals as input predictors the proposed ceemd rf krr model was appraised with ceemd rf standalone rf and krr models the developed ceemd rf krr and comparison models were successfully appraised to generate smaller relative percentage errors in terms of rrmse with reasonably higher magnitudes of r ewi ens and elm tables 4 6 the performance was high according to the achieved assessment criteria eqs 9 15 used in this paper thus the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr framework can aptly be applied to forecast monthly p where the forecasting of future p is likely to become more erratic caused by global warming and an increase in water demand the hybrid ceemd rf krr and competing models generated slightly varying results for each of the stations due to diverse geographic conditions as displayed in table 1 each study zone possesses distinct climatic and environmental properties which significantly affect rainfall qing et al 2011 for example gilgit is basically a hilly area at higher elevation 2437 m which significantly affects the rainfall in the region rainfall is a lot more common at a higher elevation region as the cooler weather and atmosphere cannot hold in as much condensation causing it to rain or snow more often poage and chamberlain 2001 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 since the study locations in this paper are at different elevation levels from low muzaffarabad 679 m to high gilgit 2437 m the models produced different prediction results vuille 2011 accurate rainfall forecasts are extremely important for the efficient operation of water infrastructure and disaster risk reductions in cases of floods and droughts anderson and burt 1985 the nature of the rainfall forecast horizon is usually defined by the application for which the forecasts are being used for instance rainfall forecasts can be made from the start of the forecast up to short medium or long term into the future forecasts for water management are needed to plan effective use of water ranging from hydroelectric power generation to water supply irrigation as well as drought and flood early warning systems in particular an effective early warning system must provide sufficient lead time for individual communities in the case of drought flood caused by rainfall to respond accordingly in the case of flood forecasts lead time can be critical in reducing infrastructural damages and loss of life forecasts must be sufficiently accurate to uphold confidence so that communities and users will take effective actions when warned if forecasts are inaccurate credibility is reduced and an adequate response is not made accurate p forecasting and developing early warning systems can have numerous benefits both nationally and internationally barredo 2007 langridge et al 2006 precise p forecasts can play an important role in the aforementioned situations for both developed and developing nations such as pakistan governments and water resource managers use machine learning tools in providing guidance for the operation of infrastructure and the implementation of appropriate measures anderson and burt 1985 further this study can be adopted anywhere for p forecasting using the ceemd algorithm in addressing non static and non linear problems the hybrid ceemd rf krr model can be applied for agriculture crop yield prediction which could be important to the government s national policy making to help minimize crop estimation uncertainties akhtar 2012 however establishing a viable rainfall forecasting and warning system for communities at risk requires the combination of meteorological and hydrological data forecast tools and trained forecasters bellerby et al 2000 and more studies pertaining to advanced machine learning modelling approaches are recommended it is noted that the current study utilized the historical significant lags of p to forecast future p and therefore carries some limitations to enhance the scope of this study other meteorological data such as synoptic scale climate mode indices temperature humidity cloud cover sunshine air temperatures soil moisture wind and solar radiation could also be collated as predictor inputs remotely sensed predictor variables through satellites or atmospheric simulation models bauer 1975 collins et al 2006 may also improve the model performances for modelling p in remote areas more importantly since process based modeling is resource demanding and cost prohibitive for developing countries the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model may be seen as a viable solution moreover the proposed hybrid model ceemd rf krr model can be applied in those regions where other meteorological data is not available the hybrid ceemd rf krr model could be further developed with ensemble strategies to possibly achieve more accurate results additionally bio inspired techniques such as quantum behaved particle swarm optimization and the firefly algorithm can assist in selecting input predictors which have been tested in the hybridization of rf and other models ghorbani et al 2018 pal et al 2012 another possible choice could be empirical wavelet transform gilles 2013 and advance multi resolution analysis huang et al 1998 future work could apply statistical copula tools nguyen huy et al 2017 in order to study the joint behavior of multivariate data 6 conclusions a hybrid ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial model has been constructed in this paper to forecast future rainfall p the p time series from 1962 to 2013 were decomposed by employing the ceemd algorithm into respective imfs and residuals components the significant lags of each imfs and residual were calculated using pacf each significant lag of pacf was incorporated into an rf model to predict imfs and residual factor finally the forecasted imfs with residuals were inserted in the krr model to design the robust ceemd rf krr model further different kinds of assessment metrics were utilized to measure the efficiency of the ceemd rf krr model the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model was compared with ceemd rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone rf and standalone krr with respective kernel functions models as evident by assessment metrics the accuracy of the proposed ceemd rf krr model is better in relation to comparative models the fe errors for the best site gilgit attained by the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model were rmse 2 52 mm and mae 1 98 mm while the achieved normalized metrics were r 0 986 wi 0 966 and ens 0 972 see tables 4 and 5 on the basis of elm the acquired magnitudes of elm agreement values for site 1 i e gilgit were elm 0 810 ceemd rf krr 0 717 ceemd rf 0 403 standalone rf and 0 047 standalone krr whereas the rrmse values were 19 2 ceemd rf krr compared with 29 4 ceemd rf 68 4 standalone rf and 108 5 standalone krr a significant amount of geographic variability was seen on the basis of rrmse for gilgit site with comparison to parachinar and muzaffarabad this study provides a baseline in terms of using the ceemd algorithm to dissolve the data into imfs and residual component to avoid the non stationarity and non linearity issues in monthly p forecasting the ceemd rf krr model may be used for drought soil moisture agricultural crops solar radiations etc that will help hydrologists and agriculturist of pakistan in the optimal resource management

5623,persistent risks of extreme weather events including droughts and floods due to climate change require precise and timely rainfall forecasting yet the naturally occurring non stationarity entrenched within the rainfall time series lowers the model performances and is an ongoing research endeavour for practicing hydrologists and drought risk evaluators in this paper an attempt is made to resolve the non stationarity challenges faced by rainfall forecasting models via a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd combined with random forest rf and kernel ridge regression krr algorithms in designing a hybrid ceemd rf krr model in forecasting rainfall at gilgit muzaffarabad and parachinar in pakistan at monthly time scale the rainfall time series data are simultaneously factorized into respective intrinsic mode functions imfs and a residual element using ceemd once the significant lags of each imf and the residual are identified both are forecasted using the rf algorithm finally the krr model is adopted where the forecasted imfs and the residual components are combined to generate the final forecasted rainfall the ceemd rf krr model shows the best performances at all three sites in comparison to the comparative models with maximum values of correlation coefficient 0 97 0 99 willmott s index 0 94 0 97 nash sutcliffe coefficient 0 94 0 97 and legates mccabe s index 0 74 0 81 furthermore the ceemd rf krr model generated the most accurate results for gilgit station considering the legate mccabe s index as base assessment criteria in addition to obtaining the lowest magnitudes of rmse 2 52 mm and mae 1 98 mm the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model attained better rainfall forecasting accuracy which is imperative for agriculture water resource management and early drought flooding warning systems keywords rainfall water resources drought ceemd random forest krr 1 introduction the rainfall p patterns are significantly affected by climate change that reshuffles agricultural crops water resources and natural extreme weather scenarios barredo 2007 such as droughts ali et al 2018a vörösmarty et al 2010 and flooding bhalme and mooley 1980 and in pakistan the 2010 monsoon rainfall news 2010 caused severe damages costing around 43 billion tarakzai 2010 hence the policymakers in conjunction with hydrologists must design new and reliable predictive tools to forecast p events for effective hydrological planning and to devise new strategies in managing rainfall risks the accuracy of current hydrological decision support systems which characterize different watersheds gebremariam et al 2014 romagnoli et al 2017 is contingent upon the physical conditions and proper calibrations as such a number of statistical modelling techniques have been explored including an empirical method chiew et al 1998 statistical non parametric probabilistic model sharma 2000 copula models nguyen huy et al 2017 and autoregressive moving averages arma model burlando et al 1993 gaussian copula methods showed huge improvements in the correlation coefficient and a decrease in root mean square error in estimating rainfall from satellite data in iran moazami et al 2014 for the case of pakistan only a handful of studies pertaining to rainfall forecasting have been performed an autoregressive integrated moving averaging arima model was developed to forecast precipitation trends salma et al 2012 while multiple linear regression models were designed for seasonal runoff archer and fowler 2008 additionally extreme rainfall events in indus river valley pakistan were estimated using the global data assimilation model reale et al 2012 later the thiessen polygon method was developed for precipitation forecasts faisal and gaffar 2012 the other issue is that these tools are generally built on regional scale sub models and the spatiotemporal aspects of the variables and require enormous spatial data with apt calibrations he et al 2014 prasad et al 2017 the artificial intelligence algorithms on the other hand do not require detailed information about physical or hydrological behaviours of the watershed in providing immense insights into a rainfall forecasting and forewarning system artificial intelligence models have been successfully applied in forecasting future p trends luk et al 2001 by dealing with non linear input features nasseri et al 2008 artificial neural networks ann were used to forecast rainfall in thailand hung et al 2009 ann was also used for a localized p forecasting system kashiwao et al 2017 using climatological data yet the forecasts were not significant in comparison to japan meteorological agency in australia monthly rainfall was forecasted using climate indices as inputs via the ann model abbot and marohasy 2014 in another study for spain the occurrence and amount of rainfall were forecasted with meteorological variables via hierarchical nominal ordinal support vector classifier sánchez monedero et al 2014 while support vector machines were utilized for p forecasts in taiwan lin et al 2009 again literature shows that for pakistan only one study with machine learning models has been explored whereby ali et al 2018b designed a markov chain monte carlo using the copula based machine learning model to forecast rainfall as such more studies in regard to rainfall forecasting need to be carried out for pakistan either using statistical or machine learning models in addition the past studies reveal that precipitation forecasting trends have been mostly based on climate data using the regression model or basic machine learning models it is also evident that the previous works have been done on large scales at either provincial or national levels but not for small areas hence more studies pertaining to designing data driven algorithms for accurate precipitation forecasting at a smaller spatial scale are required that will be undertaken in this study furthermore the above mentioned studies were beneficial to various stakeholders to develop machine learning models for a reasonably accurate forecast of precipitation but all these studies were not able to handle the non stationarity and non linearity issues that arise in the rainfall data ali et al 2018b sánchez monedero et al 2014 the naturally abrupt p trends compounded by changing climate conditions that have been observed for the last few years in pakistan and in other regions need to be aptly considered and captured by such models particularly for pakistan there is no study performed on the development of an advanced data intelligent model that tackles the issues of non stationarity and non linearity of rainfall data to address these gaps there is a dire need for developing data driven models for accurate p forecasting at a much better scale than endeavoured beforehand that is able to ameliorate non stationarity and non linearity issues which is the novelty of this current study to overcome these issues an apt multi resolution analytical tool is used to extract the embedded features from the rainfall time series data that inherently has embedded climate induced variability the extracted features form a suite of non static time series signals that help to improve a standalone data intelligent model to deal with this issue the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd which is an advanced form of empirical mode decomposition huang et al 1998 can act as a useful tool in improving the accuracy that is lacking in the existing models the ceemd is able to clearly resolve and isolate the large fluctuating signals into respective smaller frequency components after the inception of ceemd method it gained attention because of its completely data dependent and self adaptability characteristics alvanitopoulos et al 2014 thus ceemd is able to extract pertinent features while preserving the physical structure of the temporal input wu et al 2011 in this work ceemd is integrated with a robust bootstrap aggregation approach i e random forest rf model and kernel ridge regression krr to develop the ceemd rf krr model for rainfall forecasting the key objectives of this study include 1 the application of ceemd to decompose the predictor variables into respective imfs and a residual factor to resolve the non stationarity and non linearity problems 2 to integrate the rf model to ceemd in order to forecast the respective imfs with residual component 3 to aggregate the forecasted imfs and residuals using the krr to forecast p values 4 to validate the forecasting capability of ceemd rf krr model in rainfall forecasting of diverse climatic regions in pakistan for comparison the results are benchmarked with standalone krr rf and ceemd rf models the developed ceemd rf krr approach is evaluated to forecast precise point based rainfall in gilgit muzaffarabad and kurrum agency parachinar districts in pakistan 2 theoretical background 2 1 complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd method the ceemd data decomposition technique addresses the non stationarity and non linearity of input data torres et al 2011 in the decomposition process gaussian white noise is added to the original data to construct a uniform reference frame which eventually is removed by averaging of the respective imfs and residue a short description of the ceemd process for an undecomposed input x t is presented below torres et al 2011 1 supply some white noise ω t to the time series x t such that x t x t ω t 2 decompose x t via emd the original ensemble mode decomposition technique to obtain the first decomposed component 3 follow steps 1 and 2 with distinct number of realizations this process is usually repeated with τ numbers of times ensemble number each with different realizations 4 then compute the mean of all imf1 as below 1 imf 1 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ω k t where ψ 1 is the computation of kth imf and ε specifies the amplitude regulation which is necessary to obtain an appropriate signal 5 hence the first residual component or the remaining component results as follows 2 r 1 t x t i m f 1 t 6 next the extraction of imf2 from the original signal x t can be extracted as 3 imf 2 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ψ 1 ω k t 7 the above steps are repeated to acquire the β 1 th imf factor as 4 imf β 1 t 1 τ k 1 τ ψ 1 x t ε ψ β ω k t 8 finally the residuals are averaged which generally is the trend display a gradual variation around the long term average 2 2 random forest rf model the building blocks of decision tree based modelling approach i e the rf model is bootstrapping and aggregation called bagging breiman 1996 schapire et al 1998 the rf model randomly adopts a bagging approach in identifying features whereby each node is randomly separated by choosing the most dominant possible predictors that would improve the model accuracy without causing overfitting breiman 2001 the following steps are adopted in designing rf models 1 using the input predictor variables n trees of bootstrapping ensembles are generated where n is the number of trees 2 an unpruned regression tree is built by choosing maximum predictors splitting creating a randomized input predictors sample denoted m try 3 the predictions from n trees are aggregated to forecast future rainfall the rf model has been applied in forecasting soil moisture prasad et al 2018 shallow water table koch et al 2019 as well as for hydrological moore et al 1991 and environmental management ascough ii et al 2008 applications interested readers may refer to breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 for a comprehensive background on rf modelling 2 3 kernel ridge regression krr model the krr is based on the kernel approach combined with ridge regressions zhang et al 2013 a key advantage is that the krr uses a regularization and kernel technique in capturing the non linear relationship overcoming the over fitting issues in the regression you et al 2018 the krr can be expressed in mathematical form as 5 arg min 1 m i 1 m f i y i 2 λ f 2 h 6 f i j 1 m α j φ x j x i where h is the hilbert normed space the eq 5 can concisely be rewritten for an m m kernel matrix k as follows 7 k λ n i y 8 y i 1 m α i φ x i x during the training stage the krr algorithm approximates α by finding solutions for eq 7 it then searches for an optimum α and λ from the parameter set for optimized performances the α is then used in the testing stage to calculate the regressand of the newer samples x as in eq 8 in this study the linear polynomial and gaussian kernels were used to get the best accuracy alaoui and mahoney 2015 you et al 2018 the ridge regression reduces the sum of squared errors sse with constraint fulfillment providing an estimate to penalize it you et al 2018 the feature s estimate does not perform arbitrarily in case we have very large estimates the sse will reduce with the increment in penalty term thus krr selects the less influential features to undergo more penalization estimates zhang et al 2013 if the number of independent predictors is too many where it is not easy to determine which predictor influences more the target response variable the krr handles the situation better than others alaoui and mahoney 2015 in krr there might be a possibility of the case where the number of dimensions can be higher or even infinitely greater than the number of data and the inverse is not easy to compute this problem can be handled with the help of eq 8 to perform the inverse either by the dimension of feature space or the number of data cases welling 2013 the solution must exist in the span of the data even the dimension is very large which shows the algorithm is linear in the feature space 3 materials and methods 3 1 rainfall p data as the data driven models highly depend on prognostic features from the past the rainfall data from 1962 to 2013 was collated from the pakistan meteorological department pmd 2016 for gilgit muzaffarabad parachinar as shown in fig 1 to assess the adaptability of the ceemd rf krr for p forecasting in pakistan the selected locations were broadly the main representative of the diverse climatic regions

krr model was established in matlab r2016b the math works inc usa running on pentium 4 dual core central processing unit with 2 93 ghz of processing speed the rainfall data were incorporated to design the hybrid ceemd rf krr ceemd rf standalone rf and standalone krr models the steps involved in establishing the ceemd rf krr are step 1 the ceemd method was employed to resolve the rainfall p into imfs and residuals the parameters defined in constructing ceemd are the number of realizations of the gaussian noise τ 500 and the provided amplitude in terms of added white noise ε 0 2 ouyang et al 2016 ren et al 2015 wang et al 2013 wu and huang 2009 for gilgit and muzaffarabad the ceemd method decomposed the p time series into nine imfs imf1 imf2 imf9 and a residual part whereas parachinar has eight imfs imf1 imf2 imf8 with a residual factor fig 2 and table 2 illustrates the ceemd decomposed imfs and residuals with p data for all locations step 2 the statistically significant lag time series computed by partial autocorrelation function pacf of imfs and residual components presented in fig 3 step 3 the normalization was established using eq 9 for the purpose of data fluctuation and spikes hsu et al 2003 as below 9 norm min max min where indicates input target min is the minimum point max denotes the maximum point and norm is the anticipated normalized value step 4 the normalized significant lags of imfs and the residual factors were incorporated as inputs to the rf model to forecast imfs and residuals one by one the number of trees ntrees 1000 and the number of predictors 5 were the predefined parameters used in the rf model at this stage basically these parameters were determined by the trial and error technique taking different combinations after several times of trial and error the optimum results with these parameters were obtained step 5 the krr model was finally applied to eventuate the ceemd rf krr model to forecast p where the forecasted imfs and residuals were utilized as input predictors krr models use different types of kernels gaussian polynomial and linear in this study the polynomial kernel appeared to be the most suitable choice after a comparative study of the respective kernels were performed the performance of ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial was evaluated against ceemd rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone krr based on each kernel type and rf models table 3 describes the parameters used in the ceemd rf krr model vs ceemd rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone krr and standalone rf models fig 4 illustrates a schematic view of the hybrid ceemd rf krr model 3 3 model assessment criteria the performance of ceemd rf krr vs ceemd rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone rf and the standalone krr models in rainfall forecasting were assessed utilizing a number of statistical and standardized metrics yen 1995 the description of these assessment criteria is discussed below dawson et al 2007 legates and mccabe 1999 willmott 1984 i correlation coefficient r is formulated as 10 r j 1 n p obs j p obs j p for j p for j j 1 n p obs j p obs j 2 j 1 n p for j p for j 2 ii willmott s index ewi is defined as 11 e wi 1 j 1 n p for j p obs j 2 j 1 n p for j p obs j p obs j p obs j 2 0 e wi 1 iii nash sutcliffe coefficient ens is described as 12 e ns 1 j 1 n p obs j p for j

legates mccabe s index elm is defined as 15 e lm 1 j 1 n p for i p obs j j 1 n p obs j p obs j 0 e lm 1 vii relative root mean square error rrmse is stated as 16 rrmse 1 n j 1 n p for j p obs j 2 1 n j 1 n p obs j 100 where p obs j and p for j are the observed and forecasted j th values of p p obs j and p for j are the average of p and n is the entire number of tested values in addition the computation of the rmse is based on the aggregation of residuals between observed and forecasted p nourani et al 2011 the higher p values are largely captured by the rmse which ranges from 0 ideal value to positive infinity however this metric should not essentially be used to compare model performance at geographically diverse sites hora and campos 2015 as these are in their absolute terms as such the relative values of root mean squared error rrmse were utilized dawson et al 2007 for this purpose 4 results the ceem rf krr model is undertaken to forecast rainfall for three highly geographically diverse regions of pakistan the hybrid ceemd rf krr based on polynomial kernel model is appraised with respect to standalone rf krr and ceemd rf models to establish parsimonious models pacf played a vital role in deciding the most relevant lags of p the arithmetical metrics discussed in eqs 9 15 are utilized to explain the results in terms of numerical model quantification the performance of the ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial model is evaluated against the counterparts in table 4 it is evident that the hybrid ceemd rf krr performed better at all three sites in achieving lower errors rmse and mae and very high pearson s correlation coefficient r while the standalone krr model performed poorly at all the three sites under consideration ideally the magnitudes of rmse and mae must be as small as possible to reflect the lowest deviations of forecasted values from the observed ones for the case of muzaffarabad and parachinar high error values were apparent from all models the competing models ceem rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone rf and standalone krr based on each kernel registered higher error values with mae ranging between 25 03 mm and 195 18 mm and rmse ranged between 35 51 mm and 222 07 mm yet the hybrid ceemd rf krr model outperformed with mae of 13 65 mm parachinar and 19 99 mm muzaffarabad and least rmse as well in comparison to the standalone krr worst performing model a two fold increase in r is noted at parachinar percentage increase 93 and a huge over three fold increase is seen for muzaffarabad percentage increase 160 and gilgit sites percentage increase 171 even with a comparison to the ceemd rf second best performing model the high percentage decrease in mae range 17 to 80 and rmse range 25 to 82 was achieved by the ceemd rf krr model further depicting its suitability in forecasting monthly p to holistically evaluate the model performances the correlation coefficient r is plotted in the form of a taylor diagram that provides a more detailed appraisal of the model performances xu et al 2016 the taylor diagram fig 5 portrays a more tangible and convincing statistical relation between the forecasted and observed monthly p depending on r with respect to standard deviations it is clearly displayed that the standalone krr and standalone rf models are not appropriate as the r to sd points were highly parted from the ideal observed point the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model was lying close to the observed p which confirms the forecasting accuracy was significantly higher at all three sites than the other three comparing models ceemd rf standalone rf and standalone krr in this study the model evaluation was also undertaken with the normalized metrics ewi ens and elm for the three sites in forecasting monthly rainfall which ideally must be equal to unity for perfectly fitting models table 5 the normalized metrics also justified a better utility of the ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial model as there was a significant increase in these values at all three study sites the ceemd rf models at all sites did perform equally well however was not able to outperform the proposed ceemd rf krr models at all sites the ceemd rf krr model attained the highest values of normalized metrics ewi ens and elm with percentage increase in ewi ranging between 3 6 and 5 7 ens ranging between 4 and 6 and elm ranging between 7 and 13 in comparison to the competing ceemd krr model which has the second best performance it must be noted that models with ens below 0 800 are unsatisfactory those between 0 800 and 0 900 are fairly good and ens values greater than 0 900 are considered to be very satisfactory shamseldin 1997 hence according to the abovementioned criteria the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr models at all sites could be regarded as very satisfactory when applied for precipitation forecasting at these three sites in pakistan more precisely table 5 examines the ceemd rf krr efficiency in predicting p using ewi ens and elm criterion for gilgit ewi 0 966 ens 0 972 and elm 0 810 muzaffarabad ewi 0 938 ens 0 941 and elm 0 739 and parachinar ewi 0 950 ens 0 950 and elm 0 759 the outcomes of benchmark models table 5 confirms the supremacy of the ceemd rf krr for all study sites in this paper hence based on the above criteria the proposed model could be regarded as satisfactory for p forecasting at these sites in pakistan in addition the model appraisal was undertaken using diagnostic plots prior to making the box plots forecasting errors fe were computed during the testing period the fe ideally needs to be zero hence when plotted on box plots the distribution of fe needs to be as close to zero as possible for best performing models the absolute fe f e values were plotted for ease of comprehension in accordance with tables 4 and 5 fig 6 ceemd rf krr models at all sites registered smaller fe distributions revealing its better forecasting capability according to the normalized metrics ewi ens and elm the ceemd rf models seemed to have a very close performance to that of ceemd rf krr models contrariwise the box plots make a clear distinction of performances since the distribution of f e generated from ceemd rf models for muzaffarabad and parachinar were fairly scattered with a large number of outlier points likewise for site 1 gilgit the ceemd rf krr model had a narrower f e distribution bounded near zero with very fewer outliers additionally the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf plots of f e were also plotted in fig 7 to get a clearer picture of the forecast error distributions for sites 2 muzaffarabad and 3 parachinar the ecdf line plots of ceemd krr standalone rf and standalone krr displayed a very close profile while at site 1 gilgit the ecdf profiles of standalone rf and standalone krr were very similar on the other hand at all three sites the ecdf profile of ceemd rf krr displayed a remarkable narrow profile confined within the least f e range hence the box plots fig 6 together with the ecdf plots fig 7 for all three sites further ascertain better performance of the ceemd rf krr model in forecasting monthly p compared to the competing models ceemd rf standalone rf and standalone krr a further diagnostic was performed with bar graph plots fig 8 based on correlation coefficient r note that the interest here is to evaluate all models in examining the percentages of p values that can be effectively forecasted by the respective models ceemd rf krr ceemd krr and standalone krr and standalone rf the standalone krr models at all sites performed poorly registering lower r values evidently the ceemd rf krr model exhibits larger r values at all three sites in comparison with the competing models consequently over 90 of forecasted values are directly associated with the observed values in the testing period specifically results reflected that for the case of gilgit r 0 986 muzaffarabad r 0 971 and parachinar r 0 976 which concur with the results in tables 4 and 5 from the outcomes of the numerical metrics tables 4 and 5 a difference in performances of models at the three distinctive sites is apparent the key limitation of these metrics is their inability to compare models at geographically disparate sites the relative performance table 6 suitably discovered that the ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial models exhibit the lowest values of rrmse in comparison with ceemd rf standalone rf and krr models for all three sites more accurately the rrmse magnitudes when comparing ceemd rf krr with the second best performing model ceemd rf in the combination ceemd rf krr ceemd rf were as follows gilgit 19 20 29 40 muzaffarabad 21 50 29 60 and parachinar 18 20 24 40 consequently the rrmse exhibited that the ceemd rf krr accomplished the best accuracy for site 3 parachinar followed by site 1 gilgit and site 2 muzaffarabad 5 discussion this study has designed a hybrid ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial model using the historical significant lags of rainfall p data to forecast monthly p in pakistan at three sites that experience a differing annual climate pattern the model utilized the ceemd algorithm to factorize the p into respective imfs and residuals components the pacf is used to compute the statistically relevant lags of imfs with residuals that are utilized into the rf model to predict each imf and the residue finally the krr model was applied to forecast and aggregate the p by incorporating the forecasted imfs and residuals as input predictors the proposed ceemd rf krr model was appraised with ceemd rf standalone rf and krr models the developed ceemd rf krr and comparison models were successfully appraised to generate smaller relative percentage errors in terms of rrmse with reasonably higher magnitudes of r ewi ens and elm tables 4 6 the performance was high according to the achieved assessment criteria eqs 9 15 used in this paper thus the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr framework can aptly be applied to forecast monthly p where the forecasting of future p is likely to become more erratic caused by global warming and an increase in water demand the hybrid ceemd rf krr and competing models generated slightly varying results for each of the stations due to diverse geographic conditions as displayed in table 1 each study zone possesses distinct climatic and environmental properties which significantly affect rainfall qing et al 2011 for example gilgit is basically a hilly area at higher elevation 2437 m which significantly affects the rainfall in the region rainfall is a lot more common at a higher elevation region as the cooler weather and atmosphere cannot hold in as much condensation causing it to rain or snow more often poage and chamberlain 2001 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 since the study locations in this paper are at different elevation levels from low muzaffarabad 679 m to high gilgit 2437 m the models produced different prediction results vuille 2011 accurate rainfall forecasts are extremely important for the efficient operation of water infrastructure and disaster risk reductions in cases of floods and droughts anderson and burt 1985 the nature of the rainfall forecast horizon is usually defined by the application for which the forecasts are being used for instance rainfall forecasts can be made from the start of the forecast up to short medium or long term into the future forecasts for water management are needed to plan effective use of water ranging from hydroelectric power generation to water supply irrigation as well as drought and flood early warning systems in particular an effective early warning system must provide sufficient lead time for individual communities in the case of drought flood caused by rainfall to respond accordingly in the case of flood forecasts lead time can be critical in reducing infrastructural damages and loss of life forecasts must be sufficiently accurate to uphold confidence so that communities and users will take effective actions when warned if forecasts are inaccurate credibility is reduced and an adequate response is not made accurate p forecasting and developing early warning systems can have numerous benefits both nationally and internationally barredo 2007 langridge et al 2006 precise p forecasts can play an important role in the aforementioned situations for both developed and developing nations such as pakistan governments and water resource managers use machine learning tools in providing guidance for the operation of infrastructure and the implementation of appropriate measures anderson and burt 1985 further this study can be adopted anywhere for p forecasting using the ceemd algorithm in addressing non static and non linear problems the hybrid ceemd rf krr model can be applied for agriculture crop yield prediction which could be important to the government s national policy making to help minimize crop estimation uncertainties akhtar 2012 however establishing a viable rainfall forecasting and warning system for communities at risk requires the combination of meteorological and hydrological data forecast tools and trained forecasters bellerby et al 2000 and more studies pertaining to advanced machine learning modelling approaches are recommended it is noted that the current study utilized the historical significant lags of p to forecast future p and therefore carries some limitations to enhance the scope of this study other meteorological data such as synoptic scale climate mode indices temperature humidity cloud cover sunshine air temperatures soil moisture wind and solar radiation could also be collated as predictor inputs remotely sensed predictor variables through satellites or atmospheric simulation models bauer 1975 collins et al 2006 may also improve the model performances for modelling p in remote areas more importantly since process based modeling is resource demanding and cost prohibitive for developing countries the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model may be seen as a viable solution moreover the proposed hybrid model ceemd rf krr model can be applied in those regions where other meteorological data is not available the hybrid ceemd rf krr model could be further developed with ensemble strategies to possibly achieve more accurate results additionally bio inspired techniques such as quantum behaved particle swarm optimization and the firefly algorithm can assist in selecting input predictors which have been tested in the hybridization of rf and other models ghorbani et al 2018 pal et al 2012 another possible choice could be empirical wavelet transform gilles 2013 and advance multi resolution analysis huang et al 1998 future work could apply statistical copula tools nguyen huy et al 2017 in order to study the joint behavior of multivariate data 6 conclusions a hybrid ceemd rf krr i e ceemd rf krrpolynomial model has been constructed in this paper to forecast future rainfall p the p time series from 1962 to 2013 were decomposed by employing the ceemd algorithm into respective imfs and residuals components the significant lags of each imfs and residual were calculated using pacf each significant lag of pacf was incorporated into an rf model to predict imfs and residual factor finally the forecasted imfs with residuals were inserted in the krr model to design the robust ceemd rf krr model further different kinds of assessment metrics were utilized to measure the efficiency of the ceemd rf krr model the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model was compared with ceemd rf ceemd rf krrgaussian ceemd rf krrlinear standalone rf and standalone krr with respective kernel functions models as evident by assessment metrics the accuracy of the proposed ceemd rf krr model is better in relation to comparative models the fe errors for the best site gilgit attained by the proposed hybrid ceemd rf krr model were rmse 2 52 mm and mae 1 98 mm while the achieved normalized metrics were r 0 986 wi 0 966 and ens 0 972 see tables 4 and 5 on the basis of elm the acquired magnitudes of elm agreement values for site 1 i e gilgit were elm 0 810 ceemd rf krr 0 717 ceemd rf 0 403 standalone rf and 0 047 standalone krr whereas the rrmse values were 19 2 ceemd rf krr compared with 29 4 ceemd rf 68 4 standalone rf and 108 5 standalone krr a significant amount of geographic variability was seen on the basis of rrmse for gilgit site with comparison to parachinar and muzaffarabad this study provides a baseline in terms of using the ceemd algorithm to dissolve the data into imfs and residual component to avoid the non stationarity and non linearity issues in monthly p forecasting the ceemd rf krr model may be used for drought soil moisture agricultural crops solar radiations etc that will help hydrologists and agriculturist of pakistan in the optimal resource management besides precise p forecasting can be used to alert the government and impacted stakeholders prior to significant water resources depletion flood and drought events credit authorship contribution

5624,gas hydrates are natural clean energy resources with significant potentials as the alternative energy resources nevertheless the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates in microstructures are not still well understood hydrate formation in sand pack specimen and x ray ct imaging experiments are conducted to elucidate the hydrates changes in microstructures color difference phase separation method is proposed to accurately segment the hydrate pore and grain phases pore scale variables are defined to quantitatively investigate the characteristics of hydrates moreover the pore scale flow properties in microstructures with hydrates are also studied results indicate that relative pore scale variables significantly affect hydrate behaviors in which hydrate saturation first increases with decreasing relative pore scale variables then keeps constant with relative stable pore scale variables and finally decreases with decreasing relative pore scale variables during the hydrate migration in the hydrate interaction hydrate saturation keeps 0 as relative pore scale variables gradually decrease to 0 caused by interaction between gas hydrates and water hydrates during the hydrate conversion hydration saturation increases with increasing relative porosity relative pore size and relative grain size due to the conversion of gas hydrates to water hydrates hydrates can decrease the permeability in porous sediments due to the occupation of the pore space by hydrates and the permeability decreases with increasing hydrate phase in porous sediments the proposed approach gives more insights to the hydrates behaviors and permeability in fine gained hydrate bearing sediments keywords hydrates x ray ct imaging microstructures pore scale variables flow properties 1 introduction gas hydrates e g methane attract lots of attentions due to the significant potentials for the clean energy resources with abundant storages yin et al 2019 the promising capacity of gas isolation and storage anderson et al 2019 the considerable threat of global warming effect liu et al 2019 previous studies verified that hydrates are primarily stored in the oceanic sediments and permafrost regions and the estimated amount of hydrates has the same order of magnitude as the total fossil fuels klauda and sandler 2005 wu et al 2017 nevertheless there still are key issues and challenges to improve the exploration and production of these energy resources related to the techniques and environment problems therefore it is imperative to well understand the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates to improve the exploration production and utilization efficiency of these energy resources to date injection of inhibitors thermal simulation and depressurization are confirmed to be the primary approaches to study the exploration and production of gas hydrates makogon 2010 bavoh et al 2019 babakhani et al 2018 lijith et al 2019 which are simply classified into three categories including the laboratory experiments liu et al 2018 sun et al 2018 theoretical analytical techniques hou et al 2019 hielscher et al 2019 and numerical simulation techniques wang et al 2019 wang et la 2019 for instances lee et al 2019 experimentally studied the inhibition effects of amino acids and ionic liquids on ch4 hydrates they found that ch4 hydrate formation ratio is extremely affected by inhibitors in which ionic liquids show larger inhibition on gas hydrate formation than glycine fu et al 2019 proposed a novel theoretical model to describe the criteria of hydrate removal including the interaction between the particle fluid and particle surface which are validated by experimental works and provide effective tools to evaluate gas transport safety sun et al 2019 proposed the coupled thermo hydro chemo mechanical thcm model to investigate the production of gas with marine hydrates under the depressurization and soil compression their numerical results suggested that the relative permeability between the dissociated and undissociated zones significantly affects the gas flow rate and the gas production decreases with decreasing downhole pressure generally these techniques mentioned above provide effective methods to study the variations transport characteristics and production of gas hydrates and depressurization is validated to be the most promising approach to study flow behaviors during gas production chen et al 2015 chong et al 2016 however there are some inevitable limitations for these techniques for examples classical experiment methods cannot provide the real time behaviors of the hydrates growth theoretical analytical methods may result in errors between the predicted results and the realistic results because the boundary conditions are ideally specified by some simplification hypothesis the defects of numerical simulations are similar to those of the theoretical analytical methods and numerical results may be different from the practical engineering results which is induced by the difference between the constructed models and the realistic geometry topologies in total the flow behaviors and distribution of hydrates are extremely affected by the microstructures of porous mediums more attentions should be paid to the detailed behaviors during hydrate variation and to their effect on flow properties in porous mediums with hydrates which are helpful to improve the production of gas hydrates hydrates significantly affect the flow properties in porous sediments during gas production which are controlled by the permeability hou et al 2018 mahabadi et al 2019 various methods have been successfully implemented to understand the permeability in hydrate bearing reservoirs including direct experimental tests li et al 2018 almenningen et al 2019 and numerical simulations van and genuchten 1980 spangenberg 2001 delli and grozic 2013 katagiri et al 2017 for instances wu et al 2018 experimentally investigated the gas phase permeability of montmorillonite with different hydrate saturations under the effective axial stresses of 1 mpa and 3 mpa their results show that the gas phase permeability first decreases and then increases with increasing gas phase saturation hou et al 2018 numerically studied the hydrate effect on the permeability of hydrate bearing sediments using lattice boltzmann modeling and proposed a new permeability prediction model based on the control seepage channel they found that minerals distributions have no effects on permeability and hydrates significantly affect the permeability in total although direct experiment tests and numerical simulations provide effective tools to study the permeability of hydrate bearing sediments there still exist some limitations the main limitations for direct experiment tests are the limited experiment configuration without natural hydrate bearing sediments and long time demand for hydrate formation weak control of hydrate formation and dissociation and sustaining high pressure and low temperature to keep gas hydrates santamarina et al 2015 priest et al 2015 numerous numerical simulations are limited to the assumed models with regular geometries which may result in errors between the numerical results and realistic results for the hydrate behaviors in porous sediments x ray ct imaging due to the advantages of nondestructive examination nde monitoring the real time behaviors of materials visualized inter microstructures are rapidly applied to study the pore scale flow properties based on extracted pore network models wang et al 2016 zhao and zhou 2019b mahabadi et al 2016 studied the residuary water phase and relative permeability in hydrate baring sediments by x ray ct images and pore network simulations their results show that gas permeability decreases with increasing hydrate phase saturation which has marginal effect on water permeability in sediments with uniform distribution of hydrates mohammadmoradi et al 2018 proposed a direct three phase pore network simulation to study hydrate behaviors and permeability of hydrate bearing sediments in which the numerical fluid occupancy profiles absolute permeability and hydraulic tortuosity well agree with experimental datasets liu et al 2019 proposed novel fractal models to study the permeability of hydrate bearing sediments by x ray ct imaging and pore network simulations in which the relative gas permeability increases and relative water permeability decreases during gas production from hydrate reservoirs thus it can be concluded that x ray ct imaging techniques are effective tools to understand the transport properties of porous sediments with hydrates however previous works mainly focused on the hydrate behaviors in models with simple pore geometries or coarse pores and few works report the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates in microstructures with fine grains which is helpful to the long term production of natural gas hydrates in fine grained sediments the primary objectives of this paper are to provide microstructural evolution of the formation migration and dissolution and to study the effect of the hydrates on the pore scale permeability color difference phase separation method cdps is proposed to accurately segment the hydrate pore and grain phases moreover the spatial distribution of hydrates in microstructures is investigated based on the extracted hydrate phase and the corresponding flow properties are analyzed compared with the previous works the main novelties of this work are 1 the accurate hydrate phase extraction by the proposed color difference phase separation method in microstructures 2 the microstructural evolution of hydrates behaviors 3 the evaluation of pore scale variables effects on the hydrates variations and 4 the investigation of pore scale hydrates effects on permeability 2 laboratory measurements in this work xenon hydrate growth experiments and x ray computed tomography ct imaging experiments are conducted to investigate the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates in sand pack specimens at microscale 2 1 experimental materials and specimen description firstly an aluminum specimen vessel φ8 6 mm 40 mm consisting of the stainless steel spring inlet and outlet spacers with stain steel sieves is cleaned by deionized water as shown in fig 1 c then sand pack with average particle diameter of 0 71 mm is filled in the aluminum specimen vessel finally the 10 wt nabr brine is prepared to saturate the sand pack specimen and the xenon gas is collected in the aluminum accumulator fig 2 b to form hydrates in sand pack specimen the whole measurement apparatus consists of the hydrate formation devices and the x ray ct imaging apparatus as shown in fig 1a 2 2 experimental configurations hydrates formation experiment is completed under conditions of the temperature of 23 1 c the pressure of 35 3 7 mpa and excess xenon gas ohgaki et al 2000 tishchenko et al 2005 fig 1b shows the device for the preparation of hydrate sand pack specimen which consists of the aluminum xenon gas accumulator the pressure gauge the neddle valve and the aluminum specimen vessel x ray ct imaging tests are conducted to capture hydrate behaviors in microstructures of sand pack samples by x ray ct scanner and detector as shown in fig 1a the scanning voltage and electricity are respectively 85kv and 300μa and the voxel spatial resolution of the x ray ct images is 28 77 μm the details for the experiment process are described as follows 1 the aluminum specimen vessel is cleaned by deionized water then dried and finally sand pack with average particle diameter of 0 71 mm is filled in the aluminum specimen vessel to prepare the sand pack specimen 2 the well prepared dry sand pack specimen is scanned by the x ray ct scanner and applied to measure the porosity and absolute permeability by the ap608 automated pemeameter porosimeter 3 10 wt nabr brine is first applied to saturate the sand pack specimen to the bulk saturation of 65 and xenon gas is then injected and circulated to the aluminum specimen vessel from inlet spacer to decrease its water saturation with increasing xenon gas the internal pressure reaches the peak value and varies between 3 5mpa and 3 7 mpa the phase equilibrium pressure is 1 75 mpa 4 during the hydration variation process the permeability of sand pack specimen in aluminum specimen vessel with two spacers are rapidly calculated based on recording pressure gradient and core flood flux wang et al 2018 once the internal pressure is stabilized the sand pack specimen is scanned again and the porosity with the excluding of hydrates is measured by the ap608 automated pemeameter porosimeter 1363 x ray ct images with the scale of 303 303 pixels are respectively obtained for dry sand pack specimen without hydrate and wet sand pack specimen with hydrates to save the memory space and to improve the computing efficiency these x ray ct images are cropped to the scale of 200 200 pixels the detailed laboratory parameters of the sand pack material are listed in table 1 3 evaluation for microstructural properties hydrates e g methane hydrates are usually stored in microstructures of underground soils or rock reservoirs the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates are quite complicated at microscale therefore to well declare the variations of hydrates in microstructures x ray ct imaging is applied to obtain the accurate information of different phases and color difference phase separation approach is proposed to accurately separate the hydrate phase from the pore phase and grain phase 3 1 pore hydrate grain phases separation in fact different phases in x ray ct images are usually represented by different gray intensity from 0 black to 255 white however the recognition range to the gray intensity by human vision is limited to only a few dozen abidi et al 2006 some tiny component phases with weak and similar gray intensities are feasible to be ignored moreover the classical algorithms such as the ostu s segmentation otsu 1979 the watershed segmentation bieniek and moga 2000 and the double threshold segmentation zhao and zhou 2019a b methods are not applicable to the separation of multiphase materials with hydrates due to their limitations on the two phase separation of pore and grain phases in addition the hydrate phase and water phase with similar gray intensity are difficult to extract from the pore phase in multiphase materials with hydrates by using the classical methods which may result in the overestimation or underestimation of the hydrate phase thus the color difference phase separation method is developed in this work to accurately capture the hydrate pore and grain phase firstly the histograms of gray intensities from the x ray ct images are computed by 1 h gf i 0 255 π f x y f u i f u i i i 0 255 where h gf denotes the histogram of the gray intensity f x y for each pixel denotes the counter function and f u i represents the unique gray intensity from 0 to 255 thus the histograms of x ray ct images from the dry sand pack specimens fig 2a and hydrate sand pack specimens fig 2d can be computed and are plotted in fig 2b and e obviously the information of pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase are concluded in these histograms to accurately segment these phases without overestimation and underestimation the gray intensities at peak point 1 and peak point 2 for dry sand pack specimen and the gray intensity at peak point 3 for hydrate sand pack specimen are respectively determined by 2 d h gf df f 0 f t 1 o r f t 2 o r f t 3 d h gf df t 1 0 d h gf df t 1 0 d h gf df t 2 0 d h gf df t 2 0 d h gf df t 3 0 d h gf df t 3 0 where t i i 1 2 3 represents the corresponding gray intensity at peak point 1 and peak point 2 in x ray ct images from dry sand pack specimen and the gray intensity at peak point 3 in x ray ct images from hydrate sand pack specimen respectively then to highlight the hydrate phase and some tiny component phases with weak and similar gray intensity e g the pore and gas phase in fig 2f the original gray intensity image is converted to the color difference image by 3 i cor i 1 p n f x y f c i rgb x 1 n y 1 n f x y x 1 n y 1 n f c r i x y r f x y f c g i x y g f x y f c b i x y b f x y where i cor denotes the color difference mapping with the color pixel f c i in the i th sub pore p n is the number of sub pores rgb represents the transform functions for the red channel r the green channel g and the blue channel b and f c r i f c g i and f c b i respectively denote the transformed three channel values for any color pixel the color difference images are computed and plotted in fig 2c for dry sand pack specimens and in fig 2f for hydrate sand pack specimens it is easy to differentiate the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase in these colored images based on their colorbars thus the color threshold values to differentiate the pore hydrate and grain phases in the color images are computed by 4 i cor f k f c i i cor f k 1 f c i 0 f m a x f c i t c 1 f dry t c 2 f hydrate where f k denotes the any color pixel in the color image t c 1 and t c 2 are the color pore phase and hydrate threshold with the value of f dry and f hydrate respectively next to avoid the overestimation or underestimation of the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase the segmentation thresholds for these phases are computed by 5 t p y y t 1 t 2 t c 1 t h y 255 t 3 t c 2 where y denotes the average function t p and t h are the pore phase and hydrate phase segmentation threshold respectively finally once these segmentation thresholds are determined the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase can be respectively segmented by 6 s e b x 1 n y 1 n f x y p x y h x y g x y p x y x 1 n y 1 n f x y 0 f 0 t p h x y x 1 n y 1 n f x y 1 f t p t h g x y x 1 n y 1 n f x y 2 f t h 255 where s e b denotes the segmented image consisting of the pore phase matrix p x y the hydrate phase matrix h x y and the grain matrix g x y fig 3 shows an example of the segmented ct image with different phases fig 3a show the segmented image with pore phase black and grain phase white for dry sand pack specimen fig 3b shows the segmented image with pore hydrate phase black and grain phase white for hydrate sand pack specimen fig 3c shows the segmented hydrate phase and its color representation with different morphology size of hydrate phase is plotted in fig 3d 3 2 definition for pore scale variables the pore scale properties play extremely significant roles in the formation migration dissolution and storage of hydrates in underground reservoirs therefore to investigate the pore scale variables effect on these properties the pore scale variables are defined to describe the distributions and variations of hydrates in microstructures generally the porosity is defined as the percentage of the void space to total space in this work the porosity is considered as the ratio of the pore phase to the total phases and is expressed as 7 φ dry p x y p x y h x y g x y 100 φ hy p x y h x y p x y h x y g x y 100 φ h h x y p x y h x y g x y 100 where φ dry and φ hy respectively represent the porosity for the dry sand pack specimen and sand pack specimen with hydrates and φ h is the hydrate phase ratio with respect to the size information for different phases they are recommended to be the equivalent radius of the circle or sphere from every sub pore phase sub hydrate phase and sub grain phase for each sub matrix for the pore hydrate and grain phases it is marked by different colors as shown in fig 3d which can be described as 8 p c x y i 1 n 1 f i x y i i n 1 f x y 0 i h c x y j 1 n 2 f j x y j i n 2 f x y 1 j g c x y k 1 n 3 f k x y k i n 3 f x y 2 k where p c x y h c x y and g c x y are respectively the color matrixes for the pore hydrate and grain phase matrixes f i x y f j x y and f k x y denotes the color pixel for the i th j th and k th sub matrixes for the pore hydrate and grain phases respectively thus the size information for the pore hydrate and grain phases can be computed based on these color sub phases of different phases by 9 r p d p i f i x y i π 1 2 r h d p i f i x y j π 1 2 r g d p i f i x y k π 1 2 where r p r h and r g are respectively the radius of the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase and dpi represents the voxel resolution in total based on these defined pore scale variables the distributions and characteristics of hydrates can be investigated and the formation migration and dissolution in microstructures can be well studied 3 3 flow properties evaluation it is easy to find from fig 3a to fig 3d that the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase in microstructures fit the linear relations for the phases in the microstructures from dry sand pack specimens and hydrate sand pack specimens the liner relations can be respectively expressed by 10 φ pore φ grain 1 φ pore φ hydrate φ grain 1 where φ pore φ hydrate and φ grain represent the phase ratio for the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase respectively once the hydrates form and migrate in the microstructures the pore phase is gradually occupied by the hydrates thus the concentration of the hydrates filled stored in the microstructural pores can be computed by 11 s hydrate h x y p x y 100 where s hydrate represents the saturation of the hydrates the pore scale permeability in the hydrate sand pack specimens is one of the most important indexes to describe the formation and migration of hydrates and it changes due to the variations of hydrates filled in the microstructures compared with the dry sand pack specimens the previous works provide excellent relations to determine the pore scale permeability with the invasion of the other phases e g oil and hydrates by kumar et al 2010 dai et al 2014 kang et al 2016 12 k hydrate k n 1 s hydrate 6 20 s hyrate 12 22 1 k n 1 s hydrate 4 62 s hyrate 27 61 2 k n 1 s hydrate e 4 95 s hydrate 3 where k hydrate and k n are the numerical pore scale permeability for hydrate sand pack specimen and numerical absolute permeability for dry sand pack specimen respectively in the pore scale microstructures the absolute permeability is the variable linking to the porosity the grain size and the grain shape factor fs which can be expressed by carman 1956 13 k n fs r g 2 φ n 3 37 5 1 φ n 2 in eq 13 the grain shape factor is equal to the ratio of the area to the volume which is represented by mccabe 2005 tiab and donaldson 2011 14 fs a g v g where a g and v g respectively denote the grain area and volume which can be obtained by pixels and when the grains are equivalent to spheres it equals to 3 r g 4 results and discussions in this works xenon gas and nabr brine 10 wt are firstly used to form hydrates in sand pack specimen then cross sections for dry sand pack specimen and hydrate sand pack specimen are obtained using x ray ct imaging finally hydrate variations in microstructures are analyzed and the flow properties in microstructures with hydrates are investigated 4 1 characterization of hydrate variations once the hydrates form the pore phases are gradually occupied by hydrate phases in each cross section the hydrate phase ratio can be simply estimated by eqs 7 10 and 11 fig 4 shows the color representation of cross sections at equilibrium state converted by eq 3 obviously the gas hydrate ratio changes with the variation of cross section depth in which hydrate phase is represented by yellow and red colors initially the hydrates rapidly form with the increase of xenon gas then the ostwald ripening occurs after one hour and the formed hydrates gradually migrate and dissolve in pore network of sand pack specimen the small hydrate crystals are gradually filled and accumulated in the pore phase from the top to the bottom of the sand pack specimens as the time increases the accumulated hydrates migrate and the gas hydrate ratio decreases with increasing depth as shown in fig 4a c moreover the exchange between the gas hydrates and water hydrates occurs as shown in fig 3d e finally the hydrates in water phase are accumulated in the bottom of the sand pack specimens hydrate distribution is extremely affected by the ostwald ripening as shown in fig 4 to well analyze this phenomenon hydrate phase is separated from the other phases individually fig 5 a and b show 3d microstructures for dry sand pack specimens and hydrate sand pack specimens in which the pore hydrate and grain phases are represented by green red and gray white colors respectively fig 5c shows the distribution of accumulated hydrates in microstructures obviously hydrates increase with increasing depth the gas hydrates gradually accumulates in the pore phase with the growth of the hydrate as shown in figs 5c 1 c 3 when hydrates increase to the saturation of 58 61 the phase change between the gas hydrates and water hydrates occurs as shown in figs 5c 4 c 5 with continuous growth of hydrates gas hydrates are changed to water hydrates as shown in fig 5c 6 in total hydrate growth is extremely affected by the undercooling and over pressurization due to the heat from the exothermic reaction freer et al 2001 which is intuitively declared by the progressive growth of the hydrates in fig 5 moreover water transport plays significant roles in the migration of hydrates due to the capillary pressure between the hydrate surfaces and the water film inks et al 2009 and the color representation in fig 4 and the progressive growth of the hydrates in fig 5 from the x ray ct imaging provide strong evidences for this phenomenon 4 2 pore scale effect on hydrates pore scale variables significantly affect the hydrate distribution and migration in microstructures and the porosity pore size and grain size for dry and hydrate sand pack specimens can be rapidly calculated by eqs 7 and 9 fig 6a c respectively show the relations between depth and numerical porosity pore size and grain size of cross sections from dry and hydrate sand pack specimens in fig 6 a the porosity of pore phase for dry sand pack specimen blue keeps constant with increasing depth nevertheless the porosity of hydrate phase red first increases then nearly decreases to 0 and finally increases with increasing depth implying the formation and migration the interaction between gas hydrate phase and water phase and the conversion from the hydrate in gas phase to the hydrate in water phase moreover the porosity of pore phase for hydrate sand pack specimen green first keeps constant then increases to the maximum and finally decreases with increasing depth which are corresponding with the variation of hydrate phase porosity mentioned above in fig 6b the pore size changes of pore phase for dry sand pack specimen hydrate phase and pore phase for hydrate sand pack specimen are similar to those of porosity because pore size information is determined by the porosity of each phase in fig 6c the grain size of grain phases for dry and hydrate sand pack specimen keeps constant and the latter is slightly larger than the former indicating the accuracy of the proposed method however the gain size changes of hydrate phase are contrary to porosity and pore size of hydrate phase in fig 6a and fig 6b due to the linear relation among the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase in eq 10 this can also evidence the formation and migration the interaction and conversation of hydrates in microstructures shown in fig 4 and fig 5 to detailedly elucidate the pore scale variables effects on hydrate variations relative pore scale variables are defined based on the pore scale variables for dry and hydrate sand pack specimens which are written as 15 φ re φ dry φ hy r rep r p dry r p hy r reg r g dry r g hy where φ re r rep and r reg are respectively the porosity pore and gain size of relative pore phase and relative gain phase figs 4 and 5 illustrate that hydrate formation migration and interaction occur in pore phase fig 6d f respectively show the relations between hydrate behaviors and relative pore scale variables obtained by eqs 9 11 and 16 in which the hydrate behaviors are divided into hydrate formation and migration hydrate interaction and hydrate conversion from gas hydrates to water hydrates based on the pore scale variables variation of hydrate phase with depth fig 6a c the details for hydrate phase conversion from gas phase to water phase can be referred in the previous work subramanian 2000 servio and englezons 2003 lei et al 2019 the close grain sizes for dry black and hydrate red sand pack specimens in fig 6f suggest the accuracy of the proposed method it is easy to find from fig 6d f that hydrate variations are significantly affected by relative pore scale variables during the hydrate migration hydrate saturation green first increases with decreasing relative porosity purple in fig 6d relative pore size purple in fig 6d and relative grain size purple in fig 6d then keep constant with relative stable pore scale variables and finally decreases with decreasing relative pore scale variables in the hydrate interaction hydrate saturation keeps 0 as relative pore scale variables gradually decrease to 0 obviously this is caused by interaction between gas hydrates and water hydrates during the hydrate conversion hydration saturation increases with increasing relative porosity relative pore size and relative grain size due to the conversion from gas hydrates to water hydrates in total relative pore scale variables significantly affect hydrate behaviors in which hydrate saturation first increases with decreasing relative pore scale variables then keep constant with relative stable pore scale variables and finally decreases with decreasing relative pore scale variables during the hydrate migration in the hydrate interaction hydrate saturation keeps 0 as relative pore scale variables gradually decrease to 0 obviously this is caused by interaction between gas hydrates and water hydrates during the hydrate conversion hydration saturation increases with increasing relative porosity relative pore size and relative grain size due to the conversion of gas hydrates to water hydrates 4 3 flow behaviors evaluation permeability is one of the most important indexes to describe the transport properties in various porous materials the migration and dissolution of hydrates change the permeability due to the occupation of pore space by hydrate phase to validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method the errors between the experimental and numerical results are calculated by 16 der de d n de 100 where der de and dn are respectively the error experimental and numerical dataset of porosity permeability for dry sand pack specimen and sand pack specimen with hydrates fig 7 a c respectively show the differences between the experimental data and numerical results for the porosity absolute permeability and pore scale permeability in selected x ray ct images from dry and hydrate sand pack specimens for the porosity in fig 7a the experimental and numerical porosity are respectively 36 7 and 34 7 and the differences between the average experimental porosity and numerical porosity range from 1 63 to 14 17 with the average of 6 57 regarding the permeability in dry sand pack specimen in fig 7b the average experimental and numerical permeability are respectively 390 07d and 421 74d and their differences vary from 0 74 to 22 01 with the average of 8 27 referring to the pore scale permeability of hydrate sand pack specimen in fig 7c the average experimental permeability and numerical permeability are respectively 358 52d and 364 95d and their differences change from 1 53 to 20 18 with the average of 8 53 in brief the average errors between the experimental data and numerical results are all less than 8 6 implying the accuracy of the proposed method therefore it is concluded that the proposed method provides effective tool to evaluate the flow properties in microstructures of porous sediments with hydrates once the permeability is determined pore scale hydrate effects on permeability can be studied fig 7d f respectively show the relations between the hydrate saturation and numerical absolute permeability for dry sand pack and the relations between the hydrate saturation and numerical pore scale permeability for hydrate sand pack considering the hydrate saturation of each x ray ct image from dry and hydrate sand pack specimens the relations between the permeability and hydrate saturation are divided into two parts shydrate less than 10 and shydrate 10 based on the hydrate saturation distribution and the hydrate saturation permeability relations for dry and hydrate sand pack specimens are respectively written as 17 k n 372 71 1932 05 exp s hydrate 0 04 s hydrate 10 r 2 0 43 k n 359 89 224 10 exp 1 s hydrate 16 96 s hydrate 10 r 2 0 68 18 k n 281 22 274 67 exp s hydrate 0 09 s hydrate 10 r 2 0 74 k n 319 61 2774 48 exp s hydrate 5 23 s hydrate 10 r 2 0 79 for the permeability in dry sand pack specimen in fig 7d and eq 17 the correlation coefficients are respectively 0 43 and 0 68 for x ray ct images with hydrate saturation less than and large than equal to 10 showing bad relations between the permeability and hydrate saturation in dry sand pack specimen when there are not external hydrate phase permeability is only the intrinsic property of porous materials related to void space referring to the pore scale permeability of hydrate sand pack specimen in fig 7e and eq 18 the correlation coefficients are respectively 0 74 and 0 79 for x ray ct images with hydrate saturation less than and large than equal to 10 obviously the correlation coefficients for the latter are larger than those for the former moreover it is easy to find that the permeability decreases with increasing hydrate saturation in porous sediments showing the inhibition of permeability by hydrates in addition it is easy to find from fig 7a c that the average experimental 358 52d and numerical 364 95d permeability for hydrate sand pack specimen are smaller than the average experimental 390 07d and numerical 421 74d permeability for dry sand pack specimen implying the inhibition of permeability by pore scale hydrates in porous sediments in total it is concluded that the average errors between the experimental data and numerical results are all less than 8 6 implying that the accuracy of the proposed method hydrates can decrease the permeability in porous sediments due to the occupation of the pore space by hydrates and the permeability decreases with increasing hydrate phase in porous sediments 5 summaries and conclusions in this work hydrates are formed using xenon and 10 wt nabr brine and x ray ct experiments are conducted to analyze the variation of hydrates in microstructures and to investigate their effects on flow properties color difference phase separation approach is proposed to accurately capture the hydrate pore and grain phases pore scale variables to describe the distribution of hydrates are defined and their effects on microstructural flow properties are investigated the primary conclusions are drawn as follows 1 hydrate formation and x ray ct imaging experiments provide the visualized real time information of the hydrates variations the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase information can be well captured by the x ray ct imaging techniques thus the formation migration and dissolution process can be well studied 2 the proposed color difference phase separation method can not only be applied to segment the pore hydrate and gain phases but also is effective to evaluate the distribution of hydrates in the microstructures from porous sediments with the aid of x ray ct imaging techniques which are helpful to understand the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates 3 by the x ray ct imaging analysis the growth interaction between hydrates in gas and water phase and the dissolution can be well observed and studied and direct visualized evidences are provided for the changes of hydrates in microstructures of sediments relative pore scale variables significantly affect hydrate behaviors in which hydrate saturation first increases with decreasing relative pore scale variables then keep constant with relative stable pore scale variables and finally decreases with decreasing relative pore scale variables during the hydrate migration in the hydrate interaction hydrate saturation keeps 0 as relative pore scale variables gradually decrease to 0 obviously this is caused by interaction between gas hydrates and water hydrates during the hydrate conversion hydration saturation increases with increasing relative porosity relative pore size and relative grain size due to the conversion of gas hydrates to water hydrates 4 the average errors between the experimental data and numerical results are all less than 8 6 implying that the accuracy of the proposed method hydrates can decrease the permeability in porous sediments due to the occupation of the pore space by hydrates and the permeability decreases with increasing hydrate phase in porous sediments author contributions section 1

5624,gas hydrates are natural clean energy resources with significant potentials as the alternative energy resources nevertheless the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates in microstructures are not still well understood hydrate formation in sand pack specimen and x ray ct imaging experiments are conducted to elucidate the hydrates changes in microstructures color difference phase separation method is proposed to accurately segment the hydrate pore and grain phases pore scale variables are defined to quantitatively investigate the characteristics of hydrates moreover the pore scale flow properties in microstructures with hydrates are also studied results indicate that relative pore scale variables significantly affect hydrate behaviors in which hydrate saturation first increases with decreasing relative pore scale variables then keeps constant with relative stable pore scale variables and finally decreases with decreasing relative pore scale variables during the hydrate migration in the hydrate interaction hydrate saturation keeps 0 as relative pore scale variables gradually decrease to 0 caused by interaction between gas hydrates and water hydrates during the hydrate conversion hydration saturation increases with increasing relative porosity relative pore size and relative grain size due to the conversion of gas hydrates to water hydrates hydrates can decrease the permeability in porous sediments due to the occupation of the pore space by hydrates and the permeability decreases with increasing hydrate phase in porous sediments the proposed approach gives more insights to the hydrates behaviors and permeability in fine gained hydrate bearing sediments keywords hydrates x ray ct imaging microstructures pore scale variables flow properties 1 introduction gas hydrates e g methane attract lots of attentions due to the significant potentials for the clean energy resources with abundant storages yin et al 2019 the promising capacity of gas isolation and storage anderson et al 2019 the considerable threat of global warming effect liu et al 2019 previous studies verified that hydrates are primarily stored in the oceanic sediments and permafrost regions and the estimated amount of hydrates has the same order of magnitude as the total fossil fuels klauda and sandler 2005 wu et al 2017 nevertheless there still are key issues and challenges to improve the exploration and production of these energy resources related to the techniques and environment problems therefore it is imperative to well understand the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates to improve the exploration production and utilization efficiency of these energy resources to date injection of inhibitors thermal simulation and depressurization are confirmed to be the primary approaches to study the exploration and production of gas hydrates makogon 2010 bavoh et al 2019 babakhani et al 2018 lijith et al 2019 which are simply classified into three categories including the laboratory experiments liu et al 2018 sun et al 2018 theoretical analytical techniques hou et al 2019 hielscher et al 2019 and numerical simulation techniques wang et al 2019 wang et la 2019 for instances lee et al 2019 experimentally studied the inhibition effects of amino acids and ionic liquids on ch4 hydrates they found that ch4 hydrate formation ratio is extremely affected by inhibitors in which ionic liquids show larger inhibition on gas hydrate formation than glycine fu et al 2019 proposed a novel theoretical model to describe the criteria of hydrate removal including the interaction between the particle fluid and particle surface which are validated by experimental works and provide effective tools to evaluate gas transport safety sun et al 2019 proposed the coupled thermo hydro chemo mechanical thcm model to investigate the production of gas with marine hydrates under the depressurization and soil compression their numerical results suggested that the relative permeability between the dissociated and undissociated zones significantly affects the gas flow rate and the gas production decreases with decreasing downhole pressure generally these techniques mentioned above provide effective methods to study the variations transport characteristics and production of gas hydrates and depressurization is validated to be the most promising approach to study flow behaviors during gas production chen et al 2015 chong et al 2016 however there are some inevitable limitations for these techniques for examples classical experiment methods cannot provide the real time behaviors of the hydrates growth theoretical analytical methods may result in errors between the predicted results and the realistic results because the boundary conditions are ideally specified by some simplification hypothesis the defects of numerical simulations are similar to those of the theoretical analytical methods and numerical results may be different from the practical engineering results which is induced by the difference between the constructed models and the realistic geometry topologies in total the flow behaviors and distribution of hydrates are extremely affected by the microstructures of porous mediums more attentions should be paid to the detailed behaviors during hydrate variation and to their effect on flow properties in porous mediums with hydrates which are helpful to improve the production of gas hydrates hydrates significantly affect the flow properties in porous sediments during gas production which are controlled by the permeability hou et al 2018 mahabadi et al 2019 various methods have been successfully implemented to understand the permeability in hydrate bearing reservoirs including direct experimental tests li et al 2018 almenningen et al 2019 and numerical simulations van and genuchten 1980 spangenberg 2001 delli and grozic 2013 katagiri et al 2017 for instances wu et al 2018 experimentally investigated the gas phase permeability of montmorillonite with different hydrate saturations under the effective axial stresses of 1 mpa and 3 mpa their results show that the gas phase permeability first decreases and then increases with increasing gas phase saturation hou et al 2018 numerically studied the hydrate effect on the permeability of hydrate bearing sediments using lattice boltzmann modeling and proposed a new permeability prediction model based on the control seepage channel they found that minerals distributions have no effects on permeability and hydrates significantly affect the permeability in total although direct experiment tests and numerical simulations provide effective tools to study the permeability of hydrate bearing sediments there still exist some limitations the main limitations for direct experiment tests are the limited experiment configuration without natural hydrate bearing sediments and long time demand for hydrate formation weak control of hydrate formation and dissociation and sustaining high pressure and low temperature to keep gas hydrates santamarina et al 2015 priest et al 2015 numerous numerical simulations are limited to the assumed models with regular geometries which may result in errors between the numerical results and realistic results for the hydrate behaviors in porous sediments x ray ct imaging due to the advantages of nondestructive examination nde monitoring the real time behaviors of materials visualized inter microstructures are rapidly applied to study the pore scale flow properties based on extracted pore network models wang et al 2016 zhao and zhou 2019b mahabadi et al 2016 studied the residuary water phase and relative permeability in hydrate baring sediments by x ray ct images and pore network simulations their results show that gas permeability decreases with increasing hydrate phase saturation which has marginal effect on water permeability in sediments with uniform distribution of hydrates mohammadmoradi et al 2018 proposed a direct three phase pore network simulation to study hydrate behaviors and permeability of hydrate bearing sediments in which the numerical fluid occupancy profiles absolute permeability and hydraulic tortuosity well agree with experimental datasets liu et al 2019 proposed novel fractal models to study the permeability of hydrate bearing sediments by x ray ct imaging and pore network simulations in which the relative gas permeability increases and relative water permeability decreases during gas production from hydrate reservoirs thus it can be concluded that x ray ct imaging techniques are effective tools to understand the transport properties of porous sediments with hydrates however previous works mainly focused on the hydrate behaviors in models with simple pore geometries or coarse pores and few works report the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates in microstructures with fine grains which is helpful to the long term production of natural gas hydrates in fine grained sediments the primary objectives of this paper are to provide microstructural evolution of the formation migration and dissolution and to study the effect of the hydrates on the pore scale permeability color difference phase separation method cdps is proposed to accurately segment the hydrate pore and grain phases moreover the spatial distribution of hydrates in microstructures is investigated based on the extracted hydrate phase and the corresponding flow properties are analyzed compared with the previous works the main novelties of this work are 1 the accurate hydrate phase extraction by the proposed color difference phase separation method in microstructures 2 the microstructural evolution of hydrates behaviors 3 the evaluation of pore scale variables effects on the hydrates variations and 4 the investigation of pore scale hydrates effects on permeability 2 laboratory measurements in this work xenon hydrate growth experiments and x ray computed tomography ct imaging experiments are conducted to investigate the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates in sand pack specimens at microscale 2 1 experimental materials and specimen description firstly an aluminum specimen vessel φ8 6 mm 40 mm consisting of the stainless steel spring inlet and outlet spacers with stain steel sieves is cleaned by deionized water as shown in fig 1 c then sand pack with average particle diameter of 0 71 mm is filled in the aluminum specimen vessel finally the 10 wt nabr brine is prepared to saturate the sand pack specimen and the xenon gas is collected in the aluminum accumulator fig 2 b to form hydrates in sand pack specimen the whole measurement apparatus consists of the hydrate formation devices and the x ray ct imaging apparatus as shown in fig 1a 2 2 experimental configurations hydrates formation experiment is completed under conditions of the temperature of 23 1 c the pressure of 35 3 7 mpa and excess xenon gas ohgaki et al 2000 tishchenko et al 2005 fig 1b shows the device for the preparation of hydrate sand pack specimen which consists of the aluminum xenon gas accumulator the pressure gauge the neddle valve and the aluminum specimen vessel x ray ct imaging tests are conducted to capture hydrate behaviors in microstructures of sand pack samples by x ray ct scanner and detector as shown in fig 1a the scanning voltage and electricity are respectively 85kv and 300μa and the voxel spatial resolution of the x ray ct images is 28 77 μm the details for the experiment process are described as follows 1 the aluminum specimen vessel is cleaned by deionized water then dried and finally sand pack with average particle diameter of 0 71 mm is filled in the aluminum specimen vessel to prepare the sand pack specimen 2 the well prepared dry sand pack specimen is scanned by the x ray ct scanner and applied to measure the porosity and absolute permeability by the ap608 automated pemeameter porosimeter 3 10 wt nabr brine is first applied to saturate the sand pack specimen to the bulk saturation of 65 and xenon gas is then injected and circulated to the aluminum specimen vessel from inlet spacer to decrease its water saturation with increasing xenon gas the internal pressure reaches the peak value and varies between 3 5mpa and 3 7 mpa the phase equilibrium pressure is 1 75 mpa 4 during the hydration variation process the permeability of sand pack specimen in aluminum specimen vessel with two spacers are rapidly calculated based on recording pressure gradient and core flood flux wang et al 2018 once the internal pressure is stabilized the sand pack specimen is scanned again and the porosity with the excluding of hydrates is measured by the ap608 automated pemeameter porosimeter 1363 x ray ct images with the scale of 303 303 pixels are respectively obtained for dry sand pack specimen without hydrate and wet sand pack specimen with hydrates to save the memory space and to improve the computing efficiency these x ray ct images are cropped to the scale of 200 200 pixels the detailed laboratory parameters of the sand pack material are listed in table 1 3 evaluation for microstructural properties hydrates e g methane hydrates are usually stored in microstructures of underground soils or rock reservoirs the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates are quite complicated at microscale therefore to well declare the variations of hydrates in microstructures x ray ct imaging is applied to obtain the accurate information of different phases and color difference phase separation approach is proposed to accurately separate the hydrate phase from the pore phase and grain phase 3 1 pore hydrate grain phases separation in fact different phases in x ray ct images are usually represented by different gray intensity from 0 black to 255 white however the recognition range to the gray intensity by human vision is limited to only a few dozen abidi et al 2006 some tiny component phases with weak and similar gray intensities are feasible to be ignored moreover the classical algorithms such as the ostu s segmentation otsu 1979 the watershed segmentation bieniek and moga 2000 and the double threshold segmentation zhao and zhou 2019a b methods are not applicable to the separation of multiphase materials with hydrates due to their limitations on the two phase separation of pore and grain phases in addition the hydrate phase and water phase with similar gray intensity are difficult to extract from the pore phase in multiphase materials with hydrates by using the classical methods which may result in the overestimation or underestimation of the hydrate phase thus the color difference phase separation method is developed in this work to accurately capture the hydrate pore and grain phase firstly the histograms of gray intensities from the x ray ct images are computed by 1 h gf i 0 255 π f x y f u i f u i i i 0 255 where h gf denotes the histogram of the gray intensity f x y for each pixel denotes the counter function and f u i represents the unique gray intensity from 0 to 255 thus the histograms of x ray ct images from the dry sand pack specimens fig 2a and hydrate sand pack specimens fig 2d can be computed and are plotted in fig 2b and e obviously the information of pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase are concluded in these histograms to accurately segment these phases without overestimation and underestimation the gray intensities at peak point 1 and peak point 2 for dry sand pack specimen and the gray intensity at peak point 3 for hydrate sand pack specimen are respectively determined by 2 d h gf df f 0 f t 1 o r f t 2 o r f t 3 d h gf df t 1 0 d h gf df t 1 0 d h gf df t 2 0 d h gf df t 2 0 d h gf df t 3 0 d h gf df t 3 0 where t i i 1 2 3 represents the corresponding gray intensity at peak point 1 and peak point 2 in x ray ct images from dry sand pack specimen and the gray intensity at peak point 3 in x ray ct images from hydrate sand pack specimen respectively then to highlight the hydrate phase and some tiny component phases with weak and similar gray intensity e g the pore and gas phase in fig 2f the original gray intensity image is converted to the color difference image by 3 i cor i 1 p n f x y f c i rgb x 1 n y 1 n f x y x 1 n y 1 n f c r i x y r f x y f c g i x y g f x y f c b i x y b f x y where i cor denotes the color difference mapping with the color pixel f c i in the i th sub pore p n is the number of sub pores rgb represents the transform functions for the red channel r the green channel g and the blue channel b and f c r i f c g i and f c b i respectively denote the transformed three channel values for any color pixel the color difference images are computed and plotted in fig 2c for dry sand pack specimens and in fig 2f for hydrate sand pack specimens it is easy to differentiate the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase in these colored images based on their colorbars thus the color threshold values to differentiate the pore hydrate and grain phases in the color images are computed by 4 i cor f k f c i i cor f k 1 f c i 0 f m a x f c i t c 1 f dry t c 2 f hydrate where f k denotes the any color pixel in the color image t c 1 and t c 2 are the color pore phase and hydrate threshold with the value of f dry and f hydrate respectively next to avoid the overestimation or underestimation of the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase the segmentation thresholds for these phases are computed by 5 t p y y t 1 t 2 t c 1 t h y 255 t 3 t c 2 where y denotes the average function t p and t h are the pore phase and hydrate phase segmentation threshold respectively finally once these segmentation thresholds are determined the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase can be respectively segmented by 6 s e b x 1 n y 1 n f x y p x y h x y g x y p x y x 1 n y 1 n f x y 0 f 0 t p h x y x 1 n y 1 n f x y 1 f t p t h g x y x 1 n y 1 n f x y 2 f t h 255 where s e b denotes the segmented image consisting of the pore phase matrix p x y the hydrate phase matrix h x y and the grain matrix g x y fig 3 shows an example of the segmented ct image with different phases fig 3a show the segmented image with pore phase black and grain phase white for dry sand pack specimen fig 3b shows the segmented image with pore hydrate phase black and grain phase white for hydrate sand pack specimen fig 3c shows the segmented hydrate phase and its color representation with different morphology size of hydrate phase is plotted in fig 3d 3 2 definition for pore scale variables the pore scale properties play extremely significant roles in the formation migration dissolution and storage of hydrates in underground reservoirs therefore to investigate the pore scale variables effect on these properties the pore scale variables are defined to describe the distributions and variations of hydrates in microstructures generally the porosity is defined as the percentage of the void space to total space in this work the porosity is considered as the ratio of the pore phase to the total phases and is expressed as 7 φ dry p x y p x y h x y g x y 100 φ hy p x y h x y p x y h x y g x y 100 φ h h x y p x y h x y g x y 100 where φ dry and φ hy respectively represent the porosity for the dry sand pack specimen and sand pack specimen with hydrates and φ h is the hydrate phase ratio with respect to the size information for different phases they are recommended to be the equivalent radius of the circle or sphere from every sub pore phase sub hydrate phase and sub grain phase for each sub matrix for the pore hydrate and grain phases it is marked by different colors as shown in fig 3d which can be described as 8 p c x y i 1 n 1 f i x y i i n 1 f x y 0 i h c x y j 1 n 2 f j x y j i n 2 f x y 1 j g c x y k 1 n 3 f k x y k i n 3 f x y 2 k where p c x y h c x y and g c x y are respectively the color matrixes for the pore hydrate and grain phase matrixes f i x y f j x y and f k x y denotes the color pixel for the i th j th and k th sub matrixes for the pore hydrate and grain phases respectively thus the size information for the pore hydrate and grain phases can be computed based on these color sub phases of different phases by 9 r p d p i f i x y i π 1 2 r h d p i f i x y j π 1 2 r g d p i f i x y k π 1 2 where r p r h and r g are respectively the radius of the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase and dpi represents the voxel resolution in total based on these defined pore scale variables the distributions and characteristics of hydrates can be investigated and the formation migration and dissolution in microstructures can be well studied 3 3 flow properties evaluation it is easy to find from fig 3a to fig 3d that the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase in microstructures fit the linear relations for the phases in the microstructures from dry sand pack specimens and hydrate sand pack specimens the liner relations can be respectively expressed by 10 φ pore φ grain 1 φ pore φ hydrate φ grain 1 where φ pore φ hydrate and φ grain represent the phase ratio for the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase respectively once the hydrates form and migrate in the microstructures the pore phase is gradually occupied by the hydrates thus the concentration of the hydrates filled stored in the microstructural pores can be computed by 11 s hydrate h x y p x y 100 where s hydrate represents the saturation of the hydrates the pore scale permeability in the hydrate sand pack specimens is one of the most important indexes to describe the formation and migration of hydrates and it changes due to the variations of hydrates filled in the microstructures compared with the dry sand pack specimens the previous works provide excellent relations to determine the pore scale permeability with the invasion of the other phases e g oil and hydrates by kumar et al 2010 dai et al 2014 kang et al 2016 12 k hydrate k n 1 s hydrate 6 20 s hyrate 12 22 1 k n 1 s hydrate 4 62 s hyrate 27 61 2 k n 1 s hydrate e 4 95 s hydrate 3 where k hydrate and k n are the numerical pore scale permeability for hydrate sand pack specimen and numerical absolute permeability for dry sand pack specimen respectively in the pore scale microstructures the absolute permeability is the variable linking to the porosity the grain size and the grain shape factor fs which can be expressed by carman 1956 13 k n fs r g 2 φ n 3 37 5 1 φ n 2 in eq 13 the grain shape factor is equal to the ratio of the area to the volume which is represented by mccabe 2005 tiab and donaldson 2011 14 fs a g v g where a g and v g respectively denote the grain area and volume which can be obtained by pixels and when the grains are equivalent to spheres it equals to 3 r g 4 results and discussions in this works xenon gas and nabr brine 10 wt are firstly used to form hydrates in sand pack specimen then cross sections for dry sand pack specimen and hydrate sand pack specimen are obtained using x ray ct imaging finally hydrate variations in microstructures are analyzed and the flow properties in microstructures with hydrates are investigated 4 1 characterization of hydrate variations once the hydrates form the pore phases are gradually occupied by hydrate phases in each cross section the hydrate phase ratio can be simply estimated by eqs 7 10 and 11 fig 4 shows the color representation of cross sections at equilibrium state converted by eq 3 obviously the gas hydrate ratio changes with the variation of cross section depth in which hydrate phase is represented by yellow and red colors initially the hydrates rapidly form with the increase of xenon gas then the ostwald ripening occurs after one hour and the formed hydrates gradually migrate and dissolve in pore network of sand pack specimen the small hydrate crystals are gradually filled and accumulated in the pore phase from the top to the bottom of the sand pack specimens as the time increases the accumulated hydrates migrate and the gas hydrate ratio decreases with increasing depth as shown in fig 4a c moreover the exchange between the gas hydrates and water hydrates occurs as shown in fig 3d e finally the hydrates in water phase are accumulated in the bottom of the sand pack specimens hydrate distribution is extremely affected by the ostwald ripening as shown in fig 4 to well analyze this phenomenon hydrate phase is separated from the other phases individually fig 5 a and b show 3d microstructures for dry sand pack specimens and hydrate sand pack specimens in which the pore hydrate and grain phases are represented by green red and gray white colors respectively fig 5c shows the distribution of accumulated hydrates in microstructures obviously hydrates increase with increasing depth the gas hydrates gradually accumulates in the pore phase with the growth of the hydrate as shown in figs 5c 1 c 3 when hydrates increase to the saturation of 58 61 the phase change between the gas hydrates and water hydrates occurs as shown in figs 5c 4 c 5 with continuous growth of hydrates gas hydrates are changed to water hydrates as shown in fig 5c 6 in total hydrate growth is extremely affected by the undercooling and over pressurization due to the heat from the exothermic reaction freer et al 2001 which is intuitively declared by the progressive growth of the hydrates in fig 5 moreover water transport plays significant roles in the migration of hydrates due to the capillary pressure between the hydrate surfaces and the water film inks et al 2009 and the color representation in fig 4 and the progressive growth of the hydrates in fig 5 from the x ray ct imaging provide strong evidences for this phenomenon 4 2 pore scale effect on hydrates pore scale variables significantly affect the hydrate distribution and migration in microstructures and the porosity pore size and grain size for dry and hydrate sand pack specimens can be rapidly calculated by eqs 7 and 9 fig 6a c respectively show the relations between depth and numerical porosity pore size and grain size of cross sections from dry and hydrate sand pack specimens in fig 6 a the porosity of pore phase for dry sand pack specimen blue keeps constant with increasing depth nevertheless the porosity of hydrate phase red first increases then nearly decreases to 0 and finally increases with increasing depth implying the formation and migration the interaction between gas hydrate phase and water phase and the conversion from the hydrate in gas phase to the hydrate in water phase moreover the porosity of pore phase for hydrate sand pack specimen green first keeps constant then increases to the maximum and finally decreases with increasing depth which are corresponding with the variation of hydrate phase porosity mentioned above in fig 6b the pore size changes of pore phase for dry sand pack specimen hydrate phase and pore phase for hydrate sand pack specimen are similar to those of porosity because pore size information is determined by the porosity of each phase in fig 6c the grain size of grain phases for dry and hydrate sand pack specimen keeps constant and the latter is slightly larger than the former indicating the accuracy of the proposed method however the gain size changes of hydrate phase are contrary to porosity and pore size of hydrate phase in fig 6a and fig 6b due to the linear relation among the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase in eq 10 this can also evidence the formation and migration the interaction and conversation of hydrates in microstructures shown in fig 4 and fig 5 to detailedly elucidate the pore scale variables effects on hydrate variations relative pore scale variables are defined based on the pore scale variables for dry and hydrate sand pack specimens which are written as 15 φ re φ dry φ hy r rep r p dry r p hy r reg r g dry r g hy where φ re r rep and r reg are respectively the porosity pore and gain size of relative pore phase and relative gain phase figs 4 and 5 illustrate that hydrate formation migration and interaction occur in pore phase fig 6d f respectively show the relations between hydrate behaviors and relative pore scale variables obtained by eqs 9 11 and 16 in which the hydrate behaviors are divided into hydrate formation and migration hydrate interaction and hydrate conversion from gas hydrates to water hydrates based on the pore scale variables variation of hydrate phase with depth fig 6a c the details for hydrate phase conversion from gas phase to water phase can be referred in the previous work subramanian 2000 servio and englezons 2003 lei et al 2019 the close grain sizes for dry black and hydrate red sand pack specimens in fig 6f suggest the accuracy of the proposed method it is easy to find from fig 6d f that hydrate variations are significantly affected by relative pore scale variables during the hydrate migration hydrate saturation green first increases with decreasing relative porosity purple in fig 6d relative pore size purple in fig 6d and relative grain size purple in fig 6d then keep constant with relative stable pore scale variables and finally decreases with decreasing relative pore scale variables in the hydrate interaction hydrate saturation keeps 0 as relative pore scale variables gradually decrease to 0 obviously this is caused by interaction between gas hydrates and water hydrates during the hydrate conversion hydration saturation increases with increasing relative porosity relative pore size and relative grain size due to the conversion from gas hydrates to water hydrates in total relative pore scale variables significantly affect hydrate behaviors in which hydrate saturation first increases with decreasing relative pore scale variables then keep constant with relative stable pore scale variables and finally decreases with decreasing relative pore scale variables during the hydrate migration in the hydrate interaction hydrate saturation keeps 0 as relative pore scale variables gradually decrease to 0 obviously this is caused by interaction between gas hydrates and water hydrates during the hydrate conversion hydration saturation increases with increasing relative porosity relative pore size and relative grain size due to the conversion of gas hydrates to water hydrates 4 3 flow behaviors evaluation permeability is one of the most important indexes to describe the transport properties in various porous materials the migration and dissolution of hydrates change the permeability due to the occupation of pore space by hydrate phase to validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method the errors between the experimental and numerical results are calculated by 16 der de d n de 100 where der de and dn are respectively the error experimental and numerical dataset of porosity permeability for dry sand pack specimen and sand pack specimen with hydrates fig 7 a c respectively show the differences between the experimental data and numerical results for the porosity absolute permeability and pore scale permeability in selected x ray ct images from dry and hydrate sand pack specimens for the porosity in fig 7a the experimental and numerical porosity are respectively 36 7 and 34 7 and the differences between the average experimental porosity and numerical porosity range from 1 63 to 14 17 with the average of 6 57 regarding the permeability in dry sand pack specimen in fig 7b the average experimental and numerical permeability are respectively 390 07d and 421 74d and their differences vary from 0 74 to 22 01 with the average of 8 27 referring to the pore scale permeability of hydrate sand pack specimen in fig 7c the average experimental permeability and numerical permeability are respectively 358 52d and 364 95d and their differences change from 1 53 to 20 18 with the average of 8 53 in brief the average errors between the experimental data and numerical results are all less than 8 6 implying the accuracy of the proposed method therefore it is concluded that the proposed method provides effective tool to evaluate the flow properties in microstructures of porous sediments with hydrates once the permeability is determined pore scale hydrate effects on permeability can be studied fig 7d f respectively show the relations between the hydrate saturation and numerical absolute permeability for dry sand pack and the relations between the hydrate saturation and numerical pore scale permeability for hydrate sand pack considering the hydrate saturation of each x ray ct image from dry and hydrate sand pack specimens the relations between the permeability and hydrate saturation are divided into two parts shydrate less than 10 and shydrate 10 based on the hydrate saturation distribution and the hydrate saturation permeability relations for dry and hydrate sand pack specimens are respectively written as 17 k n 372 71 1932 05 exp s hydrate 0 04 s hydrate 10 r 2 0 43 k n 359 89 224 10 exp 1 s hydrate 16 96 s hydrate 10 r 2 0 68 18 k n 281 22 274 67 exp s hydrate 0 09 s hydrate 10 r 2 0 74 k n 319 61 2774 48 exp s hydrate 5 23 s hydrate 10 r 2 0 79 for the permeability in dry sand pack specimen in fig 7d and eq 17 the correlation coefficients are respectively 0 43 and 0 68 for x ray ct images with hydrate saturation less than and large than equal to 10 showing bad relations between the permeability and hydrate saturation in dry sand pack specimen when there are not external hydrate phase permeability is only the intrinsic property of porous materials related to void space referring to the pore scale permeability of hydrate sand pack specimen in fig 7e and eq 18 the correlation coefficients are respectively 0 74 and 0 79 for x ray ct images with hydrate saturation less than and large than equal to 10 obviously the correlation coefficients for the latter are larger than those for the former moreover it is easy to find that the permeability decreases with increasing hydrate saturation in porous sediments showing the inhibition of permeability by hydrates in addition it is easy to find from fig 7a c that the average experimental 358 52d and numerical 364 95d permeability for hydrate sand pack specimen are smaller than the average experimental 390 07d and numerical 421 74d permeability for dry sand pack specimen implying the inhibition of permeability by pore scale hydrates in porous sediments in total it is concluded that the average errors between the experimental data and numerical results are all less than 8 6 implying that the accuracy of the proposed method hydrates can decrease the permeability in porous sediments due to the occupation of the pore space by hydrates and the permeability decreases with increasing hydrate phase in porous sediments 5 summaries and conclusions in this work hydrates are formed using xenon and 10 wt nabr brine and x ray ct experiments are conducted to analyze the variation of hydrates in microstructures and to investigate their effects on flow properties color difference phase separation approach is proposed to accurately capture the hydrate pore and grain phases pore scale variables to describe the distribution of hydrates are defined and their effects on microstructural flow properties are investigated the primary conclusions are drawn as follows 1 hydrate formation and x ray ct imaging experiments provide the visualized real time information of the hydrates variations the pore phase hydrate phase and grain phase information can be well captured by the x ray ct imaging techniques thus the formation migration and dissolution process can be well studied 2 the proposed color difference phase separation method can not only be applied to segment the pore hydrate and gain phases but also is effective to evaluate the distribution of hydrates in the microstructures from porous sediments with the aid of x ray ct imaging techniques which are helpful to understand the formation migration and dissolution of hydrates 3 by the x ray ct imaging analysis the growth interaction between hydrates in gas and water phase and the dissolution can be well observed and studied and direct visualized evidences are provided for the changes of hydrates in microstructures of sediments relative pore scale variables significantly affect hydrate behaviors in which hydrate saturation first increases with decreasing relative pore scale variables then keep constant with relative stable pore scale variables and finally decreases with decreasing relative pore scale variables during the hydrate migration in the hydrate interaction hydrate saturation keeps 0 as relative pore scale variables gradually decrease to 0 obviously this is caused by interaction between gas hydrates and water hydrates during the hydrate conversion hydration saturation increases with increasing relative porosity relative pore size and relative grain size due to the conversion of gas hydrates to water hydrates 4 the average errors between the experimental data and numerical results are all less than 8 6 implying that the accuracy of the proposed method hydrates can decrease the permeability in porous sediments due to the occupation of the pore space by hydrates and the permeability decreases with increasing hydrate phase in porous sediments author contributions section 1
