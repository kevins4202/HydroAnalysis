13975,the present work reports the efficacy of three coagulants cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 both salt mixed in 1 1 ratio v v for treatment of wastewater from effluent treatment plant of petroleum refinery using coagulation and flocculation process the independent parameters such as ph and dosage of coagulants were optimized using response surface methodology with central composite design technique considering final ph reduction in cod turbidity tds and color as dependent variables the statistical fitness of developed model was checked using anova a second order quadratic model r2 95 was best fitted to develop the relation between independent and dependent variables charge neutralization sweep flocculation adsorption and formation of tribasic copper chloride tbcc were mainly responsible for coagulation and flocculation processes results showed that mixed coagulant cuso4 fecl3 delivered better result than cuso4 and fecl3 individually cuso4 fecl3 along with adsorption and sweep flocculation forms tribasic copper chloride tbcc as a proceeding intermediate in the ph range 5 7 the tbcc formation enhanced the flocculation by destabilizing colloidal and suspended particles due to its catalytic decolorizing and octahedral structural properties maximum reduction in cod 76 77 turbidity 89 47 tds 94 16 and color 95 29 was observed at ph 7 12 and 0 20 g l dosage of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the final ph of solution at optimum condition for all three coagulants was under the disposal limits further the flocs formed are characterized using xps sem and edx analyses to reveal the formation of tbcc as intermediate during the process keywords petroleum refinery wastewater pre treatment coagulation flocculation response surface methodology tribasic copper chloride 1 introduction petroleum refinery effluent pre is wastewater generated from crude oil refining units during the production of fuels and other petrochemical products 1 the pre contains a wide range of contaminants such as oil and grease toxic organic compounds along with harmful metals phenolic compound nitrogen and sulphur containing complexes with varied concentrations 2 3 coelho et al reported that the quantity of pre generated during crude oil processing is 0 4 1 6 times the quantity of the processed crude oil 4 the presence of large amount of colloidal organic and inorganic compounds present in wastewater increases turbidity tds and color of water above the utility limits 5 the highly acidic and alkaline nature of water directly affects the properties of water 5 6 for the disposal of pre the government of india 7 and the world bank group 8 has defined the limits of the parameters ph chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity total dissolved solids tds and color for effluent 9 consequently the appropriate treatment of pre is required for its reuse and disposal 10 various treatment methods used for treating pre include coagulation 11 adsorption 12 membrane separation 13 electrochemical method 14 chemical oxidation 15 catalytic wet air oxidation 16 photo catalytic oxidation and biological techniques 17 adsorption physical treatment process with activated carbon is the commonly used method however it is preferred when the spent carbon can be re generated 12 membrane separation process by reverse osmosis phenomena is applied for the removal of inorganic salt organic matters and heavy metal in the wastewater however the method is not compatible due to membrane fouling and high cost of membrane replacement 18 electrochemical method use metal electrodes like boron diamond doped anode ruthenium mixed metal oxide and iron electrode which are quite expensive 19 corrosion of electrode further increases the cost of electrode replacement in chemical oxidation process the large amount of an oxidants such as o3 clo2 cl2 h2o2 is required which are expensive and bounds the application of treatment 20 in terms of scale up photo catalytic oxidation and catalytic wet air oxidation are challenging as these processes requires uv light and high pressure reactor which are expensive and limit the application of these processes at industrial level 21 22 the coagulation and flocculation are cost effective straight forward pre treatment processes which can be extensively used on large scale for the reduction in chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity total dissolved solid tds and color of pre by using cheap metallic salts as coagulants 11 23 24 coagulation is very effective process for reduction of organic matter suspended and colloidal materials which are mainly responsible for higher cod biochemical oxygen demand bod tds turbidity color and ph of wastewater in case of pre specific contaminants are heavy metals high molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons a colloidal particle 0 01 1 Î¼m size in wastewater bears negative charge and the force of attraction in between particles are less than the electrical charge repelling force brownian motion retain the particles in static suspension so colloidal particles cannot be distant by simple sedimentation process in rational time chemical coagulants and flocculants are used for deduction of colloidal and suspended particles in wastewater the flocculation denotes to succeeding collision occur once the destabilized particles after coagulation process are driven towards each other by hydraulic shear force in rapid mixing and flocculation basin consequently the colloids agglomerated and rapidly bridge together with each other and adsorbed over suspended particles to form micro flocs that grow together to make observable floc 23 25 as reported in many studies inorganic metal salts like ferric chloride ferrous sulphate copper sulphate poly aluminium chloride etc have been used as coagulants for the treatment of wastewater by several researchers 26 27 when metal salts dissolve in water metal ion hydrates and hydrolysed species these species entrap the colloidal particles by three different mechanisms charge neutralisation adsorption and sweep flocculation 10 11 28 hossam et al 29 reported that coagulation process can lower the turbidity to 1 8 ntu by ferric chloride compared to aluminium sulphate lime and ferrous sulphate at optimal initial ph of 8 6 coagulation and flocculation was also investigated by carlos et al 28 using jar test for petroleum refinery effluent from a portuguese plant by using pax 18 17 al2o3 aluminium sulphate and ferrous sulphate with flocculent nalco 71 408 as coagulants they reported ph as the controlling factor for efficient cod toc and turbidity removal the combination of pax 18 28 6 mg l and nalco 4 5 mg l achieve 80 efficiency for cod toc and turbidity at ph ranging from 6 0 7 0 berrin et al 30 experimentally showed centrifugation with coagulation significantly improved the petroleum hydrocarbon removal by 10 14 and turbidity 10 35 respectively by using cat floc k 10 and cat floc t 2 copper salts are reported as better coagulants than iron and aluminium salts parmesh et al 31 reported 76 cod and 78 color reduction by copper sulphate as a coagulant for the treatment of paper and pulp mill effluent abolhassani et al 32 reported copper sulphate showed a better performance in reducing microbial and organic contaminants present in municipal waste latex copper based coagulant in alkaline range forms tribasic copper chloride tbcc which also acts as a decolorizing agent to the best of our knowledge no work has been reported on the use of cuso4 fecl3 cupric sulphate and ferric chloride mixed in 1 1 ratio by volume coagulant in comparison to cupric sulphate and ferric chloride coagulants individually for wastewater collected from the effluent treatment plant of petroleum refinery in addition dependent variables like final ph cod turbidity tds and color are optimized in the selected range of variation in independent variable like ph and dosage of coagulant by response surface methodology and analysis of variance the efficient execution of the coagulation flocculation treatment method depends upon the selection of appropriate independent variables for an optimum result the conventional method of optimization where one independent variable is varied at a time keeping other variable constant is time consuming since multiple numbers of experiments has to perform to get the optimum condition also interaction effect of independent variables and collaborated analysis between enormous no of independent and dependent variables becoming difficult for accurate optimization 33 response surface methodology rsm is an efficient way to for the optimization of independent variables and their responses collectively and is used in different processes to achieve the highest efficiency the rsm reduces the number of experiments significantly and has the ability to study a large number of parameters as well as interaction between them 34 analysis of variance anova provides the statistical results and diagnostic checking test which researchers use to evaluate the adequacy of the models 35 in this study the potential and the effective pre treatment of pre was investigated by coagulation and flocculation process using cupric sulphate ferric chloride and the mixture of cupric sulphate and ferric chloride in the ration of 1 1 by volume the experiment stratagem of rsm design with central composite design ccd technique was used for optimization and effectively built models for the process independent variables in terms of their effect on dependent variables the percentage reduction in cod turbidity tds color and ph was observed before and after the experiments the two factors ph dosage and the five responses final ph cod turbidity tds and color were used for the statistical design for optimum conditions in addition the nature of flocs formed is analysed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray edx analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of wastewater sample petroleum refinery effluent pre was collected from the flow equalization tank of the effluent treatment plant etp from petroleum refinery situated in northern india the etp wastewater was mainly drained from the cooling and cleaning processes during various operations of petroleum refining the collected wastewater was mixed with concentrated h2so4 2 ml l and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to preclude the photo catalyzed change in the pre composition the wastewater characteristics as listed in table 1 proposed by the world bank 9 and the environment protection rules 1986 in schedule 1 36 for oil refinery industry were determined for the collected pre samples by the standard methods immediately after the collection of wastewater 37 the stored wastewater sample was used as such in further experiments without any dilution 2 2 chemicals all the chemicals used during the experiments were of analytical reagent ar grade the cupric sulfate ferric chloride anhydrous sodium hydroxide naoh sulfuric acid h2so4 and hydrochloric acid hcl were procured from the fisher scientific mumbai 2 3 analysis of wastewater the cod of the wastewater was determined by the standard closed reflux dichromate method 38 using water testing unit rd125 lovibond india after completion of oxidation the excess amount of reagent is measured photometrically by the photometer system md100 lovibond india samples were centrifuged centrifuge model r 4c remi instruments india to obtain the precipitate after jar test and clear supernatant of the treated wastewater left was used for cod measurement the turbidity measurement was carried out using a turbidity meter its 1000 iso tech india the ph and total dissolved solids tds measurements were carried out by the multi meter real time data logger system its 601 iso tech india the color was analyzed by the colorimeter hi 93727 hanna instruments europe the ph turbidity tds and color of the sample were measured after filtration through filter paper whatman filter paper grade 1 of pore size 11 Î¼m in general there is no relationship between the turbidity and the total suspended particles in untreated wastewater the turbidity tds and color measured after filtration after removal of all the suspended particles increase the efficiency and preciseness of the observed data for calculations 2 4 calculation of g value g value is the root mean square velocity gradient which is defined by camp stein for flocculation 39 as follows g w Î¼ where w dissipation function n m2 s dissipated power per unit volume p v v volume of flocculation tank m3 Î¼ absolute viscosity a good precise protocol for centrifugation is to use the g value rather than rpm because the rotor size might differ and the g value will be differ while the rpm stay the same the role of power number is beneficial for a specific impeller and tank geometry the scale up of the pilot systems is conceivable with the same power number if geometrical similarity is maintained g is not the universal constant mainly depend upon the type of chamber kind of fluid flow and devices for rotating blades axial flow type of flocculation devices power consumed is given by leentwar ywema 39 40 as follows p Ï Ï n3 d5 n m s where p power consumed by device Ï dimensionless power number Ï liquid density kg m3 n mixer rotational speed revolution per second d diameter of mixer impeller m therefore g is related to power number by 39 g Ï Ï n 3 d 5 v Î¼ s 1 the ratio of g values at different rpms such as 200 and 30 is calculated named gr gr g1 g2 where g1 g value at 200 rpm g2 g value at 30 rpm 2 5 analysis of flocs formed after coagulation and flocculation the elemental composition and chemical state of the flocs formed during the coagulation and flocculation process in terms of their binding energy were determined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps model k alpha thermoscientific india the scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray edx analyzer quanta 450 fei edax usa was used to examine the surface morphology and to detect the elements present on the surface of flocs formed during the coagulation and flocculation 2 6 experimental design and data analysis the rsm with ccd technique was applied to optimize the process parameters the ph coded as a and coagulant dosage coded as b were selected as independent variables while final ph variation cod turbidity tds and color reduction were selected as dependent variables for statistical data analysis the design expert software version 11 was used the range of independent variables for three coagulants cupric sulphate ferric chloride and 1 1 ratio v v mixture of cupric sulphate and ferric chloride cuso4 fecl3 were selected based on the basis of preliminary experiments performed for cod reduction by each coagulant these preliminary experiments were performed at ph ranging from 3 to 13 and dosage ranging from 0 15 0 95 g l keeping rest of the parameters such as rpm and time as constant and the respective data are given in table s1 s3 supplementary material based on cod reduction the range of independent variables ph and coagulant dosage for all three types of coagulants was selected as mentioned in table 2 the ccd full factorial design gives thirteen experiments for each coagulant according to the eq 1 41 covering four factorial points 2n four axial points 2n and five replicated centre points nc the central point varied in between 3 10 which helped in predicting the experimental error and data reproducibility 1 n 2n 2n nc 4 4 5 13 where n is the total number of experimental runs that has to be performed and n is the number of independent variables once the range of independent variable for each coagulant was incorporated with design expert software the set of different experimental conditions was obtained which is provided as the experimental design matrix table 3 the experiments were performed at these set of conditions and incorporated in design expert software as actual dependent variables three levels were set for both ph a and dosage b such as 1 minimum 0 central 1 maximum for each coagulant after performing the experiment the general correlation between the independent variables ph dosage and response variables final ph cod turbidity tds and colour was acquired as 2 y f x1 x2 x3 xn where y represents the response of dependent variable f is the function relates response to independent variables and x1 x2 x3 xn is the n independent variables that affect the response the quadratic second order polynomial equation was then suggested by the anova technique which was used for establishing the relation between independent and dependent variables and is expressed as 3 y Î² 0 i 0 n Î² i x i i 1 n Î² i i x i 2 i 1 n 1 j i 1 n Î² i j x i x j e where y Î² 0 Î² i Î² ii Î² ij are the predicted response the constant regression coefficient the linear coefficient the quadratic coefficient and the interaction coefficient respectively and xi xj are coded values of the independent variables the regression analysis and anova were applied to study the statistical fitness of developed model at 95 confidence level using design expert software the experimental data sets were evaluated with several variables like p value f value degree of freedom df determination coefficient r2 adjusted determination of coefficient r a d j 2 adequate precision ap standard deviation sd and coefficient of variance cv to check the statistical fitness of the model f value describe the variation in responses which can be verified by regression equation whereas p value ascertain the statistical fitness of the developed model for a model to be significant p value should be less than 0 05 and p value for lack of fit test should be greater than 0 05 34 the r2 coefficient determines the proportion of total variation in response which indicates the ratio of sum of squares due to regression ssr to the total sum of square sst r2 varies from zero to one for satisfactory and desirable quadratic model equation of the experimental data r2 coefficient is preferred closed to 1 42 adequate precision ap greater than 4 indicates adequate model perception ap is used for comparing the range of the predicted values at design point to average predicted error 33 43 the predicted vs actual values plot and three dimensional 3d rsm plot were used to investigate the optimum condition of responses stimulated by the varied independent variables a cv indicates the experimental reliability and precision 44 2 7 experimental setup and the process the coagulation and flocculation process was executed by jar test apparatus ik 155 ikon india with an inserted rectangular paddle blade 2 paddle blade of dimensions 0 05m 0 02m x 0 0072 m in impeller jar test is aimed to remove the non settable suspended and colloidal matter from the effluent which leads to the reduction of cod turbidity tds and color the experiments were performed at the set of conditions provided by the design expert software as mentioned in table 3 considering ph and dosage as independent variables rest of the parameters such as rapid and slow mixing rpm revolutions per minute and settling time were selected from the literature 6 11 24 accordingly the coagulation during jar test operation was performed for 5 min at 200 rpm using rapid mixing and flocculation was performed for 20 min at slow mixing speed of 30 rpm followed by the 45 min settling time the similar procedure was followed for all three coagulants separately the final supernatant obtained after centrifugation has subjected to cod analysis the supernatant after the filtration by the whatman filter paper of pore size 11 Î¼m was used for the analysis of ph turbidity tds and colour all the experiments were performed twice and average value has been reported 3 result and discussion 3 1 statistical analysis the response surface methodology rsm is used for the procurement of collaborative optimum result for two independent variables ph and dosage and five dependent variables final ph cod turbidity tds and color reduction analyses of the effect of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants by coagulation flocculation for pre the ccd legitimated the development of mathematical equation shown in table 4 where predicted response y were assessed as a function of ph a and coagulant dosage b and was calculated as the sum of a constant two first order coefficient in terms of a and b one interaction effect ab and two second order effects a2 and b2 according to eq 3 the mathematical equations obtained from anova were used to analyse the goodness of fit 3 2 effect of coagulants on final ph relation between the predicted and experimental values of final ph for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants is shown in fig 1 a fig 2 a fig 3 a respectively the graphs clearly shows that both actual and predicted values of the response are in close agreement which interprets that the model developed for final ph is well matched to form a relationship among independent and dependent variables during coagulation and flocculation processes the value of co relation coefficient r2 for response final ph in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 0 9972 0 9800 and 0 9937 respectively and showed a reliable relation between dependent and independent variables this also elucidated that the total variation explained by the developed model was 99 72 98 and 99 37 and there might be 0 28 2 and 0 63 of the total variation that cannot be explained by the developed model the r a d j 2 for response final ph for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 0 9952 0 9657 and 0 9892 which were very close to r2 value as shown in table 4 thus the prediction of experimental data is deliberately satisfactory the relationships developed through anova between independent variables ph a dosage b and dependent variables final ph cod tds turbidity and color reduction for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are presented in table 4 in the form of quadratic equations the positive terms of the equations indicates a favorable effect whereas negative sign indicates the antagonistic effect of each factor for final ph in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the parameters b had more negative effect as compared to ab for all three coagulants while other parameters such as a a2 and b2 had positive effect on the response the significance of independent variable was also evaluated in terms of p and f values for response final ph in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the p value was less than 0 0001 in each case while f value was found to be 496 49 68 59 and 221 82 respectively the ap for response final ph was found to be 64 517 28 9648 and 52 5019 for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants respectively this inferred that the developed response equation can be used within a range defined for designing the model reproducibility is interpreted in terms of coefficient of variance cv and model is considered as reproducible when cv is less than 10 for response final ph in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the cv was 1 39 3 51 and 3 224 respectively justifying very good precision and reliability of the developed model the three dimensional 3d plots of the dependent variable final ph at the optimum condition were obtained to verify dependence of independent variable ph and dosage for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the results are shown in fig 4 a fig 5 a and fig 6 a respectively the response final ph for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants increased with the increases in ph of pre and decreased with the increase in dosage the maximum final ph was attained at high ph and low dosage whereas the lowest final ph was found at low ph and high dosage in case of cuso4 the value of final ph was higher than fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 the range of final ph for fecl3 with an increase in ph and dosage was very small as shown in fig 5 a this might be due to higher acidic nature of ferric chloride solution in water in case of cuso4 fecl3 the final ph was found in between the cuso4 and fecl3 also the final ph in case of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 as coagulant was found in the safe zone for disposal of pre after treatment experimentally it was observed that the ph of 1 0 g l concentration solution for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants were 4 16 1 70 and 2 01 respectively this showed that mixing of coagulant can change the ph of the solution during coagulation process the ph value refers to the number of hydrogen ions present in a medium 45 as described by the precipitation theory of the ions i e metal salt when mixed with water release the metal cations and hydronium ion which consequently makes any medium too acidic 46 the cuso4 in water forms cu 2 and so4 2 ions which are hydrolysed to cuoh cu oh 2 and h3o the release of the hydronium hydrogen ions by hydrolysis is responsible for the acidic nature of the aqueous solution of cuso4 fecl3 in water forms fe oh 2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 h3o and hcl where the formation of hcl and h3o ions makes it highly acidic in nature the mixture cuso4 fecl3 contains both the hcl h3o and so4 2 ions which make it more acidic than cuso4and less acidic than the fecl3 47 according to 3d graph projection of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant in fig 6 a and considering the optimum collaborated value of all dependent variable for all three type of coagulants the cuso4 fecl3 coagulant best among the all at high ph and low dosage in the range selected independent parameters the fecl3 coagulant is not suggested as the coagulant for the treatment of pre due to the highly acidic nature of the coagulant solution as per the government rules of disposal of wastewater in water bodies the ph of wastewater must be lies between 5 9 the range of final ph for fecl3 at all the combination of ph and dosage selected for coagulation process was less than 3 7 therefore it is considered as an acid salt and the wastewater must hold adequate alkalinity natural or added to react with the acid as it forms to sustain the ph within the preferred range for good coagulation and flocculation 3 3 effect of coagulants on cod the relation between the actual and predicted values of cod reduction for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are shown in fig 1 b 2 b and 3 b respectively it can be seen that both actual and predicted values are very close to each other which indicates that the developed model is reliable enough to establish the relationship between dependent and independent variables the r2 a n d r a d j 2 values for cod reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 were found to be 0 9636 0 9674 and 0 9891 and 0 9376 0 9440 and 0 9813 respectively as listed in table 4 the higher values of both r2 a n d r a d j 2 attribute to the excellent and reliable fitting of the developed model the r a d j 2 values are very close to r2 value which signify that the developed model is significant the relationship between independent and dependent variables in the form of quadratic equation for cod reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are given in table 4 for cuso4 the terms b ab a2 and b2 had negative effects while a had a positive effect on the response variable for fecl3 coagulant b ab and a2 had negative effects while a and b2 had positive effects on the response this might be due to increase in cod reduction with increase in ph in range of 7 11 and 3 7 for cuso4 and fecl3 respectively as well as increase in dosage in the range of 0 6 1 2 and 0 2 1 0 g l for cuso4 and fecl3 respectively in case of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant a b and a2 had negative effects however ab and b2 had positive impact on response at ph ranging from 5 to 9 and dosage ranging from 0 2 to 1 0 g l the statistical analysis for cod reduction as mentioned in table 4 showed that for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants f value were noted to be 37 05 68 59 and 126 73 respectively and p value was less than 0 0001 for all three coagulants this revealed that the model developed by anova is well suited to establish the relation between independent and dependent variable for all coagulants the ap measured for cod reduction was 19 4554 19 0979 and 27 2064 for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants respectively and indicated that the developed response equation can be used within a range defined for designing for cod reduction the cv for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 2 64 4 52 and 3 05 indicated the precision and reliability of the response model was very good the r2 p value f value ap and cv for cuso4 fecl3 coagulant was found to be best among the three coagulants by anova and thus it can be attributed that the model developed for cod reduction for cuso4 fecl3 coagulant was more desirable precise and reliable for design purpose the 3d plots for cod reduction at the optimum condition were achieved to examine the effect of independent variables ph and dosage the results for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are shown in fig 4 b 5 b and 6 b respectively for cuso4 fig 4 b the cod reduction increased with the increase in ph while with increase in dosage cod reduction increased up to a maximum value then start decreasing the maximum cod reduction was observed at high ph and low dosage for fecl3 fig 5 b cod reduction was increased with the increase in ph while with the increase in dosage the cod reduction increased in the lower range of ph and decreased in the higher range of ph the optimum cod reduction was obtained at low ph and high dosage however in case of fecl3 the desirable range predicted by the anova was at high ph and low dosage this might be due to parallel and interactive effect of other dependent variables the final ph of solution at lower ph and high dosage became highly acidic in nature which would not be fit for disposal in case of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the reduction in cod first increased with the increase in ph upto 7 after that cod reduction suddenly decreased with dosage in the range of 0 2 1 0 g l with increase in dosage the cod reduction decreased between the ph ranges from 5 to 7 however after ph 9 the cod reduction increased with the increase of dosage the maximum cod reduction was observed around at 7 ph and lower dosage as shown in fig 6 b the maximum cod reduction could be observed by a coagulant at the condition where combined effect of charge neutralization adsorption and sweep flocculation will occur at maximum rates when the metal salts is dissolved in water the metal ion hydrolyzed and hydrated to form mono and polymeric species like moh 2 m oh 2 m2 oh 2 4 m oh 4 5 m oh 3 and m oh 4 when these cations are hydrolyzed the chloride and sulfates ions forms are very soluble and non reactive in solution in the acidic range principally charge neutralization occurs where the negative charge ions present in pre are neutralized with the positively charged metal species the adsorption occurs generally in the alkaline range where the cations of metal ions form an insoluble complex and metal hydroxide having positive charge have large surface area and are amorphous and hydrophobic in nature get attached to the negatively charged anionic particles present in pre the cuso4 fecl3 coagulant in the ph range 4 7 and cuso4 in the alkaline range in presence of chloride ion reacts as per the following reactions respectively 48 49 4 cuso4 h2o cu 2 so4 2 oh h 5 fecl3 h2o fe 3 3cl oh h 6 cuso4 2 fecl3 fe2 so4 3 3cucl2 the naoh present in the pre reacts with cucl2to form cu2 oh 3cl during the coagulation and flocculation process 7 cucl2 3 naoh cu2 oh 3cl 3 nacl if sufficient chloride ions are present in solution hydrolysis of cuso4 with alkali also produces cu2 oh 3cl 48 8 cuso4 3 naoh nacl cu2 oh 3cl 2 na2so4 tribasic copper chloride cu2 oh 3cl tbcc used as a chemical intermediate or proceeding intermediate in industries it is virtually insoluble in water and organic solvents and largely soluble in neutral medium and decomposes above 220 c 49 tbcc is also used as a catalyst 50 photo catalyst and decolorizing agent 51 tbcc has high density and a 3d octahedron edge linked and parallel layered structure 48 52 which enhances the adsorption and settling characteristics in water the maximum cod reduction from eq 7 and 8 for cuso4 fecl3 at lower dosage and ph 7 and cuso4 with alkali coagulant is attributed the formation of tbcc intermediate respectively the speciation diagram of fe iii 53 and cu ii 52 represents the variation in ion formation by coagulant in wastewater the fe 3 ion in acidic medium below ph 5 exists in the form of fe 3 fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 for fecl3 maximum cod reduction at ph 5 0 and dosage 0 2 g l was due to the charge neutralization the cuso4 at ph above 8 exists as cu oh 3 cu oh 4 2 and cu oh 2 the maximum cod reduction in case of cuso4 was attained at ph 11 and dosage 0 74 g l due to adsorption sweep flocculation and the tbcc formation the maximum cod removal observed for cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulant is due to the simultaneous effect of adsorption sweep flocculation and formation of tbcc cuso4 fecl3 coagulant was found to be most effective coagulant among the three coagulants used for coagulation and flocculation process of pre 3 4 effect of coagulants on turbidity the relation between actual and predicted values of response turbidity reduction established by anova for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants is shown in fig 1 c 2 c and 3 c respectively the results showed that actual and predicted values are close to each other for all three coagulants justifying that developed model is reliable enough for predicting the response the value of correlation coefficients r2 and r a d j 2 values for turbidity reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are 0 9796 0 9951 and 0 9887 and 0 9650 0 9915 and 0 9806 respectively this suggests the unfailing relation between the dependent and independent variables the quadratic relationship established between independent ph a dosage b and dependent variable turbidity reduction for coagulants cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 are shown in table 4 for cuso4 the parameters b and ab had negative effect on the turbidity reduction while parameters a a2 and b2 had a positive effect on turbidity reduction in case of fecl3 parameters ab and a2 had a negative effect and a b and b2 had positive effect on the turbidity reduction for cuso4 fecl3 as coagulant a and a2 had negative effect however parameters b ab b2 had a positive effect on the turbidity reduction the anova confirmed that for turbidity reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the p value is less than 0 0001 for all coagulants and f value is 67 24 281 78 and 122 02 respectively this signifies that the model developed by anova is appropriately applicable the ap measured for response in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 19 117 41 0969 and 28 8259 respectively this indicates that developed model can be used within a well defined array for designing the cv for turbidity reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 3 07 1 80 and 1 92 respectively which indicated that precision and reliability of the response model was actually upright fig 4 c 5 c and 6 c show the 3d response surface plots for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants it was investigated to study the effect of change in independent variable on dependent variables turbidity measured in terms of scattering of light caused by both inorganic colloids and organic matter present in pre the electrical charge of inorganic colloids in wastewater form adsorption and desorption surface for anions cations and all other charged materials 54 in addition turbidity of pre might be due to colored particle dissolved in pre in coagulation and flocculation process the coagulant treatment breaks the colloidal suspension of anions and cations present in pre though brownian movement 11 55 this attributed to decrease in the turbidity of pre by any or combined effect of neutralization adsorption and sweep flocculation the combined effect of ph and dosage were studied for all three coagulants for cuso4 the turbidity reduction first decreased up to certain value with increase in ph and dosage and then started increasing on further increase in ph and dosage the turbidity reduction was optimum at high ph and at all defined range of dosage for cuso4 on the other hand opposite trend with respect to cuso4 for turbidity reduction was observed in case of fecl3 with the increase in ph the turbidity reduction initially increased and then after certain ph it decreased however the dosage variation reflected the opposite trend the effect of change in dosage variation for fecl3 was minimal the maximum turbidity removal was observed above ph 5 in the defined range for cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the turbidity reduction decreased with increase in ph while it increased with increase in dosage from speciation diagram it can be observed that cuso4 above ph 9 and fecl3 above ph 5 forms the metal salt such as m oh x 0 and m oh x ions m cu 2 and fe 3 this salt formation attributed to maximum turbidity reduction through adsorption and sweep flocculation leaving the charge neutralization less effective for pre thus the organic and inorganic compounds present in pre were removed principally by adsorption and sweep flocculation for cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the range of ph for major turbidity reduction was from 5 to 8 which were in between the other two coagulants cuso4 and fecl3 the tbcc formed in case of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 as coagulants enhanced the turbidity reduction due to its tendency to form larger floc size and its decolorizing properties 3 5 effect of coagulants on tds reduction for tds reduction the relation between actual and predicted values for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 are presented in figs 1 d 2 d and 3 d respectively the close agreement between actual and predicted values showed that the developed model is reliable enough to establish the relation between independent and dependent variables the value of correlation coefficients r2 and r a d j 2 values for tds reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are 0 9645 0 9734 and 0 9762 and 0 9391 0 9544 and 0 9592 respectively this suggests the unfailing relation between the dependent and independent variables the quadratic relationship established between independent ph a dosage b and dependent variable tds reduction for coagulants cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 are shown in table 4 in case of cuso4 the parameters a b and b2 had a negative influence while ab and a2 had positive influence for fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 the parameters b ab b2 had a negative influence while a and a2 had a positive influence in addition the statistical fitness of developed model for response tds reduction for all three coagulants was also examined by p value f value ap and cv the results are presented in table 4 results show that in every aspect the developed model for tds reduction is reliable and significant total dissolved solid tds is a measurement of inorganic salts organic matter and other dissolved materials in water 1 the 3d plots for turbidity reduction for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are shown in figs 4 d 5 d and 6 d respectively to examine the effect of ph and dosage on tds reduction tds are solids which totally dissolved and forming homogenous mixture for cuso4 tds reduction initially decreased with increase in ph and after ph 9 it increased however with change in dose an opposite trend was observed for tds reduction in neutral and highly basic medium as shown in fig 4 d thus for cuso4 the optimum tds reduction was observed at lower ph and lower dosage this might be attributed to charge neutralization in case of fecl3 the tds reduction increased with the increase in ph and decreased with simultaneous increase in dosage however at higher ph and lower dosage the change in tds reduction was not significant thus for fecl3 the optimum tds reduction was observed at the maximum ph and minimum dosage this might be attributed to adsorption and sweep flocculation phenomena for cuso4 fecl3 tds reduction increased with increase in ph and decreased with increase in dosage of the coagulant thus in case of cuso4 fecl3 the optimal tds reduction was perceived at high ph and low dosage this might be due to higher sweep flocculation and moderate adsorption this attributed again to the formation of tbcc in case of both cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulant causing enhanced aggregation of flocs that boosted the settling of dissolved solid after adsorption and sweep flocculation 3 6 effect of coagulants on colour reduction the actual and predicted values relation analogy suggested by anova for color reduction by cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are shown in figs 1 e 2 e and 3 e respectively the result showed that both actual and predicted values were close to each other justifying the significance of the developed model the correlation coefficients r2 and r a d j 2 of developed model equation in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants were found to be 0 9545 0 9769 and 0 9878 and0 9219 0 9604 and 0 9791 respectively this proposed a reliable relation between the dependent and independent variables the quadratic response between independent and dependent variables for colour reduction is presented in table 4 for colour reduction in case of cuso4 the negative impact was shown by ab while positive impact was shown by a b a2 and b2 in case of fecl3 the negative impact was shown by a and b while positive impact was shown by ab a2 and b2 similarly in case of cuso4 fecl3 the negative impact was shown by a and a2 while positive impact was shown by b ab and b2 in addition the statistical fitness of the developed model for response color reduction for all three coagulants was also examined by p value f value ap and cv the results are presented in table 4 results show that in every aspect the developed model for color reduction is reliable and significant the 3d plots of response color reduction for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 were analyzed to investigate the coupled effect of ph and dosage on color reduction and the results are shown in figs 4 e 5 e and 6 e respectively pre contains high levels of metals inorganic and derived hydrocarbons these high molecular weight compounds are responsible for the dark color of the effluent the color reduction of pre through coagulation and flocculation process was perceived as a result of charge neutralization adsorption and sweep flocculation in case of cuso4 colour reduction increased with increase in ph and dosage the optimum color reduction was observed at maximum ph and dosage in the selected range this might be attributed to adsorption and sweep flocculation for fecl3 initially the color reduction decreased with increase in ph and after ph 5 the color reduction increased while with the increase of dosage the color reduction decreased continuously the optimum color reduction was attained at lower and neutral ph and dosage this revealed that color reduction was observed in highly acidic or neutral medium as a result of charge neutralization of fecl3 in case of cuso4 fecl3 initially the color reduction increased till ph 7 on further increase in ph the color reduction decreased with increase in dosage initially the color reduction decreased after that it starts increasing the optimum color reduction was attained at maximum dosage and nearly at neutral ph 7 thus color reduction of pre was occurred due to charge neutralization adsorption and sweep flocculation phenomena however in case of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 the formation of tbcc abruptly reduced the color since it act as a decolorizing agent 3 7 process optimization thirteen experiments for each coagulant separately have been performed according to the set of conditions provided by the design expert software as mentioned in experimental design matrix table 3 the optimum value of independent variable for each coagulant was obtained for all five response variables for a defined range of independent variables and constraints over each response variable as mentioned in table 5 the optimum conditions for all three coagulants considering all the response variables in their predefined goal table 4 simultaneously are presented in table 6 it would be appropriate to mention that there might be other optimum conditions if we consider one response variable at a time however in the present study all five response variables are considered at the same time to determine the optimum value of independent variable the optimum condition for cuso4 was found to be dosage 0 74 g l and ph 11 and for fecl3 it was dosage 0 20 g l and ph 7 respectively the optimum condition for cuso4 fecl3 was found to be dosage 0 20 g l and ph 7 1 in addition for the validation of optimum condition obtained by anova the experiments were performed at the same optimum conditions and it was found that in each case the error was less than 3 table 6 this clearly revealed that model developed for coagulation and flocculation was in good agreement with the experimental results 3 8 significance of g value the ratio of value of g was calculated to understand the settling velocity gradient parameters in conversion of rpm the calculated value of gr was 17 189 which signifies that in flocculation process the settling of particles at 200 rpm was 17 189 times more than at 30 rpm consequently there should be better removal at 200 rpm however at very high rpm the coagulated flocs may break and became water borne 5 consequently coagulation was performed at 200 rpm and flocculation of particles was performed at low rpm such as 30 3 9 characteristics of coagulation flocs formed by xps sem and edx 3 9 1 xps analysis of flocs xps analysis was employed to examine the chemical shift of the elements from its initial state to the final state after coagulation and flocculation process present study mainly focused on the final elemental state of cupper and iron to understand the mechanism in case of all three coagulants and specially the formation of tbcc in case of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 fig 7 a c represents the xps survey of flocs obtained after coagulation and flocculation using cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 respectively the presence of cu2p3 fe2p cl2p o1 s and s2p elements can be seen in the flocs fig 8 a b displays the cu2p3 and fe2p xps core level spectra of flocs after coagulation and flocculation the binding energy of pure cu i cu ii and cu ii carbonate hydroxide was 933 933 5 and 934 7 ev 56 after coagulation the binding energy of cu2p3 shifted to 935 17 ev for cuso4 while 935 56 ev for cuso4 fecl3 fig 8a this attributes the presence of an additional component of high electron affinity which decreased the electron density near cu as a result binding energy increases the o1 s pure binding energy for o 1 was 529 530 ev and for o 2 it was 532 6 ev 57 in fig 7 a and c the binding energy of o1 s was 532 47 ev which was nearly equal to o 2 this attributes that o1 s was attached with the element of higher electron affinity than the oh bond 58 59 this may reveal that chain structure of tbcc was formed during the process the cl2p spectrum in fig 7 a and c also confirm the chemical shift with binding energy 199 96 ev whereas the binding energy of cl in case of nacl formation was 198 5 199 ev 60 consequently cu cl and o confirm the existence of heavy molecular compound present in flocs formed the fe2p spectrum was studied for fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulant and results are presented in fig 8b the fe ii cation exhibit the pure binding energy peak at 709 8 for fe o bond 61 after coagulation the binding energy of fe2p shifted to 711 3 ev for fecl3 while 713 1 ev for cuso4 fecl3 fig 8b the fe iii cation exhibits the binding energy 711 3 ev 62 this attributed that the fe exist in fe iii state as presented in eq 5 and the charge neutralization phenomena was dominated for the coagulation and flocculation process in case of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the binding energy of fe2p was more than the fe iii state this indicated the formation of fe2 so4 3 as mentioned in eq 6 3 9 2 sem and edx analysis of flocs the results of sem edx analysis of flocs formed during coagulation and flocculation are shown in fig 9 a d the relative abundance of elements existing on the surface of flocs formed is presented in table 7 based on the sem microphotograph the particles of pre formed regular loose and tiny particles of identical shape and size as shown in fig 9 a the sem image of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 are presented in fig 9 b and d in both the cases the compact clustered and large size crystal like structure of flocs can be seen however in case of cuso4 fecl3 the size of crystal are even larger as compare to cuso4 this attributes that adsorption phenomena inter particle bridging and formation of tbcc octahedral crystallites 63 64 are dominant in case of cuso4 fecl3 as compare to cuso4 however in case of fecl3 coagulant the irregular granular units of small size can be been seen in fig 9 c this attributes that small size flocs are settled and the charge neutralization phenomena is dominant in case of fecl3 based on edx analysis 18 elements were detected in which carbon oxygen copper iron sulphur and lead were found in a higher percentage for all three type of flocs table 7 the detection of carbon on the surface of sludge attributed to cod reduction capacity of sludge 11 maximum carbon was found in case of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant at its optimum condition this result is well supported by the efficiency of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant for reduction in percentage of all selected dependent variables 4 conclusion the wastewater collected from the effluent treatment plant of petroleum refinery was treated using coagulation and flocculation process jar test method the copper and iron based coagulants i e cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 1 1 ratio mixture were used for the process the independent process parameters such as ph and coagulant dosage were optimized using response surface methodology with central composite design technique considering final ph reduction in cod turbidity tds and color as dependent variables the optimum condition for cuso4 was found as dosage 0 74 g l and ph 11 with the final ph of 8 46 the reduction in cod turbidity tds and color were as 55 93 97 05 92 28 and 94 20 respectively for fecl3 the optimum condition was dosage 0 20 g l and ph 7 0 with final ph of 3 72 and reduction in cod turbidity tds and color were 53 99 79 35 93 68 and 92 31 respectively in case of cuso4 fecl3 the optimum dosage was found to be 0 20 g l and ph 7 10 with final ph of 5 0 the corresponding reduction in cod turbidity tds and color were 76 77 89 47 94 16 95 29 respectively the mixed coagulant cuso4 fecl3 showed better results for all the dependent variables as compare to the individual cuso4 and fecl3 coagulants the mixed coagulant cuso4 fecl3 along with adsorption and sweep flocculation the formation of tribasic copper chloride tbcc was prominent the tbcc acts as proceeding intermediate in the ph ranging from 5 to 7 tbcc formation enhanced the flocculation process by its catalytic decolorizing and octahedral structural properties cuso4 coagulant in presence of chloride ions and alkali also form tbcc the final ph of solution at the optimum condition for all three coagulants is under the disposal limit the analysis of sem edx and xps indicates the formation of tbcc which helped in enhancing the ability of coagulation and flocculation it may be concluded that mixed coagulant cuso4 fecl3 is well suited for the treatment of pre using coagulation and flocculation process the optimization of the process parameters may increase the process efficiency and reduction in cod turbidity tds and color may enhance the efficiency of secondary treatment of waste water author s name and affiliation 1 dr pradeep

13975,the present work reports the efficacy of three coagulants cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 both salt mixed in 1 1 ratio v v for treatment of wastewater from effluent treatment plant of petroleum refinery using coagulation and flocculation process the independent parameters such as ph and dosage of coagulants were optimized using response surface methodology with central composite design technique considering final ph reduction in cod turbidity tds and color as dependent variables the statistical fitness of developed model was checked using anova a second order quadratic model r2 95 was best fitted to develop the relation between independent and dependent variables charge neutralization sweep flocculation adsorption and formation of tribasic copper chloride tbcc were mainly responsible for coagulation and flocculation processes results showed that mixed coagulant cuso4 fecl3 delivered better result than cuso4 and fecl3 individually cuso4 fecl3 along with adsorption and sweep flocculation forms tribasic copper chloride tbcc as a proceeding intermediate in the ph range 5 7 the tbcc formation enhanced the flocculation by destabilizing colloidal and suspended particles due to its catalytic decolorizing and octahedral structural properties maximum reduction in cod 76 77 turbidity 89 47 tds 94 16 and color 95 29 was observed at ph 7 12 and 0 20 g l dosage of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the final ph of solution at optimum condition for all three coagulants was under the disposal limits further the flocs formed are characterized using xps sem and edx analyses to reveal the formation of tbcc as intermediate during the process keywords petroleum refinery wastewater pre treatment coagulation flocculation response surface methodology tribasic copper chloride 1 introduction petroleum refinery effluent pre is wastewater generated from crude oil refining units during the production of fuels and other petrochemical products 1 the pre contains a wide range of contaminants such as oil and grease toxic organic compounds along with harmful metals phenolic compound nitrogen and sulphur containing complexes with varied concentrations 2 3 coelho et al reported that the quantity of pre generated during crude oil processing is 0 4 1 6 times the quantity of the processed crude oil 4 the presence of large amount of colloidal organic and inorganic compounds present in wastewater increases turbidity tds and color of water above the utility limits 5 the highly acidic and alkaline nature of water directly affects the properties of water 5 6 for the disposal of pre the government of india 7 and the world bank group 8 has defined the limits of the parameters ph chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity total dissolved solids tds and color for effluent 9 consequently the appropriate treatment of pre is required for its reuse and disposal 10 various treatment methods used for treating pre include coagulation 11 adsorption 12 membrane separation 13 electrochemical method 14 chemical oxidation 15 catalytic wet air oxidation 16 photo catalytic oxidation and biological techniques 17 adsorption physical treatment process with activated carbon is the commonly used method however it is preferred when the spent carbon can be re generated 12 membrane separation process by reverse osmosis phenomena is applied for the removal of inorganic salt organic matters and heavy metal in the wastewater however the method is not compatible due to membrane fouling and high cost of membrane replacement 18 electrochemical method use metal electrodes like boron diamond doped anode ruthenium mixed metal oxide and iron electrode which are quite expensive 19 corrosion of electrode further increases the cost of electrode replacement in chemical oxidation process the large amount of an oxidants such as o3 clo2 cl2 h2o2 is required which are expensive and bounds the application of treatment 20 in terms of scale up photo catalytic oxidation and catalytic wet air oxidation are challenging as these processes requires uv light and high pressure reactor which are expensive and limit the application of these processes at industrial level 21 22 the coagulation and flocculation are cost effective straight forward pre treatment processes which can be extensively used on large scale for the reduction in chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity total dissolved solid tds and color of pre by using cheap metallic salts as coagulants 11 23 24 coagulation is very effective process for reduction of organic matter suspended and colloidal materials which are mainly responsible for higher cod biochemical oxygen demand bod tds turbidity color and ph of wastewater in case of pre specific contaminants are heavy metals high molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons a colloidal particle 0 01 1 Î¼m size in wastewater bears negative charge and the force of attraction in between particles are less than the electrical charge repelling force brownian motion retain the particles in static suspension so colloidal particles cannot be distant by simple sedimentation process in rational time chemical coagulants and flocculants are used for deduction of colloidal and suspended particles in wastewater the flocculation denotes to succeeding collision occur once the destabilized particles after coagulation process are driven towards each other by hydraulic shear force in rapid mixing and flocculation basin consequently the colloids agglomerated and rapidly bridge together with each other and adsorbed over suspended particles to form micro flocs that grow together to make observable floc 23 25 as reported in many studies inorganic metal salts like ferric chloride ferrous sulphate copper sulphate poly aluminium chloride etc have been used as coagulants for the treatment of wastewater by several researchers 26 27 when metal salts dissolve in water metal ion hydrates and hydrolysed species these species entrap the colloidal particles by three different mechanisms charge neutralisation adsorption and sweep flocculation 10 11 28 hossam et al 29 reported that coagulation process can lower the turbidity to 1 8 ntu by ferric chloride compared to aluminium sulphate lime and ferrous sulphate at optimal initial ph of 8 6 coagulation and flocculation was also investigated by carlos et al 28 using jar test for petroleum refinery effluent from a portuguese plant by using pax 18 17 al2o3 aluminium sulphate and ferrous sulphate with flocculent nalco 71 408 as coagulants they reported ph as the controlling factor for efficient cod toc and turbidity removal the combination of pax 18 28 6 mg l and nalco 4 5 mg l achieve 80 efficiency for cod toc and turbidity at ph ranging from 6 0 7 0 berrin et al 30 experimentally showed centrifugation with coagulation significantly improved the petroleum hydrocarbon removal by 10 14 and turbidity 10 35 respectively by using cat floc k 10 and cat floc t 2 copper salts are reported as better coagulants than iron and aluminium salts parmesh et al 31 reported 76 cod and 78 color reduction by copper sulphate as a coagulant for the treatment of paper and pulp mill effluent abolhassani et al 32 reported copper sulphate showed a better performance in reducing microbial and organic contaminants present in municipal waste latex copper based coagulant in alkaline range forms tribasic copper chloride tbcc which also acts as a decolorizing agent to the best of our knowledge no work has been reported on the use of cuso4 fecl3 cupric sulphate and ferric chloride mixed in 1 1 ratio by volume coagulant in comparison to cupric sulphate and ferric chloride coagulants individually for wastewater collected from the effluent treatment plant of petroleum refinery in addition dependent variables like final ph cod turbidity tds and color are optimized in the selected range of variation in independent variable like ph and dosage of coagulant by response surface methodology and analysis of variance the efficient execution of the coagulation flocculation treatment method depends upon the selection of appropriate independent variables for an optimum result the conventional method of optimization where one independent variable is varied at a time keeping other variable constant is time consuming since multiple numbers of experiments has to perform to get the optimum condition also interaction effect of independent variables and collaborated analysis between enormous no of independent and dependent variables becoming difficult for accurate optimization 33 response surface methodology rsm is an efficient way to for the optimization of independent variables and their responses collectively and is used in different processes to achieve the highest efficiency the rsm reduces the number of experiments significantly and has the ability to study a large number of parameters as well as interaction between them 34 analysis of variance anova provides the statistical results and diagnostic checking test which researchers use to evaluate the adequacy of the models 35 in this study the potential and the effective pre treatment of pre was investigated by coagulation and flocculation process using cupric sulphate ferric chloride and the mixture of cupric sulphate and ferric chloride in the ration of 1 1 by volume the experiment stratagem of rsm design with central composite design ccd technique was used for optimization and effectively built models for the process independent variables in terms of their effect on dependent variables the percentage reduction in cod turbidity tds color and ph was observed before and after the experiments the two factors ph dosage and the five responses final ph cod turbidity tds and color were used for the statistical design for optimum conditions in addition the nature of flocs formed is analysed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray edx analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of wastewater sample petroleum refinery effluent pre was collected from the flow equalization tank of the effluent treatment plant etp from petroleum refinery situated in northern india the etp wastewater was mainly drained from the cooling and cleaning processes during various operations of petroleum refining the collected wastewater was mixed with concentrated h2so4 2 ml l and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to preclude the photo catalyzed change in the pre composition the wastewater characteristics as listed in table 1 proposed by the world bank 9 and the environment protection rules 1986 in schedule 1 36 for oil refinery industry were determined for the collected pre samples by the standard methods immediately after the collection of wastewater 37 the stored wastewater sample was used as such in further experiments without any dilution 2 2 chemicals all the chemicals used during the experiments were of analytical reagent ar grade the cupric sulfate ferric chloride anhydrous sodium hydroxide naoh sulfuric acid h2so4 and hydrochloric acid hcl were procured from the fisher scientific mumbai 2 3 analysis of wastewater the cod of the wastewater was determined by the standard closed reflux dichromate method 38 using water testing unit rd125 lovibond india after completion of oxidation the excess amount of reagent is measured photometrically by the photometer system md100 lovibond india samples were centrifuged centrifuge model r 4c remi instruments india to obtain the precipitate after jar test and clear supernatant of the treated wastewater left was used for cod measurement the turbidity measurement was carried out using a turbidity meter its 1000 iso tech india the ph and total dissolved solids tds measurements were carried out by the multi meter real time data logger system its 601 iso tech india the color was analyzed by the colorimeter hi 93727 hanna instruments europe the ph turbidity tds and color of the sample were measured after filtration through filter paper whatman filter paper grade 1 of pore size 11 Î¼m in general there is no relationship between the turbidity and the total suspended particles in untreated wastewater the turbidity tds and color measured after filtration after removal of all the suspended particles increase the efficiency and preciseness of the observed data for calculations 2 4 calculation of g value g value is the root mean square velocity gradient which is defined by camp stein for flocculation 39 as follows g w Î¼ where w dissipation function n m2 s dissipated power per unit volume p v v volume of flocculation tank m3 Î¼ absolute viscosity a good precise protocol for centrifugation is to use the g value rather than rpm because the rotor size might differ and the g value will be differ while the rpm stay the same the role of power number is beneficial for a specific impeller and tank geometry the scale up of the pilot systems is conceivable with the same power number if geometrical similarity is maintained g is not the universal constant mainly depend upon the type of chamber kind of fluid flow and devices for rotating blades axial flow type of flocculation devices power consumed is given by leentwar ywema 39 40 as follows p Ï Ï n3 d5 n m s where p power consumed by device Ï dimensionless power number Ï liquid density kg m3 n mixer rotational speed

named gr gr g1 g2 where g1 g value at 200 rpm g2 g value at 30 rpm 2 5 analysis of flocs formed after coagulation and flocculation the elemental composition and chemical state of the flocs formed during the coagulation and flocculation process in terms of their binding energy were determined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps model k alpha thermoscientific india the scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray edx analyzer quanta 450 fei edax usa was used to examine the surface morphology and to detect the elements present on the surface of flocs formed during the coagulation and flocculation 2 6 experimental design and data analysis the rsm with ccd technique was applied to optimize the process parameters the ph coded as a and coagulant dosage coded as b were selected as independent variables while final ph variation cod turbidity tds and color reduction were selected as dependent variables for statistical data analysis the design expert software version 11 was used the range of independent variables for three coagulants cupric sulphate ferric chloride and 1 1 ratio v v mixture of cupric sulphate and ferric chloride cuso4 fecl3 were selected based on the basis of preliminary experiments performed for cod reduction by each coagulant these preliminary experiments were performed at ph ranging from 3 to 13 and dosage ranging from 0 15 0 95 g l keeping rest of the parameters such as rpm and time as constant and the respective data are given in table s1 s3 supplementary material based on cod reduction the range of independent variables ph and coagulant dosage for all three types of coagulants was selected as mentioned in table 2 the ccd full factorial design gives thirteen experiments for each coagulant according to the eq 1 41 covering four factorial points 2n four axial points 2n and five replicated centre points nc the central point varied in between 3 10 which helped in predicting the experimental error and data reproducibility 1 n 2n 2n nc 4 4 5 13 where n is the total number of experimental runs that has to be performed and n is the number of independent variables once the range of independent variable for each coagulant was incorporated with design expert software the set of different experimental conditions was obtained which is provided as the experimental design matrix table 3 the experiments were performed at these set of conditions and incorporated in design expert software as actual dependent variables three levels were set for both ph a and dosage b such as 1 minimum 0 central 1 maximum for each coagulant after performing the experiment the general correlation between the independent variables ph dosage and response variables final ph cod turbidity tds and colour was acquired as 2 y f x1 x2 x3 xn where y represents the response of dependent variable f is the function relates response to independent variables and x1 x2 x3 xn is the n independent variables that affect the response the quadratic second order polynomial equation was then suggested by the anova technique which was used for establishing the relation between independent and dependent variables and is expressed as 3 y Î² 0 i 0 n Î² i x i i 1 n Î² i i x i 2 i 1 n 1 j i 1 n Î² i j x i x j e where y Î² 0 Î² i Î² ii Î² ij are the predicted response the constant regression coefficient the linear coefficient the quadratic coefficient and the interaction coefficient respectively and xi xj are coded values of the independent variables the regression analysis and anova were applied to study the statistical fitness of developed model at 95 confidence level using design expert software the experimental data sets were evaluated with several variables like p value f value degree of freedom df determination coefficient r2 adjusted determination of coefficient r a d j 2 adequate precision ap standard deviation sd and coefficient of variance cv to check the statistical fitness of the model f value describe the variation in responses which can be verified by regression equation whereas p value ascertain the statistical fitness of the developed model for a model to be significant p value should be less than 0 05 and p value for lack of fit test should be greater than 0 05 34 the r2 coefficient determines the proportion of total variation in response which indicates the ratio of sum of squares due to regression ssr to the total sum of square sst r2 varies from zero to one for satisfactory and desirable quadratic model equation of the experimental data r2 coefficient is preferred closed to 1 42 adequate precision ap greater than 4 indicates adequate model perception ap is used for comparing the range of the predicted values at design point to average predicted error 33 43 the predicted vs actual values plot and three dimensional 3d rsm plot were used to investigate the optimum condition of responses stimulated by the varied independent variables a cv indicates the experimental reliability and precision 44 2 7 experimental setup and the process the coagulation and flocculation process was executed by jar test apparatus ik 155 ikon india with an inserted rectangular paddle blade 2 paddle blade of dimensions 0 05m 0 02m x 0 0072 m in impeller jar test is aimed to remove the non settable suspended and colloidal matter from the effluent which leads to the reduction of cod turbidity tds and color the experiments were performed at the set of conditions provided by the design expert software as mentioned in table 3 considering ph and dosage as independent variables rest of the parameters such as rapid and slow mixing rpm revolutions per minute and settling time were selected from the literature 6 11 24 accordingly the coagulation during jar test operation was performed for 5 min at 200 rpm using rapid mixing and flocculation was performed for 20 min at slow mixing speed of 30 rpm followed by the 45 min settling time the similar procedure was followed for all three coagulants separately the final supernatant obtained after centrifugation has subjected to cod analysis the supernatant after the filtration by the whatman filter paper of pore size 11 Î¼m was used for the analysis of ph turbidity tds and colour all the experiments were performed twice and average value has been reported 3 result and discussion 3 1 statistical analysis the response surface methodology rsm is used for the procurement of collaborative optimum result for two independent variables ph and dosage and five dependent variables final ph cod turbidity tds and color reduction analyses of the effect of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants by coagulation flocculation for pre the ccd legitimated the development of mathematical equation shown in table 4 where predicted response y were assessed as a function of ph a and coagulant dosage b and was calculated as the sum of a constant two first order coefficient in terms of a and b one interaction effect ab and two second order effects a2 and b2 according to eq 3 the mathematical equations obtained from anova were used to analyse the goodness of fit 3 2 effect of coagulants on final ph relation between the predicted and experimental values of final ph for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants is shown in fig 1 a fig 2 a fig 3 a respectively the graphs clearly shows that both actual and predicted values of the response are in close agreement which interprets that the model developed for final ph is well matched to form a relationship among independent and dependent variables during coagulation and flocculation processes the value of co relation coefficient r2 for response final ph in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 0 9972 0 9800 and 0 9937 respectively and showed a reliable relation between dependent and independent variables this also elucidated that the total variation explained by the developed model was 99 72 98 and 99 37 and there might be 0 28 2 and 0 63 of the total variation that cannot be explained by the developed model the r a d j 2 for response final ph for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 0 9952 0 9657 and 0 9892 which were very close to r2 value as shown in table 4 thus the prediction of experimental data is deliberately satisfactory the relationships developed through anova between independent variables ph a dosage b and dependent variables final ph cod tds turbidity and color reduction for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are presented in table 4 in the form of quadratic equations the positive terms of the equations indicates a favorable effect whereas negative sign indicates the antagonistic effect of each factor for final ph in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the parameters b had more negative effect as compared to ab for all three coagulants while other parameters such as a a2 and b2 had positive effect on the response the significance of independent variable was also evaluated in terms of p and f values for response final ph in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the p value was less than 0 0001 in each case while f value was found to be 496 49 68 59 and 221 82 respectively the ap for response final ph was found to be 64 517 28 9648 and 52 5019 for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants respectively this inferred that the developed response equation can be used within a range defined for designing the model reproducibility is interpreted in terms of coefficient of variance cv and model is considered as reproducible when cv is less than 10 for response final ph in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the cv was 1 39 3 51 and 3 224 respectively justifying very good precision and reliability of the developed model the three dimensional 3d plots of the dependent variable final ph at the optimum condition were obtained to verify dependence of independent variable ph and dosage for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the results are shown in fig 4 a fig 5 a and fig 6 a respectively the response final ph for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants increased with the increases in ph of pre and decreased with the increase in dosage the maximum final ph was attained at high ph and low dosage whereas the lowest final ph was found at low ph and high dosage in case of cuso4 the value of final ph was higher than fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 the range of final ph for fecl3 with an increase in ph and dosage was very small as shown in fig 5 a this might be due to higher acidic nature of ferric chloride solution in water in case of cuso4 fecl3 the final ph was found in between the cuso4 and fecl3 also the final ph in case of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 as coagulant was found in the safe zone for disposal of pre after treatment experimentally it was observed that the ph of 1 0 g l concentration solution for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants were 4 16 1 70 and 2 01 respectively this showed that mixing of coagulant can change the ph of the solution during coagulation process the ph value refers to the number of hydrogen ions present in a medium 45 as described by the precipitation theory of the ions i e metal salt when mixed with water release the metal cations and hydronium ion which consequently makes any medium too acidic 46 the cuso4 in water forms cu 2 and so4 2 ions which are hydrolysed to cuoh cu oh 2 and h3o the release of the hydronium hydrogen ions by hydrolysis is responsible for the acidic nature of the aqueous solution of cuso4 fecl3 in water forms fe oh 2 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 h3o and hcl where the formation of hcl and h3o ions makes it highly acidic in nature the mixture cuso4 fecl3 contains both the hcl h3o and so4 2 ions which make it more acidic than cuso4and less acidic than the fecl3 47 according to 3d graph projection of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant in fig 6 a and considering the optimum collaborated value of all dependent variable for all three type of coagulants the cuso4 fecl3 coagulant best among the all at high ph and low dosage in the range selected independent parameters the fecl3 coagulant is not suggested as the coagulant for the treatment of pre due to the highly acidic nature of the coagulant solution as per the government rules of disposal of wastewater in water bodies the ph of wastewater must be lies between 5 9 the range of final ph for fecl3 at all the combination of ph and dosage selected for coagulation process was less than 3 7 therefore it is considered as an acid salt and the wastewater must hold adequate alkalinity natural or added to react with the acid as it forms to sustain the ph within the preferred range for good coagulation and flocculation 3 3 effect of coagulants on cod the relation between the actual and predicted values of cod reduction for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are shown in fig 1 b 2 b and 3 b respectively it can be seen that both actual and predicted values are very close to each other which indicates that the developed model is reliable enough to establish the relationship between dependent and independent variables the r2 a n d r a d j 2 values for cod reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 were found to be 0 9636 0 9674 and 0 9891 and 0 9376 0 9440 and 0 9813 respectively as listed in table 4 the higher values of both r2 a n d r a d j 2 attribute to the excellent and reliable fitting of the developed model the r a d j 2 values are very close to r2 value which signify that the developed model is significant the relationship between independent and dependent variables in the form of quadratic equation for cod reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are given in table 4 for cuso4 the terms b ab a2 and b2 had negative effects while a had a positive effect on the response variable for fecl3 coagulant b ab and a2 had negative effects while a and b2 had positive effects on the response this might be due to increase in cod reduction with increase in ph in range of 7 11 and 3 7 for cuso4 and fecl3 respectively as well as increase in dosage in the range of 0 6 1 2 and 0 2 1 0 g l for cuso4 and fecl3 respectively in case of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant a b and a2 had negative effects however ab and b2 had positive impact on response at ph ranging from 5 to 9 and dosage ranging from 0 2 to 1 0 g l the statistical analysis for cod reduction as mentioned in table 4 showed that for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants f value were noted to be 37 05 68 59 and 126 73 respectively and p value was less than 0 0001 for all three coagulants this revealed that the model developed by anova is well suited to establish the relation between independent and dependent variable for all coagulants the ap measured for cod reduction was 19 4554 19 0979 and 27 2064 for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants respectively and indicated that the developed response equation can be used within a range defined for designing for cod reduction the cv for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 2 64 4 52 and 3 05 indicated the precision and reliability of the response model was very good the r2 p value f value ap and cv for cuso4 fecl3 coagulant was found to be best among the three coagulants by anova and thus it can be attributed that the model developed for cod reduction for cuso4 fecl3 coagulant was more desirable precise and reliable for design purpose the 3d plots for cod reduction at the optimum condition were achieved to examine the effect of independent variables ph and dosage the results for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are shown in fig 4 b 5 b and 6 b respectively for cuso4 fig 4 b the cod reduction increased with the increase in ph while with increase in dosage cod reduction increased up to a maximum value then start decreasing the maximum cod reduction was observed at high ph and low dosage for fecl3 fig 5 b cod reduction was increased with the increase in ph while with the increase in dosage the cod reduction increased in the lower range of ph and decreased in the higher range of ph the optimum cod reduction was obtained at low ph and high dosage however in case of fecl3 the desirable range predicted by the anova was at high ph and low dosage this might be due to parallel and interactive effect of other dependent variables the final ph of solution at lower ph and high dosage became highly acidic in nature which would not be fit for disposal in case of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the reduction in cod first increased with the increase in ph upto 7 after that cod reduction suddenly decreased with dosage in the range of 0 2 1 0 g l with increase in dosage the cod reduction decreased between the ph ranges from 5 to 7 however after ph 9 the cod reduction increased with the increase of dosage the maximum cod reduction was observed around at 7 ph and lower dosage as shown in fig 6 b the maximum cod reduction could be observed by a coagulant at the condition where combined effect of charge neutralization adsorption and sweep flocculation will occur at maximum rates when the metal salts is dissolved in water the metal ion hydrolyzed and hydrated to form mono and polymeric species like moh 2 m oh 2 m2 oh 2 4 m oh 4 5 m oh 3 and m oh 4 when these cations are hydrolyzed the chloride and sulfates ions forms are very soluble and non reactive in solution in the acidic range principally charge neutralization occurs where the negative charge ions present in pre are neutralized with the positively charged metal species the adsorption occurs generally in the alkaline range where the cations of metal ions form an insoluble complex and metal hydroxide having positive charge have large surface area and are amorphous and hydrophobic in nature get attached to the negatively charged anionic particles present in pre the cuso4 fecl3 coagulant in the ph range 4 7 and cuso4 in the alkaline range in presence of chloride ion reacts as per the following reactions respectively 48 49 4 cuso4 h2o cu 2 so4 2 oh h 5 fecl3 h2o fe 3 3cl oh h 6 cuso4 2 fecl3 fe2 so4 3 3cucl2 the naoh present in the pre reacts with cucl2to form cu2 oh 3cl during the coagulation and flocculation process 7 cucl2 3 naoh cu2 oh 3cl 3 nacl if sufficient chloride ions are present in solution hydrolysis of cuso4 with alkali also produces cu2 oh 3cl 48 8 cuso4 3 naoh nacl cu2 oh 3cl 2 na2so4 tribasic copper chloride cu2 oh 3cl tbcc used as a chemical intermediate or proceeding intermediate in industries it is virtually insoluble in water and organic solvents and largely soluble in neutral medium and decomposes above 220 c 49 tbcc is also used as a catalyst 50 photo catalyst and decolorizing agent 51 tbcc has high density and a 3d octahedron edge linked and parallel layered structure 48 52 which enhances the adsorption and settling characteristics in water the maximum cod reduction from eq 7 and 8 for cuso4 fecl3 at lower dosage and ph 7 and cuso4 with alkali coagulant is attributed the formation of tbcc intermediate respectively the speciation diagram of fe iii 53 and cu ii 52 represents the variation in ion formation by coagulant in wastewater the fe 3 ion in acidic medium below ph 5 exists in the form of fe 3 fe oh 2 and fe oh 2 for fecl3 maximum cod reduction at ph 5 0 and dosage 0 2 g l was due to the charge neutralization the cuso4 at ph above 8 exists as cu oh 3 cu oh 4 2 and cu oh 2 the maximum cod reduction in case of cuso4 was attained at ph 11 and dosage 0 74 g l due to adsorption sweep flocculation and the tbcc formation the maximum cod removal observed for cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulant is due to the simultaneous effect of adsorption sweep flocculation and formation of tbcc cuso4 fecl3 coagulant was found to be most effective coagulant among the three coagulants used for coagulation and flocculation process of pre 3 4 effect of coagulants on turbidity the relation between actual and predicted values of response turbidity reduction established by anova for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants is shown in fig 1 c 2 c and 3 c respectively the results showed that actual and predicted values are close to each other for all three coagulants justifying that developed model is reliable enough for predicting the response the value of correlation coefficients r2 and r a d j 2 values for turbidity reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are 0 9796 0 9951 and 0 9887 and 0 9650 0 9915 and 0 9806 respectively this suggests the unfailing relation between the dependent and independent variables the quadratic relationship established between independent ph a dosage b and dependent variable turbidity reduction for coagulants cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 are shown in table 4 for cuso4 the parameters b and ab had negative effect on the turbidity reduction while parameters a a2 and b2 had a positive effect on turbidity reduction in case of fecl3 parameters ab and a2 had a negative effect and a b and b2 had positive effect on the turbidity reduction for cuso4 fecl3 as coagulant a and a2 had negative effect however parameters b ab b2 had a positive effect on the turbidity reduction the anova confirmed that for turbidity reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants the p value is less than 0 0001 for all coagulants and f value is 67 24 281 78 and 122 02 respectively this signifies that the model developed by anova is appropriately applicable the ap measured for response in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 19 117 41 0969 and 28 8259 respectively this indicates that developed model can be used within a well defined array for designing the cv for turbidity reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants was found to be 3 07 1 80 and 1 92 respectively which indicated that precision and reliability of the response model was actually upright fig 4 c 5 c and 6 c show the 3d response surface plots for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants it was investigated to study the effect of change in independent variable on dependent variables turbidity measured in terms of scattering of light caused by both inorganic colloids and organic matter present in pre the electrical charge of inorganic colloids in wastewater form adsorption and desorption surface for anions cations and all other charged materials 54 in addition turbidity of pre might be due to colored particle dissolved in pre in coagulation and flocculation process the coagulant treatment breaks the colloidal suspension of anions and cations present in pre though brownian movement 11 55 this attributed to decrease in the turbidity of pre by any or combined effect of neutralization adsorption and sweep flocculation the combined effect of ph and dosage were studied for all three coagulants for cuso4 the turbidity reduction first decreased up to certain value with increase in ph and dosage and then started increasing on further increase in ph and dosage the turbidity reduction was optimum at high ph and at all defined range of dosage for cuso4 on the other hand opposite trend with respect to cuso4 for turbidity reduction was observed in case of fecl3 with the increase in ph the turbidity reduction initially increased and then after certain ph it decreased however the dosage variation reflected the opposite trend the effect of change in dosage variation for fecl3 was minimal the maximum turbidity removal was observed above ph 5 in the defined range for cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the turbidity reduction decreased with increase in ph while it increased with increase in dosage from speciation diagram it can be observed that cuso4 above ph 9 and fecl3 above ph 5 forms the metal salt such as m oh x 0 and m oh x ions m cu 2 and fe 3 this salt formation attributed to maximum turbidity reduction through adsorption and sweep flocculation leaving the charge neutralization less effective for pre thus the organic and inorganic compounds present in pre were removed principally by adsorption and sweep flocculation for cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the range of ph for major turbidity reduction was from 5 to 8 which were in between the other two coagulants cuso4 and fecl3 the tbcc formed in case of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 as coagulants enhanced the turbidity reduction due to its tendency to form larger floc size and its decolorizing properties 3 5 effect of coagulants on tds reduction for tds reduction the relation between actual and predicted values for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 are presented in figs 1 d 2 d and 3 d respectively the close agreement between actual and predicted values showed that the developed model is reliable enough to establish the relation between independent and dependent variables the value of correlation coefficients r2 and r a d j 2 values for tds reduction in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are 0 9645 0 9734 and 0 9762 and 0 9391 0 9544 and 0 9592 respectively this suggests the unfailing relation between the dependent and independent variables the quadratic relationship established between independent ph a dosage b and dependent variable tds reduction for coagulants cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 are shown in table 4 in case of cuso4 the parameters a b and b2 had a negative influence while ab and a2 had positive influence for fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 the parameters b ab b2 had a negative influence while a and a2 had a positive influence in addition the statistical fitness of developed model for response tds reduction for all three coagulants was also examined by p value f value ap and cv the results are presented in table 4 results show that in every aspect the developed model for tds reduction is reliable and significant total dissolved solid tds is a measurement of inorganic salts organic matter and other dissolved materials in water 1 the 3d plots for turbidity reduction for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are shown in figs 4 d 5 d and 6 d respectively to examine the effect of ph and dosage on tds reduction tds are solids which totally dissolved and forming homogenous mixture for cuso4 tds reduction initially decreased with increase in ph and after ph 9 it increased however with change in dose an opposite trend was observed for tds reduction in neutral and highly basic medium as shown in fig 4 d thus for cuso4 the optimum tds reduction was observed at lower ph and lower dosage this might be attributed to charge neutralization in case of fecl3 the tds reduction increased with the increase in ph and decreased with simultaneous increase in dosage however at higher ph and lower dosage the change in tds reduction was not significant thus for fecl3 the optimum tds reduction was observed at the maximum ph and minimum dosage this might be attributed to adsorption and sweep flocculation phenomena for cuso4 fecl3 tds reduction increased with increase in ph and decreased with increase in dosage of the coagulant thus in case of cuso4 fecl3 the optimal tds reduction was perceived at high ph and low dosage this might be due to higher sweep flocculation and moderate adsorption this attributed again to the formation of tbcc in case of both cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulant causing enhanced aggregation of flocs that boosted the settling of dissolved solid after adsorption and sweep flocculation 3 6 effect of coagulants on colour reduction the actual and predicted values relation analogy suggested by anova for color reduction by cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants are shown in figs 1 e 2 e and 3 e respectively the result showed that both actual and predicted values were close to each other justifying the significance of the developed model the correlation coefficients r2 and r a d j 2 of developed model equation in case of cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulants were found to be 0 9545 0 9769 and 0 9878 and0 9219 0 9604 and 0 9791 respectively this proposed a reliable relation between the dependent and independent variables the quadratic response between independent and dependent variables for colour reduction is presented in table 4 for colour reduction in case of cuso4 the negative impact was shown by ab while positive impact was shown by a b a2 and b2 in case of fecl3 the negative impact was shown by a and b while positive impact was shown by ab a2 and b2 similarly in case of cuso4 fecl3 the negative impact was shown by a and a2 while positive impact was shown by b ab and b2 in addition the statistical fitness of the developed model for response color reduction for all three coagulants was also examined by p value f value ap and cv the results are presented in table 4 results show that in every aspect the developed model for color reduction is reliable and significant the 3d plots of response color reduction for cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 were analyzed to investigate the coupled effect of ph and dosage on color reduction and the results are shown in figs 4 e 5 e and 6 e respectively pre contains high levels of metals inorganic and derived hydrocarbons these high molecular weight compounds are responsible for the dark color of the effluent the color reduction of pre through coagulation and flocculation process was perceived as a result of charge neutralization adsorption and sweep flocculation in case of cuso4 colour reduction increased with increase in ph and dosage the optimum color reduction was observed at maximum ph and dosage in the selected range this might be attributed to adsorption and sweep flocculation for fecl3 initially the color reduction decreased with increase in ph and after ph 5 the color reduction increased while with the increase of dosage the color reduction decreased continuously the optimum color reduction was attained at lower and neutral ph and dosage this revealed that color reduction was observed in highly acidic or neutral medium as a result of charge neutralization of fecl3 in case of cuso4 fecl3 initially the color reduction increased till ph 7 on further increase in ph the color reduction decreased with increase in dosage initially the color reduction decreased after that it starts increasing the optimum color reduction was attained at maximum dosage and nearly at neutral ph 7 thus color reduction of pre was occurred due to charge neutralization adsorption and sweep flocculation phenomena however in case of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 the formation of tbcc abruptly reduced the color since it act as a decolorizing agent 3 7 process optimization thirteen experiments for each coagulant separately have been performed according to the set of conditions provided by the design expert software as mentioned in experimental design matrix table 3 the optimum value of independent variable for each coagulant was obtained for all five response variables for a defined range of independent variables and constraints over each response variable as mentioned in table 5 the optimum conditions for all three coagulants considering all the response variables in their predefined goal table 4 simultaneously are presented in table 6 it would be appropriate to mention that there might be other optimum conditions if we consider one response variable at a time however in the present study all five response variables are considered at the same time to determine the optimum value of independent variable the optimum condition for cuso4 was found to be dosage 0 74 g l and ph 11 and for fecl3 it was dosage 0 20 g l and ph 7 respectively the optimum condition for cuso4 fecl3 was found to be dosage 0 20 g l and ph 7 1 in addition for the validation of optimum condition obtained by anova the experiments were performed at the same optimum conditions and it was found that in each case the error was less than 3 table 6 this clearly revealed that model developed for coagulation and flocculation was in good agreement with the experimental results 3 8 significance of g value the ratio of value of g was calculated to understand the settling velocity gradient parameters in conversion of rpm the calculated value of gr was 17 189 which signifies that in flocculation process the settling of particles at 200 rpm was 17 189 times more than at 30 rpm consequently there should be better removal at 200 rpm however at very high rpm the coagulated flocs may break and became water borne 5 consequently coagulation was performed at 200 rpm and flocculation of particles was performed at low rpm such as 30 3 9 characteristics of coagulation flocs formed by xps sem and edx 3 9 1 xps analysis of flocs xps analysis was employed to examine the chemical shift of the elements from its initial state to the final state after coagulation and flocculation process present study mainly focused on the final elemental state of cupper and iron to understand the mechanism in case of all three coagulants and specially the formation of tbcc in case of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 fig 7 a c represents the xps survey of flocs obtained after coagulation and flocculation using cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 respectively the presence of cu2p3 fe2p cl2p o1 s and s2p elements can be seen in the flocs fig 8 a b displays the cu2p3 and fe2p xps core level spectra of flocs after coagulation and flocculation the binding energy of pure cu i cu ii and cu ii carbonate hydroxide was 933 933 5 and 934 7 ev 56 after coagulation the binding energy of cu2p3 shifted to 935 17 ev for cuso4 while 935 56 ev for cuso4 fecl3 fig 8a this attributes the presence of an additional component of high electron affinity which decreased the electron density near cu as a result binding energy increases the o1 s pure binding energy for o 1 was 529 530 ev and for o 2 it was 532 6 ev 57 in fig 7 a and c the binding energy of o1 s was 532 47 ev which was nearly equal to o 2 this attributes that o1 s was attached with the element of higher electron affinity than the oh bond 58 59 this may reveal that chain structure of tbcc was formed during the process the cl2p spectrum in fig 7 a and c also confirm the chemical shift with binding energy 199 96 ev whereas the binding energy of cl in case of nacl formation was 198 5 199 ev 60 consequently cu cl and o confirm the existence of heavy molecular compound present in flocs formed the fe2p spectrum was studied for fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 coagulant and results are presented in fig 8b the fe ii cation exhibit the pure binding energy peak at 709 8 for fe o bond 61 after coagulation the binding energy of fe2p shifted to 711 3 ev for fecl3 while 713 1 ev for cuso4 fecl3 fig 8b the fe iii cation exhibits the binding energy 711 3 ev 62 this attributed that the fe exist in fe iii state as presented in eq 5 and the charge neutralization phenomena was dominated for the coagulation and flocculation process in case of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant the binding energy of fe2p was more than the fe iii state this indicated the formation of fe2 so4 3 as mentioned in eq 6 3 9 2 sem and edx analysis of flocs the results of sem edx analysis of flocs formed during coagulation and flocculation are shown in fig 9 a d the relative abundance of elements existing on the surface of flocs formed is presented in table 7 based on the sem microphotograph the particles of pre formed regular loose and tiny particles of identical shape and size as shown in fig 9 a the sem image of cuso4 and cuso4 fecl3 are presented in fig 9 b and d in both the cases the compact clustered and large size crystal like structure of flocs can be seen however in case of cuso4 fecl3 the size of crystal are even larger as compare to cuso4 this attributes that adsorption phenomena inter particle bridging and formation of tbcc octahedral crystallites 63 64 are dominant in case of cuso4 fecl3 as compare to cuso4 however in case of fecl3 coagulant the irregular granular units of small size can be been seen in fig 9 c this attributes that small size flocs are settled and the charge neutralization phenomena is dominant in case of fecl3 based on edx analysis 18 elements were detected in which carbon oxygen copper iron sulphur and lead were found in a higher percentage for all three type of flocs table 7 the detection of carbon on the surface of sludge attributed to cod reduction capacity of sludge 11 maximum carbon was found in case of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant at its optimum condition this result is well supported by the efficiency of cuso4 fecl3 coagulant for reduction in percentage of all selected dependent variables 4 conclusion the wastewater collected from the effluent treatment plant of petroleum refinery was treated using coagulation and flocculation process jar test method the copper and iron based coagulants i e cuso4 fecl3 and cuso4 fecl3 1 1 ratio mixture were used for the process the independent process parameters such as ph and coagulant dosage were optimized using response surface methodology with central composite design technique considering final ph reduction in cod turbidity tds and color as dependent variables the optimum condition for cuso4 was found as dosage 0 74 g l and ph 11 with the final ph of 8 46 the reduction in cod turbidity tds and color were as 55 93 97 05 92 28 and 94 20 respectively for fecl3 the optimum condition was dosage 0 20 g l and ph 7 0 with final ph of 3 72 and reduction in cod turbidity tds and color were 53 99 79 35 93 68 and 92 31 respectively in case of cuso4 fecl3 the optimum dosage was found to be 0 20 g l and ph 7 10 with final ph of 5 0 the corresponding reduction in cod turbidity tds and color were 76 77 89 47 94 16 95 29 respectively the mixed coagulant cuso4 fecl3 showed better results for all the dependent variables as compare to the individual cuso4 and fecl3 coagulants the mixed coagulant cuso4 fecl3 along with adsorption and sweep flocculation the formation of tribasic copper chloride tbcc was prominent the tbcc acts as proceeding intermediate in the ph ranging from 5 to 7 tbcc formation enhanced the flocculation process by its catalytic decolorizing and octahedral structural properties cuso4 coagulant in presence of chloride ions and alkali also form tbcc the final ph of solution at the optimum condition for all three coagulants is under the disposal limit the analysis of sem edx and xps indicates the formation of tbcc which helped in enhancing the ability of coagulation and flocculation it may be concluded that mixed coagulant cuso4 fecl3 is well suited for the treatment of pre using coagulation and flocculation process the optimization of the process parameters may increase the process efficiency and reduction in cod turbidity tds and color may enhance the efficiency of secondary treatment of waste water author s name and affiliation 1 dr pradeep

untreated wastewater and regarded as the main culprit of the surface water pollution exposure to those organic contaminants could disrupt the physiological system in human and living organisms currently there are various conventional methods were introduced to treat the wastewater contaminant such as chemical coagulation flocculation ion exchange membrane filtration and adsorption 1 6 however those methods only converting the contaminants to other different phase and they are not fully destroyed or eliminated 7 although organic contaminants are difficult to biologically degrade due to their complex organic structure but they can be easily degraded by induced photochemical treatment photocatalytic process involved three main steps which are 1 photogeneration of charge carriers 2 separation of charge carrier and diffusion to the surface of the photocatalyst and 3 redox reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst compared to other conventional method removal of contaminant through photocatalytic offer friendly by product due to mineralization capability to produce co2 and h2o furthermore photocatalyst like tio2 and zno were acknowledged as cheap chemically stable non toxic high efficiency and reusable 8 despite the promising achievement of photocatalyst like titania tio2 zinc oxide zno cadmium sulphide cds calcium titanate catio3 bismuth ferrite bifeo3 lanthanum ferrite lafeo3 and others as photocatalyst there are several limitations suffered when applied in real waste water treatment 9 16 the major limitation of currently used semiconductor photocatalyst is their wide band gap therefore they required high power uv irradiation to excite the electron from valence band to conduction band previous studies proposed coupling the semiconductor photocatalyst with other semiconductors that have smaller band gap to form heterostructures to capture photons from the visible light and generate stable electron hole pairs 17 18 most recently many new and innovative photocatalytic materials offering highly efficient photocatalytic have been developed to further improve the photocatalytic performance on wastewater contaminants they are including metal selenide and their composites as the photocatalytic materials with high efficient has been attended 19 22 there also graphene and g c3n4 could do a revolution in the photocatalytic materials such as semiconducting nanostructures 23 25 in addition there also advanced photocatalyst like bismuth sulphide nanorod 26 gallium doped zinc sulphide quantum dots 27 carbon bismuth sulphide core shell heterostructures 28 and g c3n4 niobium pentoxide 29 were developed for enhancing photocatalytic performance however as they present in powder form they tend to agglomerate sinks or suspends in the solution and very difficult to be separated from the solution these conditions reduce the performance of the photocatalyst due to lowering active surface area reduce light utilization and limiting contact area with the pollutants hence immobilizing the photocatalyst on substrate to form composite materials could overcome those limitations most recently development of various hybrid composite materials by impregnated onto potential substrate has attracted much attention to tackle the environmental issues 8 20 25 30 31 researchers come out with fresh and novel idea on development of floating composite photocatalyst by immobilizing the photocatalyst on the floatable substrate in order to achieve highest photocatalytic efficiency the substrate need to be well designed to utilize the maximum source light and retain the pollutants close to the surface of photocatalysts the floating composite photocatalyst is an attractive option for waste water treatment due to utilization of full solar irradiation of non oxygenated and non stirred reservoir this is due to the maximization of light utilization and oxygenation would result in higher rates of radical formation and oxidation efficiencies hence enhance the photocatalytic performance 32 furthermore the floating photocatalyst can be independently utilized in remote areas under local solar remediation without any special installation or equipment 33 for example they can be used for the more efficient destruction of suspended insoluble organic contaminants such as in in oil spill accidents area 34 fig 1 illustrated the schematic diagram of photocatalytic degradation of pollutants over floating composite photocatalyst basically the ability of the photocatalyst to float on the water surface allows more efficient irradiation and oxygenation which are fundamental for the photocatalytic degradation of contaminated waste water generally in the presence of solar or ultraviolet uv irradiation electrons are promoted from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb of the semiconductor oxide to give electron hole pairs 33 the valence band hole hvb is positive enough to form hydroxyl radicals o h at the surface of the photocatalyst then electron at conduction band e is negative enough to reduce o2 molecules to generate superoxide radicals ion o 2 both superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are responsible for degradation of pollutants subsequently large numbers of radicals were generated by the hydrolysis of water in the presence of o2 recent studies reported floating photocatalyst can be fabricated by impregnating photocatalyst onto various floating material such as palm trunk perlite wood cork vermiculite canvas and etc 33 35 39 they also called as buoyant photocatalyst in this review we discussed the recent advances on the fabrication performance as well as application of floating composite membrane for waste water treatment the development of floating photocatalysts received considerable attention as they could overcome the limitation of non floating photocatalysts such as agglomeration recovery and flexibility the most important issue of non floating photocatalyst is the accessibility of oxygen and sunlight to the bottom of the water is a really big challenge 40 by immobilizing photocatalyst onto a floatable support the maximal oxygenation and optimal solar irradiation can be achieved as the photocatalyst localized on the interface of the water and the air consequently the oxidation efficiency and radical generation rate are highly improved 41 moreover the floating photocatalyst do not require stirring process especially contaminated wastewater reservoir that located in remote areas like river or lakes since stirring is not available under that kind of condition particularly all these reasons show the importance of the floating photocatalyst over non floating photocatalyst 2 fabrication of floating nanocomposite photocatalyst over the past decades have witnessed development of floating composite photocatalyst as a newly emerging and innovative solution for wastewater treatment in the literature various techniques have been introduced for immobilizing photocatalyst onto floatable materials such as sol gel dip coating spray coating solvothermal hydrothermal liquid phase deposition sol carbonization surface modification centrifugation as well as three dimensional 3d printing as summarized in table 1 there are also different kind of floating materials have been identified as potential substrate for fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst such as cork glass beads silica palm trunk perlite polymer light expanded clay aggregate leca concrete graphite canvas and etc 36 table 1 summarizes the fabrication techniques of the floating composite photocatalyst fabrication parameters type of contaminants and their performances based on the solar or uv irradiation in the following sections we describe the fabrication methods of floating nanocomposite photocatalyst in more details 2 1 sol gel sol gel is the most popular technique to fabricate floating composite photocatalyst this is due to the compatibility of the formation of inorganic photocatalyst on the organic substrate under mild condition while enhance the chemical thermal and mechanical stability of the composite photocatalyst 54 generally during sol gel process the floatable substrate is immersed in alcohol solution of precursor photocatalyst alcohol promote good dispersion of photocatalyst particles then the solution is heated up to certain temperature for some time by forming gel like mixture the amorphous photocatalyst can directly precipitated and coated on the surface of the floating substrate through hydrolysis then followed by calcination process respectively 43 sol gel technique is acknowledged as the most appropriate technique to deposit photocatalyst on floating materials such as expanded graphite and organosilica due to high temperature resistance during calcination 51 54 55 zhang et al fabricated floating photocatalyst by sol gel technique to treat the diesel polluted water area 50 initially the tetrabutyl titanate bismuth nitrate and expanded graphite were vigorously stirred in absolute alcohol and hno3 to form solution a then solution b which formed by dissolution of urea as the nitrogen n precursor was added dropwise into solution a under vigorous stirring to form a gel precipitate in order to ensure the mixture completely hydrolyze the gel precipitate was aged for 24 h before heated at 80 for 8 h and calcinated at temperature of 550 c for 2 h in the n2 the fabricated composites were rinsed with ethanol and deionized water three times before dried in the presence of 500 w xenon lamp as visible light source the bi n tio2 expanded graphite exhibited the promising photodegradation efficiency of 83 8 towards high initial concentration of diesel 500 mg l under visible light irradiation for 300 min this finding also evidenced that bi n tio2 expanded graphite that fabricated by sol gel technique are stable photocatalyst for the in situ treatment of diesel contaminated water due to floatation and regeneration of this composite photocatalyst expanded graphite is recognized as an excellent adsorbent due to the porosity and light properties however previous study reported the structure of the expanded graphite was unstable and tends to collapse by external force 51 hence the researchers found it was crucial to develop expanded graphite c c composite egc and porous expanded graphite c c composite pegc to improve the stability of expanded graphite eg structure to be suitable floating substrate as photocatalyst carrier wang et al fabricated egc by dispersing expanded graphite and phenol formaldehyde resin into absolute alcohol while stirring at 60 c for 8 h 51 then the mixture was heated at 105 c for 8 h then calcined at 550 c for 1 h in n2 atmosphere then they fabricated ni n tio2 on both egc and pegc by sol gel technique with gel precipitate aging of 24 h drying at 80 c for 8 h and calcined at 550 c in order to fabricate pegc the fabrication procedure was extended by addition polyvinyl butyral and methenamine as porogen and hardener respectively the photocatalytic degradation performance of diesel oil by eg n tio2 egc ni n tio2 egc and ni n tio2 pegc were compared favorably the results revealed the ni n tio2 pegc exhibited higher diesel removal rate of 95 9 under visible light irradiation for 5 h in contrast to n tio2 egc which recorded removal rate of 63 0 excellent performance of the ni n tio2 pegc composite might be attributed to 1 the porous structure of the substrate refine the excellent electron acceptor and transporter which could reduce the recombination of the photo induced hole electron pairs 2 larger surface active area could increase the reaction 3 synergistic adsorption photocatalytic on the surface of the floating composite 4 floatable properties of pegc induced maximum utilization of light energy and 5 the variant channel structure of the composite photocatalyst offer the diesel adsorption with different carbon constitutions post treatment of floating composite photocatalyst by calcination at high temperature ranging from 300 400 c could promote the strong interaction and compatibility between the photocatalyst particle and the floating substrate however very high calcination temperature could deteriorate the floating properties of the substrate as reported by maki et al 2016 they fabricated floating tio2 photocatalyst support from organosilica through sol gel reactions of organosilanes which are octyl and methyl silyl trichlorides and 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane then dried at 50 c and denoted as tio2 sn 50 54 calcination of the sample tio2 sn 50 at 400 c tio2 sn 400 resulted on formation of tio2 polymethylsiloxane by oxidative decomposition of octyl and 3 aminopropyl groups while retaining the floatability properties they also found that calcination at optimum temperature led to the enhancement of the total specific surface area from 88 0 to 230 0 m2 g and the growth of anatase crystallites fig 2 a d showed the digital image of the floatability of the photocatalyst at different calcination temperature the sample sn 50 tio2 sn 50 and tio2 sn 400 particles floated on water however the sample tio2 sn 600 sank when the sample was calcined at 600 c this is due to the absence of organic groups in the tio2 organosilica fig 2 e f showed the water contact angles of tio2 sn 50 and tio2 sn 400 were 129 and 139 indicates that the surface of the composite is hydrophobic which make them floatable in water 2 2 surface coating basically there are three types of surface coating that have been employed by researchers for fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst which are dip coating spray coating and spin coating 34 40 45 surface coating technique is an alternative route to alter the surface of the floating materials in order to deposit the photocatalyst particles on them however this technique does not involve direct attachment of chemical functional group like chemical surface modification technique do hence usage of binding agent is crucial to improve the deposition of photocatalyst on the floating substrate furthermore post treatment like calcination at higher temperature is necessary to guarantee the crystallization of amorphous photocatalyst precursor which could enhance the photocatalytic performance of the floating composite photocatalyst 2 2 1 dip coating from suspension dip coating is one of the simple economic and efficient technique to immobilize photocatalyst onto the floating materials this technique allows the immersion of floating materials in the photocatalyst suspension or slurry and thereafter allowed for drying and followed by calcination in the earlier research hosseini et al successfully fabricated floating composite photocatalyst by utilizing perlite as the floating substrate and titania powder p 25 as photocatalyst 52 by employed dip coating technique titania successfully coated on the floatable and porous structure of the perlite within 30 min contact time and calcinated at 450 c for 30 min they also recommended in order to remove excess unattached titania the tio2 perlite composite need to be washed in deionized water and assisted by air bubbling in a vessel for a few minutes twice later de andrade et al were prepared the floating photocatalyst by simply dip coating the cubes of autoclaved cellular concrete composite acc approximately 2 2 1 cm by mixture of titanium tetrachloride and isopropanol solution for only 20 s 45 the coated cubes then were dried in oven at 60 c for 30 min before calcined at 550 c for 2 h high temperature during calcination treatment is important for transformation of titanium tetrachloride into anatase form of tio2 which promote the photocatalytic activity of the floating tio2 acc photocatalyst they found tio2 successfully deposited onto the acc based on fig 3 a b that displayed the scanning electron microscopy sem images of cork before and after deposition of tio2 respectively furthermore x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps also detected the presence of tio2 on the acc the binding energies of the ti 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 doublets 464 3 0 5 ev and 458 6 0 4 ev respectively are very close to values previously reported 464 34 ev and 458 8 ev respectively thus indicating a minor chemical variation of ti in the tio2 acc composite which indicates weak interactions between tio2 on the acc surface fig 3c this floating photocatalyst was tested for degradation of indigo carmine under uv irradiation as shown in fig 3 d they revealed that the floating tio2 acc photocatalyst is far more efficient of about 100 rather than tio2 p25 uv and uv with removal rates of nearly 60 as shown in fig 3 e mohammadi et al reported floating photocatalyst can be derived from leca granules in their study a novel hybrid tio2 zno photocatalyst was deposited on the porous leca 8 initially tio2 p25 powder was dispersed in the ethanol solution and striated to from the slurry solution in order to produce uniform dispersion tio2 slurry solution dilute nitric acid ph 3 5 was added in the solution zinc acetate solution was added in the titania solution to form tio2 zno composite sonication under 50 khz frequency also necessary to reduce the flocculation of the mixture then the porous leca granules was added to the synthesized solution to adsorb adequate amount of the slurry before separated and dried at 120 c for 12 h the tio2 zno leca composite was calcinated for 30 min a 350 c to ensure the effective and strong adhesion of the particles on the surface of leca granule the floating tio2 zno leca composite photocatalyst then was tested for degradation of ammonia under uv c irradiation the results showed that 95 2 of ammonia was degraded in 3 h reaction time however dip coating also can be performed without calcination treatment for example sboui et al were successfully fabricated a floating photocatalyst from tio2 polyaniline pani and cork through dip coating technique without calcination at high temperature 41 this is due to the tio2 pani nanocomposites particles are well synthesized by surface modification technique before being coated on the surface of the floating cork substrate the cork was subjected to direct deposition of tio2 pani nanocomposite with presence of commercial vinyl as binder for the resultant mixture in order to ensure the uniform coating of tio2 on floating substrate the resultant mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min fig 4 a d showed sem images of pure tio2 nanoparticle tio2 pani tio2 pani cork nanocomposite and transmission electron microscopy tem image of tio2 pani respectively the tio2 pani cork floating photocatalyst showed very promising photocatalytic performance by efficiently degrade methyl orange dye up to 95 2 within 210 min using solar irradiation without oxygenation and stirring this result is mainly reflected by the ability to float by cork also ability to adsorb both uv and solar light by tio2 pani to deliver the excited state electrons of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo as illustrated in fig 4 e pani not only improved the photocatalytic performance of tio2 but also other semiconductor like zinc selenide nanoparticles 19 the floating composite photocatalyst also can be fabricated through immersing the canvas non woven textured into iron precursor solution fe no3 3 9h2o 48 the material was stirred for 1 h contact time before dried in oven for 12 h at 150 c fig 5 concluded fe successfully coated on the canvas through dip coating process fig 5 a b showed the color change of the neat canvas from white to reddish brown after coated by iron nitrate solution in order to further observe the morphology of the coated iron on the canvas sem images of before and after treatment were analysed from fig 5 c f impregnation of iron iii oxide can be clearly observed by homogeneous distribution of the particles throughout the microfibers structure of the canvas fig 5 g indicated the removal of organic dye from the aqueous solution almost completed due to the significant decrease in the band of 552 nm represent the character of the rh b pigment fig 5 h demonstrated in the presence of the catalyst and uv light the degradation of rh b is almost 100 after 90 min these findings indicated the floating canvas are promising solution for contaminant degradation by solar remediation through non mechanically stirring and non oxygenated reservoirs this is based on the maximum light utilization that obtained by the entangled fibers that result in higher radical formation rates and oxidation efficiencies 2 2 2 spin coating researcher also attracted on spin coating technique for fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst for example guo et al fabricated floating graphitic carbon nitride polyetherimide gc3n4 pei by spin coating 40 firstly they synthesized g c3n4 from urea through heat treatment then they are simplified dissolved pei particles within dichloromethane then mixed with the g c3n4 powder by subsequent ultrasonication and centrifugation for 10 min with the rotating speed of 4000 rpm the fabricated gc3n4 pei was tested for degradation of methyl orange under light irradiation of table lamp they compared the photodegradation efficiency of methyl orange by neat g c3n4 powder and gc3n4 pei composite with stirring and without stirring the results showed methyl orange was degraded 91 0 by g c3n4 powder and 80 0 by gc3n4 pei composite with stirring however without stirring condition the photodegradation of gc3n4 dropped to 37 0 which is lower than 55 0 by gc3n4 pei composite this finding indicated the floating gc3n4 pei composite photocatalyst utilized more solar energy for better photodegradation performance then the submerged gc3n4 powder photocatalyst that require stirring process 2 2 3 spray coating besides than fabricated floating photocatalyst using dip coating technique the floating photocatalyst also can be fabricated through spray coating magalhÃ£es and lago prepared floating photocatalyst by spraying a polystyrene pst solution in ethyl acetate on expanded polystyrene eps beads and tio2 34 eps beads were selected as floating support is due their light and floatable properties furthermore eps also having good chemical thermal and mechanical stability the floating tio2 eps composite was dried at 80 c for 1 h to remove the ethyl acetate before subjected to vigorous strring in water for 2 h to remove any loosely attached tio2 from the eps surface spray coating is suitable for short run fabrication because the process is fast and simple however this kind of fabrication technique often leads to waste of materials due to over spraying it is also very difficult to contol the coating thickness on the surface of the floating materials 2 3 hydrothermal fabrication of floatable composite photocatalyst by hydrothermal is carried out in one pot teflon autoclaves which are tightly sealed in stainless steel chamber that can withstand high pressure and temperatures for a long duration time the main fabrication parameters of this method are the synthesis temperature duration pressure and initial ph of the medium in the system 39 this fabrication technique is one of the great interest due to its potential to develop homogenous composite photocatalyst in one step process furthermore this technique also affordable and environmentally friendly numerous researchers applied hydrothermal technique for coating tio2 onto floatable materials such as surface of woods 39 56 57 recently darkhosh et al successfully developed a novel visible light water floating catalyst called as cufeo2 expanded perlite for degradation of methylene blue 32 in their study the cufeo2 was directly deposited on the surface of expanded perlite through one step hydrothermal reaction at 180 c within 24 h the morphology characterization analysis indicated that the rhombohedral cufeo2 homogeneously distributed on the perlite surface as shown by fig 6 a c as shown in fig 6 d with the presence of visible light the cufeo2 composite photocatalyst was reported excellent photodegradation efficiency of 99 0 for degradation of methylene blue the excellent photocatalytic activity of this composite photocatalyst is resulted by the synergistic influence and interaction between photocatalytic and floatable properties of cufeo2 and perlite in the moderate hydrothermal reaction that ensure the reaction at the surface of the composite photocatalyst as illustrated in fig 6 e researchers also demonstrated that fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst can be revealed by combination of hydrothermal and liquid phase deposition process for example khan et al 2019 reported the floating reduced graphene oxide quantum dots bismuth bismuth tungstate rgo qds bi bi2wo6 expanded perlite nanocomposite photocatalyst can be fabricated by hydrothermal technique and followed by liquid phase deposition process 35 as illustrated in fig 7 a the expanded perlite required pre treatment by soaked overnight in 10 wt hcl before being sieved uniformly through a 40 mesh screen then the treated perlite was soaked in d h2o for 1 h before dried in oven for 24 h at 80 c the reduced graphene oxide quantum dots rgo qds was firstly synthesized by hummer s method and treated with strong acid as illustrated in fig 7 b they prepared the floating bi bi2wo6 expanded perlite nanocomposite by hydrothermal method hydrothermal synthesis was carried out by using precursors bismuth nitrate bi no3 35 h2o and sodium tungstate na2wo42 h2o with the presence of pvp k30 and citric acid at synthesis temperature of 170 0 c for 10 h then rgo qds was deposited on the bi bi2wo6 expanded perlite by the facile liquid phase deposition process their result shows the significant photodegradation efficiency on rhodamine b and phenol which recorded 95 0 and 93 0 with the presence of visible light irradiation researchers have demonstrated solvothermal technique can be employed to grow tio2 photocatalyst on the graphene substrate to form floatable photocatalyst in the water 58 schematic diagram of formation floating tio2 graphene photocatalyst was demonstrated in fig 8 in their study expanded graphite was first heated at high temperature with the presence of oleum to enlarge the distance between adjacent graphitic layers also to enhance the number of surface groups then ti precursor solution tetrabutyl titanate in ethanol was mixed with oleum treated expanded graphite before filled in teflon autoclave and kept at 180 c for 3 6 12 or 24 h this solvothermal process allowed in situ growth of tio2 nanoparticles in the interlayers of the expanded graphite forming tio2 graphene composites even though solvothermal offers fast and simple technique of fabrication of floating nanocomposite photocatalyst but there are limitations of this technique one of them is low hydrothermal temperature is not suitable for transformation of amorphous structure inorganic particles into crystalline structure which reduce the photocatalytic activity of the particles then the usage of photocatalytic precursor solution is not recommended for this kind of fabrication technique secondly high temperature of hydrothermal process is not suitable for organic floatable substrate such as polymeric based materials due to lower thermal stability the structure of the polymeric substrate might deteriorate during solvothermal process hence selection of the substrate needs to be strict and carefully analysed before proceed to fabrication third fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst might resulted in heterogeneous or diverse distribution of photocatalyst particles on the surface of substrate this is due to the floatability of the substrate and hydrolysis process of development of the photocatalyst occurred at the bottom of the autoclave flask which discrete the uniform deposition of the photocatalyst on the floating substrate as illustrated in fig 9 hence continuous stirring is required to ensure homogeneous dispersion of developed photocatalyst on the surface of the floating substrate 2 4 solvent casting another technique to fabricate floating composite photocatalyst that attracted attention of researcher is solvent casting singh et al introduced two routes called as 1 impregnation solvent cast and 2 strewing solvent cast technique 49 fig 10 a b showed the developed floating photocatalyst ag tio2 onto into polystyrene ps fabricated by impregnation solvent cast and strewing solvent cast respectively the fabricated composite photocatalyst films were subjected to photodegradation of methylene blue in aqueous solution under both solar and uv irradiation they found the maximum photodegradation of methylene blue irradiated by solar light by strewn solvent cast photocatalyst and impregnated solvent cast photocatalyst were about 83 0 and 68 0 respectively while under uv irradiation the photodegradation of methylene blue by strewn solvent cast photocatalyst and impregnated solvent cast photocatalyst were about 94 0 and 86 0 respectively this result indicated photocatalyst film that fabricated by strewn solvent cast having higher photodegradation performance this can be ascribed by the location of the tio2 photocatalyst particles that adhered externally onto the surface of ps as compared to floating photocatalyst that fabricated via impregnated solvent cast strewn photocatalyst have a greater probability interacting with the methylene blue molecules which enhance the photodegradation performance 2 5 surface modification surface modification of the floating substrate could enhance the interaction or deposition of photocatalyst particles onto the surface of the substrate commonly the surfaces of the substrates were treated by strong acid or alkaline to make the them became rougher before deposition of the photocatalyst according to wang et al 2015 they used the method of surface modification to load hollow tio2 onto the surface of hollow glass microsphere hgms 43 this method offered production of floating photocatalyst with larger specific surface area and much better photocatalytic performance briefly as demonstrated in fig 11 a they modified the surface of hgms by hydrofluoric acid hf and vinyl trimethoxysilane vtms to make the surface became rougher and appropriate to load pst particles pst particles was used as the template for precipitation of amorphous tio2 through hydrolysis process then the crystallization of amorphous tio2 was proceed through calcination 550 c and directly removed pst by combustion fig 11 show the sem images of the b pst c hgms corroded by hf and modified by vtms d pst loaded on hgms e hgmsht after calcination at 550 c based on previous studies most of the floating photocatalysts were prepared by coating the commercial photocatalyst within the floatable substrate besides that sol gel and hydrothermal technique are often used by mixing the substrate with the precursor solution of the photocatalyst commonly in order to further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst addition of activation agent during preparation process was suggested however those techniques involved physical interaction which limiting the stability and could be resulted in leaking of the photocatalyst from the surface of the floating substrate photocatalyst particles tend to peel off and shrink during the crystallization and calcination process hence decline the photocatalytic performance due to the reduction of active surface area in order to overcome the limitation production of floating photocatalyst through surface modification could be consider as promising alternative to load photocatalyst on the surface of floating substrate materials 2 6 three dimensional 3d printing most recently fabrication of floating photocatalyst by 3d printing has attracted much attention due to the economical efficient easily implantable and environmentally compatible process according to martÃ­n de vidales et al they fabricated tio2 ldpe by different method 1 mixing tio2 and ldpe in a hot cylinder mixer 2 using o xylene as dispersing and 3 using anionic surfactant as dispersing agent 47 the scheme of fabrication of the photocatalyst was illustrated in fig 12 a the mixture then was chopped and extruded as the three different filaments called as ldpe tio2 cm ldpe tio2 o xylene and ldpe tio2 surfactant respectively the filaments were printed as meshes in a fused deposition modelling 3d printer fig 12 b d showed the i sem surface images ii eds mapping and iii eds analysis of the fabricated b ldpe tio2 cm c ldpe tio2 o xylene dld pe ldpe tio2 surfactant the observation can be made all the photocatalyst particles were highly dispersed and agglomerated on the surface of meshes which indicated when an anionic surfactant or o xylene were used as dispersing media no apparent improvement is achieved and significant agglomerations can be observed from the results they found the maximum degradation by photocatalyst in meshes form that obtained from 3d printing is significantly higher than the plate geometry the enhancement of the process efficiency is attributed to the higher active surface available for oxidation of pollutant furthermore the adhesion of tio2 photocatalyst and polymer was improved by extrusion and 3d printing process hence fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst by 3d printing offer promising solution for photodegradation of contaminant in aquous system 2 7 low temperature ultrasonic and deposition even though researchers reported physical approach on deposition of photocatalyst on floating substrate such as sol gel dip coating hydrothermal is an efficient and cost effective but most the mentioned techniques are not suitable to be used for coating tio2 on polymer substrate this is due to high temperature calcination for transformation of photoactive anatase structure of tio2 might destroyed the structure of the polymer substrate hence zhang et al introduced a low temperature ultrasonic and deposition approach for efficiently coated tio2 onto the polyurethane foam puf 38 zhang et al utilized puf as substrate for the photocatalyst because of it has a rougher surface high specific surface area high porosity as well as light weight the omt powders were used as precursor and dissolved in absolute alcohol with a little portion of concentrated nitric acid the solution was vibrated by ultrasonic vibration for 30 min at 80 c then puf was added to the dispersed omt ethanol solution before ultrasonic vibrated for another 30 min the omt coated puf then was dried at 60 c for 24 h to form tio2 puf floating composite photocatalyst this photocatalyst was analysed for the simultaneous degradation of organic dyes methylene blue rhodamine b and methyl orange and reduction of heavy metal hexavalent chromium cr vi into trivalent chromium cr iii they found with the presence of solar irradiation tio2 puf that fabricated via low temperature ultrasonic approach exhibited good adsorption performance and high photocatalytic activity 90 4 97 4 3 photocatalytic mechanism by floating photocatalyst 3 1 organic pollutants organic contaminants are the major pollutant in wastewater 59 primarily organic contaminants composed of carbon hydrogen and other elements such as nitrogen amine amide azo aromatic compound and etc they could be various wastes like dye phenols alcohol diesel aldehydes antibiotics pharmaceutical and etc fig 13 shows the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of rhodamine b rhb by cds ep floating photocatalyst 42 the cds nanoparticles were attracted to the partially positive charges on the surface of ep due to the content of alumina and silica as the floatable properties of ep the visible light irradiated the cds to excite its electrons to the conduction band the presence of oxygen molecules in the atmosphere accept the photogenerated electrons and superoxide is produced meanwhile the h in the valence band is captured by h2o molecules to form hydroxyl radicals formation of superoxides and hydroxyl radicals can degrade rhb into co2 and h2o in other study wang et al successfully synthesized egc based ni n tio2 floating photocatalyst for adsorption and degradation of diesel oil 51 the proposed mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of diesel oil was depicted in fig 14 as shown in the schematic diagram in the visible light region ni n codoping showed effective absorption which attributed to the charge transfer between the orbital d of the dopants and band gap states of tio2 the synthesized ni n tio2 egc photocatalyst generates h and photogenerated electrons in the presence of visible light eq 1 the h react with water or oh that adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals eqs 2 and 3 meanwhile the photogenerated electrons can be trapped by the oxygen molecule that absorbed on the surface of catalyst to produce superoxide eq 4 additionally the superoxide can further react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals eq 5 these reactive oxygen radicals can react with diesel oil to mineralize the hydrocarbon components as shown in eq 6 1 ni n tio2 pegc hv ni n tio2 pegc h e 2 h h2oads oh h 3 h oh ads oh 4 e o2 ads o2 5 o2 2h2oads 2 oh 2oh o2 6 diesel oil oh o2 co2 h2o 3 2 inorganic pollutants inorganic pollutants of wastewater comprise of metalloid heavy metal ions nitrate phosphate etc heavy metal contamination in water supplies has drawn global attention due to the toxicity and carcinogenicity effects towards living bodies recently the treatment of harmful heavy metal like hexavalent cr vi with the presence of dyes were studied by zhang et al 38 fig 15 shows the removal of cr vi by photocatalytic activity of the floating omt puf by reduction of cr vi under sunlight in different coexisting dye systems the main photocatalytic reaction mechanism of the simultaneous dye oxidation and reduction of cr vi was described in eqs 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 as expressed below 7 tio2 hv hvb ecb 8 ecb crvi criii 9 hvb dye pollutants co2 h2o 10 ecb o2 o2 11 o2 dye pollutants co2 h2o 12 hvb h2o oh h 13 o2 h2o oh oh 14 oh dye pollutants co2 h2o 15 tioh2 cr2o7 2 tioh cr2o7 2 h briefly from eqs 7 14 when the tio2 that located in omt puf is bombarded by sunlight irradiation the electrons are released from the vb to cb to give electron hole pairs the electron at cb ecb could reduce the cr vi into cr iii additionally the h ions adsorbed on the surface of tio2 allows the adsorbed h to trap electrons to form hads and facilitate the reduction of toxic cr vi into less harmful cr iii as expressed in eq 15 simultaneously the dye pollutants were degraded by superoxide o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh that generated by hydrolysis of water in the presence of o2 4 future directions and conclusions basically the ability of the composite photocatalyst to float on the surface of water permits more efficient light illumination and oxygenation which are fundamental for the photocatalytic process in the future more studies and research work on fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst are still required to enhance the performance of the photocatalyst this study can be a guideline to design and fabricate the superior materials with photocatalytic and floatable properties for wastewater treatment first an excellent non toxic and biodegradable floatable substrate and photocatalyst need to be explored this is due to the longer contact time on the contaminated water could deteriorate the floating properties of the substrate hence utilization of the biodegradable substrate could solve the environmental issue such as post treatment issue by letting them settled down at the bottom of treatment tank second adhesion of photocatalyst on the surface of the of the floatable substrate must be further improved because it is the major key to down to earth application of the photocatalyst leaking of photocatalyst from floatable substrate could led to secondary pollution to environment third more research work on development of visible driven floating photocatalyst should be intensified rather than uv driven photocatalyst this is due to visible light is more accessible especially in local remote area modification of photocatalyst particle by reduction of band gap could further enhance the photocatalytic performance fourth other potential semiconductor based photocatalyst need to be explored that fulfilled practical application instead of focusing on existing semiconductor based photocatalyst semiconductor like perovskite could overcome the limitation of the common photocatalyst by having lower bandgap and utilized visible light irradiation rather than uv irradiation last but not least green synthesis of floating photocatalyst by using plant based or agricultural waste as reducing or stabilizing agent should be further explored commonly chemical additives were employed as stabilizing agent which contribute to secondary pollution as conclusion more effort should be devoted to deeper understanding on fabrication

13976,the illumination of source light and oxygenation are two fundamental factors for superior photocatalytic performance in waste water treatment powder form of existing photocatalyst reduced the performance of the photocatalyst due to lowering active surface area reduce light utilization and limiting contact area with the pollutants a number of researchers came out with fresh and novel ideas on immobilizing potential photocatalyst on floatable substrate to form floating composite photocatalyst the floating composite photocatalyst is an attractive option for waste water treatment due to utilization of full solar irradiation of non oxygenated and non stirred reservoir this makes development of floating photocatalyst is significant to be reviewed this review highlights the most recent fabrication and application of floating photocatalyst for wastewater treatment fabrication techniques such as sol gel surface coating hydrothermal solvent casting surface modification three dimensional printing and low temperature ultrasonic were reviewed moreover the perspective on future direction to improve the photocatalytic performances were discussed at the end of the review keywords floating composite photocatalyst surface coating fabrication application wastewater treatment 1 introduction a drop of water is worth more than a sack of gold to a thirsty man is a famous quote describing the significance values of clean and pure water rather than luxurious materials the past few decades have witnessed to rapid development in agriculture and industrialization activities that generated increased volume of untreated wastewater contaminants such as dye phenolic compounds humic substances pesticides heavy metal and pharmaceutical wastes have found in the untreated wastewater and regarded as the main culprit of the surface water pollution exposure to those organic contaminants could disrupt the physiological system in human and living organisms currently there are various conventional methods were introduced to treat the wastewater contaminant such as chemical coagulation flocculation ion exchange membrane filtration and adsorption 1 6 however those methods only converting the contaminants to other different phase and they are not fully destroyed or eliminated 7 although organic contaminants are difficult to biologically degrade due to their complex organic structure but they can be easily degraded by induced photochemical treatment photocatalytic process involved three main steps which are 1 photogeneration of charge carriers 2 separation of charge carrier and diffusion to the surface of the photocatalyst and 3 redox reaction on the surface of the photocatalyst compared to other conventional method removal of contaminant through photocatalytic offer friendly by product due to mineralization capability to produce co2 and h2o furthermore photocatalyst like tio2 and zno were acknowledged as cheap chemically stable non toxic high efficiency and reusable 8 despite the promising achievement of photocatalyst like titania tio2 zinc oxide zno cadmium sulphide cds calcium titanate catio3 bismuth ferrite bifeo3 lanthanum ferrite lafeo3 and others as photocatalyst there are several limitations suffered when applied in real waste water treatment 9 16 the major limitation of currently used semiconductor photocatalyst is their wide band gap therefore they required high power uv irradiation to excite the electron from valence band to conduction band previous studies proposed coupling the semiconductor photocatalyst with other semiconductors that have smaller band gap to form heterostructures to capture photons from the visible light and generate stable electron hole pairs 17 18 most recently many new and innovative photocatalytic materials offering highly efficient photocatalytic have been developed to further improve the photocatalytic performance on wastewater contaminants they are including metal selenide and their composites as the photocatalytic materials with high efficient has been attended 19 22 there also graphene and g c3n4 could do a revolution in the photocatalytic materials such as semiconducting nanostructures 23 25 in addition there also advanced photocatalyst like bismuth sulphide nanorod 26 gallium doped zinc sulphide quantum dots 27 carbon bismuth sulphide core shell heterostructures 28 and g c3n4 niobium pentoxide 29 were developed for enhancing photocatalytic performance however as they present in powder form they tend to agglomerate sinks or suspends in the solution and very difficult to be separated from the solution these conditions reduce the performance of the photocatalyst due to lowering active surface area reduce light utilization and limiting contact area with the pollutants hence immobilizing the photocatalyst on substrate to form composite materials could overcome those limitations most recently development of various hybrid composite materials by impregnated onto potential substrate has attracted much attention to tackle the environmental issues 8 20 25 30 31 researchers come out with fresh and novel idea on development of floating composite photocatalyst by immobilizing the photocatalyst on the floatable substrate in order to achieve highest photocatalytic efficiency the substrate need to be well designed to utilize the maximum source light and retain the pollutants close to the surface of photocatalysts the floating composite photocatalyst is an attractive option for waste water treatment due to utilization of full solar irradiation of non oxygenated and non stirred reservoir this is due to the maximization of light utilization and oxygenation would result in higher rates of radical formation and oxidation efficiencies hence enhance the photocatalytic performance 32 furthermore the floating photocatalyst can be independently utilized in remote areas under local solar remediation without any special installation or equipment 33 for example they can be used for the more efficient destruction of suspended insoluble organic contaminants such as in in oil spill accidents area 34 fig 1 illustrated the schematic diagram of photocatalytic degradation of pollutants over floating composite photocatalyst basically the ability of the photocatalyst to float on the water surface allows more efficient irradiation and oxygenation which are fundamental for the photocatalytic degradation of contaminated waste water generally in the presence of solar or ultraviolet uv irradiation electrons are promoted from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb of the semiconductor oxide to give electron hole pairs 33 the valence band hole hvb is positive enough to form hydroxyl radicals o h at the surface of the photocatalyst then electron at conduction band e is negative enough to reduce o2 molecules to generate superoxide radicals ion o 2 both superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are responsible for degradation of pollutants subsequently large numbers of radicals were generated by the hydrolysis of water in the presence of o2 recent studies reported floating photocatalyst can be fabricated by impregnating photocatalyst onto various floating material such as palm trunk perlite wood cork vermiculite canvas and etc 33 35 39 they also called as buoyant photocatalyst in this review we discussed the recent advances on the fabrication performance as well as application of floating composite membrane for waste water treatment the development of floating photocatalysts received considerable attention as they could overcome the limitation of non floating photocatalysts such as agglomeration recovery and flexibility the most important issue of non floating photocatalyst is the accessibility of oxygen and sunlight to the bottom of the water is a really big challenge 40 by immobilizing photocatalyst onto a floatable support the maximal oxygenation and optimal solar irradiation can be achieved as the photocatalyst localized on the interface of the water and the air consequently the oxidation efficiency and radical generation rate are highly improved 41 moreover the floating photocatalyst do not require stirring process especially contaminated wastewater reservoir that located in remote areas like river or lakes since stirring is not available under that kind of condition particularly all these reasons show the importance of the floating photocatalyst over non floating photocatalyst 2 fabrication of floating nanocomposite photocatalyst over the past decades have witnessed development of floating composite photocatalyst as a newly emerging and innovative solution for wastewater treatment in the literature various techniques have been introduced for immobilizing photocatalyst onto floatable materials such as sol gel dip coating spray coating solvothermal hydrothermal liquid phase deposition sol carbonization surface modification centrifugation as well as three dimensional 3d printing as summarized in table 1 there are also different kind of floating materials have been identified as potential substrate for fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst such as cork glass beads silica palm trunk perlite polymer light expanded clay aggregate leca concrete graphite canvas and etc 36 table 1 summarizes the fabrication techniques of the floating composite photocatalyst fabrication parameters type of contaminants and their performances based on the solar or uv irradiation in the following sections we describe the fabrication methods of floating nanocomposite photocatalyst in more details 2 1 sol gel sol gel is the most popular technique to fabricate floating composite photocatalyst this is due to the compatibility of the formation of inorganic photocatalyst on the organic substrate under mild condition while enhance the chemical thermal and mechanical stability of the composite photocatalyst 54 generally during sol gel process the floatable substrate is immersed in alcohol solution of precursor photocatalyst alcohol promote good dispersion of photocatalyst particles then the solution is heated up to certain temperature for some time by forming gel like mixture the amorphous photocatalyst can directly precipitated and coated on the surface of the floating substrate through hydrolysis then followed by calcination process respectively 43 sol gel technique is acknowledged as the most appropriate technique to deposit photocatalyst on floating materials such as expanded graphite and organosilica due to high temperature resistance during calcination 51 54 55 zhang et al fabricated floating photocatalyst by sol gel technique to treat the diesel polluted water area 50 initially the tetrabutyl titanate bismuth nitrate and expanded graphite were vigorously stirred in absolute alcohol and hno3 to form solution a then solution b which formed by dissolution of urea as the nitrogen n precursor was added dropwise into solution a under vigorous stirring to form a gel precipitate in order to ensure the mixture completely hydrolyze the gel precipitate was aged for 24 h before heated at 80 for 8 h and calcinated at temperature of 550 c for 2 h in the n2 the fabricated composites were rinsed with ethanol and deionized water three times before dried in the presence of 500 w xenon lamp as visible light source the bi n tio2 expanded graphite exhibited the promising photodegradation efficiency of 83 8 towards high initial concentration of diesel 500 mg l under visible light irradiation for 300 min this finding also evidenced that bi n tio2 expanded graphite that fabricated by sol gel technique are stable photocatalyst for the in situ treatment of diesel contaminated water due to floatation and regeneration of this composite photocatalyst expanded graphite is recognized as an excellent adsorbent due to the porosity and light properties however previous study reported the structure of the expanded graphite was unstable and tends to collapse by external force 51 hence the researchers found it was crucial to develop expanded graphite c c composite egc and porous expanded graphite c c composite pegc to improve the stability of expanded graphite eg structure to be suitable floating substrate as photocatalyst carrier wang et al fabricated egc by dispersing expanded graphite and phenol formaldehyde resin into absolute alcohol while stirring at 60 c for 8 h 51 then the mixture was heated at 105 c for 8 h then calcined at 550 c for 1 h in n2 atmosphere then they fabricated ni n tio2 on both egc and pegc by sol gel technique with gel precipitate aging of 24 h drying at 80 c for 8 h and calcined at 550 c in order to fabricate pegc the fabrication procedure was extended by addition polyvinyl butyral and methenamine as porogen and hardener respectively the photocatalytic degradation performance of diesel oil by eg n tio2 egc ni n tio2 egc and ni n tio2 pegc were compared favorably the results revealed the ni n tio2 pegc exhibited higher diesel removal rate of 95 9 under visible light irradiation for 5 h in contrast to n tio2 egc which recorded removal rate of 63 0 excellent performance of the ni n tio2 pegc composite might be attributed to 1 the porous structure of the substrate refine the excellent electron acceptor and transporter which could reduce the recombination of the photo induced hole electron pairs 2 larger surface active area could increase the reaction 3 synergistic adsorption photocatalytic on the surface of the floating composite 4 floatable properties of pegc induced maximum utilization of light energy and 5 the variant channel structure of the composite photocatalyst offer the diesel adsorption with different carbon constitutions post treatment of floating composite photocatalyst by calcination at high temperature ranging from 300 400 c could promote the strong interaction and compatibility between the photocatalyst particle and the floating substrate however very high calcination temperature could deteriorate the floating properties of the substrate as reported by maki et al 2016 they fabricated floating tio2 photocatalyst support from organosilica through sol gel reactions of organosilanes which are octyl and methyl silyl trichlorides and 3 aminopropyltrimethoxysilane then dried at 50 c and denoted as tio2 sn 50 54 calcination of the sample tio2 sn 50 at 400 c tio2 sn 400 resulted on formation of tio2 polymethylsiloxane by oxidative decomposition of octyl and 3 aminopropyl groups while retaining the floatability properties they also found that calcination at optimum temperature led to the enhancement of the total specific surface area from 88 0 to 230 0 m2 g and the growth of anatase crystallites fig 2 a d showed the digital image of the floatability of the photocatalyst at different calcination temperature the sample sn 50 tio2 sn 50 and tio2 sn 400 particles floated on water however the sample tio2 sn 600 sank when the sample was calcined at 600 c this is due to the absence of organic groups in the tio2 organosilica fig 2 e f showed the water contact angles of tio2 sn 50 and tio2 sn 400 were 129 and 139 indicates that the surface of the composite is hydrophobic which make them floatable in water 2 2 surface coating basically there are three types of surface coating that have been employed by researchers for fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst which are dip coating spray coating and spin coating 34 40 45 surface coating technique is an alternative route to alter the surface of the floating materials in order to deposit the photocatalyst particles on them however this technique does not involve direct attachment of chemical functional group like chemical surface modification technique do hence usage of binding agent is crucial to improve the deposition of photocatalyst on the floating substrate furthermore post treatment like calcination at higher temperature is necessary to guarantee the crystallization of amorphous photocatalyst precursor which could enhance the photocatalytic performance of the floating composite photocatalyst 2 2 1 dip coating from suspension dip coating is one of the simple economic and efficient technique to immobilize photocatalyst onto the floating materials this technique allows the immersion of floating materials in the photocatalyst suspension or slurry and thereafter allowed for drying and followed by calcination in the earlier research hosseini et al successfully fabricated floating composite photocatalyst by utilizing perlite as the floating substrate and titania powder p 25 as photocatalyst 52 by employed dip coating technique titania successfully coated on the floatable and porous structure of the perlite within 30 min contact time and calcinated at 450 c for 30 min they also recommended in order to remove excess unattached titania the tio2 perlite composite need to be washed in deionized water and assisted by air bubbling in a vessel for a few minutes twice later de andrade et al were prepared the floating photocatalyst by simply dip coating the cubes of autoclaved cellular concrete composite acc approximately 2 2 1 cm by mixture of titanium tetrachloride and isopropanol solution for only 20 s 45 the coated cubes then were dried in oven at 60 c for 30 min before calcined at 550 c for 2 h high temperature during calcination treatment is important for transformation of titanium tetrachloride into anatase form of tio2 which promote the photocatalytic activity of the floating tio2 acc photocatalyst they found tio2 successfully deposited onto the acc based on fig 3 a b that displayed the scanning electron microscopy sem images of cork before and after deposition of tio2 respectively furthermore x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps also detected the presence of tio2 on the acc the binding energies of the ti 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 doublets 464 3 0 5 ev and 458 6 0 4 ev respectively are very close to values previously reported 464 34 ev and 458 8 ev respectively thus indicating a minor chemical variation of ti in the tio2 acc composite which indicates weak interactions between tio2 on the acc surface fig 3c this floating photocatalyst was tested for degradation of indigo carmine under uv irradiation as shown in fig 3 d they revealed that the floating tio2 acc photocatalyst is far more efficient of about 100 rather than tio2 p25 uv and uv with removal rates of nearly 60 as shown in fig 3 e mohammadi et al reported floating photocatalyst can be derived from leca granules in their study a novel hybrid tio2 zno photocatalyst was deposited on the porous leca 8 initially tio2 p25 powder was dispersed in the ethanol solution and striated to from the slurry solution in order to produce uniform dispersion tio2 slurry solution dilute nitric acid ph 3 5 was added in the solution zinc acetate solution was added in the titania solution to form tio2 zno composite sonication under 50 khz frequency also necessary to reduce the flocculation of the mixture then the porous leca granules was added to the synthesized solution to adsorb adequate amount of the slurry before separated and dried at 120 c for 12 h the tio2 zno leca composite was calcinated for 30 min a 350 c to ensure the effective and strong adhesion of the particles on the surface of leca granule the floating tio2 zno leca composite photocatalyst then was tested for degradation of ammonia under uv c irradiation the results showed that 95 2 of ammonia was degraded in 3 h reaction time however dip coating also can be performed without calcination treatment for example sboui et al were successfully fabricated a floating photocatalyst from tio2 polyaniline pani and cork through dip coating technique without calcination at high temperature 41 this is due to the tio2 pani nanocomposites particles are well synthesized by surface modification technique before being coated on the surface of the floating cork substrate the cork was subjected to direct deposition of tio2 pani nanocomposite with presence of commercial vinyl as binder for the resultant mixture in order to ensure the uniform coating of tio2 on floating substrate the resultant mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 min fig 4 a d showed sem images of pure tio2 nanoparticle tio2 pani tio2 pani cork nanocomposite and transmission electron microscopy tem image of tio2 pani respectively the tio2 pani cork floating photocatalyst showed very promising photocatalytic performance by efficiently degrade methyl orange dye up to 95 2 within 210 min using solar irradiation without oxygenation and stirring this result is mainly reflected by the ability to float by cork also ability to adsorb both uv and solar light by tio2 pani to deliver the excited state electrons of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo as illustrated in fig 4 e pani not only improved the photocatalytic performance of tio2 but also other semiconductor like zinc selenide nanoparticles 19 the floating composite photocatalyst also can be fabricated through immersing the canvas non woven textured into iron precursor solution fe no3 3 9h2o 48 the material was stirred for 1 h contact time before dried in oven for 12 h at 150 c fig 5 concluded fe successfully coated on the canvas through dip coating process fig 5 a b showed the color change of the neat canvas from white to reddish brown after coated by iron nitrate solution in order to further observe the morphology of the coated iron on the canvas sem images of before and after treatment were analysed from fig 5 c f impregnation of iron iii oxide can be clearly observed by homogeneous distribution of the particles throughout the microfibers structure of the canvas fig 5 g indicated the removal of organic dye from the aqueous solution almost completed due to the significant decrease in the band of 552 nm represent the character of the rh b pigment fig 5 h demonstrated in the presence of the catalyst and uv light the degradation of rh b is almost 100 after 90 min these findings indicated the floating canvas are promising solution for contaminant degradation by solar remediation through non mechanically stirring and non oxygenated reservoirs this is based on the maximum light utilization that obtained by the entangled fibers that result in higher radical formation rates and oxidation efficiencies 2 2 2 spin coating researcher also attracted on spin coating technique for fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst for example guo et al fabricated floating graphitic carbon nitride polyetherimide gc3n4 pei by spin coating 40 firstly they synthesized g c3n4 from urea through heat treatment then they are simplified dissolved pei particles within dichloromethane then mixed with the g c3n4 powder by subsequent ultrasonication and centrifugation for 10 min with the rotating speed of 4000 rpm the fabricated gc3n4 pei was tested for degradation of methyl orange under light irradiation of table lamp they compared the photodegradation efficiency of methyl orange by neat g c3n4 powder and gc3n4 pei composite with stirring and without stirring the results showed methyl orange was degraded 91 0 by g c3n4 powder and 80 0 by gc3n4 pei composite with stirring however without stirring condition the photodegradation of gc3n4 dropped to 37 0 which is lower than 55 0 by gc3n4 pei composite this finding indicated the floating gc3n4 pei composite photocatalyst utilized more solar energy for better photodegradation performance then the submerged gc3n4 powder photocatalyst that require stirring process 2 2 3 spray coating besides than fabricated floating photocatalyst using dip coating technique the floating photocatalyst also can be fabricated through spray coating magalhÃ£es and lago prepared floating photocatalyst by spraying a polystyrene pst solution in ethyl acetate on expanded polystyrene eps beads and tio2 34 eps beads were selected as floating support is due their light and floatable properties furthermore eps also having good chemical thermal and mechanical stability the floating tio2 eps composite was dried at 80 c for 1 h to remove the ethyl acetate before subjected to vigorous strring in water for 2 h to remove any loosely attached tio2 from the eps surface spray coating is suitable for short run fabrication because the process is fast and simple however this kind of fabrication technique often leads to waste of materials due to over spraying it is also very difficult to contol the coating thickness on the surface of the floating materials 2 3 hydrothermal fabrication of floatable composite photocatalyst by hydrothermal is carried out in one pot teflon autoclaves which are tightly sealed in stainless steel chamber that can withstand high pressure and temperatures for a long duration time the main fabrication parameters of this method are the synthesis temperature duration pressure and initial ph of the medium in the system 39 this fabrication technique is one of the great interest due to its potential to develop homogenous composite photocatalyst in one step process furthermore this technique also affordable and environmentally friendly numerous researchers applied hydrothermal technique for coating tio2 onto floatable materials such as surface of woods 39 56 57 recently darkhosh et al successfully developed a novel visible light water floating catalyst called as cufeo2 expanded perlite for degradation of methylene blue 32 in their study the cufeo2 was directly deposited on the surface of expanded perlite through one step hydrothermal reaction at 180 c within 24 h the morphology characterization analysis indicated that the rhombohedral cufeo2 homogeneously distributed on the perlite surface as shown by fig 6 a c as shown in fig 6 d with the presence of visible light the cufeo2 composite photocatalyst was reported excellent photodegradation efficiency of 99 0 for degradation of methylene blue the excellent photocatalytic activity of this composite photocatalyst is resulted by the synergistic influence and interaction between photocatalytic and floatable properties of cufeo2 and perlite in the moderate hydrothermal reaction that ensure the reaction at the surface of the composite photocatalyst as illustrated in fig 6 e researchers also demonstrated that fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst can be revealed by combination of hydrothermal and liquid phase deposition process for example khan et al 2019 reported the floating reduced graphene oxide quantum dots bismuth bismuth tungstate rgo qds bi bi2wo6 expanded perlite nanocomposite photocatalyst can be fabricated by hydrothermal technique and followed by liquid phase deposition process 35 as illustrated in fig 7 a the expanded perlite required pre treatment by soaked overnight in 10 wt hcl before being sieved uniformly through a 40 mesh screen then the treated perlite was soaked in d h2o for 1 h before dried in oven for 24 h at 80 c the reduced graphene oxide quantum dots rgo qds was firstly synthesized by hummer s method and treated with strong acid as illustrated in fig 7 b they prepared the floating bi bi2wo6 expanded perlite nanocomposite by hydrothermal method hydrothermal synthesis was carried out by using precursors bismuth nitrate bi no3 35 h2o and sodium tungstate na2wo42 h2o with the presence of pvp k30 and citric acid at synthesis temperature of 170 0 c for 10 h then rgo qds was deposited on the bi bi2wo6 expanded perlite by the facile liquid phase deposition process their result shows the significant photodegradation efficiency on rhodamine b and phenol which recorded 95 0 and 93 0 with the presence of visible light irradiation researchers have demonstrated solvothermal technique can be employed to grow tio2 photocatalyst on the graphene substrate to form floatable photocatalyst in the water 58 schematic diagram of formation floating tio2 graphene photocatalyst was demonstrated in fig 8 in their study expanded graphite was first heated at high temperature with the presence of oleum to enlarge the distance between adjacent graphitic layers also to enhance the number of surface groups then ti precursor solution tetrabutyl titanate in ethanol was mixed with oleum treated expanded graphite before filled in teflon autoclave and kept at 180 c for 3 6 12 or 24 h this solvothermal process allowed in situ growth of tio2 nanoparticles in the interlayers of the expanded graphite forming tio2 graphene composites even though solvothermal offers fast and simple technique of fabrication of floating nanocomposite photocatalyst but there are limitations of this technique one of them is low hydrothermal temperature is not suitable for transformation of amorphous structure inorganic particles into crystalline structure which reduce the photocatalytic activity of the particles then the usage of photocatalytic precursor solution is not recommended for this kind of fabrication technique secondly high temperature of hydrothermal process is not suitable for organic floatable substrate such as polymeric based materials due to lower thermal stability the structure of the polymeric substrate might deteriorate during solvothermal process hence selection of the substrate needs to be strict and carefully analysed before proceed to fabrication third fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst might resulted in heterogeneous or diverse distribution of photocatalyst particles on the surface of substrate this is due to the floatability of the substrate and hydrolysis process of development of the photocatalyst occurred at the bottom of the autoclave flask which discrete the uniform deposition of the photocatalyst on the floating substrate as illustrated in fig 9 hence continuous stirring is required to ensure homogeneous dispersion of developed photocatalyst on the surface of the floating substrate 2 4 solvent casting another technique to fabricate floating composite photocatalyst that attracted attention of researcher is solvent casting singh et al introduced two routes called as 1 impregnation solvent cast and 2 strewing solvent cast technique 49 fig 10 a b showed the developed floating photocatalyst ag tio2 onto into polystyrene ps fabricated by impregnation solvent cast and strewing solvent cast respectively the fabricated composite photocatalyst films were subjected to photodegradation of methylene blue in aqueous solution under both solar and uv irradiation they found the maximum photodegradation of methylene blue irradiated by solar light by strewn solvent cast photocatalyst and impregnated solvent cast photocatalyst were about 83 0 and 68 0 respectively while under uv irradiation the photodegradation of methylene blue by strewn solvent cast photocatalyst and impregnated solvent cast photocatalyst were about 94 0 and 86 0 respectively this result indicated photocatalyst film that fabricated by strewn solvent cast having higher photodegradation performance this can be ascribed by the location of the tio2 photocatalyst particles that adhered externally onto the surface of ps as compared to floating photocatalyst that fabricated via impregnated solvent cast strewn photocatalyst have a greater probability interacting with the methylene blue molecules which enhance the photodegradation performance 2 5 surface modification surface modification of the floating substrate could enhance the interaction or deposition of photocatalyst particles onto the surface of the substrate commonly the surfaces of the substrates were treated by strong acid or alkaline to make the them became rougher before deposition of the photocatalyst according to wang et al 2015 they used the method of surface modification to load hollow tio2 onto the surface of hollow glass microsphere hgms 43 this method offered production of floating photocatalyst with larger specific surface area and much better photocatalytic performance briefly as demonstrated in fig 11 a they modified the surface of hgms by hydrofluoric acid hf and vinyl trimethoxysilane vtms to make the surface became rougher and appropriate to load pst particles pst particles was used as the template for precipitation of amorphous tio2 through hydrolysis process then the crystallization of amorphous tio2 was proceed through calcination 550 c and directly removed pst by combustion fig 11 show the sem images of the b pst c hgms corroded by hf and modified by vtms d pst loaded on hgms e hgmsht after calcination at 550 c based on previous studies most of the floating photocatalysts were prepared by coating the commercial photocatalyst within the floatable substrate besides that sol gel and hydrothermal technique are often used by mixing the substrate with the precursor solution of the photocatalyst commonly in order to further enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst addition of activation agent during preparation process was suggested however those techniques involved physical interaction which limiting the stability and could be resulted in leaking of the photocatalyst from the surface of the floating substrate photocatalyst particles tend to peel off and shrink during the crystallization and calcination process hence decline the photocatalytic performance due to the reduction of active surface area in order to overcome the limitation production of floating photocatalyst through surface modification could be consider as promising alternative to load photocatalyst on the surface of floating substrate materials 2 6 three dimensional 3d printing most recently fabrication of floating photocatalyst by 3d printing has attracted much attention due to the economical efficient easily implantable and environmentally compatible process according to martÃ­n de vidales et al they fabricated tio2 ldpe by different method 1 mixing tio2 and ldpe in a hot cylinder mixer 2 using o xylene as dispersing and 3 using anionic surfactant as dispersing agent 47 the scheme of fabrication of the photocatalyst was illustrated in fig 12 a the mixture then was chopped and extruded as the three different filaments called as ldpe tio2 cm ldpe tio2 o xylene and ldpe tio2 surfactant respectively the filaments were printed as meshes in a fused deposition modelling 3d printer fig 12 b d showed the i sem surface images ii eds mapping and iii eds analysis of the fabricated b ldpe tio2 cm c ldpe tio2 o xylene dld pe ldpe tio2 surfactant the observation can be made all the photocatalyst particles were highly dispersed and agglomerated on the surface of meshes which indicated when an anionic surfactant or o xylene were used as dispersing media no apparent improvement is achieved and significant agglomerations can be observed from the results they found the maximum degradation by photocatalyst in meshes form that obtained from 3d printing is significantly higher than the plate geometry the enhancement of the process efficiency is attributed to the higher active surface available for oxidation of pollutant furthermore the adhesion of tio2 photocatalyst and polymer was improved by extrusion and 3d printing process hence fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst by 3d printing offer promising solution for photodegradation of contaminant in aquous system 2 7 low temperature ultrasonic and deposition even though researchers reported physical approach on deposition of photocatalyst on floating substrate such as sol gel dip coating hydrothermal is an efficient and cost effective but most the mentioned techniques are not suitable to be used for coating tio2 on polymer substrate this is due to high temperature calcination for transformation of photoactive anatase structure of tio2 might destroyed the structure of the polymer substrate hence zhang et al introduced a low temperature ultrasonic and deposition approach for efficiently coated tio2 onto the polyurethane foam puf 38 zhang et al utilized puf as substrate for the photocatalyst because of it has a rougher surface high specific surface area high porosity as well as light weight the omt powders were used as precursor and dissolved in absolute alcohol with a little portion of concentrated nitric acid the solution was vibrated by ultrasonic vibration for 30 min at 80 c then puf was added to the dispersed omt ethanol solution before ultrasonic vibrated for another 30 min the omt coated puf then was dried at 60 c for 24 h to form tio2 puf floating composite photocatalyst this photocatalyst was analysed for the simultaneous degradation of organic dyes methylene blue rhodamine b and methyl orange and reduction of heavy metal hexavalent chromium cr vi into trivalent chromium cr iii they found with the presence of solar irradiation tio2 puf that fabricated via low temperature ultrasonic approach exhibited good adsorption performance and high photocatalytic activity 90 4 97 4 3 photocatalytic mechanism by floating photocatalyst 3 1 organic pollutants organic contaminants are the major pollutant in wastewater 59 primarily organic contaminants composed of carbon hydrogen and other elements such as nitrogen amine amide azo aromatic compound and etc they could be various wastes like dye phenols alcohol diesel aldehydes antibiotics pharmaceutical and etc fig 13 shows the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of rhodamine b rhb by cds ep floating photocatalyst 42 the cds nanoparticles were attracted to the partially positive charges on the surface of ep due to the content of alumina and silica as the floatable properties of ep the visible light irradiated the cds to excite its electrons to the conduction band the presence of oxygen molecules in the atmosphere accept the photogenerated electrons and superoxide is produced meanwhile the h in the valence band is captured by h2o molecules to form hydroxyl radicals formation of superoxides and hydroxyl radicals can degrade rhb into co2 and h2o in other study wang et al successfully synthesized egc based ni n tio2 floating photocatalyst for adsorption and degradation of diesel oil 51 the proposed mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of diesel oil was depicted in fig 14 as shown in the schematic diagram in the visible light region ni n codoping showed effective absorption which attributed to the charge transfer between the orbital d of the dopants and band gap states of tio2 the synthesized ni n tio2 egc photocatalyst generates h and photogenerated electrons in the presence of visible light eq 1 the h react with water or oh that adsorbed on the surface of photocatalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals eqs 2 and 3 meanwhile the photogenerated electrons can be trapped by the oxygen molecule that absorbed on the surface of catalyst to produce superoxide eq 4 additionally the superoxide can further react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals eq 5 these reactive oxygen radicals can react with diesel oil to mineralize the hydrocarbon components as shown in eq 6 1 ni n tio2 pegc hv ni n tio2 pegc h e 2 h h2oads oh h 3 h oh ads oh 4 e o2 ads o2 5 o2 2h2oads 2 oh 2oh o2 6 diesel oil oh o2 co2

to the toxicity and carcinogenicity effects towards living bodies recently the treatment of harmful heavy metal like hexavalent cr vi with the presence of dyes were studied by zhang et al 38 fig 15 shows the removal of cr vi by photocatalytic activity of the floating omt puf by reduction of cr vi under sunlight in different coexisting dye systems the main photocatalytic reaction mechanism of the simultaneous dye oxidation and reduction of cr vi was described in eqs 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 as expressed below 7 tio2 hv hvb ecb 8 ecb crvi criii 9 hvb dye pollutants co2 h2o 10 ecb o2 o2 11 o2

irradiation the electrons are released from the vb to cb to give electron hole pairs the electron at cb ecb could reduce the cr vi into cr iii additionally the h ions adsorbed on the surface of tio2 allows the adsorbed h to trap electrons to form hads and facilitate the reduction of toxic cr vi into less harmful cr iii as expressed in eq 15 simultaneously the dye pollutants were degraded by superoxide o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh that generated by hydrolysis of water in the presence of o2 4 future directions and conclusions basically the ability of the composite photocatalyst to float on the surface of water permits more efficient light illumination and oxygenation which are fundamental for the photocatalytic process in the future more studies and research work on fabrication of floating composite photocatalyst are still required to enhance the performance of the photocatalyst this study can be a guideline to design and fabricate the superior materials with photocatalytic and floatable properties for wastewater treatment first an excellent non toxic and biodegradable floatable substrate and photocatalyst need to be explored this is due to the longer contact time on the contaminated water could deteriorate the floating properties of the substrate hence utilization of the biodegradable substrate could solve the environmental issue such as post treatment issue by letting them settled down at the bottom of treatment tank second adhesion of photocatalyst on the surface of the of the floatable substrate must be further improved because it is the major key to down to earth application of the photocatalyst leaking of photocatalyst from floatable substrate could led to secondary pollution to environment third more research work on development of visible driven floating photocatalyst should be intensified rather than uv driven photocatalyst this is due to visible light is more accessible especially in local remote area modification of photocatalyst particle by reduction of band gap could further enhance the photocatalytic performance fourth other potential semiconductor based photocatalyst need to be explored that fulfilled practical application instead of focusing on existing semiconductor based photocatalyst semiconductor like perovskite could overcome the limitation of the common photocatalyst by having lower bandgap and utilized visible light irradiation rather than uv irradiation last but not least green synthesis of floating photocatalyst by using plant based or agricultural waste as reducing or stabilizing agent should be further explored commonly chemical additives were employed as stabilizing agent which contribute to secondary pollution as conclusion more effort should be devoted to deeper understanding on fabrication utilization and mechanism of floating composite photocatalyst on wastewater treatment 5 declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

13977,the electroplating industrial wastewater is an environmental issue due to the high metal concentration and difficulty in disposing of the final residue generated by the formation of sludge when using the precipitation method in this context we propose to remove nickel from wastewater from the jewelry industry wastewater to obtain corrosion resistant ni w alloys by the electroplating process the concentration of nickel removed from the effluent was quantified by ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy indicating removal close to 40 x ray diffraction xrd patterns showed the crystallinity of the deposits as well as the scanning electron microscope sem with the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx technique determined homogeneity and the composition with 76 wt ni 24 wt w for the optimized alloy besides corrosion resistance tests by linear polarization indicated an rp value of 29 199 Ï m2 keywords environmentally friendly process new material nickel tungsten corrosion resistance 1 introduction in general the jewelry electroplating industries use the process of ion exchange or chemical precipitation for the wastewater treatment the disadvantage of ion exchange is the high initial investment coexisting ions interference high acidity required and the non recovery of resins contaminated with toxic metals 1 in the precipitation process in addition to the disadvantage of consuming chemicals useful for the precipitation reaction the residual sludge generated after separation from the liquid phase must be stored or disposed of in appropriate landfills 2 4 the electrodeposition technique is a viable alternative for toxic metals removal the main advantages of using electrodeposition technology when compared to removal conventional processes are 1 the removal of the metal from the solution and not just the transfer of the ion to the solid phase 2 the reuse of the metal 3 the use of electricity as a clean reagent 4 the ease in the optimization process through variable control 5 in the electrodeposition process an electrolytic cell contains the electrolyte rich in ionic salts of the metal to be deposited the most common electrolytic baths are inorganic containing metals such as cu zn ni in addition to noble metals au ag pt the electrochemical reaction consists of the exchange of electrons between two redox reactions the reduction of certain components in the electrolyte occurs due to the passage of an electric current through the electrolytic solution however this electrochemical reaction is processed exclusively at the electrode electrolyte interface the deposition of noble metal alloys allows the production of decorative items improves the resistance and appearance of the coated parts besides to the physical aspect metal alloys are widely used as a protective film for anticorrosive aspects the application of tungsten w alloys has become of great interest to researchers due to its composition and structural characteristics the high melting point 3410 c makes this metal difficult to deposit on the surface of any other metal as it has a low coefficient of linear expansion 4 3 10 6 c and high thermal conductivity 173 wm 1k 1 besides w is a non carcinogenic metal and non toxic to aquatic environments 6 tungsten has applications from the manufacture of jewelry from scratch resistant hypoallergenic connections to analytical instruments such as a mass spectrometer the electrodeposition is only successful when accompanied by metals from the fe group fe co and ni 7 9 this phenomenon called induced codeposition 10 also occurs with mo 11 the non deposition of pure w is explained by the partial reduction of the tungstate anion wo4 2 for some oxides of this metal on the cathode surface and due to the low reduction potential compared to the reduction of h ions in the solution 12 in this way we proposed to form corrosion resistant ni w alloys from the jewelry industry wastewater and quantify the ni removal efficiency the morphology composition and physical aspects in addition to corrosion tests such as polarization resistance rp and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were performed for the coatings 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater characterization the jewelry industry wastewater contained sulfate chloride boric acid and levelers brighteners and humectant additives the ni concentration of 0 846 m was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkin elmer optima 8300 a technique consisting of ionization of atoms in the plasma which due to excitation the electrons of the atom or ion jump to a higher energy level after the relaxation of the atom to its initial state the energy is emitted in the form of photons with a specific wavelength of the element 2 2 electrodeposition assays the ni w alloys were deposited on both sides of a flat copper plate with 0 02 m on the side of a square which resulted in 8 10 4 m2 of surface area coupled to the rotating electrode through a cooper rod the substrate preparation was performed to allow the quality of the metallic alloy deposition mechanical treatment was applied with 400 and 1200 sandpaper to remove oxidation level and polish the surface chemical treatment was performed using 10 wt naoh to eliminate fats and 1 v v h2so4 for surface activation both lasting 1 min deionized water to dilute the nickel concentration in 0 1 m sodium tungstate na2wo4 in concentrations from 0 075 to 0 3 m and ammonium citrate nh4 2c6h6o7 0 27 m to solubilize sodium tungstate and promoting the complexation of species responsible for ni deposition were added in the wastewater to compose the electrolytic bath the range of electric current density applied was from 100 to 500 a m 2 with a potentiostat versastat 3 princeton applied research and the bath temperature was maintained at 25 60 c with a water bath the substrate was coupled to the rotating electrode pattern 616a princeton applied research with a speed of 50 rpm to maintain homogeneity and allow the release of hydrogen gas a hollow platinum mesh worked as a counter electrode and reference the tests were carried out lasting 3600 s using a 23 experimental design to evaluate the deposition efficiency of the ni w alloy on the cu substrate the influence of three variables na2wo4 concentration cw electric current density i and bath temperature t on nickel removal was analyzed two different levels 1 and 1 of the variables were evaluated according to table 1 in addition to the central point 0 performed in triplicate to identify the effect of each variable as a function of deposition efficiency the ranges of the variables were determined according to a previous study 13 2 3 faradaic efficiency and

evaluated by scanning electron microscope sem model leo 440i equipped with edx leo electron microscopy oxford cambridge england model 6070 physical characteristics such as crystallinity were performed by the x ray diffraction xrd philips analytical x ray diffractometer and x pert mpd model with k Î± cu scanning method 40 kv voltage 2Î¸ and speed 0 033 s 1 with a wavelength of 1 54 Ã¥ 2 5 electrochemical corrosion testing the tafel extrapolation methods and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis specified in the standard 14 were applied to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the ni w coatings the tests occurred in a 3 electrode cell with ag agcl as a reference and pt as a counter electrode in a saline medium composed of 0 1 m nacl potentials between the range of 0 25 v to 0 25 v around the open circuit potential with a scanning speed of 0 01 v s 1 were applied for the extrapolation tafel lines for the eis test the potential measured in open circuit for an hour with an amplitude of 0 01 v was applied varying the frequency from 106 to 0 01 hz with the analysis of the data through the extrapolation of the tafel curves the values of polarization resistance rp corrosion potential ecorr and density of corrosion current density icorr were obtained nyquist diagrams generated by the eis tests estimated the equivalent electrical system 3 results and discussion 3 1 study of parameters for electroplating and nickel removal preliminary studies indicated an increase in ni removal by increasing electrodeposition time however after 1 h the coating easily detached from the substrate which is not suitable for application as an anticorrosive alloy electrodeposition lasting 6 h can remove 98 ni 15 in chemical precipitation ni removal reaches 100 however it requires a longer time of at least 24 h which may vary according to the study with application of silica xerogel which the treatment time was 72 h 16 the ion exchange treatment even though it is fast the resin synthesis process is not environmentally friendly and the regeneration of the spent resin through chemical compounds is the main disadvantage of these sorbents 17 however high ni removals such as 99 5 0 2 can be achieved by this treatment 18 table 2 shows the results of the removal percentages the deposited mass and the composition of the ni w alloy according to table 2 faradaic efficiency is not directly proportional to the ni removal from the electrolytic bath comparing the data from experiment 1 faradaic efficiency 3 5 and ni removal 24 with experiment 2 faradaic efficiency 19 4 and ni removal 20 there is no relationship between the responses since faradaic efficiency is only related to the amount of electrical energy used during the electrodeposition process in addition the use of three points in the sample for the edx analysis may not represent the sample composition as a whole decreasing faradaic efficiency for the ni removal analysis the increase in na2wo4 concentration influenced the removal percentage however the greatest effect on the response was the interaction of the electric current density with the temperature being inversely proportional data evaluation was performed using the statistica 8 0 software considering pure error and 95 confidence level among the results of the 11 experiments interactions of up to three variables were considered significant within the 95 confidence level the coefficient of linear and adjusted determination was 94 3 and 81 1 respectively eq 3 relates faradaic efficiency to na2wo4 concentration bath temperature and electric current density 3 Îµ 21 1 c w 7 9 i 17 4 t 6 9 c w i 5 2 c w t 6 9 c w i t 25 0 where cw na2wo4 concentration i electric current density and t bath temperature in the encoded values statistical analysis provided a linear model indicating that the three variables influenced faradaic efficiency with significant effects and interactions between them the studied interval considered the greater na2wo4 solubility 0 3 m in the ni bath according to preliminary studies the temperature and the concentration of sodium tungstate showed the greatest effect since the increase of both variables together provided greater faradaic efficiency as shown in fig 1 a which fixed the electric current density at the central point 300 a m 2 as indicated by the red color in the response contours faradaic efficiencies close to 45 are achieved with the na2wo4 concentration of 0 3 m and 60 c the model proved to be significant according to fig 1b which indicates the normal distribution of residues showing most points organized along the straight line statistical analysis has proven to be a useful tool capable of describing the electrodeposition of metal alloys according to several studies 19 22 3 2 morphology and composition the characterization of the coatings was carried out through micrographs compositions and diffractograms of all coatings for experiment 6 micrographs were not obtained due to the redundancy of the copper substrate coating fig 2 a c shows the micrographs of experiment 2 na2wo4 concentration of 0 3 m electric current density of 100 a m 2 25 c and experiment 8 na2wo4 concentration 0 3 m electric current density of 500 a m 2 60 c the presence of cracks was directly proportional to the increase in temperature and electric current density demonstrating a higher surface tension in experiment 8 compared to experiment 2 the three intensity peaks that the diffractograms presented were at 2Î¸ 43 7 50 9 and 74 8 with the crystallographic planes 111 200 and 220 respectively corresponding of the centered face cubic structure of the ni17w3 alloy jcpds no 65 4828 the plane 111 shows the ni w structure since no peaks referring to the body centered cubic structure of w it was verified the w incorporation in the ni matrix 23 the plane 200 at peak 50 9 refers to pure nickel that may be superimposed on the ni4w compound 24 the plane 220 represents one of the crystallographic planes of the face centered cubic structure nih changing the orientation of ni 25 when the diffractograms of experiments 2 69 wt ni 31 wt w and 8 68 wt ni 32 wt w were compared the contribution to the reduction of peak intensity was observed indicating a phase transformation with increasing temperature and electric current density although experiments 2 and 8 have a similar metallic composition there is a strong relationship between the physical structures of the deposits with the temperature and the density of the applied current such as the increase in the amount of cracks fig 3 a c presents the micrographs and diffractograms of experiment 1 na2wo4 concentration 0 075 m electric current density 100 a m 2 25 c and experiment 10 na2wo4 concentration 0 075 m electric current density 300 a m 2 42 5 c the comparison of these two experiments demonstrated similar behavior to experiments 2 and 8 with reduced peaks in the diffractogram and increased cracks with increasing temperature and electric current density in experiment 10 the formation of two close peaks was evidenced and both are identified by the plan 111 the diffractograms of experiments 3 4 5 and 7 are shown in fig 4 using sem and the xrd technique the crystallinity and the ni w composition in all deposits were verified by the diffractograms the predominance of ni in the alloy composition influences the crystalline formation of the coatings amorphization of structures is unlikely with high concentrations of nickel regardless of electrodeposition parameters 22 the crystallite size was calculated by scherrer equation and the value of 9 8 0 8 nm was similar to a study on ni w alloys deposited with 2000 a m 2 which the value was 13 nm 26 fig 5 shows the micrographs of experiments 3 4 5 and 7 experiments 3 fig 5a and 4 fig 5b were deposited with the same values of temperature 25 c and electric current density 500 a m 2 both had a similar metallic composition respectively 82 wt ni 18 wt w and 88 wt ni 12 wt w through the micrographs similarities in the physical characteristics of the coating were observed although the na2wo4 concentration variable was significant for nickel removal this variable does not have great influences on the physical aspects of the coatings however the electric current density and temperature variables were crucial in the formation of cracks and homogeneity experiments 5 and 7 had the same temperature values 60 c and na2wo4 concentration 0 075 m during electrodeposition both with similar morphology and metallic composition with 86 wt ni 14 wt w and 88 wt ni 12 wt w respectively the formation of clusters and the overlapping of ni nodules and fissures were identified in these samples according to fig 5c and d in solid substitutional solutions formed by two elements a large significant difference between the atomic diameters of the alloy metals may distort the crystal lattice cause deformations in the coating the dispersion degree of the microstructure may increase and precipitate as structural heterogeneities during the electrodeposition process 27 according to a previous study 28 high temperature values generate fewer uniform surfaces 3 3 corrosion tests electrochemical studies of corrosion resistance with the relevant ni w alloys showed greater adhesion to the substrate the results were obtained using the tafel extrapolation and eis methods tafel polarization experiments are shown in fig 6 the values of corrosion current icorr and polarization resistance rp were estimated by the stern geary equation as described and are shown in table 3 the polarization resistance was inversely proportional to the corrosion current the composition of the alloy influences the corrosion resistance since the increase in the percentage of w provides greater resistance to corrosion in the alloys of the w group this evaluation and comparison can be performed when the morphologies have similar aspects 22 29 according to table 3 there was no significant difference in the alloy composition however different morphologies were obtained experiment 1 76 wt ni 24 wt w and experiment 2 69 wt ni 31 wt w present the highest percentages of w in the composition experiment 2 showed cracks fig 5 justifying the low value of the polarization resistance however experiment 1 did not present cracks and had greater resistance to polarization thus the coating morphology had a greater influence on corrosion resistance than the alloy composition as well as experiment 3 had a lower value of polarization resistance and significant amounts of cracks fig 7 presents the eis results and the equivalent circuit in the form of nyquist diagrams indicating a small electrical resistance to the electrolyte in the high frequency region and the capacitive arc of the electrical double layer higher real impedance values in experiment 1 showed greater polarization resistance in tafel s results randles equivalent circuits were applied to adjust the data the equivalent circuits of the nyquist diagrams are associated with a circuit configuration including constant phase element cpe which characterize an imperfect capacitor the electrolyte resistance re and the coating resistance rf the transfer of interfacial charge is observed at high frequencies composed of a semicircle on the nyquist diagram 30 warburg type impedance provides capacitive behavior at low frequencies 31 not observed in this study the cpe model is the replacement of the double layer capacitance in electrodes with a rough 32 porous appearance 33 or composed of passivated films and coatings 34 35 these types of electrodes showed frequency dispersions generated by the heterogeneity of the interface 36 table 4 shows the simulation parameters by the spectrum analyzer software the rf resulting from the adjustment of the eis tests was consistent with the icorr values obtained from the tafel extrapolation demonstrating a high corrosion resistance of experiment 1 the maximum rf error e was 7 7 in experiment 7 the results of n were between 0 5 and 1 and n values close to 1 indicates the electrode surface is rough almost all experiments showed similar re 4 conclusions ni w alloys were successfully deposited using wastewater from the electroplating industry the na2wo4 concentration and the temperature of the electrolytic solution significantly influenced the faradaic yield the na2wo4 concentration and the rotating cathode influenced the ni removal and the amount of deposited mass the metallic deposits showed homogeneity and adhesion to the substrate and ni removal close to 40 this optimum point occurred with the na2wo4 concentration of 0 075 m an electric current density of 100 a m 2 a temperature of 25 c and a rotating cathode of 50 rpm the deposit characterization by xrd and sem did not indicate cracks and the composition of the alloy was 76 wt ni and 24 wt w the results of the corrosion showed that the homogeneity of the coating and the absence of cracks reflected in the increased resistance to corrosion for experiment 1 the rp value was 29 199 Ï m2 besides the presence of

centered cubic structure of w it was verified the w incorporation in the ni matrix 23 the plane 200 at peak 50 9 refers to pure nickel that may be superimposed on the ni4w compound 24 the plane 220 represents one of the crystallographic planes of the face centered cubic structure nih changing the orientation of ni 25 when the diffractograms of experiments 2 69 wt ni 31 wt w and 8 68 wt ni 32 wt w were compared the contribution to the reduction of peak intensity was observed indicating a phase transformation with increasing temperature and electric current density although experiments 2 and 8 have a similar metallic composition there is a strong relationship between the physical structures of the deposits with the temperature and the density of the applied current such as the increase in the amount of cracks fig 3 a c presents the micrographs and diffractograms of experiment 1 na2wo4 concentration 0 075 m electric current density 100 a m 2 25 c and experiment 10 na2wo4 concentration 0 075 m electric current density 300 a m 2 42 5 c the comparison of these two experiments demonstrated similar behavior to experiments 2 and 8 with reduced peaks in the diffractogram and increased cracks with increasing temperature and electric current density in experiment 10 the formation of two close peaks was evidenced and both are identified by the plan 111 the diffractograms of experiments 3 4 5 and 7 are shown in fig 4 using sem and the xrd technique the crystallinity and the ni w composition in all deposits were verified by the diffractograms the predominance of ni in the alloy composition influences the crystalline formation of the coatings amorphization of structures is unlikely with high concentrations of nickel regardless of electrodeposition parameters 22 the crystallite size was calculated by scherrer equation and the value of 9 8 0 8 nm was similar to a study on ni w alloys deposited with 2000 a m 2 which the value was 13 nm 26 fig 5 shows the micrographs of experiments 3 4 5 and 7 experiments 3 fig 5a and 4 fig 5b were deposited with the same values of temperature 25 c and electric current density 500 a m 2 both had a similar metallic composition respectively 82 wt ni 18 wt w and 88 wt ni 12 wt w through the micrographs similarities in the physical characteristics of the coating were observed although the na2wo4 concentration variable was significant for nickel removal this variable does not have great influences on the physical aspects of the coatings however the electric current density and temperature variables were crucial in the formation of cracks and homogeneity experiments 5 and 7 had the same temperature values 60 c and na2wo4 concentration 0 075 m during electrodeposition both with similar morphology and metallic composition with 86 wt ni 14 wt w and 88 wt ni 12 wt w respectively the formation of clusters and the overlapping of ni nodules and fissures were identified in these samples according to fig 5c and d in solid substitutional solutions formed by two elements a large significant difference between the atomic diameters of the alloy metals may distort the crystal lattice cause deformations in the coating the dispersion degree of the microstructure may increase and precipitate as structural heterogeneities during the electrodeposition process 27 according to a previous study 28 high temperature values generate fewer uniform surfaces 3 3 corrosion tests electrochemical studies of corrosion resistance with the relevant ni w alloys showed greater adhesion to the substrate the results were obtained using the tafel extrapolation and eis methods tafel polarization experiments are shown in fig 6 the values of corrosion current icorr and polarization resistance rp were estimated by the stern geary equation as described and are shown in table 3 the polarization resistance was inversely proportional to the corrosion current the composition of the alloy influences the corrosion resistance since the increase in the percentage of w provides greater resistance to corrosion in the alloys of the w group this evaluation and comparison can be performed when the morphologies have similar aspects 22 29 according to table 3 there was no significant difference in the alloy composition however different morphologies were obtained experiment 1 76 wt ni 24 wt w and experiment 2 69 wt ni 31 wt w present the highest percentages of w in the composition experiment 2 showed cracks fig 5 justifying the low value of the polarization resistance however experiment 1 did not present cracks and had greater resistance to polarization thus the coating morphology had a greater influence on corrosion resistance than the alloy composition as well as experiment 3 had a lower value of polarization resistance and significant amounts of cracks fig 7 presents the eis results and the equivalent circuit in the form of nyquist diagrams indicating a small electrical resistance to the electrolyte in the high frequency region and the capacitive arc of the electrical double layer higher real impedance values in experiment 1 showed greater polarization resistance in tafel s results randles equivalent circuits were applied to adjust the data the equivalent circuits of the nyquist diagrams are associated with a circuit configuration including constant phase element cpe which characterize an imperfect capacitor the electrolyte resistance re and the coating resistance rf the transfer of interfacial charge is observed at high frequencies composed of a semicircle on the nyquist diagram 30 warburg type impedance provides capacitive behavior at low frequencies 31 not observed in this study the cpe model is the replacement of the double layer capacitance in electrodes with a rough 32 porous appearance 33 or composed of passivated films and coatings 34 35 these types of electrodes showed frequency dispersions generated by the heterogeneity of the interface 36 table 4 shows the simulation parameters by the spectrum analyzer software the rf resulting from the adjustment of the eis tests was consistent with the icorr values obtained from the tafel extrapolation demonstrating a high corrosion resistance of experiment 1 the maximum rf error e was 7 7 in experiment 7 the results of n were between 0 5 and 1 and n values close to 1 indicates the electrode surface is rough almost all experiments showed similar re 4 conclusions ni w alloys were successfully deposited using wastewater from the electroplating industry the na2wo4 concentration and the temperature of the electrolytic solution significantly influenced the faradaic yield the na2wo4 concentration and the rotating cathode influenced the ni removal and the amount of deposited mass the metallic deposits showed homogeneity and adhesion to the substrate and ni removal close to 40 this optimum point occurred with the na2wo4 concentration of 0 075 m an electric current density of 100 a m 2 a temperature of 25 c and a rotating cathode of 50 rpm the deposit characterization by xrd and sem did not indicate cracks and the composition of the alloy was 76 wt ni and 24 wt w the results of the corrosion showed that the homogeneity of the coating and the absence of cracks reflected in the increased resistance to corrosion for experiment 1 the rp value was 29 199 Ï m2 besides the presence of

13978,in this work a dual layer nanfibrous san4 hips membrane has been fabricated via the gas assisted electrospinning and employed for industrial textile wastewater treatment by direct contact membrane distillation dcmd the obtained results showed that the new membrane is robust and able to remove the contaminants remarkably with almost 99 28 97 93 and 100 reductions for cod bod and color respectively however a flux decline of up to 42 58 was observed after 48 h dcmd process concerning the rejection results it can be concluded that the flux decline is mainly caused by the membrane fouling rather than the partial pore wetting as the membrane remained hydrophobic after the 48 h experiment the surface contact angle reduced from 143 2 to 121 5 foulants accumulation on the membrane surface can increase the mass transfer resistance of vapor molecules this can considerably reduce the productivity the obtained results were also compared with the literature on the other md processes as well as the conventional pressure driven membrane processes further studies on enhancing the membrane surface properties are required to control and reduce the fouling tendency caused by the contaminants in the industrial textile wastewater this is of crucial for the long term dcmd performance keywords industrial textile wastewater direct contact membrane distillation dcmd dual layer nanofibrous membrane san4 hips gas assisted electrospinning 1 introduction recently the world is faced with severe global concerns including a lack of freshwater availability and environmental pollutions 1 concerning these issues increasing the freshwater demand and decreasing the accessibility of useable water sources are the key factors that have led to a widespread search for alternative water resources 2 3 wastewater generated in public uses and various industrial sectors can then be investigated as a promising source for water makeup in industry in better words the wastewater treatment is an in place strategy for recovering and reusing the polluted water resources mostly for industrial and irrigation purposes 4 5 the textile industry uses a large amount of water and a wide range of synthetic dyes and chemicals as a result large amounts of highly polluted and colored wastewater 200 350 m3 per ton of finished textile product is generated due to the low uptake of the dyes by fabrics 6 the most crucial drawback of this highly colored wastewater goes back to its significant effect on the photosynthetic function in plants moreover due to low light penetration and oxygen consumption the aquatic life is also in danger by draining the untreated textile wastewater further to dyes and a large amount of water the textile wastewater also includes detergents stabilizing agents degradable organics inorganic salts desizers and heavy metals 7 8 all these can lead to high cod chemical oxygen demand high turbidity the large amount of heavy metals content etc and consequently a high level of toxicity for humans and animals this highly polluted wastewater can then be classified as high risk hazardous effluents 9 10 that is why the discharge standard for textile wastewater is strict in many countries for instance the standard values for discharging the dyeing effluent into surface water and irrigation purposes for cod bod ph and tss are 100 and 200 mg l 1 50 and 100 mg l 1 6 5 8 and 60 and 100 mg l 1 respectively 11 13 in the past decades toxicity removal and dye recovery have received considerable attention however in recent years the primary efforts have been focused on water recovery methods different technologies such as adsorption advanced oxidations biological techniques and membrane separation have been widely used for textile wastewater treatment 6 8 however these technologies suffer from low efficiency use of toxic chemicals and generation of harmful by products as well as high process and maintenance costs therefore pressure driven membrane processes such as nanofiltration nf have attracted lots of attention for treating the dyeing and printing wastewater in the textile industry this is owing to some advantages of membrane processes over conventional techniques including high rejection rate for contaminants scalable modular design inherent simplicity and ease of maintenance 14 however low water recovery and high energy consumption as well as high operating pressure are some bottlenecks of pressure driven membrane processes 15 furthermore membrane fouling generally occurs in forms of foulant adhesion deposition and thermodynamic filtration resistance of the gel layer this is a severe challenge for the membrane bioreactors and pressure driven membrane processes 16 19 membrane distillation md process is a thermally driven separation technique which uses a hydrophobic membrane for separating the vapor molecules from a heated feed stream the operating pressure in the md process is quite low almost near the atmospheric pressure hence it is a promising alternative for ro nf processes low operating pressure can also tend to less membrane fouling and increase the safety of process md process works under mild operating temperatures 50 80 c 20 thus this separation technique can utilize renewable and or waste thermal energy sources such as solar energy and previously heated liquid streams in industrial sectors 21 moreover considering the discharge temperature of the textile wastewater 50 80 c the md process can directly use the drained effluent without needing to further energy consumption for heating step 22 in md process the applied microporous membrane acts as a barrier between the hot feed and cold permeate streams moreover the hydrophobic nature of the membrane surface prevents the process liquid from penetrating the pores therefore theoretically almost 100 rejection rate for solutes and non volatile contaminants can be achieved 23 one of the first attempts for applying the md process for colored effluent treatment was reported by calabro and co workers 24 in this work the authors used the md process to produce clean water with high purity the authors investigated the effect of feed temperature and flow rate on the permeate flux and its purity as well as the temperature polarization coefficients moreover the energy efficiency of the md process for treating the dyed effluent was estimated in another work banat and co workers 25 used the vmd vacuum md process equipped with polypropylene pp tubular module for the treatment of textile wastewater dyed by the methylene blue the effect of operating parameters on the permeate flux was investigated the authors also developed a mathematical model and the modeling results were validated on the experimental data criscuoli and co workers 26 used the vmd process for water recovery of wastewater containing different types of dyes the authors studied the effect of operating parameters on the dye rejection factor and the permeate flux the authors reported a complete dye rejection and pure water production in all experiments in another research li and co workers 27 studied the feasibility of the dcmd direct contact md process for treating the industrial effluent from the dyeing process in the textile industry the authors used two commercial membranes made of pvdf and ptfe the obtained results indicated that the ptfe membrane performed better in terms of the permeate flux and contaminant rejection authors concluded that almost 90 cod removal and 94 color removal were achieved in experiments by the use of the ptfe membrane moreover the authors found that the membrane fouling and the resultant flux decline could be caused by the accumulation of sio2 and dispersed dyes on the membrane surface it is worth noting that all these works have used commercially available hydrophobic mf membranes which usually improperly perform for the md process 28 therefore the next step for using the md process for dye effluent treatment followed by fabricating specific membranes mostly via the well known phase inversion technique mokhtar and co workers 13 fabricated a hollow fiber pvdf coloiside 15a membrane with nanocomposite structure via the phase inversion method for treating the industrial textile wastewater by the dcmd process based on the obtained results the permeate flux declined almost about 50 in the first few hours 13 22 kg m 2 h 1 while the fabricated membrane abled to treat the industrial wastewater by reducing at least 89 of the initial values of the contaminants the authors discussed that the reduction in the permeate flux was mainly due to scaling and partial pore wetting moreover the authors concluded that the dcmd process had shown remarkable performance for removal of cod 90 8 dye 95 3 and tds 93 7 one of the most critical challenges of the dcmd process is the lack of specific and affordable membranes for evaluating the economic feasibility in treating the textile effluent this can be more highlighted owing to the limitations of membranes fabricated via the phase inversion including low hydrophobicity low porosity wide surface pore size distribution dead ended pores and high energy loss by heat conduction 29 recently electrospun nanofibrous membranes have introduced to the md process having high porosity 90 remarkable surface hydrophobicity even superhydrophobicity and lower heat loss through the membrane bulk make them an attractive candidate for different treatment purposes by the md process 30 31 however very few works studied on the application of electrospun membranes in treating the textile effluent 32 the novelties of this research can be explained as follow a novel dual layer nanofibrous membrane was fabricated and used for treating the industrial textile wastewater by using the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd process for the first time to the best of our knowledge in the open literature the modified electrospinning method with higher nanofiber mass production as compared with the typical electrospinning i e the gas assisted electrospinning also known as electroblowing was used for fabrication of nanofibrous membrane samples the structure of the proposed composite membrane consists of two nanofibrous layers the styrene acrylonitrile san4 polymer for the bottom layer and the high impact polystyrene hips polymer for the top layer various techniques were used for the characterization of membrane specifications and study on its performance the fabricated membrane was then used for treating the simulated single dye solution and the real textile wastewater samples by the dcmd process all tests were conducted under constant temperature and flowrate moreover the actual textile wastewater sample was tested in the dcmd system as received and without any pretreatment step this can evaluate the performance of the newly developed membrane for further challenging applications the results of this work introduce a cost effective and more affordable membrane which can shed some light on the niches of the dcmd process for industrial textile wastewater treatment presented follow are the detailed results of this research 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercial granules of high impact polystyrene hips mfi 4 5 g 10min 1 200 c and styrene acrylonitrile san4 mfi 7 g 10min

facilitate the gas assisted electrospinning all chemicals were used as received commercial dyes including the disperse dye red 60 and the reactive dye orange 122 were purchased from the local vendors and used for the preparation of simulated single dye wastewater samples table 1 shows the characteristics of the used dyes 35 36 all dyes were used as received the industrial textile wastewater sample was also supplied by a local textile dyeing factory in alborz province iran the effluent sample was collected from the equalization tank then was preserved in the fridge 4 c to prevent any biodegradation due to microbial action noureddin et al 2014 jaber et al 2015 it should be mentioned that the real wastewater sample was used as received without any pretreatment step a commercial ptfe membrane with 0 22 Î¼m pore size membrane solutions co china was used as the control for comparing the morphology mechanical features and results for the dcmd process in terms of the permeate flux and the contaminant rejection 2 2 solution preparation for gas assisted electrospinning the homogenous dope solutions were prepared for fabricating the composite nanofibrous membrane samples by dissolving 22 wt of hips polymer and 24 wt san4 polymer in the mixture of dmf acetone solvents 7 3 separately this followed by stirring at 250 rpm for 24 h the polymer solutions were then kept at ambient temperature for 24 h to remove the bubbles before the gas assisted electrospinning step 2 3 gas assisted electrospinning system a gas assisted electrospinning system was used for fabricating the electroblown nanofibrous membrane samples fig 1 shows a general scheme of the applied system in this research the gas assisted electrospinning conditions were set as follow 20 kv high voltage 135 Î¼l min 1 dope injection rate 35 cm tip to collector distance 150 rpm drum collector rotation speed 14 g and 18 g needles for the co axial spinneret outer and inner respectively and 3 n l min 1 dried airflow in the conventional electrospinning system the dope solution is charged under the high voltage electric field then it is injected through a single tube needle with a few microliters per hour Î¼l h 1 29 the low nanofiber productivity is one of the most essential niches for the upscaling of this technique to fabricate the membrane samples a complimentary external drag force can be used to increase the nanofiber productivity employing a gas flow surrounding the taylor cone through the co axial nozzle aminyan and bazgir 2019 the proposed gas flow can then impose the additional stretching force to enhance the nanofiber mass production and their deposition speed as well the applied spinneret in the gas assisted electrospinning consists of two needles in the co axial configuration the polymer solution is delivered through the inner needle 14 g while the gas jet is imposed through the outer needle the detailed configuration of the gas assisted electrospinning is shown in fig 2 for other parts of the system there is no difference as compared with the conventional electrospinning 2 4 cold press treatment before the dcmd tests the dual layer nanofibrous membrane samples were cold pressed gotech taiwan under 2000 psi for 30 s 2 5 dcmd process a lab scale apparatus was used for the dcmd tests fig 3 shows the general scheme of the dcmd system the hot feed and the cold permeate streams were circulated in a closed loop using two diaphragm pumps two precise regulators were used for adjusting the inlet pressures in the feed and permeate channels 0 15 bar a plate and frame module with 12 5 cm2 active area channels depth 1 mm was used when the hot feed stream was fed into the lower channel and the cold permeate stream was fed into the upper channel in all tests the membrane surface made of hips was in direct contact with the hot feed stream the fabricated nanofibrous and ptfe membranes were then addressed to the dcmd process using distilled water simulated single dye solutions and an industrial wastewater sample from a textile dyeing factory for all the tests conducted the constant temperature difference of 40 c Î´t was used the feed temperature th was set at 52 2 c and the permeate temperature tc was established at 12 3 c respectively this Î´t was investigated as it would be the most affordable temperature difference in the textile factory the effluent temperature varies between 50 80 c for commercialization of the dcmd process constant feed flowrates of 0 48 and 0 24 l min 1 were investigated for the hot qh and cold qc streams respectively two sets of dcmd tests were conducted the short term tests for 6 h and the long term tests for 48 h the permeate tank containing the distilled water 4 5 Î¼s cm 1 12 3 c was circulated at the half of the feed flowrates with counter current flow arrangement inside the module this operating condition causes a bit higher hydraulic pressure in the feed channel thus membrane pore wetting is more detectable four pt 100 thermal sensors jumo temperature sensor germany were located as close as possible to the entry and exit points of the dcmd module to monitor the temperatures two precise regulators and corresponding pressure gauges adjusted and controlled the pressure of the feed and permeate channels an a d ek 2000i digital balance japan was used for recording the permeate weight differences during the tests the temperatures of the feed and permeate tanks were adjusted using a heater and a chiller respectively it is worth stating that the permeate flux was reported after reaching a stable condition after almost 30 min for all tests 2 6 process analysis and membrane characterization a metrohm conductivity meter metrohm 912 switzerland was used to detect the conductivity of the permeate tank the permeate flux was determined as follow 1 j Î´ m a t where j kg m 2 h 1 Î´m a and t represent the permeate flux the weight difference the effective membrane area and the test time the rejection rate for all tests was determined as follow 2 r c f c p c f 100 where r is the rejection factor and cf and cp are the concentrations of the contaminates mg l 1 in the feed and the permeate respectively scanning electron microscope sem system vega tescan czech republic was used for morphology observation of the fabricated and commercial membranes before and after the dcmd tests samples were first coated with a thin gold layer using a sputter coating machine emitech sc7620 at least 100 fiber diameters were measured from different areas and different pictures with the same magnification of each membrane as described in the previous studies 37 38 sem images were analyzed to measure the fiber diameter and its distribution as well as surface pore size and its distribution by an image analyzer software digimizer 5 3 5 from random membrane surfaces based on the standard method described in the literature at least three various locations were considered for pore size evaluation 39 40 the thicknesses of the neat and the cold pressed dual layer membrane samples were measured form random places of each sample using a precise micrometer the average of 10 measured thicknesses was reported the thickness of the commercial ptfe membrane was reported by the supplier total thickness 180 Î¼m and 20 Î¼m for the ptfe layer 38 the porosity of the nanofibrous membrane is defined as the inter fiber space to the total volume of the membrane the porosity was determined by utilizing the gravimetric method as follow 42 3 Îµ w w w d Ï i w w w d Ï i w d Ï p where w d is the dry weight of the membrane g w w is the ipa saturated weight of the membrane g Ï i and Ï p are the densities of ipa and polymer respectively liquid entry pressure lep value of a membrane is a function of maximum pore size rmax surface hydrophobicity Î¸ and thickness 43 it ensures the membrane performance for wastewater treatment in long term operation the lep values of the fabricated and commercial membranes were determined as described in the literature 44 45 the pressure was increased stepwise with 0 1 bar every 30 s until a flow is detected the pressure was then recognized as the lep 4 l e p Î² Î³ 1 cos Î¸ r max the dual layer nanofibrous membrane and the commercial ptfe membrane were also examined for their surface hydrophobicity by the water contact angle wca measurement using the sessile drop method and a ccd camera kruss analyzer g10 drop shape analyzer germany at least the average of three measurements was reported the mechanical properties of the fabricated and commercial membranes including elongation at break tensile strength mpa and breaking factor n m 1 of the nanofibrous composite and ptfe membranes were evaluated by a tensile testing machine instron 1122 uk a fitted paper frame was used to load the samples between the two jaws of the tensile machine to avoid damaging the membrane samples during the tensile tests before conducting the tensile test the frame was cut from both sides and only the membrane samples went through the test 46 the average value of the three trials was then reported at ambient conditions 23 c temperature and 35 humidity 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology observation and characteristics fig 4 illustrates the surface morphologies of the gas assisted electrospun fibers in the range of nano micro size and their respective fiber diameter distributions and the cross section image of the dual layer cold pressed membrane as well as the surface morphology of the commercial ptfe membrane the surface of nanofibrous membrane samples was analyzed for the fiber diameter its average value and the distribution of fiber diameters in the typical electrospinning polymer fibers are ejected from the tip of the spinneret when the high voltage is applied between the needle tip and the collector the imposed airflow in the gas assisted electrospinning adds an extra drag force which surrounds the taylor s cone this not only can implement the fiber productivity but also make the solidification step faster 47 the continuous accumulation of the solidified nano micro fibers can randomly form layers upon layers the result is an interconnected nanofibrous structure 48 table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the individual layers the dual layer membrane and the commercial ptfe membrane the single hips layer 1 consists of fibers in the range of 200 1500 nm with an average diameter of 970 nm the fibers diameter did not change considerably after the cold press step 985 nm see fig 4 the hips nanofibers have a cylindrical shape and some beads can be observed on the fibers this bead on fiber structure is similar to the resultant fibers in the research by zulfi and co workers 49 moreover the beads can be related to the butadiene content in the hips structure which is hardly soluble in dmf solvent 50 however a nanofibrous structure with a random fiber distribution in the range of 70 250 nm and without beads formation was obtained for the san4 single layer 2 as the cold press was used for the post treatment step the average fiber diameter 143 nm did change considerably see fig 4 on the other hand the cold press post treatment changed the thickness of the single layers as well as the dual layer membrane structure as could be observed in table 2 the thickness reduced from 239 nm to 173 nm for the dual layer membrane it is well discussed in the literature that the thinner the membrane is the lower mass transfer exists for vapor molecules however very thin membranes lose a considerable amount of energy of the feed stream through the membrane heat conduction which is one of the most significant drawbacks of the dcmd process 51 therefore there is a trade off between the membrane thickness and the permeate flux especially for large size md modules 52 shirazi and co workers 28 used different commercial ptfe membranes with different thicknesses 115 300 Î¼m for desalination by using the dcmd process the authors comprehensively discussed the effect of the membrane thickness and concluded that thicker structure could reduce the permeate flux for feed salinities up to 45 g l 1 in another research eykens and co workers 53 studied on the membrane thickness on the permeate flux of the dcmd process at different salinities up to 24 wt the authors concluded that thinner membranes show higher fluxes while energy efficiency is unaffected by membrane thickness for very low feed salinity however when highly saline feed was introduced to the dcmd system the optimal membrane thickness depends on the membrane parameters and process conditions and thicker membrane can perform more efficient than that of the thinner ones surface hydrophobicity is a crucial parameter for md membranes 54 55 thus the single layer webs and the dual layer membrane as well as the commercial ptfe membrane were all tested for the surface hydrophobicity the surface contact angles were measured at about 148 3 and 144 for neat samples of 1 and 2 membranes respectively table 2 the same values were measured at about 142 6 and 131 3 for the pressed samples respectively as could be observed the hydrophobicity of the 1 layer hips is higher than that of the 2 san4 layer both before and after the cold pressing step which can be attributed to the intrinsic properties of the hips polymer moreover the beaded structure of the hips nanofibers can enhance the surface hydrophobicity therefore based on the obtained results the nanofibrous hips web with higher surface hydrophobicity was investigated for the membrane top layer and the nanofibrous san 4 mat was investigated as the bottom layer on the other hand the decrease of the surface hydrophobicity after cold press treatment can be affected by the reduction of the surface roughness and higher fiber compaction this is in good agreement with the results reported by yao and co workers 56 the authors reported that heat pressed treatment led to lower surface hydrophobicity for the electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene membranes moreover the surface contact angle for the dual layer membrane 3 is 148 5 and 143 2 before and after cold press respectively additionally this should be noted that all membrane samples are more hydrophobic than that of the ptfe membrane 4 with a 123 5 contact angle this can be concluded that the new dual layer san4 hips membrane with a three dimensional interconnected pore structure is more promising in term of the surface hydrophobicity table 3 presents the other characteristics of the dual layer membrane and the commercial ptfe membrane including the mean surface pore size dp the porosity Îµ and liquid entry pressure lep membrane samples both the dual layer 3 and the commercial ptfe 4 were examined for the surface pore size using image analysis of sem images the minimum and maximum pore sizes were also measured 0 296 and 3 57 Î¼m and 0 23 and 1 88 Î¼m for the 3 membrane before and after the cold press treatment respectively the same values were measured at 0 113 and 0 79 Î¼m for the commercial membrane 4 respectively moreover the mean pore size dp for the 3 membrane was measured at 1 76 and 0 43 Î¼m before and after cold press respectively however the mean surface pore size for the commercial membrane was estimated at 0 29 Î¼m which is almost close to the reported value by the supplier i e 0 22 Î¼m table 3 this can also confirm the validation of the image processing technique for the surface pore size measurement of the nanofibrous membranes moreover the accuracy of the microscopic method for pore size analysis has already been tested and reported in the literature 38 57 58 the results also revealed that the smaller surface pore size could be achieved by the simple cold press treatment technique smaller pore size can then guarantee the long term performance of the membrane for the dcmd tests owing lower pore wetting risk for tighter membranes 28 moreover it is reported in the literature that the optimum surface pore size for an md membrane is in the range of 0 1 0 5 Î¼m 30 the mean surface pore size of the cold pressed dual layer membrane is 0 43 Î¼m which is favorably in the optimum range membrane porosity is an essential feature of the dcmd process 59 it is referred to as the void volume fraction of the membrane 60 higher porosity can provide more channels in the membrane structure and consequently higher evaporation surface area for diffusing the vapor molecules 42 therefore membranes with higher porosity can provide higher permeate flux 61 furthermore the presence of more voids can reduce the heat loss through the dcmd membrane owing to enhance its thermal resistance in better words the air which is present in the pore spaces has much lower thermal conductivity k 0 029 w m 1 k 1 than the membrane materials hips 0 16 0 22 w m 1 k 1 and san4 0 348 w m 1 k 1 as a result both permeability and thermal efficiency of the membrane can be considerably increased at higher porosity ranges 62 it is worth noting that the conventional phase inversion membranes suffer from the low porosity while the electrospinning technique can fabricate membranes with porosity up to 90 29 however it should be noted that high membrane porosity can weaken the membrane mechanical durability the neat and cold pressed 3 membrane samples as well as the commercial membrane 4 were tested for their porosity as could be observed in table 3 the neat dual layer membrane has 94 6 porosity and this value decreases up to 77 8 after cold press treatment the porosity of the commercial membrane was reported at about 75 by the supplier which is almost lower than that of the newly fabricated nanofibrous membrane 3 in all configurations of the md process only vapor molecules should transfer through the membrane pores and the process liquid i e the hot feed should not penetrate into the pores that is why the active surface of the membrane which is in direct contact with the feed stream should be hydrophobic 31 as could be observed in table 2 the cold pressed dual layer membrane is more hydrophobic 143 2 than that of the commercial ptfe membrane 123 5 this remarkable hydrophobicity was provided by the hips layer that is why the nanofibrous the hips layer was investigated as the top surface for the dual layer membrane further to this the lep liquid entry pressure value of the dcmd membrane which is defined as the minimum transmembrane pressure where liquid penetrates the pores of the membrane should be as high as possible 63 the high lep value is essential to avoid membrane pore wetting and its value must be higher than that of the imposed hydrostatic pressure 64 it is discussed in the literature that the proper lep of 200 kpa is necessary for the long term md performance 65 the lep value was measured at 135 6 kpa which is almost lower than that of the commercial ptfe membrane 140 4 kpa this difference in the lep values can be attributed to the surface properties of the membranes while the dual layer membrane is more hydrophobic it has a larger surface pore size 0 43 Î¼m as compared with the commercial ptfe membrane 0 29 Î¼m tijing and co workers 39 conducted the lep tests for a dual layer membrane with a nanofibrous structure made of poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene and a commercial ptfe membrane the authors reported 77 94 kpa and 273 kpa for their lep respectively it was concluded that the lower lep for the fabricated electrospun membrane attributed to its large surface pore size i e 1 Î¼m in another research woo and co workers 66 reported the lep values in the range of 122 184 kpa for the neat and heat pressed dual layer nanofibrous membranes the authors discussed that the heat pressed membranes have higher lep which is owing to their higher compaction and decreased pore size in the nanofibrous structure 3 1 1 mechanical properties the pressure driven membrane processes work under high operating pressures ranging from 500 to 2500 kpa 67 while all md configurations operate at almost atmospheric pressure 150 kpa therefore the membrane has fewer requirements for mechanical integrity 65 however adequate mechanical features are necessary to guarantee the long term performance of an md membrane and damage prevention moreover the electrospun nanofibrous membrane should withstand the stress from packing the membranes in the module 66 the dual layer nanofibrous membrane samples before and after cold press treatment were characterized for the mechanical properties the force at break fb the elongation at break eb the tensile strength at break tsb and the braking factor bf were measured at 2 09 and 2 19 n 8 and 4 0 404 and 5 16 mpa and 80 91 and 87 7 n m 1 respectively results indicated that the cold press treatment enhanced the mechanical durability of the nanofibrous membrane table 4 presents the mechanical properties of the cold pressed dual layer membrane 3 as compared with the commercial ptfe membrane 4 as could be observed the ptfe membrane has remarkable mechanical features however it should be noted that all tests for 3 membrane were conducted for the support less membrane sample while it was almost impossible to remove the thin ptfe layer 20 Î¼m from the nonwoven support based on the obtained results this can be discussed that the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous san4 hips membrane has a semi elastic behavior and can bend properly 3 2 dcmd performance for textile wastewater the textile industry in both the dyeing and printing sections can provide a large amount of highly polluted and colored wastewater which should be appropriately treated before discharging to the environment 6 among different possible treatment strategies the dcmd process possesses remarkable advantages over others one of the most great superiorities is the ability to utilize the waste heat of the drained dyeing wastewater which is in the range of 50 80 c 13 22 this can significantly decrease energy consumption during the treatment process moreover it can also impose less carbon foot print and thermal pollution on the environment however most of the reports on the application of md processes for treating the textile wastewater have been focused on the lab made simulated samples rather than the real industrial effluent 27 3 2 1 distilled water flux the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous membrane 3 and the commercial ptfe membrane 4 were first tested for their pure water flux fig 5 illustrated the permeate flux when the distilled water was fed into the dcmd system Î´t 40 c qh 0 48 l min 1 and qc 0 24 l min 1 the average permeate fluxes were measured at about 41 30 and 36 54 kg m 2 h 1 for 3 and 4 membranes respectively when the distilled water is introduced to the md system there is not a significant fluctuation in the permeate flux therefore the short term tests were conducted for 6 h as could be observed in fig 5 the fabricated nanofibrous membrane provided higher permeate flux this can be attributed to the larger pore size higher surface hydrophobicity and thinner structure of the 3 membrane 0 43 Î¼m 143 2 and 173 Î¼m respectively as compared with the commercial 4 membrane 0 29 Î¼m 123 5 and 180 Î¼m respectively this is in good agreement with the discussion by eykens and co workers 53 moreover the 3 membrane has an almost higher porosity than that of the 4 membrane see table 3 all these have led to higher permeate flux for the 3 membrane when the distilled water was introduced to the dcmd system furthermore the permeate flux for both membranes is almost constant with negligible fluctuation after 6 h continuous dcmd test this behavior for distilled water permeate flux is mainly due to its purity and the absence of contaminants which is also similar to the reported performance in the literature 68 3 2 2 simulated wastewater flux the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous membrane 3 and the commercial ptfe membrane 4 were then tested for their permeate flux when simulated single dye wastewater samples were introduced to the dcmd system two wastewater samples were prepared by dispersing two different dyes i e disperse red 60 wdr and reactive orange 122 wro table 1 in the distilled water the same operating conditions Î´t 53 c qh 0 48 l min 1 qc 0 24 l min 1 were used for dcmd tests for 6 h fig 6 illustrates the variation of the permeate flux versus the time the membrane samples were addressed to the short term test for 6 h to evaluate their performance and the interaction of the membrane surface with the single dye as could be observed the initial permeate fluxes were measured at about 38 77 and 32 20 kg m 2 h 1 for 3 and 4 membranes respectively for treating the wro wastewater see fig 6 a moreover higher and almost more stable permeate flux was achieved by using the 3 membrane than that of the 4 one when the wro wastewater was introduced to the dcmd system the higher permeate flux of the 3 membrane can be attributed to its larger pore size higher porosity with the 3d interconnected pores and almost thinner structure on the other hand when the wdr wastewater was fed to the dcmd system the initial fluxes were measured at about 36 33 and 35 11 kg m 2 h 1 for 3 and 4 membranes respectively see fig 6 b moreover the declined trend for the permeate flux was different the permeate flux is reductive for both 3 and 4 membranes for the first 30 min the 3 membrane provided higher flux as compared with the 4 membrane however almost a sharp flux decline was observed for both membranes after 180 min dcmd test after this both membranes performed practically invariably overall the 4 membrane provided higher permeate flux as compared with the 3 membrane by using the wdr wastewater sample this can be attributed to the higher fouling tendency of the membranes by using the individual disperse dye fig 6 b disperse dyes are almost insoluble in water table 1 and various surfactants and dispersing agents are needed to enhance their solubility in the water 6 14 69 however the wdr wastewater in this work was prepared by dispersing the pure red 60 dye in the distilled water without using any surfactants therefore the majority of dye content precipitated on the membrane surface and formed a cake layer moreover lower permeate flux for the 3 membrane compared with the 4 membrane can be attributed to the higher scaling tendency of the membrane surface and forming a thicker cake layer moreover the dye charge seems ineffective in the membrane fouling as the top layer is formed by the hips nanofibers this polymer is a non polar one 70 this is discussed in the next section it is worth quoting that almost 100 color rejection was achieved in the dcmd tests for both wdr and wro wastewater samples after 6 h continuous operation this is in good agreement with the literature on the md based treatment of the simulated textile wastewater 24 26 3 2 3 industrial wastewater flux for the next step both the fabricated nanofibrous membrane and the commercial membrane 3 and 4 respectively were continuously tested for treating the real industrial textile wastewater for up to 48 h the permeate flux data was recorded every 1 h as could be observed in fig 7 the initial permeate flux recorded at about 37 34 and 34 88 kg m 2 h 1 by using the 3 and 4 membranes respectively the flux then tended to decrease up to 12 for the 4 membrane during the first 15 h of the dcmd process after this time the permeate flux for the 4 membrane fluctuated with the almost constant trend the trend for the 3 membrane permeate flux is practically different the flux decline during the first 15 h of the dcmd process was virtually up to 22 after this time the constant permeate flux with slight fluctuation can be observed moreover higher permeate flux was achieved by using the 3 membrane after 48 h continuous dcmd operation for treating the industrial textile wastewater the obtained average permeate fluxes for the 3 and 4 membranes were measured at about 23 56 and 19 82 kg m 2 h 1 respectively the obtained permeate flux profile for the 4 membrane in this work is almost in a good agreement with the reported results in the literature for the md based treatment of industrial textile wastewater 13 however the 3 membrane performed better and provided higher permeate flux but it should be noted that having higher permeate flux is not enough and the quality of the obtained permeate should be adequate to pass the standards this is discussed in the next section the sharp decreasing trend of the permeate flux during the first 10 15 h of the dcmd process is caused by solute color deposition on the membrane surface this can lead to cake formation on the membrane surface and pore blocking as well as higher mass transfer resistance for vapor molecules the partial pore wetting owing to the presence of the surfactants in the industrial textile wastewater can also cause the flux decline furthermore other contaminants can sever the polarization effects 71 72 overall the performance of the 3 membrane was remarkable and more promising as compared with the reported ones in the literature 73 74 the fouling and rejection performances of the 3 and 4 membranes are discussed in the next section 3 3 rejection and membrane fouling in this work three types of wastewater samples were investigated for evaluating the dcmd performance for textile effluent treatment the first two samples were prepared by dispersing the individual dyes i e disperse red 60 wdr with a neutral charge and reactive orange 122 wro with the negative charge in the distilled water table 1 and the third sample was the real textile wastewater sample collected from a local dyeing factory the daily amount of discharged effluent was reported at about 120 150 m3 d 1 with temperature in the range of 60 80 c the membrane performance for wastewater treatment not only should be evaluated based on the permeate flux but also should be examined based on the contaminant rejection potential 75 76 the rejection performance of the 3 and 4 membranes was measured based on the eq 2 3 3 1 rejection based on the obtained results almost complete rejection 100 was achieved for both 3 and 4 membranes by using wdr and wro wastewater samples this can be attributed to the non volatile property and large molecule sizes of the dyes it is well discussed in the literature that one of the most promising advantages of the md process is the ability to reach high rejection factors 100 for non volatile solutes 68 this is also in a good agreement with the literature on the rejection data for md based desalination and dye removal from the simulated wastewaters 24 26 table 5 shows the characteristics of the industrial textile effluent as well as the permeate analysis for the dcmd tests performed by using the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous membrane 3 and the commercial ptfe membrane 4 moreover the standards for discharging the effluent are tabulated as could be observed the industrial wastewater sample is highly colored color 2000 mg pt l 1 and polluted cod 1250 mg o2 l 1 with a high level of ec electrical conductivity 6237 3 Î¼s cm 1 and tds total dissolved solids 4797 mg l 1 therefore owing to strict standards for draining out the textile wastewater mostly in terms of cod bod and color content 13 27 this wastewater cannot discharge directly to the environment based on the obtained results both the 3 and 4 membranes have performed remarkably the commercial ptfe membrane reduced the cod color and tds up to 17 mg o2 l 1 5 mg pt l 1 and 31 mg l 1 which all equal to almost 98 64 99 75 and 99 35 contaminant rejection respectively the same values for the contaminant rejection were measured at about 99 28 100 and 99 79 for cod color and tds by using the 3 membrane respectively in terms of bod and turbidity rejections both membranes performed perfectly with almost complete rejection it should be noted that few works in the literature reported the md treatment results for real textile wastewater samples mokhtar and co workers 13 reported 72 80 and 72 89 rejections for cod and color removal respectively using a pvdf cloisite 15a hollow fiber membrane in another work li and co workers 27 reported 89 96 and 94 100 rejections for cod and color removal respectively using commercial pvdf and ptfe membranes the cold pressed dual layer membrane showed better results in rejecting color in comparison to the cod this can be attributed to the large particle size for color molecules which is in the range of 600 1000 g mol 1 for textile dyes and pigments however the cod of the industrial textile wastewater is a complex mixture of surfactants dyes mineral oils suspended solids etc moreover the organic contaminants in the dyeing effluent are in the range of 0 001 100 Î¼m 13 14 which are much smaller than that of the membrane pores see table 3 as discussed in the literature some of these components can be possibly transported through the membrane pores by vapor molecules as the primary carrier 72 74 overall based on the obtained results in this work it can be concluded that the dcmd performance of the 3 membrane was considerably promising for industrial textile wastewater treatment moreover it should be noted that although 100 cod removal could not be achieved by using the 3 membrane via the dcmd process the permeate quality is still in the standard range see table 5 3 3 2 fouling unlike the pressure driven nf ro membrane processes which work under high operating pressures 10 25 bar the dcmd process works at almost atmosphere pressure 0 15 bar 58 therefore there is a lower fouling scaling tendency in the md processes however the membrane fouling in all configurations of the md process is related to the hydrophobic nature of the applied material for fabricating the membrane 77 in the case of dyeing and printing wastewaters in the textile industry there is an excellent interaction between the membrane surface and the aromatic rings of the color molecules which causes an enhanced fouling tendency 76 that is why even though the operating pressure in md processes is lower than of the lep value of the used membrane partial pore wetting can cause the membrane wetting and penetrating the solutes to the permeate side this can happen when fouling and scaling occur at the membrane surface which can change the membrane properties such as lep and surface hydrophobicity 74 therefore close inspections via visualization of the membranes surfaces and sem observations were performed fig 8 shows the membranes surfaces and sem images with different magnifications as could be observed a thin layer of organophilic compounds present in the wastewater samples which is almost dense is formed on the membrane surface the proposed layer can therefore reduce the available open pore area for transporting the vapor molecules from the hot front to the cold side this is the main reason for the flux decline as time goes by this observation can confirm the experimental results for the reduction in the permeate flux after 6 and 48 h dcmd process respectively the same results for the effect of cake layer formation and fouling on the membrane surface have also been observed for the md based treatment of other wastewater samples 78 moreover the dye charge seems ineffective in the membrane fouling as the top layer is formed by the hips nanofibers and this polymer is a non polar one 70 furthermore the membrane surfaces were analyzed for the elemental components using edx analysis as shown in table 6 the results strongly indicated the formation of the fouling layer on the membrane surface the presence of these elements can be attributed to the dyes chemicals and inorganic materials as well as surfactants in the dyeing processes of textiles and fabrics 6 10 the carbon c oxygen o and fluorine f content of the pristine membranes are related to the chemical structure of the ptfe c2f4 n san4 c8h8 n c3h3n m and hips polymers other elements can be found in industrial textile wastewaters 27 35 71 72 moreover the formation of the fouling layer on the membrane surface reduced the original content of c o and f elements this can confirm the presence of the scaling layers on the membrane surfaces see fig 8 for instance the carbon content reduced up to 53 95 53 61 and 33 38 for the nanofibrous membrane samples used for the wdr wro and the real wastewater samples respectively moreover the fluorine content reduced up to 45 33 25 75 and 53 24 for the commercial membrane samples used for the wdr wro and the real wastewater samples respectively all these revealed that the foulants cover the membrane surfaces meanwhile the higher oxygen content is caused by organic and biological components in the wastewater samples 74 76 the formation of the foulant layer on the membrane surface can also enhance the pore wetting risk of the membrane in the dcmd process 77 78 this can be investigated as one of the most important reasons for the reduction of color and cod removal when a real textile effluent is introduced to the md system mostly in the long term operation 74 pore wetting in md membranes can occur when i the input pressure in the feed channel is higher than that of the lep value ii the feed sample contains high surfactants and organic contents and iii the formed cake layer influences the surface hydrophobicity 31 77 although the membrane fouling was almost considerable mostly for the newly developed nanofibrous san4 hips membrane 3 for treating the industrial wastewater see fig 8 the pore wetting was almost negligible this conclusion can be proved based on the rejection factors for contaminants and the dcmd performance of the 3 membrane see table 5 therefore it can be concluded that the flux reduction was mainly due to the fouling effect rather than the partial pore wetting this discussion was also proved by examining the surface hydrophobicity of the fouled membranes as could be observed in fig 9 there are some reductions in the surface contact angles for both the 3 and 4 membranes the contact angle for pristine 3 and 4 membrane was 143 2 and 123 5 respectively while it reduced after using for real textile wastewater treatment for instance the surface contact angle reduced up to 15 15 and 13 92 after treating the real textile effluent for the 3 and 4 membranes respectively the hydrophobicity reduction is almost more for the 3 membrane than that of the 4 membrane however it is still hydrophobic enough to be used in the dcmd process this reduction in the surface contact angle can be attributed to the sophisticated composition of the formed cake layers on the surfaces of the membranes 27 it has been discussed in the literature that the presence of the organic compounds in the textile wastewater could affect the surface properties of the investigated membrane mokhtar and co workers 13 reported an almost 29 reduction in the surface hydrophobicity pristine membrane 97 7 and fouled membrane 69 3 when a lab made pvdf cloisite 15a hollow fiber membrane was used for treating the real textile effluent in another work li and co workers 27 reported a 6 9 42 reduction in the surface hydrophobicity of commercial ptfe and pvdf membranes furthermore the obtained results revealed that the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous san4 hips membrane in this work is more durable for textile effluent treatment in terms of surface hydrophobicity than that of the discussed ones in the literature this can therefore guarantee the long term dcmd performance of this membrane with remarkable contaminants removal efficiency as reported in table 5 3 4 feasibility consideration table 7 presents comparative results in terms of permeate fluxes and rejections of this work with some examples from the published literature it is worth noting that very few studies investigated the real textile wastewater for addressing to the md process for treatment 27 as could be observed the newly developed dual layer nanofibrous san4 hips membrane 3 is comparable with the commercial membranes concerning the permeate flux and contaminant rejection cod and color removal moreover as discussed previously the permeate flux decline in this work was mainly due to the scale cake formation and fouling on the membrane surface rather than the partial pore wetting as the membranes 3 and 4 remained hydrophobic after the dcmd tests fig 9 in better words the reduction in the permeate flux can be mostly attributed to the complex composition of the industrial textile effluent sample in which some of the organic foulants formed a cake layer on the membrane surface and enhanced the mass transfer resistance for vapor molecules 29 78 taking the obtained results in this work and the presented ones in table 7 into consideration the newly developed nanofibrous membrane 3 can be investigated as an alternative for the dcmd treatment of industrial textile wastewater moreover it should be noted that the used polymers in fabricating this nanofibrous membrane i e hips and san 4 are much cheaper and more cost effective than that of the pvdf polymer and its derivatives these further to the potential for using the industrial wastewater with the temperature in the range of 50 80 c directly as the feed and without any pre heating step can shed some light on further economizing the dcmd process for textile wastewater treatment however more efforts are still needed to work on membrane fouling reduction and mechanical durability enhancement furthermore the textile industry uses a large amount of water for different steps varying from several hundred to a few thousand m3 day 1 6 14 15 thus the efficient water recovery using the dcmd process equipped by the newly developed nanofibrous membrane and producing high quality product i e clean water which can pass the standards see table 5 can further improve the sustainability in the textile industry to prove the efficiency of the dcmd process for industrial wastewater treatment its operating conditions and the permeate quality were also thoroughly compared to other membrane based alternatives including mf uf nf and ro pressure driven processes the results are summarized in table 8 as could be observed in terms of operation the dcmd process is driven in considerably lower pressure 0 15 bar however the operating pressure is much higher mostly for nf and ro processes 10 bar 5 11 14 in terms of the permeate quality the product provided by the dcmd process is comparable with the ro process both of them can meet the required standards for discharging the textile effluent moreover it should be noted that the dcmd process in this research has been driven without any pretreatment step in many pressure driven membrane processes the pretreatment step is essential when the actual wastewater sample is introduced to the system this is owing to the fouling tendency in these processes which is caused by operating pressure and contaminant content however the md process is less sensitive to the membrane fouling due to the low operating pressure this is one of the most important advantages of the md process compared with other techniques removing the pretreatment step can also decrease the carbon footprint and operation costs thus the real textile effluent in this work was fed into the system directly as received another critical challenge of ro is its high energy consumption which is owing to the high osmotic pressure during treatment 29 however the dcmd process does not have such a problem as it can directly utilize the waste thermal energy in the textile industry 50 80 c temperature of the discharged effluent stream 80 this can considerably decrease the operation costs and step forward the dcmd process for economizing and cost effective textile effluent treatment furthermore water penetration into the pores is prevented in the dcmd process owing to the hydrophobic nature of the applied membrane thus almost all of the contaminants and non volatile dissolved solutes can be removed in this process the result is a high purity product see table 8 fig 10 shows the visual view of the feed samples and the obtained permeate in this work it is worth noting that the minor incomplete rejection of contaminants in this research could be mainly related to the membrane fouling rather than the partial pore wetting problem this is in good agreement with the published results in the literature 13 80 however further studies should be completed to improve the anti fouling and anti wetting properties of the md membranes for economized textile effluent treatment 4 conclusions a new membrane with composite dual layer nanofibrous structure has been experimentally used for treating the industrial textile wastewater by using the dcmd process the findings of this study firstly demonstrated that the dcmd process is promising to overcome the limitations of conventional uf nf ro processes in terms of process safety owing to the lower operating pressure and the contaminant removal due to its high rejection potential the used polymers i e hips and san are more cost effective than that of the pvdf one moreover the fabrication technique is the gas assisted electrospinning with higher nanofiber mass production rate than that of the typical electrospinning furthermore the energy consumption in the dcmd process can be considerably lower than that of the conventional membrane processes this is one of the highlighted advantages of the dcmd process that can utilize the waste thermal energy 50 80 c of the discharged textile wastewater all these can shed some light on economizing the md based treatment of the textile effluent the dual layer composite san4 hips membrane demonstrated a remarkable treatment potential of good quality with almost 99 cod reduction and 100 color rejection thus it can be concluded that this has been an accomplishment in treating the industrial textile effluent so far however the membrane fouling is still a severe challenge owing to increment of the mass transfer resistance and the permeate flux decline besides the flux reduction was mainly due to the surface fouling rather than the partial pore wetting concerning the obtained results it can be concluded that the dcmd process equipped with the fabricated dual layer nanofibrous composite membrane in this research can produce the permeate of high quality for possible water reuse however more research is still necessary especially on fouling reduction declarations of competing interest none

13978,in this work a dual layer nanfibrous san4 hips membrane has been fabricated via the gas assisted electrospinning and employed for industrial textile wastewater treatment by direct contact membrane distillation dcmd the obtained results showed that the new membrane is robust and able to remove the contaminants remarkably with almost 99 28 97 93 and 100 reductions for cod bod and color respectively however a flux decline of up to 42 58 was observed after 48 h dcmd process concerning the rejection results it can be concluded that the flux decline is mainly caused by the membrane fouling rather than the partial pore wetting as the membrane remained hydrophobic after the 48 h experiment the surface contact angle reduced from 143 2 to 121 5 foulants accumulation on the membrane surface can increase the mass transfer resistance of vapor molecules this can considerably reduce the productivity the obtained results were also compared with the literature on the other md processes as well as the conventional pressure driven membrane processes further studies on enhancing the membrane surface properties are required to control and reduce the fouling tendency caused by the contaminants in the industrial textile wastewater this is of crucial for the long term dcmd performance keywords industrial textile wastewater direct contact membrane distillation dcmd dual layer nanofibrous membrane san4 hips gas assisted electrospinning 1 introduction recently the world is faced with severe global concerns including a lack of freshwater availability and environmental pollutions 1 concerning these issues increasing the freshwater demand and decreasing the accessibility of useable water sources are the key factors that have led to a widespread search for alternative water resources 2 3 wastewater generated in public uses and various industrial sectors can then be investigated as a promising source for water makeup in industry in better words the wastewater treatment is an in place strategy for recovering and reusing the polluted water resources mostly for industrial and irrigation purposes 4 5 the textile industry uses a large amount of water and a wide range of synthetic dyes and chemicals as a result large amounts of highly polluted and colored wastewater 200 350 m3 per ton of finished textile product is generated due to the low uptake of the dyes by fabrics 6 the most crucial drawback of this highly colored wastewater goes back to its significant effect on the photosynthetic function in plants moreover due to low light penetration and oxygen consumption the aquatic life is also in danger by draining the untreated textile wastewater further to dyes and a large amount of water the textile wastewater also includes detergents stabilizing agents degradable organics inorganic salts desizers and heavy metals 7 8 all these can lead to high cod chemical oxygen demand high turbidity the large amount of heavy metals content etc and consequently a high level of toxicity for humans and animals this highly polluted wastewater can then be classified as high risk hazardous effluents 9 10 that is why the discharge standard for textile wastewater is strict in many countries for instance the standard values for discharging the dyeing effluent into surface water and irrigation purposes for cod bod ph and tss are 100 and 200 mg l 1 50 and 100 mg l 1 6 5 8 and 60 and 100 mg l 1 respectively 11 13 in the past decades toxicity removal and dye recovery have received considerable attention however in recent years the primary efforts have been focused on water recovery methods different technologies such as adsorption advanced oxidations biological techniques and membrane separation have been widely used for textile wastewater treatment 6 8 however these technologies suffer from low efficiency use of toxic chemicals and generation of harmful by products as well as high process and maintenance costs therefore pressure driven membrane processes such as nanofiltration nf have attracted lots of attention for treating the dyeing and printing wastewater in the textile industry this is owing to some advantages of membrane processes over conventional techniques including high rejection rate for contaminants scalable modular design inherent simplicity and ease of maintenance 14 however low water recovery and high energy consumption as well as high operating pressure are some bottlenecks of pressure driven membrane processes 15 furthermore membrane fouling generally occurs in forms of foulant adhesion deposition and thermodynamic filtration resistance of the gel layer this is a severe challenge for the membrane bioreactors and pressure driven membrane processes 16 19 membrane distillation md process is a thermally driven separation technique which uses a hydrophobic membrane for separating the vapor molecules from a heated feed stream the operating pressure in the md process is quite low almost near the atmospheric pressure hence it is a promising alternative for ro nf processes low operating pressure can also tend to less membrane fouling and increase the safety of process md process works under mild operating temperatures 50 80 c 20 thus this separation technique can utilize renewable and or waste thermal energy sources such as solar energy and previously heated liquid streams in industrial sectors 21 moreover considering the discharge temperature of the textile wastewater 50 80 c the md process can directly use the drained effluent without needing to further energy consumption for heating step 22 in md process the applied microporous membrane acts as a barrier between the hot feed and cold permeate streams moreover the hydrophobic nature of the membrane surface prevents the process liquid from penetrating the pores therefore theoretically almost 100 rejection rate for solutes and non volatile contaminants can be achieved 23 one of the first attempts for applying the md process for colored effluent treatment was reported by calabro and co workers 24 in this work the authors used the md process to produce clean water with high purity the authors investigated the effect of feed temperature and flow rate on the permeate flux and its purity as well as the temperature polarization coefficients moreover the energy efficiency of the md process for treating the dyed effluent was estimated in another work banat and co workers 25 used the vmd vacuum md process equipped with polypropylene pp tubular module for the treatment of textile wastewater dyed by the methylene blue the effect of operating parameters on the permeate flux was investigated the authors also developed a mathematical model and the modeling results were validated on the experimental data criscuoli and co workers 26 used the vmd process for water recovery of wastewater containing different types of dyes the authors studied the effect of operating parameters on the dye rejection factor and the permeate flux the authors reported a complete dye rejection and pure water production in all experiments in another research li and co workers 27 studied the feasibility of the dcmd direct contact md process for treating the industrial effluent from the dyeing process in the textile industry the authors used two commercial membranes made of pvdf and ptfe the obtained results indicated that the ptfe membrane performed better in terms of the permeate flux and contaminant rejection authors concluded that almost 90 cod removal and 94 color removal were achieved in experiments by the use of the ptfe membrane moreover the authors found that the membrane fouling and the resultant flux decline could be caused by the accumulation of sio2 and dispersed dyes on the membrane surface it is worth noting that all these works have used commercially available hydrophobic mf membranes which usually improperly perform for the md process 28 therefore the next step for using the md process for dye effluent treatment followed by fabricating specific membranes mostly via the well known phase inversion technique mokhtar and co workers 13 fabricated a hollow fiber pvdf coloiside 15a membrane with nanocomposite structure via the phase inversion method for treating the industrial textile wastewater by the dcmd process based on the obtained results the permeate flux declined almost about 50 in the first few hours 13 22 kg m 2 h 1 while the fabricated membrane abled to treat the industrial wastewater by reducing at least 89 of the initial values of the contaminants the authors discussed that the reduction in the permeate flux was mainly due to scaling and partial pore wetting moreover the authors concluded that the dcmd process had shown remarkable performance for removal of cod 90 8 dye 95 3 and tds 93 7 one of the most critical challenges of the dcmd process is the lack of specific and affordable membranes for evaluating the economic feasibility in treating the textile effluent this can be more highlighted owing to the limitations of membranes fabricated via the phase inversion including low hydrophobicity low porosity wide surface pore size distribution dead ended pores and high energy loss by heat conduction 29 recently electrospun nanofibrous membranes have introduced to the md process having high porosity 90 remarkable surface hydrophobicity even superhydrophobicity and lower heat loss through the membrane bulk make them an attractive candidate for different treatment purposes by the md process 30 31 however very few works studied on the application of electrospun membranes in treating the textile effluent 32 the novelties of this research can be explained as follow a novel dual layer nanofibrous membrane was fabricated and used for treating the industrial textile wastewater by using the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd process for the first time to the best of our knowledge in the open literature the modified electrospinning method with higher nanofiber mass production as compared with the typical electrospinning i e the gas assisted electrospinning also known as electroblowing was used for fabrication of nanofibrous membrane samples the structure of the proposed composite membrane consists of two nanofibrous layers the styrene acrylonitrile san4 polymer for the bottom layer and the high impact polystyrene hips polymer for the top layer various techniques were used for the characterization of membrane specifications and study on its performance the fabricated membrane was then used for treating the simulated single dye solution and the real textile wastewater samples by the dcmd process all tests were conducted under constant temperature and flowrate moreover the actual textile wastewater sample was tested in the dcmd system as received and without any pretreatment step this can evaluate the performance of the newly developed membrane for further challenging applications the results of this work introduce a cost effective and more affordable membrane which can shed some light on the niches of the dcmd process for industrial textile wastewater treatment presented follow are the detailed results of this research 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercial granules of high impact polystyrene hips mfi 4 5 g 10min 1 200 c and styrene acrylonitrile san4 mfi 7 g 10min

was also supplied by a local textile dyeing factory in alborz province iran the effluent sample was collected from the equalization tank then was preserved in the fridge 4 c to prevent any biodegradation due to microbial action noureddin et al 2014 jaber et al 2015 it should be mentioned that the real wastewater sample was used as received without any pretreatment step a commercial ptfe membrane with 0 22 Î¼m pore size membrane solutions co china was used as the control for comparing the morphology mechanical features and results for the dcmd process in terms of the permeate flux and the contaminant rejection 2 2 solution preparation for gas assisted electrospinning the homogenous dope solutions were prepared for fabricating the composite nanofibrous membrane samples by dissolving 22 wt of hips polymer and 24 wt san4 polymer in the mixture of dmf acetone solvents 7 3 separately this followed by stirring at 250 rpm for 24 h the polymer solutions were then kept at ambient temperature for 24 h to remove the bubbles before the gas assisted electrospinning step 2 3 gas assisted electrospinning system a gas assisted electrospinning system was used for fabricating the electroblown nanofibrous membrane samples fig 1 shows a general scheme of the applied system in this research the gas assisted electrospinning conditions were set as follow 20 kv high voltage 135 Î¼l min 1 dope injection rate 35 cm tip to collector distance 150 rpm drum collector rotation speed 14 g and 18 g needles for the co axial spinneret outer and inner respectively and 3 n l min 1 dried airflow in the conventional electrospinning system the dope solution is charged under the high voltage electric field then it is injected through a single tube needle with a few microliters per hour Î¼l h 1 29 the low nanofiber productivity is one of the most essential niches for the upscaling of this technique to fabricate the membrane samples a complimentary external drag force can be used to increase the nanofiber productivity employing a gas flow surrounding the taylor cone through the co axial nozzle aminyan and bazgir 2019 the proposed gas flow can then impose the additional stretching force to enhance the nanofiber mass production and their deposition speed as well the applied spinneret in the gas assisted electrospinning consists of two needles in the co axial configuration the polymer solution is delivered through the inner needle 14 g while the gas jet is imposed through the outer needle the detailed configuration of the gas assisted electrospinning is shown in fig 2 for other parts of the system there is no difference as compared with the conventional electrospinning 2 4 cold press treatment before the dcmd tests the dual layer nanofibrous membrane samples were cold pressed gotech taiwan under 2000 psi for 30 s 2 5 dcmd process a lab scale apparatus was used for the dcmd tests fig 3 shows the general scheme of the dcmd system the hot feed and the cold permeate streams were circulated in a closed loop using two diaphragm pumps two precise regulators were used for adjusting the inlet pressures in the feed and permeate channels 0 15 bar a plate and frame module with 12 5 cm2 active area channels depth 1 mm was used when the hot feed stream was fed into the lower channel and the cold permeate stream was fed into the upper channel in all tests the membrane surface made of hips was in direct contact with the hot feed stream the fabricated nanofibrous and ptfe membranes were then addressed to the dcmd process using distilled water simulated single dye solutions and an industrial wastewater sample from a textile dyeing factory for all the tests conducted the constant temperature difference of 40 c Î´t was used the feed temperature th was set at 52 2 c and the permeate temperature tc was established at 12 3 c respectively this Î´t was investigated as it would be the most affordable temperature difference in the textile factory the effluent temperature varies between 50 80 c for commercialization of the dcmd process constant feed flowrates of 0 48 and 0 24 l min 1 were investigated for the hot qh and cold qc streams respectively two sets of dcmd tests were conducted the short term tests for 6 h and the long term tests for 48 h the permeate tank containing the distilled water 4 5 Î¼s cm 1 12 3 c was circulated at the half of the feed flowrates with counter current flow arrangement inside the module this operating condition causes a bit higher hydraulic pressure in the feed channel thus membrane pore wetting is more detectable four pt 100 thermal sensors jumo temperature sensor germany were located as close as possible to the entry and exit points of the dcmd module to monitor the temperatures two precise regulators and corresponding pressure gauges adjusted and controlled the pressure of the feed and permeate channels an a d ek 2000i digital balance japan was used for recording the permeate weight differences during the tests the temperatures of the feed and permeate tanks were adjusted using a heater and a chiller respectively it is worth stating that the permeate flux was reported after reaching a stable condition after almost 30 min for all tests 2 6 process analysis and membrane characterization a metrohm conductivity meter metrohm 912 switzerland was used to detect the conductivity of the permeate tank the permeate flux was determined as follow 1 j Î´ m a t where j kg m 2 h 1 Î´m a and t represent the permeate flux the weight difference the effective membrane area and the test time the rejection rate for all tests was determined as follow 2 r c f c p c f 100 where r is the rejection factor and cf and cp are the concentrations of the contaminates mg l 1 in the feed and the permeate respectively scanning electron microscope sem system vega tescan czech republic was used for morphology observation of the fabricated and commercial membranes before and after the dcmd tests samples were first coated with a thin gold layer using a sputter coating machine emitech sc7620 at least 100 fiber diameters were measured from different areas and different pictures with the same magnification of each membrane as described in the previous studies 37 38 sem images were analyzed to measure the fiber diameter and its distribution as well as surface pore size and its distribution by an image analyzer software digimizer 5 3 5 from random membrane surfaces based on the standard method described in the literature at least three various locations were considered for pore size evaluation 39 40 the thicknesses of the neat and the cold pressed dual layer membrane samples were measured form random places of each sample using a precise micrometer the average of 10 measured thicknesses was reported the thickness of the commercial ptfe membrane was reported by the supplier total thickness 180 Î¼m and 20 Î¼m for the ptfe layer 38 the porosity of the nanofibrous membrane is defined as the inter fiber space to the total volume of the membrane the porosity was determined by utilizing the gravimetric method as follow 42 3 Îµ w w w d Ï i w w w d Ï i w d Ï p where w d is the dry weight of the membrane g w w is the ipa saturated weight of the membrane g Ï i and Ï p are the densities of ipa and polymer respectively liquid entry pressure lep value of a membrane is a function of maximum pore size rmax surface hydrophobicity Î¸ and thickness 43 it ensures the membrane performance for wastewater treatment in long term operation the lep values of the fabricated and commercial membranes were determined as described in the literature 44 45 the pressure was increased stepwise with 0 1 bar every 30 s until a flow is detected the pressure was then recognized as the lep 4 l e p Î² Î³ 1 cos Î¸ r max the dual layer nanofibrous membrane and the commercial ptfe membrane were also examined for their surface hydrophobicity by the water contact angle wca measurement using the sessile drop method and a ccd camera kruss analyzer g10 drop shape analyzer germany at least the average of three measurements was reported the mechanical properties of the fabricated and commercial membranes including elongation at break tensile strength mpa and breaking factor n m 1 of the nanofibrous composite and ptfe membranes were evaluated by a tensile testing machine instron 1122 uk a fitted paper frame was used to load the samples between the two jaws of the tensile machine to avoid damaging the membrane samples during the tensile tests before conducting the tensile test the frame was cut from both sides and only the membrane samples went through the test 46 the average value of the three trials was then reported at ambient conditions 23 c temperature and 35 humidity 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology observation and characteristics fig 4 illustrates the surface morphologies of the gas assisted electrospun fibers in the range of nano micro size and their respective fiber diameter distributions and the cross section image of the dual layer cold pressed membrane as well as the surface morphology of the commercial ptfe membrane the surface of nanofibrous membrane samples was analyzed for the fiber diameter its average value and the distribution of fiber diameters in the typical electrospinning polymer fibers are ejected from the tip of the spinneret when the high voltage is applied between the needle tip and the collector the imposed airflow in the gas assisted electrospinning adds an extra drag force which surrounds the taylor s cone this not only can implement the fiber productivity but also make the solidification step faster 47 the continuous accumulation of the solidified nano micro fibers can randomly form layers upon layers the result is an interconnected nanofibrous structure 48 table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the individual layers the dual layer membrane and the commercial ptfe membrane the single hips layer 1 consists of fibers in the range of 200 1500 nm with an average diameter of 970 nm the fibers diameter did not change considerably after the cold press step 985 nm see fig 4 the hips nanofibers have a cylindrical shape and some beads can be observed on the fibers this bead on fiber structure is similar to the resultant fibers in the research by zulfi and co workers 49 moreover the beads can be related to the butadiene content in the hips structure which is hardly soluble in dmf solvent 50 however a nanofibrous structure with a random fiber distribution in the range of 70 250 nm and without beads formation was obtained for the san4 single layer 2 as the cold press was used for the post treatment step the average fiber diameter 143 nm did change considerably see fig 4 on the other hand the cold press post treatment changed the thickness of the single layers as well as the dual layer membrane structure as could be observed in table 2 the thickness reduced from 239 nm to 173 nm for the dual layer membrane it is well discussed in the literature that the thinner the membrane is the lower mass transfer exists for vapor molecules however very thin membranes lose a considerable amount of energy of the feed stream through the membrane heat conduction which is one of the most significant drawbacks of the dcmd process 51 therefore there is a trade off between the membrane thickness and the permeate flux especially for large size md modules 52 shirazi and co workers 28 used different commercial ptfe membranes with different thicknesses 115 300 Î¼m for desalination by using the dcmd process the authors comprehensively discussed the effect of the membrane thickness and concluded that thicker structure could reduce the permeate flux for feed salinities up to 45 g l 1 in another research eykens and co workers 53 studied on the membrane thickness on the permeate flux of the dcmd process at different salinities up to 24 wt the authors concluded that thinner membranes show higher fluxes while energy efficiency is unaffected by membrane thickness for very low feed salinity however when highly saline feed was introduced to the dcmd system the optimal membrane thickness depends on the membrane parameters and process conditions and thicker membrane can perform more efficient than that of the thinner ones surface hydrophobicity is a crucial parameter for md membranes 54 55 thus the single layer webs and the dual layer membrane as well as the commercial ptfe membrane were all tested for the surface hydrophobicity the surface contact angles were measured at about 148 3 and 144 for neat samples of 1 and 2 membranes respectively table 2 the same values were measured at about 142 6 and 131 3 for the pressed samples respectively as could be observed the hydrophobicity of the 1 layer hips is higher than that of the 2 san4 layer both before and after the cold pressing step which can be attributed to the intrinsic properties of the hips polymer moreover the beaded structure of the hips nanofibers can enhance the surface hydrophobicity therefore based on the obtained results the nanofibrous hips web with higher surface hydrophobicity was investigated for the membrane top layer and the nanofibrous san 4 mat was investigated as the bottom layer on the other hand the decrease of the surface hydrophobicity after cold press treatment can be affected by the reduction of the surface roughness and higher fiber compaction this is in good agreement with the results reported by yao and co workers 56 the authors reported that heat pressed treatment led to lower surface hydrophobicity for the electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene membranes moreover the surface contact angle for the dual layer membrane 3 is 148 5 and 143 2 before and after cold press respectively additionally this should be noted that all membrane samples are more hydrophobic than that of the ptfe membrane 4 with a 123 5 contact angle this can be concluded that the new dual layer san4 hips membrane with a three dimensional interconnected pore structure is more promising in term of the surface hydrophobicity table 3 presents the other characteristics of the dual layer membrane and the commercial ptfe membrane including the mean surface pore size dp the porosity Îµ and liquid entry pressure lep membrane samples both the dual layer 3 and the commercial ptfe 4 were examined for the surface pore size using image analysis of sem images the minimum and maximum pore sizes were also measured 0 296 and 3 57 Î¼m and 0 23 and 1 88 Î¼m for the 3 membrane before and after the cold press treatment respectively the same values were measured at 0 113 and 0 79 Î¼m for the commercial membrane 4 respectively moreover the mean pore size dp for the 3 membrane was measured at 1 76 and 0 43 Î¼m before and after cold press respectively however the mean surface pore size for the commercial membrane was estimated at 0 29 Î¼m which is almost close to the reported value by the supplier i e 0 22 Î¼m table 3 this can also confirm the validation of the image processing technique for the surface pore size measurement of the nanofibrous membranes moreover the accuracy of the microscopic method for pore size analysis has already been tested and reported in the literature 38 57 58 the results also revealed that the smaller surface pore size could be achieved by the simple cold press treatment technique smaller pore size can then guarantee the long term performance of the membrane for the dcmd tests owing lower pore wetting risk for tighter membranes 28 moreover it is reported in the literature that the optimum surface pore size for an md membrane is in the range of 0 1 0 5 Î¼m 30 the mean surface pore size of the cold pressed dual layer membrane is 0 43 Î¼m which is favorably in the optimum range membrane porosity is an essential feature of the dcmd process 59 it is referred to as the void volume fraction of the membrane 60 higher porosity can provide more channels in the membrane structure and consequently higher evaporation surface area for diffusing the vapor molecules 42 therefore membranes with higher porosity can provide higher permeate flux 61 furthermore the presence of more voids can reduce the heat loss through the dcmd membrane owing to enhance its thermal resistance in better words the air which is present in the pore spaces has much lower thermal conductivity k 0 029 w m 1 k 1 than the membrane materials hips 0 16 0 22 w m 1 k 1 and san4 0 348 w m 1 k 1 as a result both permeability and thermal efficiency of the membrane can be considerably increased at higher porosity ranges 62 it is worth noting that the conventional phase inversion membranes suffer from the low porosity while the electrospinning technique can fabricate membranes with porosity up to 90 29 however it should be noted that high membrane porosity can weaken the membrane mechanical durability the neat and cold pressed 3 membrane samples as well as the commercial membrane 4 were tested for their porosity as could be observed in table 3 the neat dual layer membrane has 94 6 porosity and this value decreases up to 77 8 after cold press treatment the porosity of the commercial membrane was reported at about 75 by the supplier which is almost lower than that of the newly fabricated nanofibrous membrane 3 in all configurations of the md process only vapor molecules should transfer through the membrane pores and the process liquid i e the hot feed should not penetrate into the pores that is why the active surface of the membrane which is in direct contact with the feed stream should be hydrophobic 31 as could be observed in table 2 the cold pressed dual layer membrane is more hydrophobic 143 2 than that of the commercial ptfe membrane 123 5 this remarkable hydrophobicity was provided by the hips layer that is why the nanofibrous the hips layer was investigated as the top surface for the dual layer membrane further to this the lep liquid entry pressure value of the dcmd membrane which is defined as the minimum transmembrane pressure where liquid penetrates the pores of the membrane should be as high as possible 63 the high lep value is essential to avoid membrane pore wetting and its value must be higher than that of the imposed hydrostatic pressure 64 it is discussed in the literature that the proper lep of 200 kpa is necessary for the long term md performance 65 the lep value was measured at 135 6 kpa which is almost lower than that of the commercial ptfe membrane 140 4 kpa this difference in the lep values can be attributed to the surface properties of the membranes while the dual layer membrane is more hydrophobic it has a larger surface pore size 0 43 Î¼m as compared with the commercial ptfe membrane 0 29 Î¼m tijing and co workers 39 conducted the lep tests for a dual layer membrane with a nanofibrous structure made of poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene and a commercial ptfe membrane the authors reported 77 94 kpa and 273 kpa for their lep respectively it was concluded that the lower lep for the fabricated electrospun membrane attributed to its large surface pore size i e 1 Î¼m in another research woo and co workers 66 reported the lep values in the range of 122 184 kpa for the neat and heat pressed dual layer nanofibrous membranes the authors discussed that the heat pressed membranes have higher lep which is owing to their higher compaction and decreased pore size in the nanofibrous structure 3 1 1 mechanical properties the pressure driven membrane processes work under high operating pressures ranging from 500 to 2500 kpa 67 while all md configurations operate at almost atmospheric pressure 150 kpa therefore the membrane has fewer requirements for mechanical integrity 65 however adequate mechanical features are necessary to guarantee the long term performance of an md membrane and damage prevention moreover the electrospun nanofibrous membrane should withstand the stress from packing the membranes in the module 66 the dual layer nanofibrous membrane samples before and after cold press treatment were characterized for the mechanical properties the force at break fb the elongation at break eb the tensile strength at break tsb and the braking factor bf were measured at 2 09 and 2 19 n 8 and 4 0 404 and 5 16 mpa and 80 91 and 87 7 n m 1 respectively results indicated that the cold press treatment enhanced the mechanical durability of the nanofibrous membrane table 4 presents the mechanical properties of the cold pressed dual layer membrane 3 as compared with the commercial ptfe membrane 4 as could be observed the ptfe membrane has remarkable mechanical features however it should be noted that all tests for 3 membrane were conducted for the support less membrane sample while it was almost impossible to remove the thin ptfe layer 20 Î¼m from the nonwoven support based on the obtained results this can be discussed that the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous san4 hips membrane has a semi elastic behavior and can bend properly 3 2 dcmd performance for textile wastewater the textile industry in both the dyeing and printing sections can provide a large amount of highly polluted and colored wastewater which should be appropriately treated before discharging to the environment 6 among different possible treatment strategies the dcmd process possesses remarkable advantages over others one of the most great superiorities is the ability to utilize the waste heat of the drained dyeing wastewater which is in the range of 50 80 c 13 22 this can significantly decrease energy consumption during the treatment process moreover it can also impose less carbon foot print and thermal pollution on the environment however most of the reports on the application of md processes for treating the textile wastewater have been focused on the lab made simulated samples rather than the real industrial effluent 27 3 2 1 distilled water flux the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous membrane 3 and the commercial ptfe membrane 4 were first tested for their pure water flux fig 5 illustrated the permeate flux when the distilled water was fed into the dcmd system Î´t 40 c qh 0 48 l min 1 and qc 0 24 l min 1 the average permeate fluxes were measured at about 41 30 and 36 54 kg m 2 h 1 for 3 and 4 membranes respectively when the distilled water is introduced to the md system there is not a significant fluctuation in the permeate flux therefore the short term tests were conducted for 6 h as could be observed in fig 5 the fabricated nanofibrous membrane provided higher permeate flux this can be attributed to the larger pore size higher surface hydrophobicity and thinner structure of the 3 membrane 0 43 Î¼m 143 2 and 173 Î¼m respectively as compared with the commercial 4 membrane 0 29 Î¼m 123 5 and 180 Î¼m respectively this is in good agreement with the discussion by eykens and co workers 53 moreover the 3 membrane has an almost higher porosity than that of the 4 membrane see table 3 all these have led to higher permeate flux for the 3 membrane when the distilled water was introduced to the dcmd system furthermore the permeate flux for both membranes is almost constant with negligible fluctuation after 6 h continuous dcmd test this behavior for distilled water permeate flux is mainly due to its purity and the absence of contaminants which is also similar to the reported performance in the literature 68 3 2 2 simulated wastewater flux the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous membrane 3 and the commercial ptfe membrane 4 were then tested for their permeate flux when simulated single dye wastewater samples were introduced to the dcmd system two wastewater samples were prepared by dispersing two different dyes i e disperse red 60 wdr and reactive orange 122 wro table 1 in the distilled water the same operating conditions Î´t 53 c qh 0 48 l min 1 qc 0 24 l min 1 were used for dcmd tests for 6 h fig 6 illustrates the variation of the permeate flux versus the time the membrane samples were addressed to the short term test for 6 h to evaluate their performance and the interaction of the membrane surface with the single dye as could be observed the initial permeate fluxes were measured at about 38 77 and 32 20 kg m 2 h 1 for 3 and 4 membranes respectively for treating the wro wastewater see fig 6 a moreover higher and almost more stable permeate flux was achieved by using the 3 membrane than that of the 4 one when the wro wastewater was introduced to the dcmd system the higher permeate flux of the 3 membrane can be attributed to its larger pore size higher porosity with the 3d interconnected pores and almost thinner structure on the other hand when the wdr wastewater was fed to the dcmd system the initial fluxes were measured at about 36 33 and 35 11 kg m 2 h 1 for 3 and 4 membranes respectively see fig 6 b moreover the declined trend for the permeate flux was different the permeate flux is reductive for both 3 and 4 membranes for the first 30 min the 3 membrane provided higher flux as compared with the 4 membrane however almost a sharp flux decline was observed for both membranes after 180 min dcmd test after this both membranes performed practically invariably overall the 4 membrane provided higher permeate flux as compared with the 3 membrane by using the wdr wastewater sample this can be attributed to the higher fouling tendency of the membranes by using the individual disperse dye fig 6 b disperse dyes are almost insoluble in water table 1 and various surfactants and dispersing agents are needed to enhance their solubility in the water 6 14 69 however the wdr wastewater in this work was prepared by dispersing the pure red 60 dye in the distilled water without using any surfactants therefore the majority of dye content precipitated on the membrane surface and formed a cake layer moreover lower permeate flux for the 3 membrane compared with the 4 membrane can be attributed to the higher scaling tendency of the membrane surface and forming a thicker cake layer moreover the dye charge seems ineffective in the membrane fouling as the top layer is formed by the hips nanofibers this polymer is a non polar one 70 this is discussed in the next section it is worth quoting that almost 100 color rejection was achieved in the dcmd tests for both wdr and wro wastewater samples after 6 h continuous operation this is in good agreement with the literature on the md based treatment of the simulated textile wastewater 24 26 3 2 3 industrial wastewater flux for the next step both the fabricated nanofibrous membrane and the commercial membrane 3 and 4 respectively were continuously tested for treating the real industrial textile wastewater for up to 48 h the permeate flux data was recorded every 1 h as could be observed in fig 7 the initial permeate flux recorded at about 37 34 and 34 88 kg m 2 h 1 by using the 3 and 4 membranes respectively the flux then tended to decrease up to 12 for the 4 membrane during the first 15 h of the dcmd process after this time the permeate flux for the 4 membrane fluctuated with the almost constant trend the trend for the 3 membrane permeate flux is practically different the flux decline during the first 15 h of the dcmd process was virtually up to 22 after this time the constant permeate flux with slight fluctuation can be observed moreover higher permeate flux was achieved by using the 3 membrane after 48 h continuous dcmd operation for treating the industrial textile wastewater the obtained average permeate fluxes for the 3 and 4 membranes were measured at about 23 56 and 19 82 kg m 2 h 1 respectively the obtained permeate flux profile for the 4 membrane in this work is almost in a good agreement with the reported results in the literature for the md based treatment of industrial textile wastewater 13 however the 3 membrane performed better and provided higher permeate flux but it should be noted that having higher permeate flux is not enough and the quality of the obtained permeate should be adequate to pass the standards this is discussed in the next section the sharp decreasing trend of the permeate flux during the first 10 15 h of the dcmd process is caused by solute color deposition on the membrane surface this can lead to cake formation on the membrane surface and pore blocking as well as higher mass transfer resistance for vapor molecules the partial pore wetting owing to the presence of the surfactants in the industrial textile wastewater can also cause the flux decline furthermore other contaminants can sever the polarization effects 71 72 overall the performance of the 3 membrane was remarkable and more promising as compared with the reported ones in the literature 73 74 the fouling and rejection performances of the 3 and 4 membranes are discussed in the next section 3 3 rejection and membrane fouling in this work three types of wastewater samples were investigated for evaluating the dcmd performance for textile effluent treatment the first two samples were prepared by dispersing the individual dyes i e disperse red 60 wdr with a neutral charge and reactive orange 122 wro with the negative charge in the distilled water table 1 and the third sample was the real textile wastewater sample collected from a local dyeing factory the daily amount of discharged effluent was reported at about 120 150 m3 d 1 with temperature in the range of 60 80 c the membrane performance for wastewater treatment not only should be evaluated based on the permeate flux but also should be examined based on the contaminant rejection potential 75 76 the rejection performance of the 3 and 4 membranes was measured based on the eq 2 3 3 1 rejection based on the obtained results almost complete rejection 100 was achieved for both 3 and 4 membranes by using wdr and wro wastewater samples this can be attributed to the non volatile property and large molecule sizes of the dyes it is well discussed in the literature that one of the most promising advantages of the md process is the ability to reach high rejection factors 100 for non volatile solutes 68 this is also in a good agreement with the literature on the rejection data for md based desalination and dye removal from the simulated wastewaters 24 26 table 5 shows the characteristics of the industrial textile effluent as well as the permeate analysis for the dcmd tests performed by using the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous membrane 3 and the commercial ptfe membrane 4 moreover the standards for discharging the effluent are tabulated as could be observed the industrial wastewater sample is highly colored color 2000 mg pt l 1 and polluted cod 1250 mg o2 l 1 with a high level of ec electrical conductivity 6237 3 Î¼s cm 1 and tds total dissolved solids 4797 mg l 1 therefore owing to strict standards for draining out the textile wastewater mostly in terms of cod bod and color content 13 27 this wastewater cannot discharge directly to the environment based on the obtained results both the 3 and 4 membranes have performed remarkably the commercial ptfe membrane reduced the cod color and tds up to 17 mg o2 l 1 5 mg pt l 1 and 31 mg l 1 which all equal to almost 98 64 99 75 and 99 35 contaminant rejection respectively the same values for the contaminant rejection were measured at about 99 28 100 and 99 79 for cod color and tds by using the 3 membrane respectively in terms of bod and turbidity rejections both membranes performed perfectly with almost complete rejection it should be noted that few works in the literature reported the md treatment results for real textile wastewater samples mokhtar and co workers 13 reported 72 80 and 72 89 rejections for cod and color removal respectively using a pvdf cloisite 15a hollow fiber membrane in another work li and co workers 27 reported 89 96 and 94 100 rejections for cod and color removal respectively using commercial pvdf and ptfe membranes the cold pressed dual layer membrane showed better results in rejecting color in comparison to the cod this can be attributed to the large particle size for color molecules which is in the range of 600 1000 g mol 1 for textile dyes and pigments however the cod of the industrial textile wastewater is a complex mixture of surfactants dyes mineral oils suspended solids etc moreover the organic contaminants in the dyeing effluent are in the range of 0 001 100 Î¼m 13 14 which are much smaller than that of the membrane pores see table 3 as discussed in the literature some of these components can be possibly transported through the membrane pores by vapor molecules as the primary carrier 72 74 overall based on the obtained results in this work it can be concluded that the dcmd performance of the 3 membrane was considerably promising for industrial textile wastewater treatment moreover it should be noted that although 100 cod removal could not be achieved by using the 3 membrane via the dcmd process the permeate quality is still in the standard range see table 5 3 3 2 fouling unlike the pressure driven nf ro membrane processes which work under high operating pressures 10 25 bar the dcmd process works at almost atmosphere pressure 0 15 bar 58 therefore there is a lower fouling scaling tendency in the md processes however the membrane fouling in all configurations of the md process is related to the hydrophobic nature of the applied material for fabricating the membrane 77 in the case of dyeing and printing wastewaters in the textile industry there is an excellent interaction between the membrane surface and the aromatic rings of the color molecules which causes an enhanced fouling tendency 76 that is why even though the operating pressure in md processes is lower than of the lep value of the used membrane partial pore wetting can cause the membrane wetting and penetrating the solutes to the permeate side this can happen when fouling and scaling occur at the membrane surface which can change the membrane properties such as lep and surface hydrophobicity 74 therefore close inspections via visualization of the membranes surfaces and sem observations were performed fig 8 shows the membranes surfaces and sem images with different magnifications as could be observed a thin layer of organophilic compounds present in the wastewater samples which is almost dense is formed on the membrane surface the proposed layer can therefore reduce the available open pore area for transporting the vapor molecules from the hot front to the cold side this is the main reason for the flux decline as time goes by this observation can confirm the experimental results for the reduction in the permeate flux after 6 and 48 h dcmd process respectively the same results for the effect of cake layer formation and fouling on the membrane surface have also been observed for the md based treatment of other wastewater samples 78 moreover the dye charge seems ineffective in the membrane fouling as the top layer is formed by the hips nanofibers and this polymer is a non polar one 70 furthermore the membrane surfaces were analyzed for the elemental components using edx analysis as shown in table 6 the results strongly indicated the formation of the fouling layer on the membrane surface the presence of these elements can be attributed to the dyes chemicals and inorganic materials as well as surfactants in the dyeing processes of textiles and fabrics 6 10 the carbon c oxygen o and fluorine f content of the pristine membranes are related to the chemical structure of the ptfe c2f4 n san4 c8h8 n c3h3n m and hips polymers other elements can be found in industrial textile wastewaters 27 35 71 72 moreover the formation of the fouling layer on the membrane surface reduced the original content of c o and f elements this can confirm the presence of the scaling layers on the membrane surfaces see fig 8 for instance the carbon content reduced up to 53 95 53 61 and 33 38 for the nanofibrous membrane samples used for the wdr wro and the real wastewater samples respectively moreover the fluorine content reduced up to 45 33 25 75 and 53 24 for the commercial membrane samples used for the wdr wro and the real wastewater samples respectively all these revealed that the foulants cover the membrane surfaces meanwhile the higher oxygen content is caused by organic and biological components in the wastewater samples 74 76 the formation of the foulant layer on the membrane surface can also enhance the pore wetting risk of the membrane in the dcmd process 77 78 this can be investigated as one of the most important reasons for the reduction of color and cod removal when a real textile effluent is introduced to the md system mostly in the long term operation 74 pore wetting in md membranes can occur when i the input pressure in the feed channel is higher than that of the lep value ii the feed sample contains high surfactants and organic contents and iii the formed cake layer influences the surface hydrophobicity 31 77 although the membrane fouling was almost considerable mostly for the newly developed nanofibrous san4 hips membrane 3 for treating the industrial wastewater see fig 8 the pore wetting was almost negligible this conclusion can be proved based on the rejection factors for contaminants and the dcmd performance of the 3 membrane see table 5 therefore it can be concluded that the flux reduction was mainly due to the fouling effect rather than the partial pore wetting this discussion was also proved by examining the surface hydrophobicity of the fouled membranes as could be observed in fig 9 there are some reductions in the surface contact angles for both the 3 and 4 membranes the contact angle for pristine 3 and 4 membrane was 143 2 and 123 5 respectively while it reduced after using for real textile wastewater treatment for instance the surface contact angle reduced up to 15 15 and 13 92 after treating the real textile effluent for the 3 and 4 membranes respectively the hydrophobicity reduction is almost more for the 3 membrane than that of the 4 membrane however it is still hydrophobic enough to be used in the dcmd process this reduction in the surface contact angle can be attributed to the sophisticated composition of the formed cake layers on the surfaces of the membranes 27 it has been discussed in the literature that the presence of the organic compounds in the textile wastewater could affect the surface properties of the investigated membrane mokhtar and co workers 13 reported an almost 29 reduction in the surface hydrophobicity pristine membrane 97 7 and fouled membrane 69 3 when a lab made pvdf cloisite 15a hollow fiber membrane was used for treating the real textile effluent in another work li and co workers 27 reported a 6 9 42 reduction in the surface hydrophobicity of commercial ptfe and pvdf membranes furthermore the obtained results revealed that the cold pressed dual layer nanofibrous san4 hips membrane in this work is more durable for textile effluent treatment in terms of surface hydrophobicity than that of the discussed ones in the literature this can therefore guarantee the long term dcmd performance of this membrane with remarkable contaminants removal efficiency as reported in table 5 3 4 feasibility consideration table 7 presents comparative results in terms of permeate fluxes and rejections of this work with some examples from the published literature it is worth noting that very few studies investigated the real textile wastewater for addressing to the md process for treatment 27 as could be observed the newly developed dual layer nanofibrous san4 hips membrane 3 is comparable with the commercial membranes concerning the permeate flux and contaminant rejection cod and color removal moreover as discussed previously the permeate flux decline in this work was mainly due to the scale cake formation and fouling on the membrane surface rather than the partial pore wetting as the membranes 3 and 4 remained hydrophobic after the dcmd tests fig 9 in better words the reduction in the permeate flux can be mostly attributed to the complex composition of the industrial textile effluent sample in which some of the organic foulants formed a cake layer on the membrane surface and enhanced the mass transfer resistance for vapor molecules 29 78 taking the obtained results in this work and the presented ones in table 7 into consideration the newly developed nanofibrous membrane 3 can be investigated as an alternative for the dcmd treatment of industrial textile wastewater moreover it should be noted that the used polymers in fabricating this nanofibrous membrane i e hips and san 4 are much cheaper and more cost effective than that of the pvdf polymer and its derivatives these further to the potential for using the industrial wastewater with the temperature in the range of 50 80 c directly as the feed and without any pre heating step can shed some light on further economizing the dcmd process for textile wastewater treatment however more efforts are still needed to work on membrane fouling reduction and mechanical durability enhancement furthermore the textile industry uses a large amount of water for different steps varying from several hundred to a few thousand m3 day 1 6 14 15 thus the efficient water recovery using the dcmd process equipped by the newly developed nanofibrous membrane and producing high quality product i e clean water which can pass the standards see table 5 can further improve the sustainability in the textile industry to prove the efficiency of the dcmd process for industrial wastewater treatment its operating conditions and the permeate quality were also thoroughly compared to other membrane based alternatives including mf uf nf and ro pressure driven processes the results are summarized in table 8 as could be observed in terms of operation the dcmd process is driven in considerably lower pressure 0 15 bar however the operating pressure is much higher mostly for nf and ro processes 10 bar 5 11 14 in terms of the permeate quality the product provided by the dcmd process is comparable with the ro process both of them can meet the required standards for discharging the textile effluent moreover it should be noted that the dcmd process in this research has been driven without any pretreatment step in many pressure driven membrane processes the pretreatment step is essential when the actual wastewater sample is introduced to the system this is owing to the fouling tendency in these processes which is caused by operating pressure and contaminant content however the md process is less sensitive to the membrane fouling due to the low operating pressure this is one of the most important advantages of the md process compared with other techniques removing the pretreatment step can also decrease the carbon footprint and operation costs thus the real textile effluent in this work was fed into the system directly as received another critical challenge of ro is its high energy consumption which is owing to the high osmotic pressure during treatment 29 however the dcmd process does not have such a problem as it can directly utilize the waste thermal energy in the textile industry 50 80 c temperature of the discharged effluent stream 80 this can considerably decrease the operation costs and step forward the dcmd process for economizing and cost effective textile effluent treatment furthermore water penetration into the pores is prevented in the dcmd process owing to the hydrophobic nature of the applied membrane thus almost all of the contaminants and non volatile dissolved solutes can be removed in this process the result is a high purity product see table 8 fig 10 shows the visual view of the feed samples and the obtained permeate in this work it is worth noting that the minor incomplete rejection of contaminants in this research could be mainly related to the membrane fouling rather than the partial pore wetting problem this is in good agreement with the published results in the literature 13 80 however further studies should be completed to improve the anti fouling and anti wetting properties of the md membranes for economized textile effluent treatment 4 conclusions a new membrane with composite dual layer nanofibrous structure has been experimentally used for treating the industrial textile wastewater by using the dcmd process the findings of this study firstly demonstrated that the dcmd process is promising to overcome the limitations of conventional uf nf ro processes in terms of process safety owing to the lower operating pressure and the contaminant removal due to its high rejection potential the used polymers i e hips and san are more cost effective than that of the pvdf one moreover the fabrication technique is the gas assisted electrospinning with higher nanofiber mass production rate than that of the typical electrospinning furthermore the energy consumption in the dcmd process can be considerably lower than that of the conventional membrane processes this is one of the highlighted advantages of the dcmd process that can utilize the waste thermal energy 50 80 c of the discharged textile wastewater all these can shed some light on economizing the md based treatment of the textile effluent the dual layer composite san4 hips membrane demonstrated a remarkable treatment potential of good quality with almost 99 cod reduction and 100 color rejection thus it can be concluded that this has been an accomplishment in treating the industrial textile effluent so far however the membrane fouling is still a severe challenge owing to increment of the mass transfer resistance and the permeate flux decline besides the flux reduction was mainly due to the surface fouling rather than the partial pore wetting concerning the obtained results it can be concluded that the dcmd process equipped with the fabricated dual layer nanofibrous composite membrane in this research can produce the permeate of high quality for possible water reuse however more research is still necessary especially on fouling reduction declarations of competing interest none

13979,phosphates enter the surface waters from agricultural sources has been regarded as an important cause of eutrophication excess of phosphate concentration can cause severe health problems such as kidney damage and osteoporosis the adsorption is one of the most popular removal methods used for treating wastewaters containing agricultural nutrients the challenge is the time that phosphorous concentration is very high in agricultural related industries and is higher than the adsorption capacity of the system this research investigated the treatment of agricultural wastewater by developing and adding two novel media allodust allochar to a single batch aerobic reactor sibar allodust and allochar consisted of allophanic soil mineral material sourced from either a horotiu soil allophanic soil or a craigieburn soil allophanic brown soil central composite design ccd and response surface methodology rsm were hired to design the experiment and model the nature of the response surface of the novel media in the experimental design and to analyze the optimum operational conditions the sibar design was optimized for three ranges of p contamination 1 50 mg l 1 low range 51 175 mid range and 176 300 high range the allodust novel media demonstrated a higher p adsorption capacity compared to the allochar media and allophane compound itself the allodust adsorbent dosage of 3 g l 1 was the optimum being able to remove 100 of p up to 50 mg l 1 in 30 minutes with the lowest aeration rate 1 5 l min 1 and remove 76 of p up to 300 mg l 1 in 450 minutes with the highest aeration rate 7 5 l min 1 keywords agricultural wastewater phosphorous adsorption novel media aerobic reactor 1 introduction excessive application of different types of fertilizers in the agricultural industries oxidation of nitrogenous waste products in human and animal excreta including septic tanks lead to contamination of surface and groundwater and has become a critical global issue 1 changes in land use and excessive use of artificial fertilisers are the main factors for the significant increase of phosphorus levels in groundwater over the past 20 years 2 phosphates enter surface water bodies as a result of agricultural fertilizer run off as well as the wastes from the biological sources the wastes and effluents from the chemical processing industrial points are the other important source of the phosphate contamination of the water resources and waterways depending upon the type of contaminant and the other environmental factors such as ph and temperature orthophosphate can be a product following dissolution in surface water moreover one of the main factors which causes eutrophication is the presence of excessive phosphorus in the water treatment plants and also waterways kidney damage and osteoporosis 3 are the main outcomes of the phosphate presence in not acceptable concentrations in the water supply systems the rigorous limits have been set from the u s epa for total phosphorus concentration in water resources from the point of the waterways 0 1 mg l 1 for rivers and 0 05 mg l 1 for rivers draining into lakes has been indicated to prevent further eutrophication also anzecc trigger values for the total phosphorus is 0 026 mg l 1 for upland rivers and 0 033 mg l 1 for lowland rivers phosphorus is one of the macro elements essential for organism growth and biosynthesis processes furthermore the efficiency of the biogas production can be spiked by the presence of phosphorus in organic pollutant digestion process 4 5 organic carbon oc content has a linear correlation with biological phosphorus removal which is reported in recent studies 6 8 one of the recognized and sustainable phosphorus methods is the adsorption through natural media and minerals while p is a critical element in any biological water treatment due to its effect on microorganisms and algal growth rate as well as conducting the anions adsorption by the bridging mechanism the chemical or physical interaction between a substance and a solid surface which is a mass transfer in a liquid phase is known as adsorption 9 10 the adsorption as an electrostatic process is a promising approach in the field of wastewater management and wastewater process engineering 11 this technique can be hired along with other mechanisms and even biological process can be supported by an adsorption mechanism 12 the physical and chemical characteristic of the anions and adsorbent and their interaction is the main and considerable factor in the adsorption process the other anion characteristics which can be effective in the selective adsorption mechanism efficiency are the solubility ionic radius hydration energy and bulk diffusion coefficient emerging research indicates that allophanic soils may reduce phosphorous in wastewater 13 16 however more information is required to understand the mechanisms involved and to quantify the effects more accurately the horotiu series allophanic soils 17 and craigieburn soils typic allophanic brown soils 17 are the local new zealand allophanic soils the horotiu is formed under the specific environmental conditions which the short range order clay mineral allophane formed from weathering the volcanic glass within the soil material in north island craigieburn occurs where the feldspar bearing greywacke and schist parent materials in the south island high country have been highly weathered allophane mineral has a very high tendency to react with phosphate the other advantage of the presence of this mineral in a soil material is to help to advance the soil physical characteristics by enhancing the soil particles binding which makes a low density and permeable soil 18 bio sorption process has been hired widely to contamination removal from wastewater such as using low cost agricultural wastes and algae 19 21 the agro based materials became an alternative for chemical adsorbents during recent years 22 one of the most popular and easy access bio wastes is sawdust which has been used in different projects and researches 23 also biochar is the other bio waste product which can be obtained from the carbonization of biomass it can enhance the soil properties and has been used as a soil amendment in different projects 24 the membrane bioreactors mbrs tertiary membrane filtration and the reverse osmosis ro were used by strom 25 to remove the p from wastewater at low concentrations of 0 04 0 04 and 0 008 mg l 1 another popular technology is p precipitation by adding the salt e g trivalent metal salts ferric chloride to the effluent containing low p concentration in this technology the production of solids in addition to that already present is problematic and is dependent to the mass of chemical added the researchers 6 investigated different cost effective phosphorus removal processes in municipal wastewater treatment where the concentration was 4 12 mg l 1 this is low range compared to agricultural industry wastewater enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and chemical precipitation are the most used among the regular p removal technologies 26 it s noteworthy that the biological treatment requires a high amount of energy to provide the aeration for a long period of time 27 on the other hand inconsistency in achieving fixed phosphorus concentration in the effluent is a major problem of these systems 26 28 providing the chemicals and the post treatment segment makes an uneconomical system while these treatments led to a high sludge production 29 apart from membrane bioreactors mbrs on a full scale basis a few alternative p removal technologies have shown an acceptable performance such as ifas ebpr integrated fixed film activated sludge systems with enhanced biological phosphorus removal and deep bed granular media filters 6 30 over the last 10 15 years the mbrs have been used widely due to their reliability in effluent quality and consistency 31 however stress on sludge in external mbr membrane pollution and cost are the main drawbacks of this method ifas ebpr as the other method which is known as a hybrid technology provides an environment for the faster growing of the denitrifiers and phosphorus accumulating organisms paos 32 which make this method more efficient compare to the conventional biological processes however the large energy requirements unavailability of mechanical spare parts locally and high construction and operation cost are the main weakness of this technology recently application of media filters for p removal from the water and wastewater has been attracted a wide range of the researches 6 33 36 the high concentration of the phosphorus present in many agricultural industry effluents makes most of the phosphorus technologies non economic and not applicable in the terms of the handling the concentration so in recent years the researchers tried to introduce a natural sustainable stable and effective clay based media to adsorb phosphate from wastewaters our research reported here aims to examine the ability of a new inexpensive developed media to adsorb p efficiency under high concentration our study will also investigate the adsorption mechanism and microstructure analysis of media before and after phosphorus adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and analysis several wastewater samples were collected from the ballance agri nutrients fertiliser distribution yard rolleston canterbury for monitoring the wastewater characteristics the samples from the pump pond and the sump were collected in clean lab containers the pond samples collected from the centre and 35 cm depth from the surface and were immediately stored in a fridge at 4 c to prevent any changes in the sample properties due to the biological reactions 37 the ph temperature c electrical conductivity ms cm salinity g l 1 and tss were determined on site at the time of sampling all the quality analysis was conducted in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 37 the water characteristics are presented in table 1 the phosphorus concentration was fixed in different batches by spiking k2po4 in different concentration zones from 50 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 2 2 allodust allochar preparation allophanic clay material from a craigieburn bw horizon typic allophanic brown soil and horotiu bw horizon allophanic soil 17 were collected from the lake coleridge area south island new zealand and ruakura agricultural centre north island respectively both the craigieburn and horotiu soils were sampled in the b horizon which has the maximum accumulation of allophanic minerals for these soils the soil samples had been air dried before using as an adsorbent and had been passed through a 2 mm sieve and then stored in dry and cool conditions 38 the sawdust of the pine tree source was collected from srs ltd in christchurch rolleston new zealand the sawdust was oven dried at 70 c after washed with ro and then deionized water a couple of times to a constant weight to obtain a fine powder a coffee grinder was used to make sawdust particles in 100 150 Î¼m size 39 in order to remove undesirable substances a solution of 0 5 m hcl was used at room temperature for 6 h 40 the adsorbent was kept under airtight conditions until used in the experiments the ph of both treated and untreated sawdust was determined a ratio of 1 10 sawdust water w v solution was prepared for measuring the ph using 5 g of raw sawdust with 50 ml deionized water after the indication of the sawdust ph in 1 10 solid water ratio the sawdust placed in a separate glass and to adjust the sawdust ph in different ranges 0 1 m hcl solution was used as the agent for the acid treatment specific amounts of 0 1 m hcl was added to the different glass beakers contained the sawdust and di water with the ph meter prob located in the beaker the addition of hcl drops continued while ph stabilised at the same ph value then the beakers were kept overnight in a room temperature environment and the ph measured 24 hrs after the ph adjustment the ph treatment process stopped after observation of a fixed number in two consecutive days the acidic treated sawdust was then dried in a 70 oven and was stored in a desiccator until used in the experiments 41 the same stock of the collected sawdust was used for the pine biochar production the particles less than 1 mm dried and was pyrolyzed at 550 c temperature a steel container covered with aluminium foil was used as the sawdust container in the muffle furnace a thermocouple was the apparatus for controlling the consistency of the temperature 550 c 8 c min for 3 h during the process a series of innovative materials were prepared fresh allochar allophane soil biochar and allodust allophane sawdust were prepared according to the different proportions of the allophanic soils biochar and ph adjusted sawdust powdered craigieburn allophane pca powdered volcanic allophane pva developed from the horotiu soil powdered ph adjusted pine sawdust pps and powdered pine biochar ppb were utilized as media in the treatment system 75 Î¼m particle size 150 Î¼m a similar size range has used in recent studies 42 43 the mix design was prepared according to previous findings 10 44 allophanic soil materials sawdust biochar silica powder and portland cement were mixed together the white cement was used as the binder agent as it had a lower fe content the mix design and cost estimation of allochar and allodust are shown in table 2 based on this information the estimated cost of allodust and allochar per ton are around nz 700 the mixture was moulded using the ratio of the 0 45 water after 1 day the mixed media was placed to the water and cured for 3 days the it was removed from the water and dried in room temperature for two days then prepared media was subjected to xrd ftir sem and testing in accordance with 37 2 3 bioreactor design couple bottom aeration cba ten separate units of single batch aerobic reactor sibar were used for the experiment the sibar s consists of a transparent column made of plexiglas for easier process controlling upvc was used for the base and cap parts of the reactors in order to enhance the mixing efficiency of the air and water cba couple bottom aeration method was used the total volume of the reactors was 2000 ml with 1500 ml working volume all ten reactors were run under the same environmental conditions and at the same time two air pumps were used for the aeration of the system all the running details of the reactors were programmed into a data logger campbell scientific cr850 to applying different aeration rates to the reactors an airflow meter was used to adjusting the airflow rate entering the system this sibar allows both mixing and aeration processes this experimental design was selected to allow for easy applicability and for simultaneous operation different operational variables were considered to design an optimum treatment system the sawdust ph 2 4 and 6 aeration rate 0 5 4 and 7 5 l min 1 contact time 30 240 and 450 min and adsorbent dosage 3 5 7 g l 1 in different phosphorous concentrations 50 175 and 300 mg l 1 introduced to the system as the variables to analysis the phosphorous removal process four dependent parameters p removal percentage chemical oxygen demand cod electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured as the design responses in all the reactor runs the timing of fill and mix 20 min draw and idle 10 min and settle 90 min were set as a constant value for all the reactors 43 45 46 2 4 experimental design rsm ccd in this research central composite design ccd and the response surface methodology rsm method from doe software stat ease used mathematical and statistical techniques to model and analyse the responses of the materials to the experimental conditions the design consists of k2 factorial points completed by 2k axial points and a centre point where k is the number of variables thereupon the ccd and rsm methods were run in order to evaluate the association between the variables i e ph of the sawdust aeration rate and contact time and their responses which were p removal cod also the do ec and ph were recorded for each reactor thus the objective of this design was to optimize the appropriate situation of operating variables to predict the best value of responses which was the removal of p contamination this is summarised in equation 1 1 y Î² 0 Îµ i 1 k Î² i x i i 1 k Î² i i x 2 i i j k j k Î² i j x i x j e where y is the response xi and xj are the variables Î²0 is a constant coefficient Î²j Î²jj and Î²ij are the interaction coefficients of linear quadratic and second order terms respectively k is the number of studied factors and e is the error 3 results and discussions for batch shaking experiment the optimum allodust and allochar dosage and mixed design for a range of time scales were determined for batch optimisation the optimum aeration rate l min 1 contact time min and sawdust ph were determined the experiment was conducted in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and shaken at different contact times after the shaking was finished the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm speed the supernatants were analysed by the smartchem 200 discrete analyser 47 method the removal efficiencies of allodust sawdust ph 2 are presented in table 3 and fig 1 fig 1 illustrates the suitability of the system under different conditions the desirability of p removal in the highest system proficiency highest p removal lowest contact time is 1 while the adsorbent dosage is minimum also it can be concluded that the highest p removal occurred when the system contained the minimum adsorbent dosage 3 1 phosphorous removal analysis in total 8 kinds of media consisting of a novel innovative materials were developed in order to investigate the effect of the allophanic soil material sawdust ph of sawdust and the biochar on the phosphorous removal from wastewater in a cba reactor the central composite design ccd method was utilised to design the experiments for each media with 4 variables and 4 responses the data were analysed with the response surface methodology rsm software in order to monitor the effect of the variable changes in the responses finally anova was run for each experiment to determine the best operating details of the system and to choose the best media for removing p from the wastewater in the bioreactors table 4 shows the allodust comprising horotiu soil material removed p under optimum conditions the different contamination zones in total 90 reactors for h allodust 90 for the c allodust 20 for the h allochar and 20 for the c allochar total of 220 16 control samples reactors were run to find the optimum media for the p removal under the optimal operating conditions of the reactors being lowest contact time and lowest aeration rate also in order to record the effect of each part of the media in p removal two control samples were run for each optimum condition 3 2 phosphorous removal by h allodust it was realized that the phosphorous removal of h allodust was significantly affected by all four system variables moreover central composite design was used to determine the interactive effects of the variables the corresponding results are shown in table 5 utilising the three dimensional response surface curves and contours the optimum values of the variables for p removal from the wastewater were determined fig 2 display the response surface and contours of the p removal rate as a function of p concentration and contact time as independent variables while the sawdust ph and aeration rate are considered as the actual factors for the low range p concentration to the high range p concentration the response surface of the p removal rate gradually decreased when the contact time and the p concentration increased from 30 to 450 min and 50 to 300 mg l 1 respectively when the system contained up to 50 mg l 1 phosphorous fig 2a illustrates the highest p removal with 99 86 when the p concentration was 50 mg l 1 and the contact time was 30 minutes when the adsorbent is mixed with 50 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 p fig 2b and fig 2c the system needs to be run with the highest contact time and the aeration rate for optimum operating conditions the p removal was 79 12 for the mid range zone by h allodust ph 4 21 and 85 13 for the high range zone by h allodust ph 5 82 in 450 minutes the adsorption amount for the blank horotiu soil was just 52 and 41 in the mid range and high range p concentration while it could adsorb the 100 of the p in the low range reactors kaolinite and goethite which are often cemented together in the binary association used as a mixture gkm and also association gka to enhance the soil phosphate adsorption capacity 48 both goethite and kaolinite minerals are ph dependent and the adsorption capacity is highly dependent on the surface properties of the adsorbents montmorillonite s surface area and pore volumes enhanced by the zr4 and zr4 al3 treatment zr4 al3 showed a more significant performance to adsorb phosphate by 17 2 mg p g in an acidic condition the inorganic bentonite modification was conducted by fe and al the interlayer spacing and pore volumes were increased significantly 4 g l 1 of the al bentonite at ph 3 could adsorb up to 60mg l 1 phosphate in 6 hrs 49 phoslock lanthanum la modified bentonite has been recognized as one of the most powerful media s to adsorb phosphate in an aqueous solution 50 56 the acidic condition was reported as a favour for phoslock adsorption behaviour haghseresht et al 51 showed a 30 drop in adsorption capacity when the ph increased to 9 0 from 5 0 it was reported that phoslock can t control the srp concentration higher than 0 047 mg p l and the reason is interactions between la and humic acids 52 57 even in the ratio of 220 1 phoslock p also ph dependency of the phoslock is not following a routine and is reversible h allodust could remove a significant amount of the p from wastewater in a wide range of non acidic ph table 5 and short contact time also the optimum adsorbent dosage to remove up to 300 mg l 1 of the phosphorous was just 3 g l 1 3 3 adsorption mechanisms 3 3 1 allophane adsorption mechanism different soil properties are known as the main factors for phosphorus adsorption ph 58 extractable al and fe 59 organic c 58 and clay content 60 it has been reported that the allophanic soils are adsorbing the phosphate anion 33 nano ball allophane minerals are the adsorption agents 61 62 because of the al oh and al h2o functional groups present on the surface of allophane minerals 63 allophanic soils have more potential to adsorb the phosphate anions compared to the other clay minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite with very high ssa and cec in the structure of allophane the aluminol groups are only located at the pores of the wall of the hollow spherules 64 storing the organic carbon and phosphate adsorption are the main characteristics of the allophane spherules the surface complexation specific adsorption and proton transfer reactions of m and ligands are the processes which cause the surface charge of the iron hydroxides 65 this surface property is one of the considerable factors in the reaction of the anions and mineral surfaces during the adsorption mechanism the anionic adsorption governs by the ligand exchange mechanism which the water dipoles desorption is one of the main consequences 66 67 the exchange of the surface hydroxyl groups with the ligands there is always a competition between ligands and oh for the occupation of the binding sites is the main process for the formation of the surface complex which its extension completely depends on the solution ph 68 69 the inner sphere complexes which are known as the solute complexes and also surface complexes are formed during the adsorption of the anions by the minerals the physical chemical characteristics of anions such as ionic radius bulk diffusion coefficient hydration energy and solubility and how they interact with the different adsorbent surfaces determine the adsorption selective mechanism of a system the other effective factor on the adsorption efficiency is the anions immobilization onto the adsorbent which is completely dependent on the pore sizes of the adsorbent so the anions hydrated dimensions and the adsorbent pore sizes are the factors which need to be considered in an adsorption system the selective anionic adsorption is the outcome of this impediment also the anions and adsorbent surface form inner outer sphere complexes and electrostatic or hydrogen bonding totally the selective anionic adsorption does not completely follow the radius properties and charge the sulfate behaviour is an example which can form the complexes on al and fe oxides and hydroxide with different charges while it compared to the fluoride it has a greater radius 70 the investigation of the anions behaviour close to the depletion region limited by the hydrated anion radius this region is different in size for each mineral and adsorbent 71 the translocation of the water molecules present in the hydrated anion with m is weak and completely ephemeral the long range electrostatic forces are the only attraction force between the adsorbent surface and hydrated anions with a large hydrated radius such as phosphate the covalent bond is associated between the anions with smaller hydrated radius which can form the inner sphere complexes 72 the anions interaction with mineral surfaces which results in the adsorption is completely affected by iron oxide and hydroxide and its surface charge the surface complexation of ligands and m and proton transfer are the processes which appoint this charge 65 the water dipoles desorption happens during the anionic adsorption which is controlled by the exchange of ligands 66 67 3 3 2 sawdust adsorption mechanism the sawdust principal adsorption mechanisms are known as the hydrogen bonding and ion exchange the sawdust complex characteristics and the adsorption behaviour of the components when facing the ions are the factors which support this idea the active ion exchange sawdust compounds are mainly the hydroxyl groups from the cell walls as well as the lignin and cellulose the polymeric material sawdust modification can enhance the adsorption properties of sawdust other researches have successfully modified sawdust to enhance the binding ability 34 73 resulting in introduction and adjustment of more n s and p containing group which are extractive groups to the sawdust these groups have electron donating behaviour while the phosphate is behaving as an electron acceptor based on these concepts the ion exchange mechanism could be considered as the main adsorption process in a system containing sawdust the p ions present in the wastewater can be adsorbed by a solid media through the surface complexes formation between the p and the adsorbed ligands while the sawdust treatment can add more active sites on the surface the physical adsorption mechanism by functional groups is the other considerable contaminant retention behaviour by sawdust the surface activation and pores development were conducted by acidic treatment of the sawdust one of the most effective factors on the sawdust adsorption capacity is the dosage using in the treatment system based on the type of the contaminant and its concentration mostly the lower adsorbent dosage is preferable in this case all the surface sites are available and exposed for retention of contaminants and the surface saturation happen faster which result in system s adsorption capacity enhancement on the other hand higher energy sites become unavailable when using high adsorbent dosage as a consequence most of the lower energy sites become occupied which drop the total adsorption capacity of the system fig 3 3 4 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis the ftir results are presented in fig 4 the presence of the allophane mineral in the media can be concluded from the band in 1028 and 816 cm 1 which belongs to strong si o si Î½a and also the 524 and 480 cm 1 si o al which is an out of plane bending 74 77 the bands at 1485 cm 1 can represent the o3 si oh and 688 cm 1 the presence of the h2o the weak bands belong to the oh Î½s happen at more than 3600 cm 1 two bands of 688 and 500 cm 1 represent the allophane and opaline silica with a disordered structure while the 688 cm 1 band belongs only to the adobes an increase at 1156 cm 1 and 1052 cm 1 bonds can be seen which the reason is the lignin structure a strong aromatic ring stretch phenylpropanoid polymer deformation methyl and methyl and methylene glycosidic linkage and vibrational stretching are indicative of a number of methylene glycosidic linkage and vibrational stretching are indicative of a number of bonds which are present in the lignin 78 following p adsorption fig 4 illustrates that the binding energy belongs to the oh groups si oh al oh dropped because of the hydrogen bond formation between the p ions and the adsorbent 79 80 also the bonding between p ions and oxygen in hydroxyl groups resulting in the wavelength decrease of the hydroxyl groups which make the oh binding energy weaker so due to the different binding changes and shift the interaction of the p ions with allophane and sawdust structure can be seen from the ftir analysis 3 5 x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis the changing in the microstructure of clay minerals is one of the consequences of the interaction between contaminants and clay soil which impact the clay particle forces one of the microstructural experiments which analysis the soil structure changes is xrd fig 5 presents the result of the x ray diffraction of the horotiu soil material and h allodust in different sawdust ph before and after the interaction with phosphorous according to the presented data the intensity of the main peaks dropped while p presented in the structure of the media in high concentration while the high concentration of phosphate adsorbed by the allodust the p ions concentration increased in the pore fluid and led the change in the structure which made it flocculated that change didn t happen in the low range of phosphate concentration which adsorbed on the surface by the reactive sites and was significantly lower than the adsorption capacity of the media the peak intensity of the flocculated soils is lower than the dispersive ones the presence of sawdust improved the peak intensity of the media in the presence of 300 mg l 1 phosphorous so the results of the smartchem p analysis agree with the xrd diffraction results it must be noticed that the peak position is not affected by increasing the p concentration of the pore fluid but just affects the peak intensity 3 6 chemical oxygen demand cod analysis non biodegradable organic matters nbom are controlling the cod amount of effluent during the treatment process it s essential to decrease the amount of nboms in order to control the cod concentration to meet the guidelines 81 soil minerals make several complexes with different properties when facing organic compounds during a process and inorganic cations water silicate layers and organic molecules are all effective factors recently different studies have been conducted concerning the sawdust application to remove different contamination from wastewater in a wastewater treatment process the main factors affecting the cod concentration in the effluent are the microorganism aquatic plants and wood based materials so it s essential to report the cod concentration and its changes during the process while using a bio waste as a media in the removal process 41 so the main objective of this part of the experiment was to quantify the effect of sawdust on the cod in the solution with different p concentrations and the other operational variables such as contact time and aeration rate table 6 the cod samples were prepared using cod digestion vials high range and employing the reactor digestion method from hach new zealand analysed by the hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer fig 6 illustrates the trend of cod amounts for the different optimized conditions the main objective of this experiment was to monitor the cod content and the changing trend of the optimized samples for each contamination range from low to high after the p adsorption the maximum cod amount occurred with the h allodust ph 2 with 51 mg l 1 when mixed with the mid range 175 mg l 1 p contamination and run with 4 5 l min 1 aeration rate for 240 min this result is in parallel with the p adsorption optimization while the h allodust2 showed the highest removal efficiency for the low range of p the cod amount of the same media was only 29 mg l 1 for the low range p concentration 50 mg l 1 when running with 1 5 l min 1 aeration rate for only 30 min so the optimized operational conditions also contained the lowest cod after p adsorption the mid range optimized media sdph 4 21 and aeration rate 7 49 at the highest contact time 450 min contained between 35 mg l 1 to 40 mg l 1 cod which was not the lowest but a good range when mixed with the 175 mg l 1 phosphorous the cod amount for the high range p concentration was only between 14 mg l 1 to 18 mg l 1 when the system was run at its optimized condition for this range of p the cod could increase up to 45 mg l 1 with the other operational conditions remaining constant in this contamination range from these results it can be stated that under acidic conditions of the media both horotiu and sawdust functional groups obtained a positive charge on the surface while the charge became negative under the alkali condition so the adsorption efficiency of the organic matter which has a negative charge is high under acidic situations conversely for the acidic treatment of sawdust hcl was used to increase the proportion of active surfaces and to prevent the elution of tannin compounds that would stain the treated water and that would greatly increase cod however in parallel with increasing the p concentration from 50 mg l 1 to 175 mg l 1 the cod amount incurred as an incremental leap but with increasing the anion concentration to 300 mg l 1 the cod amount decreased so the acidic treatment and protonation of the sawdust surface could be known as a method to control the cod concentration of the effluent 3 7 scanning electron microscope sem the sem was employed to examine the morphology of the soil and developed media before and after the reaction with phosphorus the soil and optimum developed media samples were coated with carbon by ems 150 t es at 62a and 80 mm distance with three pulses 3 seconds pulse the morphology study was operated by sem jeol jsm 7000 f at 5kv and wd6mm for imaging and wd10 mm for eds the results of the morphological study are illustrated in figs 7 8 the binding materials between the soil and media particles couldn t resolve using the usual magnification the sem images of the horotiu and h allodust showed the silty structure as a dominant one in horotiu also allophane particles which were the suspect for the gel like material observed three gravity sedimentation process was conducted and then the deposited materials used for the morphology study fig 7 the clay size particles are still merged into each other and the increased resolution shows that the binder is formed of globular agglomerates of spherical particles with outer diameters of approximately 5 nm which corresponds to the morphology and dimensions of allophane particles 74 75 82 84 these aggregates were observed on both horotiu soil and h allodust media before and after the p adsorption the purpose of the sawdust acidic treatment was to increase the surface activity the surface was activated resulting in well developed pores and covered by the allophane nanoparticles fig 8a the acidic treatment was effective in achieving and activated surface of the raw sawdust the developed pores and channels on the sawdust particles are due to the elimination of filaments sem images of the media after the p adsorption h allodust 50 mg l 1 p demonstrates that the flocculated particles and filled pores can be seen while the allophanic particles are still present on the surface which is parallel with the adsorption results fig 8b the h allodust adsorbed almost all the p in the solution and still had the capacity to adsorb more p from the wastewater in addition the eds graphs demonstrate the presence of the p on the media surface fig 8b 3 8 optimization and statistical analysis the correlation between the variables sawdust ph contact time min aeration rate l min 1 and p concentration mg l 1 and the two important process responses p removal and cod mg l 1 was analyzed by response surface methodology rsm several model terms were preferred to achieve the best fit in a particular model the development of mathematical equations where predicted results y were evaluated as a function of the sawdust ph x1 contact time x2 aeration rate x3 and p concentration x4 was permitted by central composite design ccd the sum of a constant four first order effects terms in x1 x2 x3 and x4 six interaction effect x1x2 x1x3 x1x4 x2x3 x2x4 x3x4 and four second order effects x1 2 x2 2 x3 2 x4 2 were the factors which the calculation conducted based on them as shown in equation 1 and table 3 based on the parameter estimation the following quadratic polynomial equation 2 is given to correlate the relationship between the four factors and the p removal rate 2 p removal 152 42941 3 65946x1 0 053889x2 13 39301x3 0 499988x4 0 005881x1x2 0 954583 x1x3 0 042907 x1x4 0 000652x2x3 0 000137 x2x4 0 008308x3x4 1

the model can be considered significant based on the model f value of 20 79 the chance of the occurrence of this f value due to the noise is only 0 01 also it can be concluded that the model terms are significantly based on the p values less than 0 0500 in this case the significant model terms represent as a c d ac ad cÂ² values greater than 0 1000 indicate the model terms are not significant also the lack of fit f value of 78 72 implies the lack of fit is significant the chance of the occurrence of this lack of fit to the noise is only 0 01 table 7 and table 8 the predicted rÂ² of 0 7157 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted rÂ² of 0 9053 i e the difference is less than 0 2 adeq precision measures the signal to noise ratio a ratio greater than 4 is desirable the model ratio of 13 373 indicates an adequate signal and this model can be used to navigate the design space the optimum conditions for the h allodust were determined for different p contamination zones table 4 all the models were significant at the 5 confidence level due to the probability 0 05 in the quadratic models r2 values close to 1 were favourable and an acceptable modification of the model can be concluded with a high value of the r2 the ratio of the sum of squares due to regression ssr to the total sum of squares sst was indicated by the correlation coefficient r2 which presented the total variation in the response predicted by the model adequate precision compared the range of the predicted values at the design points to the mean prediction error the sufficient agreement between the values achieved from the model and the real data is illustrated clearly in fig 9 4 conclusions the phosphorus removal efficiency of our novel developed media allodust augmented sibar was carried out using a low to high range of p concentrated agricultural wastewater utilising wastewater containing higher than permissible discharge limits of p also allowed us to investigate the morphology and microstructural changes along with the adsorption capacity of the media when it s mixed with a very high p concentration the overarching aim of our research is to develop a low cost and sustainable adsorbent media material which can adsorb a high concentration of phosphorus at the lowest contact time and minimal energy consumption the p removal rate of 99 86 when the p concentration was up to 50 mg l 1 in 30 minutes by allodust2 50 and 85 13 for p concentration up to 300 mg l 1 p by h allodust5 82 in 450 minutes demonstrated the high capacity of the allodust to remove p from agriculturally sourced

13979,phosphates enter the surface waters from agricultural sources has been regarded as an important cause of eutrophication excess of phosphate concentration can cause severe health problems such as kidney damage and osteoporosis the adsorption is one of the most popular removal methods used for treating wastewaters containing agricultural nutrients the challenge is the time that phosphorous concentration is very high in agricultural related industries and is higher than the adsorption capacity of the system this research investigated the treatment of agricultural wastewater by developing and adding two novel media allodust allochar to a single batch aerobic reactor sibar allodust and allochar consisted of allophanic soil mineral material sourced from either a horotiu soil allophanic soil or a craigieburn soil allophanic brown soil central composite design ccd and response surface methodology rsm were hired to design the experiment and model the nature of the response surface of the novel media in the experimental design and to analyze the optimum operational conditions the sibar design was optimized for three ranges of p contamination 1 50 mg l 1 low range 51 175 mid range and 176 300 high range the allodust novel media demonstrated a higher p adsorption capacity compared to the allochar media and allophane compound itself the allodust adsorbent dosage of 3 g l 1 was the optimum being able to remove 100 of p up to 50 mg l 1 in 30 minutes with the lowest aeration rate 1 5 l min 1 and remove 76 of p up to 300 mg l 1 in 450 minutes with the highest aeration rate 7 5 l min 1 keywords agricultural wastewater phosphorous adsorption novel media aerobic reactor 1 introduction excessive application of different types of fertilizers in the agricultural industries oxidation of nitrogenous waste products in human and animal excreta including septic tanks lead to contamination of surface and groundwater and has become a critical global issue 1 changes in land use and excessive use of artificial fertilisers are the main factors for the significant increase of phosphorus levels in groundwater over the past 20 years 2 phosphates enter surface water bodies as a result of agricultural fertilizer run off as well as the wastes from the biological sources the wastes and effluents from the chemical processing industrial points are the other important source of the phosphate contamination of the water resources and waterways depending upon the type of contaminant and the other environmental factors such as ph and temperature orthophosphate can be a product following dissolution in surface water moreover one of the main factors which causes eutrophication is the presence of excessive phosphorus in the water treatment plants and also waterways kidney damage and osteoporosis 3 are the main outcomes of the phosphate presence in not acceptable concentrations in the water supply systems the rigorous limits have been set from the u s epa for total phosphorus concentration in water resources from the point of the waterways 0 1 mg l 1 for rivers and 0 05 mg l 1 for rivers draining into lakes has been indicated to prevent further eutrophication also anzecc trigger values for the total phosphorus is 0 026 mg l 1 for upland rivers and 0 033 mg l 1 for lowland rivers phosphorus is one of the macro elements essential for organism growth and biosynthesis processes furthermore the efficiency of the biogas production can be spiked by the presence of phosphorus in organic pollutant digestion process 4 5 organic carbon oc content has a linear correlation with biological phosphorus removal which is reported in recent studies 6 8 one of the recognized and sustainable phosphorus methods is the adsorption through natural media and minerals while p is a critical element in any biological water treatment due to its effect on microorganisms and algal growth rate as well as conducting the anions adsorption by the bridging mechanism the chemical or physical interaction between a substance and a solid surface which is a mass transfer in a liquid phase is known as adsorption 9 10 the adsorption as an electrostatic process is a promising approach in the field of wastewater management and wastewater process engineering 11 this technique can be hired along with other mechanisms and even biological process can be supported by an adsorption mechanism 12 the physical and chemical characteristic of the anions and adsorbent and their interaction is the main and considerable factor in the adsorption process the other anion characteristics which can be effective in the selective adsorption mechanism efficiency are the solubility ionic radius hydration energy and bulk diffusion coefficient emerging research indicates that allophanic soils may reduce phosphorous in wastewater 13 16 however more information is required to understand the mechanisms involved and to quantify the effects more accurately the horotiu series allophanic soils 17 and craigieburn soils typic allophanic brown soils 17 are the local new zealand allophanic soils the horotiu is formed under the specific environmental conditions which the short range order clay mineral allophane formed from weathering the volcanic glass within the soil material in north island craigieburn occurs where the feldspar bearing greywacke and schist parent materials in the south island high country have been highly weathered allophane mineral has a very high tendency to react with phosphate the other advantage of the presence of this mineral in a soil material is to help to advance the soil physical characteristics by enhancing the soil particles binding which makes a low density and permeable soil 18 bio sorption process has been hired widely to contamination removal from wastewater such as using low cost agricultural wastes and algae 19 21 the agro based materials became an alternative for chemical adsorbents during recent years 22 one of the most popular and easy access bio wastes is sawdust which has been used in different projects and researches 23 also biochar is the other bio waste product which can be obtained from the carbonization of biomass it can enhance the soil properties and has been used as a soil amendment in different projects 24 the membrane bioreactors mbrs tertiary membrane filtration and the reverse osmosis ro were used by strom 25 to remove the p from wastewater at low concentrations of 0 04 0 04 and 0 008 mg l 1 another popular technology is p precipitation by adding the salt e g trivalent metal salts ferric chloride to the effluent containing low p concentration in this technology the production of solids in addition to that already present is problematic and is dependent to the mass of chemical added the researchers 6 investigated different cost effective phosphorus removal processes in municipal wastewater treatment where the concentration was 4 12 mg l 1 this is low range compared to agricultural industry wastewater enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and chemical precipitation are the most used among the regular p removal technologies 26 it s noteworthy that the biological treatment requires a high amount of energy to provide the aeration for a long period of time 27 on the other hand inconsistency in achieving fixed phosphorus concentration in the effluent is a major problem of these systems 26 28 providing the chemicals and the post treatment segment makes an uneconomical system while these treatments led to a high sludge production 29 apart from membrane bioreactors mbrs on a full scale basis a few alternative p removal technologies have shown an acceptable performance such as ifas ebpr integrated fixed film activated sludge systems with enhanced biological phosphorus removal and deep bed granular media filters 6 30 over the last 10 15 years the mbrs have been used widely due to their reliability in effluent quality and consistency 31 however stress on sludge in external mbr membrane pollution and cost are the main drawbacks of this method ifas ebpr as the other method which is known as a hybrid technology provides an environment for the faster growing of the denitrifiers and phosphorus accumulating organisms paos 32 which make this method more efficient compare to the conventional biological processes however the large energy requirements unavailability of mechanical spare parts locally and high construction and operation cost are the main weakness of this technology recently application of media filters for p removal from the water and wastewater has been attracted a wide range of the researches 6 33 36 the high concentration of the phosphorus present in many agricultural industry effluents makes most of the phosphorus technologies non economic and not applicable in the terms of the handling the concentration so in recent years the researchers tried to introduce a natural sustainable stable and effective clay based media to adsorb phosphate from wastewaters our research reported here aims to examine the ability of a new inexpensive developed media to adsorb p efficiency under high concentration our study will also investigate the adsorption mechanism and microstructure analysis of media before and after phosphorus adsorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and analysis several wastewater samples were collected from the ballance agri nutrients fertiliser distribution yard rolleston canterbury for monitoring the wastewater characteristics the samples from the pump pond and the sump were collected in clean lab containers the pond samples collected from the centre and 35 cm depth from the surface and were immediately stored in a fridge at 4 c to prevent any changes in the sample properties due to the biological reactions 37 the ph temperature c electrical conductivity ms cm salinity g l 1 and tss were determined on site at the time of sampling all the quality analysis was conducted in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 37 the water characteristics are presented in table 1 the phosphorus concentration was fixed in different batches by spiking k2po4 in different concentration zones from 50 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 2 2 allodust allochar preparation allophanic clay material from a craigieburn bw horizon typic allophanic brown soil and horotiu bw horizon allophanic soil 17 were collected from the lake coleridge area south island new zealand and ruakura agricultural centre north island respectively both the craigieburn and horotiu soils were sampled in the b horizon which has the maximum accumulation of allophanic minerals for these soils the soil samples had been air dried before using as an adsorbent and had been passed through a 2 mm sieve and then stored in dry and cool conditions 38 the sawdust of the pine tree source was collected from srs ltd in christchurch rolleston new zealand the sawdust was oven dried at 70 c after washed with ro and then deionized water a couple of times to a constant weight to obtain a fine powder a coffee grinder was used to make sawdust particles in 100 150 Î¼m size 39 in order to remove undesirable substances a solution of 0 5 m hcl was used at room temperature for 6 h 40 the adsorbent was kept under airtight conditions until used in the experiments the ph of both treated and untreated sawdust was determined a ratio of 1 10 sawdust water w v solution was prepared for measuring the ph using 5 g of raw sawdust with 50 ml deionized water after the indication of the sawdust ph in 1 10 solid water ratio the sawdust placed in a separate glass and to adjust the sawdust ph in different ranges 0 1 m hcl solution was used as the agent for the acid treatment specific amounts of 0 1 m hcl was added to the different glass beakers contained the sawdust and di water with the ph meter prob located in the beaker the addition of hcl drops continued while ph stabilised at the same ph value then the beakers were kept overnight in a room temperature environment and the ph measured 24 hrs after the ph adjustment the ph treatment process stopped after observation of a fixed number in two consecutive days the acidic treated sawdust was then dried in a 70 oven and was stored in a desiccator until used in the experiments 41 the same stock of the collected sawdust was used for the pine biochar production the particles less than 1 mm dried and was pyrolyzed at 550 c temperature a steel container covered with aluminium foil was used as the sawdust container in the muffle furnace a thermocouple was the apparatus for controlling the consistency of the temperature 550 c 8 c min for 3 h during the process a series of innovative materials were prepared fresh allochar allophane soil biochar and allodust allophane sawdust were prepared according to the different proportions of the allophanic soils biochar and ph adjusted sawdust powdered craigieburn allophane pca powdered volcanic allophane pva developed from the horotiu soil powdered ph adjusted pine sawdust pps and powdered pine biochar ppb were utilized as media in the treatment system 75 Î¼m particle size 150 Î¼m a similar size range has used in recent studies 42 43 the mix design was prepared according to previous findings 10 44 allophanic soil materials sawdust biochar silica powder and portland cement were mixed together the white cement was used as the binder agent as it had a lower fe content the mix design and cost estimation of allochar and allodust are shown in table 2 based on this information the estimated cost of allodust and allochar per ton are around nz 700 the mixture was moulded using the ratio of the 0 45 water after 1 day the mixed media was placed to the water and cured for 3 days the it was removed from the water and dried in room temperature for two days then prepared media was subjected to xrd ftir sem and testing in accordance with 37 2 3 bioreactor design couple bottom aeration cba ten separate units of single batch aerobic reactor sibar were used for the experiment the sibar s consists of a transparent column made of plexiglas for easier process controlling upvc was used for the base and cap parts of the reactors in order to enhance the mixing efficiency of the air and water cba couple bottom aeration method was used the total volume of the reactors was 2000 ml with 1500 ml working volume all ten reactors were run under the same environmental conditions and at the same time two air pumps were used for the aeration of the system all the running details of the reactors were programmed into a data logger campbell scientific cr850 to applying different aeration rates to the reactors an airflow meter was used to adjusting the airflow rate entering the system this sibar allows both mixing and aeration processes this experimental design was selected to allow for easy applicability and for simultaneous operation different operational variables were considered to design an optimum treatment system the sawdust ph 2 4 and 6 aeration rate 0 5 4 and 7 5 l min 1 contact time 30 240 and 450 min and adsorbent dosage 3 5 7 g l 1 in different phosphorous concentrations 50 175 and 300 mg l 1 introduced to the system as the variables to analysis the phosphorous removal process four dependent parameters p removal percentage chemical oxygen demand cod electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured as the design responses in all the reactor runs the timing of fill and mix 20 min draw and idle 10 min and settle 90 min were set as a constant value for all the reactors 43 45 46 2 4 experimental design rsm ccd in this research central composite design ccd and the response surface methodology rsm method from doe software stat ease used mathematical and statistical techniques to model and analyse the responses of the materials to the experimental conditions the design consists of k2 factorial points completed by 2k axial points and a centre point where k is the number of variables thereupon the ccd and rsm methods were run in order to evaluate the association between the variables i e ph of the sawdust aeration rate and contact time and their responses which were p removal cod also the do ec and ph were recorded for each reactor thus the objective of this design was to optimize the appropriate situation of operating variables to predict the best value of responses which was the removal of p contamination this is summarised in equation 1 1 y Î² 0 Îµ i 1 k Î² i x i i 1 k Î² i i x 2 i i j k j k Î² i j x i x j e where y is the response xi and xj are the variables Î²0 is a constant coefficient Î²j Î²jj and Î²ij are the interaction coefficients of linear quadratic and second order terms respectively k is the number of studied factors and e is the error 3 results and discussions for batch shaking experiment the optimum allodust and allochar dosage and mixed design for a range of time scales were determined for batch optimisation the optimum aeration rate l min 1 contact time min and sawdust ph were determined the experiment was conducted in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and shaken at different contact times after the shaking was finished the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm speed the supernatants were analysed by the smartchem 200 discrete analyser 47 method the removal efficiencies of allodust sawdust ph 2 are presented in table 3 and fig 1 fig 1 illustrates the suitability of the system under different conditions the desirability of p removal in the highest system proficiency highest p removal lowest contact time is 1 while the adsorbent dosage is minimum also it can be concluded that the highest p removal occurred when the system contained the minimum adsorbent dosage 3 1 phosphorous removal analysis in total 8 kinds of media consisting of a novel innovative materials were developed in order to investigate the effect of the allophanic soil material sawdust ph of sawdust and the biochar on the phosphorous removal from wastewater in a cba reactor the central composite design ccd method was utilised to design the experiments for each media with 4 variables and 4 responses the data were analysed with the response surface methodology rsm software in order to monitor the effect of the variable changes in the responses finally anova was run for each experiment to determine the best operating details of the system and to choose the best media for removing p from the wastewater in the bioreactors table 4 shows the allodust comprising horotiu soil material removed p under optimum conditions the different contamination zones in total 90 reactors for h allodust 90 for the c allodust 20 for the h allochar and 20 for the c allochar total of 220 16 control samples reactors were run to find the optimum media for the p removal under the optimal operating conditions of the reactors being lowest contact time and lowest aeration rate also in order to record the effect of each part of the media in p removal two control samples were run for each optimum condition 3 2 phosphorous removal by h allodust it was realized that the phosphorous removal of h allodust was significantly affected by all four system variables moreover central composite design was used to determine the interactive effects of the variables the corresponding results are shown in table 5 utilising the three dimensional response surface curves and contours the optimum values of the variables for p removal from the wastewater were determined fig 2 display the response surface and contours of the p removal rate as a function of p concentration and contact time as independent variables while the sawdust ph and aeration rate are considered as the actual factors for the low range p concentration to the high range p concentration the response surface of the p removal rate gradually decreased when the contact time and the p concentration increased from 30 to 450 min and 50 to 300 mg l 1 respectively when the system contained up to 50 mg l 1 phosphorous fig 2a illustrates the highest p removal with 99 86 when the p concentration was 50 mg l 1 and the contact time was 30 minutes when the adsorbent is mixed with 50 mg l 1 to 300 mg l 1 p fig 2b and fig 2c the system needs to be run with the highest contact time and the aeration rate for optimum operating conditions the p removal was 79 12 for the mid range zone by h allodust ph 4 21 and 85 13 for the high range zone by h allodust ph 5 82 in 450 minutes the adsorption amount for the blank horotiu soil was just 52 and 41 in the mid range and high range p concentration while it could adsorb the 100 of the p in the low range reactors kaolinite and goethite which are often cemented together in the binary association used as a mixture gkm and also association gka to enhance the soil phosphate adsorption capacity 48 both goethite and kaolinite minerals are ph dependent and the adsorption capacity is highly dependent on the surface properties of the adsorbents montmorillonite s surface area and pore volumes enhanced by the zr4 and zr4 al3 treatment zr4 al3 showed a more significant performance to adsorb phosphate by 17 2 mg p g in an acidic condition the inorganic bentonite modification was conducted by fe and al the interlayer spacing and pore volumes were increased significantly 4 g l 1 of the al bentonite at ph 3 could adsorb up to 60mg l 1 phosphate in 6 hrs 49 phoslock lanthanum la modified bentonite has been recognized as one of the most powerful media s to adsorb phosphate in an aqueous solution 50 56 the acidic condition was reported as a favour for phoslock adsorption behaviour haghseresht et al 51 showed a 30 drop in adsorption capacity when the ph increased to 9 0 from 5 0 it was reported that phoslock can t control the srp concentration higher than 0 047 mg p l and the reason is interactions between la and humic acids 52 57 even in the ratio of 220 1 phoslock p also ph dependency of the phoslock is not following a routine and is reversible h allodust could remove a significant amount of the p from wastewater in a wide range of non acidic ph table 5 and short contact time also the optimum adsorbent dosage to remove up to 300 mg l 1 of the phosphorous was just 3 g l 1 3 3 adsorption mechanisms 3 3 1 allophane adsorption mechanism different soil properties are known as the main factors for phosphorus adsorption ph 58 extractable al and fe 59 organic c 58 and clay content 60 it has been reported that the allophanic soils are adsorbing the phosphate anion 33 nano ball allophane minerals are the adsorption agents 61 62 because of the al oh and al h2o functional groups present on the surface of allophane minerals 63 allophanic soils have more potential to adsorb the phosphate anions compared to the other clay minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite with very high ssa and cec in the structure of allophane the aluminol groups are only located at the pores of the wall of the hollow spherules 64 storing the organic carbon and phosphate adsorption are the main characteristics of the allophane spherules the surface complexation specific adsorption and proton transfer reactions of m and ligands are the processes which cause the surface charge of the iron hydroxides 65 this surface property is one of the considerable factors in the reaction of the anions and mineral surfaces during the adsorption mechanism the anionic adsorption governs by the ligand exchange mechanism which the water dipoles desorption is one of the main consequences 66 67 the exchange of the surface hydroxyl groups with the ligands there is always a competition between ligands and oh for the occupation of the binding sites is the main process for the formation of the surface complex which its extension completely depends on the solution ph 68 69 the inner sphere complexes which are known as the solute complexes and also surface complexes are formed during the adsorption of the anions by the minerals the physical chemical characteristics of anions such as ionic radius bulk diffusion coefficient hydration energy and solubility and how they interact with the different adsorbent surfaces determine the adsorption selective mechanism of a system the other effective factor on the adsorption efficiency is the anions immobilization onto the adsorbent which is completely dependent on the pore sizes of the adsorbent so the anions hydrated dimensions and the adsorbent pore sizes are the factors which need to be considered in an adsorption system the selective anionic adsorption is the outcome of this impediment also the anions and adsorbent surface form inner outer sphere complexes and electrostatic or hydrogen bonding totally the selective anionic adsorption does not completely follow the radius properties and charge the sulfate behaviour is an example which can form the complexes on al and fe oxides and hydroxide with different charges while it compared to the fluoride it has a greater radius 70 the investigation of the anions behaviour close to the depletion region limited by the hydrated anion radius this region is different in size for each mineral and adsorbent 71 the translocation of the water molecules present in the hydrated anion with m is weak and completely ephemeral the long range electrostatic forces are the only attraction force between the adsorbent surface and hydrated anions with a large hydrated radius such as phosphate the covalent bond is associated between the anions with smaller hydrated radius which can form the inner sphere complexes 72 the anions interaction with mineral surfaces which results in the adsorption is completely affected by iron oxide and hydroxide and its surface charge the surface complexation of ligands and m and proton transfer are the processes which appoint this charge 65 the water dipoles desorption happens during the anionic adsorption which is controlled by the exchange of ligands 66 67 3 3 2 sawdust adsorption mechanism the sawdust principal adsorption mechanisms are known as the hydrogen bonding and ion exchange the sawdust complex characteristics and the adsorption behaviour of the components when facing the ions are the factors which support this idea the active ion exchange sawdust compounds are mainly the hydroxyl groups from the cell walls as well as the lignin and cellulose the polymeric material sawdust modification can enhance the adsorption properties of sawdust other researches have successfully modified sawdust to enhance the binding ability 34 73 resulting in introduction and adjustment of more n s and p containing group which are extractive groups to the sawdust these groups have electron donating behaviour while the phosphate is behaving as an electron acceptor based on these concepts the ion exchange mechanism could be considered as the main adsorption process in a system containing sawdust the p ions present in the wastewater can be adsorbed by a solid media through the surface complexes formation between the p and the adsorbed ligands while the sawdust treatment can add more active sites on the surface the physical adsorption mechanism by functional groups is the other considerable contaminant retention behaviour by sawdust the surface activation and pores development were conducted by acidic treatment of the sawdust one of the most effective factors on the sawdust adsorption capacity is the dosage using in the treatment system based on the type of the contaminant and its concentration mostly the lower adsorbent dosage is preferable in this case all the surface sites are available and exposed for retention of contaminants and the surface saturation happen faster which result in system s adsorption capacity enhancement on the other hand higher energy sites become unavailable when using high adsorbent dosage as a consequence most of the lower energy sites become occupied which drop the total adsorption capacity of the system fig 3 3 4 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis the ftir results are presented in fig 4 the presence of the allophane mineral in the media can be concluded from the band in 1028 and 816 cm 1 which belongs to strong si o si Î½a and also the 524 and 480 cm 1 si o al which is an out of plane bending 74 77 the bands at 1485 cm 1 can represent the o3 si oh and 688 cm 1 the presence of the h2o the weak bands belong to the oh Î½s happen at more than 3600 cm 1 two bands of 688 and 500 cm 1 represent the allophane and opaline silica with a disordered structure while the 688 cm 1 band belongs only to the adobes an increase at 1156 cm 1 and 1052 cm 1 bonds can be seen which the reason is the lignin structure a strong aromatic ring stretch phenylpropanoid polymer deformation methyl and methyl and methylene glycosidic linkage and vibrational stretching are indicative of a number of methylene glycosidic linkage and vibrational stretching are indicative of a number of bonds which are present in the lignin 78 following p adsorption fig 4 illustrates that the binding energy belongs to the oh groups si oh al oh dropped because of the hydrogen bond formation between the p ions and the adsorbent 79 80 also the bonding between p ions and oxygen in hydroxyl groups resulting in the wavelength decrease of the hydroxyl groups which make the oh binding energy weaker so due to the different binding changes and shift the interaction of the p ions with allophane and sawdust structure can be seen from the ftir analysis 3 5 x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis the changing in the microstructure of clay minerals is one of the consequences of the interaction between contaminants and clay soil which impact the clay particle forces one of the microstructural experiments which analysis the soil structure changes is xrd fig 5 presents the result of the x ray diffraction of the horotiu soil material and h allodust in different sawdust ph before and after the interaction with phosphorous according to the presented data the intensity of the main peaks dropped while p presented in the structure of the media in high concentration while the high concentration of phosphate adsorbed by the allodust the p ions concentration increased in the pore fluid and led the change in the structure which made it flocculated that change didn t happen in the low range of phosphate concentration which adsorbed on the surface by the reactive sites and was significantly lower than the adsorption capacity of the media the peak intensity of the flocculated soils is lower than the dispersive ones the presence of sawdust improved the peak intensity of the media in the presence of 300 mg l 1 phosphorous so the results of the smartchem p analysis agree with the xrd diffraction results it must be noticed that the peak position is not affected by increasing the p concentration of the pore fluid but just affects the peak intensity 3 6 chemical oxygen demand cod analysis non biodegradable organic matters nbom are controlling the cod amount of effluent during the treatment process it s essential to decrease the amount of nboms in order to control the cod concentration to meet the guidelines 81 soil minerals make several complexes with different properties when facing organic compounds during a process and inorganic cations water silicate layers and organic molecules are all effective factors recently different studies have been conducted concerning the sawdust application to remove different contamination from wastewater in a wastewater treatment process the main factors affecting the cod concentration in the effluent are the microorganism aquatic plants and wood based materials so it s essential to report the cod concentration and its changes during the process while using a bio waste as a media in the removal process 41 so the main objective of this part of the experiment was to quantify the effect of sawdust on the cod in the solution with different p concentrations and the other operational variables such as contact time and aeration rate table 6 the cod samples were prepared using cod digestion vials high range and employing the reactor digestion method from hach new zealand analysed by the hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer fig 6 illustrates the trend of cod amounts for the different optimized conditions the main objective of this experiment was to monitor the cod content and the changing trend of the optimized samples for each contamination range from low to high after the p adsorption the maximum cod amount occurred with the h allodust ph 2 with 51 mg l 1 when mixed with the mid range 175 mg l 1 p contamination and run with 4 5 l min 1 aeration rate for 240 min this result is in parallel with the p adsorption optimization while the h allodust2 showed the highest removal efficiency for the low range of p the cod amount of the same media was only 29 mg l 1 for the low range p concentration 50 mg l 1 when running with 1 5 l min 1 aeration rate for only 30 min so the optimized operational conditions also contained the lowest cod after p adsorption the mid range optimized media sdph 4 21 and aeration rate 7 49 at the highest contact time 450 min contained between 35 mg l 1 to 40 mg l 1 cod which was not the lowest but a good range when mixed with the 175 mg l 1 phosphorous the cod amount for the high range p concentration was only between 14 mg l 1 to 18 mg l 1 when the system was run at its optimized condition for this range of p the cod could increase up to 45 mg l 1 with the other operational conditions remaining constant in this contamination range from these results it can be stated that under acidic conditions of the media both horotiu and sawdust functional groups obtained a positive charge on the surface while the charge became negative under the alkali condition so the adsorption efficiency of the organic matter which has a negative charge is high under acidic situations conversely for the acidic treatment of sawdust hcl was used to increase the proportion of active surfaces and to prevent the elution of tannin compounds that would stain the treated water and that would greatly increase cod however in parallel with increasing the p concentration from 50 mg l 1 to 175 mg l 1 the cod amount incurred as an incremental leap but with increasing the anion concentration to 300 mg l 1 the cod amount decreased so the acidic treatment and protonation of the sawdust surface could be known as a method to control the cod concentration of the effluent 3 7 scanning electron microscope sem the sem was employed to examine the morphology of the soil and developed media before and after the reaction with phosphorus the soil and optimum developed media samples were coated with carbon by ems 150 t es at 62a and 80 mm distance with three pulses 3 seconds pulse the morphology study was operated by sem jeol jsm 7000 f at 5kv and wd6mm for imaging and wd10 mm for eds the results of the morphological study are illustrated in figs 7 8 the binding materials between the soil and media particles couldn t resolve using the usual magnification the sem images of the horotiu and h allodust showed the silty structure as a dominant one in horotiu also allophane particles which were the suspect for the gel like material observed three gravity sedimentation process was conducted and then the deposited materials used for the morphology study fig 7 the clay size particles are still merged into each other and the increased resolution shows that the binder is formed of globular agglomerates of spherical particles with outer diameters of approximately 5 nm which corresponds to the morphology and dimensions of allophane particles 74 75 82 84 these aggregates were observed on both horotiu soil and h allodust media before and after the p adsorption the purpose of the sawdust acidic treatment was to increase the surface activity the surface was activated resulting in well developed pores and covered by the allophane nanoparticles fig 8a the acidic treatment was effective in achieving and activated surface of the raw sawdust the developed pores and channels on the sawdust particles are due to the elimination of filaments sem images of the media after the p adsorption h allodust 50 mg l 1 p demonstrates that the flocculated particles and filled pores can be seen while the allophanic particles are still present on the surface which is parallel with the adsorption results fig 8b the h allodust adsorbed almost all the p in the solution and still had the capacity to adsorb more p from the wastewater in addition the eds graphs demonstrate the presence of the p on the media surface fig 8b 3 8 optimization and statistical analysis the correlation between the variables sawdust ph contact time min aeration rate l min 1 and p concentration mg l 1 and the two important process responses p removal and cod mg l 1 was analyzed by response surface methodology rsm several model terms were preferred to achieve the best fit in a particular model the development of mathematical equations where predicted results y were evaluated as a function of the sawdust ph x1 contact time x2 aeration rate x3 and p concentration x4 was permitted by central composite design ccd the sum of a constant four first order effects terms in x1 x2 x3 and x4 six interaction effect x1x2 x1x3 x1x4 x2x3 x2x4 x3x4 and four second order effects x1 2 x2 2 x3 2 x4 2 were the factors which the calculation conducted based on them as shown in equation 1 and table 3 based on the parameter estimation the following quadratic polynomial equation 2 is given to correlate the relationship between the four factors and the p removal rate 2 p removal 152 42941 3 65946x1 0 053889x2 13 39301x3 0 499988x4 0 005881x1x2 0 954583 x1x3 0 042907 x1x4 0 000652x2x3 0 000137 x2x4 0 008308x3x4 1

the model can be considered significant based on the model f value of 20 79 the chance of the occurrence of this f value due to the noise is only 0 01 also it can be concluded that the model terms are significantly based on the p values less than 0 0500 in this case the significant model terms represent as a c d ac ad cÂ² values greater than 0 1000 indicate the model terms are not significant also the lack of fit f value of 78 72 implies the lack of fit is significant the chance of the occurrence of this lack of fit to the noise is only 0 01 table 7 and table 8 the predicted rÂ² of 0 7157 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted rÂ² of 0 9053 i e the difference is less than 0 2 adeq precision measures the signal to noise ratio a ratio greater than 4 is desirable the model ratio of 13 373 indicates an adequate signal and this model can be used to navigate the design space the optimum conditions for the h allodust were determined for different p contamination zones table 4 all the models were significant at the 5 confidence level due to the probability 0 05 in the quadratic models r2 values close to 1 were favourable and an acceptable modification of the model can be concluded with a high value of the r2 the ratio of the sum of squares due to regression ssr to the total sum of squares sst was indicated by the correlation coefficient r2 which presented the total variation in the response predicted by the model adequate precision compared the range of the predicted values at the design points to the mean prediction error the sufficient agreement between the values achieved from the model and the real data is illustrated clearly in fig 9 4 conclusions the phosphorus removal efficiency of our novel developed media allodust augmented sibar was carried out using a low to high range of p concentrated agricultural wastewater utilising wastewater containing higher than permissible discharge limits of p also allowed us to investigate the morphology and microstructural changes along with the adsorption capacity of the media when it s mixed with a very high p concentration the overarching aim of our research is to develop a low cost and sustainable adsorbent media material which can adsorb a high concentration of phosphorus at the lowest contact time and minimal energy consumption the p removal rate of 99 86 when the p concentration was up to 50 mg l 1 in 30 minutes by allodust2 50 and 85 13 for p concentration up to 300 mg l 1 p by h allodust5 82 in 450 minutes demonstrated the high capacity of the allodust to remove p from agriculturally sourced
