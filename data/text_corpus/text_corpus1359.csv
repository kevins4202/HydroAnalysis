6795,artificial recharge is an effective way to minimize dewatering induced ground settlements in deep excavation to ensure the success of a long term recharge it is necessary to redevelop recharge wells i e pumping periodically to prevent well clogging field measurements show that ground settlements will occur during the well redevelopment this paper proposed a method referred to as the combined recharge to eliminate settlement during well redevelopment in the proposed method a row of recharge wells ar well is added at the side of the traditional recharge wells pr wells to compensate water loss due to pr well redevelopment two field tests with and without use of combined recharge are conducted to investigate the ground response to recharge and redevelopment test results show that building settlements will increase progressively during redevelopment for case without combined recharge however there are no significant surface settlements during redevelopment for the case with combined recharge keywords deep excavation artificial recharge confined aquifer recharge test ground settlement leakage effect 1 introduction in recent years underground space in big cities was developed rapidly for infrastructures in mass transport or disaster prevention lyu et al 2018 pujades et al 2014a xu et al 2018 most of these underground space constructions was conducted with deep excavations and the depth of excavation increases fast tan and lu 2017 wu et al 2015b this causes the foundation pit to be usually threatened by the high piezometric heads in confined aquifers pujades et al 2017 shen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 if the groundwater in a confined aquifer cannot be reasonably controlled during excavation large deformations and hydraulic heave will occur pujades et al 2014b shen et al 2013 typically dewatering in the confined aquifer is adopted to lower the groundwater head inside the excavation and meanwhile sealing curtains are employed to block groundwater seepage from beyond the excavation to relieve the dewatering induced environment deformations wu et al 2015a xu et al 2014 zeng et al 2017a b c 2018b zhang et al 2018b however if the sealing curtain cannot totally cut off the confined aquifer zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 or there are some defects in sealing curtain pujades et al 2012 2016 dewatering will inevitably cause a decrease of the groundwater head outside the excavation and further induce surrounding environment deformations forth 2004 roy and robinson 2009 zheng et al 2013 2014a to minimize the dewatering induced adverse impacts artificial recharge is usually adopted which can compensate the drawdown by injecting the water into the aquifer phien wej et al 1998 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 however an inherent problem in artificial recharge is well plugging which reduces recharge flow rate and even invalidates the recharge wells pavelic et al 2007 phien wej et al 1998 pyne 1995 taneja and khepar 1996 the plugging may be due to suspended particles in the recharge water bichara 1986 biological growth around the well screen vecchioli 1970 and some other reasons powers 2007 to address the plugging of recharge wells periodic redevelopment of the recharge wells is required to remove the plugging constituents phien wej et al 1998 powers 2007 the wells are typically redeveloped by over pumping through a submersible pump installed within the well in advance the period of over pumping typically ranges from several hours to several days every couple of days powers 2007 pyne 1995 over pumping can induce groundwater drawdown which may turn the recharge cone created by recharge into a depression cone as shown in fig 1 the ground settlement may then occur in fact many researchers ni et al 2011 phien wej et al 1998 zheng et al 2014a have proved that the pumping induced drawdown and settlement in confined aquifer can reach most of their stable value within a short time e g several hours which means redevelopment may induce detectable ground settlement in addition shen et al 2013 pointed out that soil settlements induced by pumping recovery process in aquifer could show a delayed behavior and the reason may be the lagging consolidation of overburdened aquitards this indicates that the redevelopment induced settlement may continue to increase even after ceasing hence it may need to take additional measures to eliminate the drawdown and soil settlement induced by redevelopment of recharge wells the current relevant research about the use of recharge for settlement control in deep excavation are mainly focused on its effectiveness and applicability some researchers powrie and roberts 1995 wang et al 2012 conducted recharge tests to investigate the groundwater response to recharge recovery process other researchers zhang and goh 2016 zhang et al 2018a 2017 zheng et al 2018 carried out recharge pumping tests and numerical simulations to study the soil behaviors during the couple actions of pumping and recharge however these studies primarily considered the effect of recharge on controlling the groundwater drawdown and soil settlements and did not investigate the redevelopment induced ground settlement in fact very few studies can be found in literature to report the ground response to the redevelopment of recharge wells if the redevelopment induced ground settlement cannot be ignored how to effectively control or eliminate this deformation is still unclear the objective of this paper is to propose a method called combined recharge which is used to prevent redevelopment induced ground settlement two field tests with and without consideration of the effect of combined recharge are conducted to investigate the ground response to recharge and redevelopment of recharge wells the test results are analyzed and compared with analytical solutions on this basis a series of optimized design schemes are proposed for reference to designers to help them better use recharge to avoid durative ground settlements in practical recharge project 2 working principle of combined recharge fig 1 c illustrates the working principle of combined recharge unlike the traditional single row well arrangement recharge wells in the proposed method are arranged in two rows with a row of primary recharge pr wells and a row of auxiliary recharge ar wells ar well is set up between pr well and the protected area the function of pr well is as same as the traditional recharge well which is used to compensate the dewatering induced drawdown by injecting water into the aquifer while ar well is only used to recharge during the redevelopment of pr well in order to prevent redevelopment induced groundwater drawdown and consequent environment settlement in the practice of combined recharge ar well can be opened earlier e g several hours before the redevelopment of pr well in this condition a small recharge cone will be formed around the two wells as shown in blue dashed line in fig 1 c during redevelopment of pr well the groundwater level adjacent to pr well will decline while the groundwater level under the protected area will remain unchanged or just have a smaller drawdown if the recharge of ar well is operated with an appropriate flow rate on this occasion the protected area will not develop or just experience slight settlement 3 field tests background introduction 3 1 test 1 traditional recharge test in a deep excavation 3 1 1 project description and soil conditions fig 2 presents the plan view of a deep excavation and instrumentation layout for the recharge test the final excavation depth was approximately 21 m below the ground surface bgs a three story religious building resting on a pile foundation with the pile length of 11 m existed at a distance of 15 m on the east side of the excavation a row of bored piles with the layout of φ1500 1700 1500 mm in diameter and 1700 mm in center to center spacing and the length of 37 9 m were applied as retaining structure around the excavation a row of φ850 600 soil cement mixed piles was set up behind the retaining structures as sealing curtains five rows of φ850 600 soil cement mixed piles were used to strengthen the soils between the excavation and the building and meanwhile a row of φ800 1000 bored piles were adopted to isolate the building aiming to minimize the excavation induced building deformation according to the geotechnical investigation report the deposit at the site is the typical soft deposit in tianjin shen et al 2015b wu et al 2018 it mainly consists of saturated silts silty clays and silty sands in the upper 60 0 m bgs fig 3 shows the typical geological section and properties at the project site there are one phreatic aquifer labelled as aq0 and two confined aquifers labelled as aqi and aqii respectively within the depth of 60 0 m bgs the aquifers are separated by aquitards the long term phreatic water level was observed at depths of around 2 2 m bgs the hydrostatic equilibrium for the two confined aquifers were reached around 4 8 and 5 3 m bgs respectively from the upper to the lower layers 3 1 2 arrangement of the recharge wells and observation instruments since the final excavation depth i e 21 m bgs was close to the top of aqi the dewatering wells were designed with 28 0 31 5 m deep and set up inside the excavation to ensure that the groundwater level in aqi can be lowered below the final excavation depth during excavation the in situ pumping tests indicate that close hydraulic connection exists between aqi and aqii it was expected that the dewatering during excavation would cause groundwater drawdown in aqi and aqii outside the excavation and further induce settlement of adjacent religious building due to the sealing curtains not totally blocking aqii to avoid the religious building settlement artificial recharge was proposed for the project figs 2 and 4 present the recharge wells layout and the structure of the wells adopted in the test five recharge wells labeled as h1 h3 h4 h7 and h11 were arranged around the religious building the screens of these wells were all located in aqi and aqii to monitor the groundwater level in aqi and aqii around the religious building three observation wells labeled as a3 a4 and a11 were employed between the excavation and religious building in addition fourteen settlement monitoring points labeled as jz1 jz14 were mounted on the religious building the building settlements were surveyed by levelling instruments serrano juan et al 2017 3 1 3 recharge test procedure and periodic redevelopment tables 1 and 2 show the main stages of soil excavation and the recharge test respectively the soil excavation started from oct 26th 2012 staged dewatering and staged excavation were adopted during stage e5 the groundwater levels in aqi and aqii outside the excavation were found to decline rapidly and the rate of religious building settlement increased these results will be described in detail in section 4 1 1 and can be seen in figs 10 and 11 this is because the dewatering with depth of 27 m bgs inside excavation was in progress during stage e5 considering that a wide range of dewatering would proceed until the base slab was cured the groundwater levels in aqi and aqii outside the excavation was believed to decline continuously which would have adverse effect on religious building to avoid the above hazard the artificial recharge lasting 197 days had been carried out since mar 25th 2013 fig 5 presents the observed real time recharge flow rate q r during the whole recharge process q r could reach 1 3 m3 h i e 24 72 m3 d and was roughly stable during recharge which indicates that the 197 days recharge run well the periodic redevelopment of the recharge wells is critical to the success of long term recharge in this project five recharge wells were redeveloped by pumping in turns in the order of h1 h7 h11 h4 h3 with the time interval between each other of about 1 day each time of the redevelopment lasted 2 h this process was repeated until the end of the recharge fig 6 presents the time interval of redevelopment for each recharge well in most conditions in this project the time interval was 3 4 days which is a little longer compared to 1 day of redevelopment interval reported by pyne 1995 the reason is that in this project the recharged aquifers are mainly composed of silts and silty sands whose soil particles are larger than those of clayey sands reported in pyne 1995 the possibility of recharge wells plugging in this project is relatively small and the redevelopment interval can be longer but it is still necessary to make recharge wells redeveloped in a large number of times in order to ensure the success of a long term recharge fig 7 presents the relationship between the accumulated redevelopment duration t and the recharge duration t for each recharge well t increases linearly with t in this case and the ratio of t to t averages about 0 026 3 2 test 2 combined recharge test in a greenfield land 3 2 1 field condition this test site was approximately 6 km away from the place of test 1 as can be seen in fig 3 the soil conditions in the two test sites are extremely similar only the thickness of the soil layers have some difference in this test site the third confined aquifer labelled as aqiii is located at the depth from 57 m bgs to 67 m bgs the aquitard above aqiii is only 2 m thick in situ pumping tests show that there is a strong hydraulic connection between aqii and aqiii while that among aq0 aqi and aqii is not apparent the long term phreatic water level was observed at depths of 2 0 m bgs the hydrostatic equilibrium for aqi aqii and aqiii were reached at 5 5 6 8 and 6 9 m bgs respectively 3 2 2 arrangement of test wells and monitoring points fig 8 presents the plan view of the test wells and monitoring points a pumping well c1 was used to simulate the redevelopment of pr well and a recharge well h1 was employed to simulate the recharge process of ar well during the redevelopment of pr well the screens of c1 and h1 were both located in aqii see fig 4 to monitor the groundwater level in aqii around c1 and h1 during combined recharge test six observation wells labeled as g1 g6 were adopted in the surrounding area in addition twenty ground surface settlement points labeled as d1 d20 were installed on the site 3 2 3 test procedure since the objective of this test was to investigate the effect of combined recharge and was not to carry out a long term recharge only one time of redevelopment was simulated in the test table 3 presents the test procedures which are as follows step 1 the ar well i e h1 used to recharge was opened in advance aiming to form an initial but small recharge cone around the two wells when the groundwater level was observed to be in a stable state the step 2 can be started step 2 let pr well i e c1 used to simulate redevelopment discharge groundwater and meanwhile the recharge of h1 was still proceeding this step was to simulate the redevelopment process under the proposed combined recharge method step 3 after the groundwater level reached steady state shut down the two wells and let the groundwater level be recovered 3 2 4 recharge flow rate and discharge flow rate fig 9 shows the real time recharge flow rate q r and discharge flow rate q d during the test it was planned to achieve q r q d 1 m3 h during the test however in fact it was not easy to control the water inflow because the water supply for recharge from city mains sometimes fluctuated and thus the results of q r and q d also show some degree of fluctuation but fortunately q r q d was roughly realized during the test 4 field tests results and analyses 4 1 results of test 1 4 1 1 groundwater level change and building settlements figs 10 and 11 present the time history curves of surrounding groundwater level change in aqi and aqii and the religious building settlements respectively every stage of soil excavation i e e1 e7 and recharge i e r1 r6 introduced in tables 1 and 2 are shown in figs 10 and 11 before the recharge test the water level decline and the building settlements were observed to occur mainly in two phases one is during e1 and e2 and the other is during e4 and e5 as described in table 1 these two phases are corresponding to the dewatering stages with the pump depth changed from 0 m to 22 m and from 22 m to 27 m respectively since the sealing curtains did not totally block aqii and meanwhile the in situ pumping tests indicate that close hydraulic connection exists between aqi and aqii dewatering conducted inside the excavation would induce the surrounding groundwater drawdown and environment settlement in addition it can be found that the building presented durative settlements from e1 to about the half of e4 but the water level decline reached a relatively stable state at the middle of e2 this indicates that the building settlement show a delayed behavior and the reason may be the lagging consolidation of aquitards below and above the aquifer pujades et al 2017 shen et al 2013 progressive increase of shear stress in soil layers with the depression cone enlarged budhu and adiyaman 2010 shen et al 2013 and the soil creep occurred in a high shear stress level nawir et al 2003 as soon as the recharge was launched the surrounding groundwater level was greatly raised and the building settlement was effectively restricted which can be seen in r1 note h1 h4 h7 and h11 were running during r1 but unfortunately the water yield inside excavation was found to increase obviously and the intermittent rise of water level was observed inside excavation during r1 the engineers had to temporarily shut down the recharge wells which were close to the excavation i e h1 and h4 letting only h7 and h11 be running i e stage r2 maybe because h1 and h4 were closed immediately and rapidly surrounding water level experienced a sharp drop which led to a fast growth of building settlement especially in the side close to the excavation i e left side of the building in this condition the engineers reopened h1 and h4 making the building settlement slow down see r3 afterwards h3 was also opened aiming to help raise surrounding groundwater level to reach its initial value see r4 r6 in these stages water level rose continuously while the building was not uplifted only showing a state of no apparent settlement the moment the recharge was stopped the water level dropped sharply and durative building settlement occurred once again that may be because the groundwater level was raised too high and exceeded its initial value during recharge hence the recovery of groundwater level after the end of recharge played a role as groundwater drawdown in addition it can be observed that the connectivity between aqi and aqii was increased since the water level measured at the end of the construction are basically equal in all the observation wells this should be because the existence of recharge well connected aqi and aqii hydraulically see fig 4 in fact when analyzing the responses of groundwater and soil to pumping and recharge the influence of the construction of underground structure on the hydraulic connection of adjacent aquifers should be concerned pujades et al 2015 the above analyses indicated that the building response are closely related to water level change in aqi the dewatering induced settlements can be effectively restricted through artificial recharge if it is operated reasonably but it may be hard to offset the existing building settlement by the use of artificial recharge hence the recharge should be aimed at maintaining the existing water level to avoid further decline and the consequent settlement but not at greatly raising water level to balance out the already occurred settlement especially the building settlement it should especially avoid excessively raising water level to exceed its initial value during recharge and also prevent shutting down recharge wells immediately and rapidly for fear that durative environment settlements occur after the close of recharge wells 4 1 2 building settlements induced by redevelopment of recharge wells during the recharge test a certain degree of building settlement can still be detected even if the recharge is under the normal operating condition as can be seen in fig 11 apart from r2 there were still 2 stages in which the building settlements occurred they were r3 and r5 in these two stages no drawdown was observed i e the recharge was running well see fig 10 what is the reason for the settlements developed in r3 and r5 in fact those were caused by the redevelopment of recharge wells taking r3 as an example fig 12 presents a more detailed development of building settlement and every time of redevelopment date during this stage the symbol of h11 in the horizontal axis at the bottom means the first time of redevelopment of h1 in the considered time range and the corresponding dates are shown in the horizontal axis at the top the rest of the symbols has the similar meanings it can be seen from fig 12 that building settlements progressively increased during 7 times of redevelopment and can reach 1 2 5 mm the settlement development shows a good correlation with the redevelopment of recharge well for example as soon as h1 was redeveloped on may 9th settlements at jz1 and jz4 i e the positions around h1 appeared immediately while no settlements occurred at jz9 and jz12 i e the positions away from h1 but around h7 however on may 10th settlements arose at jz9 and jz12 the moment h7 was redeveloped now that the redevelopment can induce durative building settlements why is there no settlement appearing during r4 and r6 see fig 11 the reason may be as follows as shown in fig 10 the groundwater level rose gradually and rapidly during r4 and r6 which may cause building uplift meanwhile the building settlement increment induced by redevelopment during these stages should still exist maybe because these two effects offset each other building settlement did not appear during r4 and r6 but as described above it is not a good choice to progressively increase the water level in a long term recharge to balance out the redevelopment induced settlement since once the water level is raised too high or exceed its initial value the recovery of groundwater level after the stop of recharge will induce durative building settlement 4 2 results of test 2 4 2 1 groundwater level change fig 13 shows the observed groundwater level change in aqii around ar and pr wells during the test in the first step groundwater recharge is conducted in advance by h1 hence water level rise can be seen around h1 and the rise is more apparent as the distances from h1 become smaller as soon as groundwater discharge is carried out by c1 drawdown arises around c1 and h1 the east side of the two wells experiences a relatively more serious decline of water levels which reach and even fall below their initial value but in the north and west sides a slight water level rise compared to their initial values still exists this is because the east side is closer to the discharge well c1 while the north side and the observation wells in west side in this test are closer to the recharge well h1 after the two wells are shut down water level in aqii is recovered to its initial state the above analysis indicates that if the recharge rate of ar well i e h1 here is roughly the same as or no less than the discharge rate of pr well i e c1 here the proposed combined recharge method can effectively restrict the water level decline and even avoid the water level from falling below its initial value during the redevelopment of recharge wells in the application of combined recharge it is suggested that ar wells i e h1 here be installed closer to the protected area e g the west side in fig 13 than pr wells i e c1 here so that the protected area could be always in the range of recharge cone rather than depression cone during the redevelopment of pr wells 4 2 2 aquifer parameters and recharge cone aquifer parameters and the shape of recharge cone are important to recharge design and analysis shen et al 2015a wu et al 2017 considering that a close hydraulic connection exists between aqii and aqiii as described above the calculation of hydraulic parameters and recharge cone in aqii should consider the water leakage effect between aqii and aqiii hence the analytical solution proposed by hantush and jacob 1955 which can reflect the leakage effect is employed to fit the observed water level data during h1 recharge i e step 1 and thus compute the aquifer parameters in addition a solution from cooper and jacob 1946 which cannot reflect the leakage effect is also adopted to analyze the aquifer parameters for comparison fig 14 shows the semi log graph of the water level rise versus recharge time the fitting curves and aquifer parameters calculated by the two analytical solutions are also plotted in the figures since the data in c1 and g3 cannot satisfy the condition that u 0 02 note u is the independent variable of well function according to cooper and jacob 1946 the cooper jacob method is not used to fit them it can be seen that the average hydraulic conductivity k of aqii calculated using the cooper jacob method is higher than that computed using the hantush jacob method apparently the hantush jacob result should be closer to the actual value because it can reflect the leakage effect which exactly exists in the field therefore if the water leakage is found to occur in the field the use of solution which cannot reflect this feature will overestimate the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer this conclusion corresponds with the results obtained by shen et al 2015b and wu et al 2018 besides the storage coefficient s and leakage factor b are also obtained according to the hantush jacob solution which can provide references for the further study based on the obtained aquifer parameters the recharge cone can be calculated since the water level reach a stable state at the end of h1 recharge see fig 13 two steady state solutions proposed by thiem 1906 and hantush 1956 are used to compute the recharge cone in aqii at the end of h1 recharge likewise the former solution cannot reflect the leakage effect while the latter one can since the aquifer parameters obtained from hantush jacob solution see fig 14 b should be closer to the actual values as described above they are put into the thiem and hantush equations to calculate the recharge cone besides the aquifer parameters obtained from cooper jacob solution see fig 14 a are also used in thiem equation to compute the recharge cone for comparison fig 15 compares the observed and computed recharge cone in aqii at the end of h1 recharge apparently the use of the thiem solution to predict the water level change in this test will have significant error if the aquifer parameters which are calculated by considering the leakage effect are employed i e k 0 184 m d the water level change will be overvalued if the parameters which are computed without consideration of the leakage effect are adopted i e k 1 45 m d the water level change will be underestimated however the hantush solution gives a more accurate prediction of the water level change in aqii during the test these results indicate that once the water leakage between adjacent aquifers is found to exist in the field engineers should use the theory which is able to consider this effect to evaluate the aquifer parameters and water level change otherwise a large computing deviation will occur especially when a serve water leakage exists 4 2 3 ground surface behavior fig 16 shows the observed ground surface deformation around h1 and c1 during the test by comparing figs 16 and 13 it can be found that the development of ground surface deformation shows a good correlation with the change of water level but the variation of deformation magnitudes during the test seems not to be such apparent compared to the water level response and most importantly the observed results show that there are no absolute surface settlements anywhere throughout the test even if settlement increments are discovered after c1 is opened this indicates that if the protected area is immediately on the ground surface the combined recharge can be designed more flexibly according the field conditions that means both the ar and pr wells can be set up either close to or away from the protected area with no worry about the possibility of redevelopment induced settlement fig 17 compares the ground surface uplift u gs cone with recharge cone in aqii at the end of h1 recharge both the surface uplift cone and recharge cone show a similar shape and both u gs and water level rise r w decrease with the distance from the recharge center i e h1 increased but the surface uplift cone has a larger range and seem to be more flat compared to the recharge cone this may be because the soil cohesion and frictional property play a role in transmitting the deformation in the soil layer 5 discussion 5 1 difference between groundwater response and soil response the combined recharge can be reasonably designed to ensure no absolute ground surface settlements anywhere during the redevelopment but as described in section 4 2 1 there are still some place undergoing some degree of absolute drawdown near the pr well i e redeveloped well during the redevelopment see fig 13 c normally it is expected that the absolute ground surface settlement should appear in the same place with groundwater drawdown but the results are just the opposite and meanwhile the deformation response of ground surface during the test seems not to be such apparent compared to the water level response this indicates that the soil response to the reciprocating action of water level rise and decline is complicated it is needed to conduct three dimensional soil fluid coupling numerical analysis to investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon the field data and computed aquifer parameters in this paper can provide references for the further numerical study 5 2 benefit and drawback of combined recharge the combined recharge is a proactive deformation control method the use of it seems to increase the project cost because the number of recharge wells will be twice that in the traditional single row recharge method but the benefit of this method i e contribution to the deformation control may far outweigh its drawback in a congested urban environment the excavations are typically surrounding by existing underground structures e g metro tunnels and building foundations with a close distance between each other zeng et al 2018a zheng et al 2014b the environment deformations induced by deep excavation should be strictly controlled in this condition the combined recharge can be seen as an important supplement to the traditional recharge method and may play a key role in restricting the environment settlement induced by groundwater drawdown hence compared to the deformation control the cost in a few more recharge wells may not be so important and most importantly if combined recharge is not designed at first and then the existing underground structures have suffered great settlement induced by groundwater drawdown the design and construction of follow up countermeasures may severely delay the project period and increase the project cost 6 concluding remarks this study developed a method referred to as the combined recharge to prevent redevelopment induced ground settlement the proposed method was verified by two field tests with and without use of combined recharge the test results are analyzed and compared with analytical solutions based on this research the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the case without combined recharge building settlements progressively increased during 7 times of redevelopment with the maximum reached to 2 5 mm the settlement shows a good correlation with the redevelopment of recharge wells this result indicates that it needs to gradually raise water level during recharge process to balance out the redevelopment induced settlement however when the water level is raised to exceed its initial value the recovery of water level after the stop of recharge will induce durative building settlement 2 in the case with combined recharge the test results show that if the recharge rate of ar well is roughly the same as or no less than the pumping rate of pr well there are no significant ground surface settlements during the redevelopment 3 the long term recharge test indicates that the building response are closely related to the water level change the dewatering induced settlements can be effectively restricted through artificial recharge if it is operated reasonably the recharge should maintain the existing water level to avoid further decline instead of greatly raising water level to uplift the building besides the recharge should be opened and closed progressively letting the water level rise and decline slowly which will help better use recharge for settlement control 4 from the case with combined recharge aquifer parameters can be calculated and with these parameters water level change can be predicted however before the calculation the hydraulic connection between aquifers leaking behavior should be confirmed if there exists leaking the theory to consider the leaking behavior e g hantush s solution should be adopted to evaluate the aquifer parameters and water level otherwise if use cooper s solution hydraulic conductivity of aquifer and the water level change will be over estimated conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

6795,artificial recharge is an effective way to minimize dewatering induced ground settlements in deep excavation to ensure the success of a long term recharge it is necessary to redevelop recharge wells i e pumping periodically to prevent well clogging field measurements show that ground settlements will occur during the well redevelopment this paper proposed a method referred to as the

developed rapidly for infrastructures in mass transport or disaster prevention lyu et al 2018 pujades et al 2014a xu et al 2018 most of these underground space constructions was conducted with deep excavations and the depth of excavation increases fast tan and lu 2017 wu et al 2015b this causes the foundation pit to be usually threatened by the high piezometric heads in confined aquifers pujades et al 2017 shen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2016 if the groundwater in a confined aquifer cannot be reasonably controlled during excavation large deformations and hydraulic heave will occur pujades et al 2014b shen et al 2013 typically dewatering in the confined aquifer is adopted to lower the groundwater head inside the excavation and meanwhile sealing curtains are employed to block groundwater seepage from beyond the excavation to relieve the dewatering induced environment deformations wu et al 2015a xu et al 2014 zeng et al 2017a b c 2018b zhang et al 2018b however if the sealing curtain cannot totally cut off the confined aquifer zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 or there are some defects in sealing curtain pujades et al 2012 2016 dewatering will inevitably cause a decrease of the groundwater head outside the excavation and further induce surrounding environment deformations forth 2004 roy and robinson 2009 zheng et al 2013 2014a to minimize the dewatering induced adverse impacts artificial recharge is usually adopted which can compensate the drawdown by injecting the water into the aquifer phien wej et al 1998 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 however an inherent problem in artificial recharge is well plugging which reduces recharge flow rate and even invalidates the recharge wells pavelic et al 2007 phien wej et al 1998 pyne 1995 taneja and khepar 1996 the plugging may be due to suspended particles in the recharge water bichara 1986 biological growth around the well screen vecchioli 1970 and some other reasons powers 2007 to address the plugging of recharge wells periodic redevelopment of the recharge wells is required to remove the plugging constituents phien wej et al 1998 powers 2007 the wells are typically redeveloped by over pumping through a submersible pump installed within the well in advance the period of over pumping typically ranges from several hours to several days every couple of days powers 2007 pyne 1995 over pumping can induce groundwater drawdown which may turn the recharge cone created by recharge into a depression cone as shown in fig 1 the ground settlement may then occur in fact many researchers ni et al 2011 phien wej et al 1998 zheng et al 2014a have proved that the pumping induced drawdown and settlement in confined aquifer can reach most of their stable value within a short time e g several hours which means redevelopment may induce detectable ground settlement in addition shen et al 2013 pointed out that soil settlements induced by pumping recovery process in aquifer could show a delayed behavior and the reason may be the lagging consolidation of overburdened aquitards this indicates that the redevelopment induced settlement may continue to increase even after ceasing hence it may need to take additional measures to eliminate the drawdown and soil settlement induced by redevelopment of recharge wells the current relevant research about the use of recharge for settlement control in deep excavation are mainly focused on its effectiveness and applicability some researchers powrie and roberts 1995 wang et al 2012 conducted recharge tests to investigate the groundwater response to recharge recovery process other researchers zhang and goh 2016 zhang et al 2018a 2017 zheng et al 2018 carried out recharge pumping tests and numerical simulations to study the soil behaviors during the couple actions of pumping and recharge however these studies primarily considered the effect of recharge on controlling the groundwater drawdown and soil settlements and did not investigate the redevelopment induced ground settlement in fact very few studies can be found in literature to report the ground response to the redevelopment of recharge wells if the redevelopment induced ground settlement cannot be ignored how to effectively control or eliminate this deformation is still unclear the objective of this paper is to propose a method called combined recharge which is used to prevent redevelopment induced ground settlement two field tests with and without consideration of the effect of combined recharge are conducted to investigate the ground response to recharge and redevelopment of recharge wells the test results are analyzed and compared with analytical solutions on this basis a series of optimized design schemes are proposed for reference to designers to help them better use recharge to avoid durative ground settlements in practical recharge project 2 working principle of combined recharge fig 1 c illustrates the working principle of combined recharge unlike the traditional single row well arrangement recharge wells in the proposed method are arranged in two rows with a row of primary recharge pr wells and a row of auxiliary recharge ar wells ar well is set up between pr well and the protected area the function of pr well is as same as the traditional recharge well which is used to compensate the dewatering induced drawdown by injecting water into the aquifer while ar well is only used to recharge during the redevelopment of pr well in order to prevent redevelopment induced groundwater drawdown and consequent environment settlement in the practice of combined recharge ar well can be opened earlier e g several hours before the redevelopment of pr well in this condition a small recharge cone will be formed around the two wells as shown in blue dashed line in fig 1 c during redevelopment of pr well the groundwater level adjacent to pr well will decline while the groundwater level under the protected area will remain unchanged or just have a smaller drawdown if the recharge of ar well is operated with an appropriate flow rate on this occasion the protected area will not develop or just experience slight settlement 3 field tests background introduction 3 1 test 1 traditional recharge test in a deep excavation 3 1 1 project description and soil conditions fig 2 presents the plan view of a deep excavation and instrumentation layout for the recharge test the final excavation depth was approximately 21 m below the ground surface bgs a three story religious building resting on a pile foundation with the pile length of 11 m existed at a distance of 15 m on the east side of the excavation a row of bored piles with the layout of φ1500 1700 1500 mm in diameter and 1700 mm in center to center spacing and the length of 37 9 m were applied as retaining structure around the excavation a row of φ850 600 soil cement mixed piles was set up behind the retaining structures as sealing curtains five rows of φ850 600 soil cement mixed piles were used to strengthen the soils between the excavation and the building and meanwhile a row of φ800 1000 bored piles were adopted to isolate the building aiming to minimize the excavation induced building deformation according to the geotechnical investigation report the deposit at the site is the typical soft deposit in tianjin shen et al 2015b wu et al 2018 it mainly consists of saturated silts silty clays and silty sands in the upper 60 0 m bgs fig 3 shows the typical geological section and properties at the project site there are one phreatic aquifer labelled as aq0 and two confined aquifers labelled as aqi and aqii respectively within the depth of 60 0 m bgs the aquifers are separated by aquitards the long term phreatic water level was observed at depths of around 2 2 m bgs the hydrostatic equilibrium for the two confined aquifers were reached around 4 8 and 5 3 m bgs respectively from the upper to the lower layers 3 1 2 arrangement of the recharge wells and observation instruments since the final excavation depth i e 21 m bgs was close to the top of aqi the dewatering wells were designed with 28 0 31 5 m deep and set up inside the excavation to ensure that the groundwater level in aqi can be lowered below the final excavation depth during excavation the in situ pumping tests indicate that close hydraulic connection exists between aqi and aqii it was expected that the dewatering during excavation would cause groundwater drawdown in aqi and aqii outside the excavation and further induce settlement of adjacent religious building due to the sealing curtains not totally blocking aqii to avoid the religious building settlement artificial recharge was proposed for the project figs 2 and 4 present the recharge wells layout and the structure of the wells adopted in the test five recharge wells labeled as h1 h3 h4 h7 and h11 were arranged around the religious building the screens of these wells were all located in aqi and aqii to monitor the groundwater level in aqi and aqii around the religious building three observation wells labeled as a3 a4 and a11 were employed between the excavation and religious building in addition fourteen settlement monitoring points labeled as jz1 jz14 were mounted on the religious building the building settlements were surveyed by levelling instruments serrano juan et al 2017 3 1 3 recharge test procedure and periodic redevelopment tables 1 and 2 show the main stages of soil excavation and the recharge test respectively the soil excavation started from oct 26th 2012 staged dewatering and staged excavation were adopted during stage e5 the groundwater levels in aqi and aqii outside the excavation were found to decline rapidly and the rate of religious building settlement increased these results will be described in detail in section 4 1 1 and can be seen in figs 10 and 11 this is because the dewatering with depth of 27 m bgs inside excavation was in progress during stage e5 considering that a wide range of dewatering would proceed until the base slab was cured the groundwater levels in aqi and aqii outside the excavation was believed to decline continuously which would have adverse effect on religious building to avoid the above hazard the artificial recharge lasting 197 days had been carried out since mar 25th 2013 fig 5 presents the observed real time recharge flow rate q r during the whole recharge process q r could reach 1 3 m3 h i e 24 72 m3 d and was roughly stable during recharge which indicates that the 197 days recharge run well the periodic redevelopment of the recharge wells is critical to the success of long term recharge in this project five recharge wells were redeveloped by pumping in turns in the order of h1 h7 h11 h4 h3 with the time interval between each other of about 1 day each time of the redevelopment lasted 2 h this process was repeated until the end of the recharge fig 6 presents the time interval of redevelopment for each recharge well in most conditions in this project the time interval was 3 4 days which is a little longer compared to 1 day of redevelopment interval reported by pyne 1995 the reason is that in this project the recharged aquifers are mainly composed of silts and silty sands whose soil particles are larger than those of clayey sands reported in pyne 1995 the possibility of recharge wells plugging in this project is relatively small and the redevelopment interval can be longer but it is still necessary to make recharge wells redeveloped in a large number of times in order to ensure the success of a long term recharge fig 7 presents the relationship between the accumulated redevelopment duration t and the recharge duration t for each recharge well t increases linearly with t in this case and the ratio of t to t averages about 0 026 3 2 test 2 combined recharge test in a greenfield land 3 2 1 field condition this test site was approximately 6 km away from the place of test 1 as can be seen in fig 3 the soil conditions in the two test sites are extremely similar only the thickness of the soil layers have some difference in this test site the third confined aquifer labelled as aqiii is located at the depth from 57 m bgs to 67 m bgs the aquitard above aqiii is only 2 m thick in situ pumping tests show that there is a strong hydraulic connection between aqii and aqiii while that among aq0 aqi and aqii is not apparent the long term phreatic water level was observed at depths of 2 0 m bgs the hydrostatic equilibrium for aqi aqii and aqiii were reached at 5 5 6 8 and 6 9 m bgs respectively 3 2 2 arrangement of test wells and monitoring points fig 8 presents the plan view of the test wells and monitoring points a pumping well c1 was used to simulate the redevelopment of pr well and a recharge well h1 was employed to simulate the recharge process of ar well during the redevelopment of pr well the screens of c1 and h1 were both located in aqii see fig 4 to monitor the groundwater level in aqii around c1 and h1 during combined recharge test six observation wells labeled as g1 g6 were adopted in the surrounding area in addition twenty ground surface settlement points labeled as d1 d20 were installed on the site 3 2 3 test procedure since the objective of this test was to investigate the effect of combined recharge and was not to carry out a long term recharge only one time of redevelopment was simulated in the test table 3 presents the test procedures which are as follows step 1 the ar well i e h1 used to recharge was opened in advance aiming to form an initial but small recharge cone around the two wells when the groundwater level was observed to be in a stable state the step 2 can be started step 2 let pr well i e c1 used to simulate redevelopment discharge groundwater and meanwhile the recharge of h1 was still proceeding this step was to simulate the redevelopment process under the proposed combined recharge method step 3 after the groundwater level reached steady state shut down the two wells and let the groundwater level be recovered 3 2 4 recharge flow rate and discharge flow rate fig 9 shows the real time recharge flow rate q r and discharge flow rate q d during the test it was planned to achieve q r q d 1 m3 h during the test however in fact it was not easy to control the water inflow because the water supply for recharge from city mains sometimes fluctuated and thus the results of q r and q d also show some degree of fluctuation but fortunately q r q d was roughly realized during the test 4 field tests results and analyses 4 1 results of test 1 4 1 1 groundwater level change and building settlements figs 10 and 11 present the time history curves of surrounding groundwater level change in aqi and aqii and the religious building settlements respectively every stage of soil excavation i e e1 e7 and recharge i e r1 r6 introduced in tables 1 and 2 are shown in figs 10 and 11 before the recharge test the water level decline and the building settlements were observed to occur mainly in two phases one is during e1 and e2 and the other is during e4 and e5 as described in table 1 these two phases are corresponding to the dewatering stages with the pump depth changed from 0 m to 22 m and from 22 m to 27 m respectively since the sealing curtains did not totally block aqii and meanwhile the in situ pumping tests indicate that close hydraulic connection exists between aqi and aqii dewatering conducted inside the excavation would induce the surrounding groundwater drawdown and environment settlement in addition it can be found that the building presented durative settlements from e1 to about the half of e4 but the water level decline reached a relatively stable state at the middle of e2 this indicates that the building settlement show a delayed behavior and the reason may be the lagging consolidation of aquitards below and above the aquifer pujades et al 2017 shen et al 2013 progressive increase of shear stress in soil layers with the depression cone enlarged budhu and adiyaman 2010 shen et al 2013 and the soil creep occurred in a high shear stress level nawir et al 2003 as soon as the recharge was launched the surrounding groundwater level was greatly raised and the building settlement was effectively restricted which can be seen in r1 note h1 h4 h7 and h11 were running during r1 but unfortunately the water yield inside excavation was found to increase obviously and the intermittent rise of water level was observed inside excavation during r1 the engineers had to temporarily shut down the recharge wells which were close to the excavation i e h1 and h4 letting only h7 and h11 be running i e stage r2 maybe because h1 and h4 were closed immediately and rapidly surrounding water level experienced a sharp drop which led to a fast growth of building settlement especially in the side close to the excavation i e left side of the building in this condition the engineers reopened h1 and h4 making the building settlement slow down see r3 afterwards h3 was also opened aiming to help raise surrounding groundwater level to reach its initial value see r4 r6 in these stages water level rose continuously while the building was not uplifted only showing a state of no apparent settlement the moment the recharge was stopped the water level dropped sharply and durative building settlement occurred once again that may be because the groundwater level was raised too high and exceeded its initial value during recharge hence the recovery of groundwater level after the end of recharge played a role as groundwater drawdown in addition it can be observed that the connectivity between aqi and aqii was increased since the water level measured at the end of the construction are basically equal in all the observation wells this should be because the existence of recharge well connected aqi and aqii hydraulically see fig 4 in fact when analyzing the responses of groundwater and soil to pumping and recharge the influence of the construction of underground structure on the hydraulic connection of adjacent aquifers should be concerned pujades et al 2015 the above analyses indicated that the building response are closely related to water level change in aqi the dewatering induced settlements can be effectively restricted through artificial recharge if it is operated reasonably but it may be hard to offset the existing building settlement by the use of artificial recharge hence the recharge should be aimed at maintaining the existing water level to avoid further decline and the consequent settlement but not at greatly raising water level to balance out the already occurred settlement especially the building settlement it should especially avoid excessively raising water level to exceed its initial value during recharge and also prevent shutting down recharge wells immediately and rapidly for fear that durative environment settlements occur after the close of recharge wells 4 1 2 building settlements induced by redevelopment of recharge wells during the recharge test a certain degree of building settlement can still be detected even if the recharge is under the normal operating condition as can be seen in fig 11 apart from r2 there were still 2 stages in which the building settlements occurred they were r3 and r5 in these two stages no drawdown was observed i e the recharge was running well see fig 10 what is the reason for the settlements developed in r3 and r5 in fact those were caused by the redevelopment of recharge wells taking r3 as an example fig 12 presents a more detailed development of building settlement and every time of redevelopment date during this stage the symbol of h11 in the horizontal axis at the bottom means the first time of redevelopment of h1 in the considered time range and the corresponding dates are shown in the horizontal axis at the top the rest of the symbols has the similar meanings it can be seen from fig 12 that building settlements progressively increased during 7 times of redevelopment and can reach 1 2 5 mm the settlement development shows a good correlation with the redevelopment of recharge well for example as soon as h1 was redeveloped on may 9th settlements at jz1 and jz4 i e the positions around h1 appeared immediately while no settlements occurred at jz9 and jz12 i e the positions away from h1 but around h7 however on may 10th settlements arose at jz9 and jz12 the moment h7 was redeveloped now that the redevelopment can induce durative building settlements why is there no settlement appearing during r4 and r6 see fig 11 the reason may be as follows as shown in fig 10 the groundwater level rose gradually and rapidly during r4 and r6 which may cause building uplift meanwhile the building settlement increment induced by redevelopment during these stages should still exist maybe because these two effects offset each other building settlement did not appear during r4 and r6 but as described above it is not a good choice to progressively increase the water level in a long term recharge to balance out the redevelopment induced settlement since once the water level is raised too high or exceed its initial value the recovery of groundwater level after the stop of recharge will induce durative building settlement 4 2 results of test 2 4 2 1 groundwater level change fig 13 shows the observed groundwater level change in aqii around ar and pr wells during the test in the first step groundwater recharge is conducted in advance by h1 hence water level rise can be seen around h1 and the rise is more apparent as the distances from h1 become smaller as soon as groundwater discharge is carried out by c1 drawdown arises around c1 and h1 the east side of the two wells experiences a relatively more serious decline of water levels which reach and even fall below their initial value but in the north and west sides a slight water level rise compared to their initial values still exists this is because the east side is closer to the discharge well c1 while the north side and the observation wells in west side in this test are closer to the recharge well h1 after the two wells are shut down water level in aqii is recovered to its initial state the above analysis indicates that if the recharge rate of ar well i e h1 here is roughly the same as or no less than the discharge rate of pr well i e c1 here the proposed combined recharge method can effectively restrict the water level decline and even avoid the water level from falling below its initial value during the redevelopment of recharge wells in the application of combined recharge it is suggested that ar wells i e h1 here be installed closer to the protected area e g the west side in fig 13 than pr wells i e c1 here so that the protected area could be always in the range of recharge cone rather than depression cone during the redevelopment of pr wells 4 2 2 aquifer parameters and recharge cone aquifer parameters and the shape of recharge cone are important to recharge design and analysis shen et al 2015a wu et al 2017 considering that a close hydraulic connection exists between aqii and aqiii as described above the calculation of hydraulic parameters and recharge cone in aqii should consider the water leakage effect between aqii and aqiii hence the analytical solution proposed by hantush and jacob 1955 which can reflect the leakage effect is employed to fit the observed water level data during h1 recharge i e step 1 and thus compute the aquifer parameters in addition a solution from cooper and jacob 1946 which cannot reflect the leakage effect is also adopted to analyze the aquifer parameters for comparison fig 14 shows the semi log graph of the water level rise versus recharge time the fitting curves and aquifer parameters calculated by the two analytical solutions are also plotted in the figures since the data in c1 and g3 cannot satisfy the condition that u 0 02 note u is the independent variable of well function according to cooper and jacob 1946 the cooper jacob method is not used to fit them it can be seen that the average hydraulic conductivity k of aqii calculated using the cooper jacob method is higher than that computed using the hantush jacob method apparently the hantush jacob result should be closer to the actual value because it can reflect the leakage effect which exactly exists in the field therefore if the water leakage is found to occur in the field the use of solution which cannot reflect this feature will overestimate the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer this conclusion corresponds with the results obtained by shen et al 2015b and wu et al 2018 besides the storage coefficient s and leakage factor b are also obtained according to the hantush jacob solution which can provide references for the further study based on the obtained aquifer parameters the recharge cone can be calculated since the water level reach a stable state at the end of h1 recharge see fig 13 two steady state solutions proposed by thiem 1906 and hantush 1956 are used to compute the recharge cone in aqii at the end of h1 recharge likewise the former solution cannot reflect the leakage effect while the latter one can since the aquifer parameters obtained from hantush jacob solution see fig 14 b should be closer to the actual values as described above they are put into the thiem and hantush equations to calculate the recharge cone besides the aquifer parameters obtained from cooper jacob solution see fig 14 a are also used in thiem equation to compute the recharge cone for comparison fig 15 compares the observed and computed recharge cone in aqii at the end of h1 recharge apparently the use of the thiem solution to predict the water level change in this test will have significant error if the aquifer parameters which are calculated by considering the leakage effect are employed i e k 0 184 m d the water level change will be overvalued if the parameters which are computed without consideration of the leakage effect are adopted i e k 1 45 m d the water level change will be underestimated however the hantush solution gives a more accurate prediction of the water level change in aqii during the test these results indicate that once the water leakage between adjacent aquifers is found to exist in the field engineers should use the theory which is able to consider this effect to evaluate the aquifer parameters and water level change otherwise a large computing deviation will occur especially when a serve water leakage exists 4 2 3 ground surface behavior fig 16 shows the observed ground surface deformation around h1 and c1 during the test by comparing figs 16 and 13 it can be found that the development of ground surface deformation shows a good correlation with the change of water level but the variation of deformation magnitudes during the test seems not to be such apparent compared to the water level response and most importantly the observed results show that there are no absolute surface settlements anywhere throughout the test even if settlement increments are discovered after c1 is opened this indicates that if the protected area is immediately on the ground surface the combined recharge can be designed more flexibly according the field conditions that means both the ar and pr wells can be set up either close to or away from the protected area with no worry about the possibility of redevelopment induced settlement fig 17 compares the ground surface uplift u gs cone with recharge cone in aqii at the end of h1 recharge both the surface uplift cone and recharge cone show a similar shape and both u gs and water level rise r w decrease with the distance from the recharge center i e h1 increased but the surface uplift cone has a larger range and seem to be more flat compared to the recharge cone this may be because the soil cohesion and frictional property play a role in transmitting the deformation in the soil layer 5 discussion 5 1 difference between groundwater response and soil response the combined recharge can be reasonably designed to ensure no absolute ground surface settlements anywhere during the redevelopment but as described in section 4 2 1 there are still some place undergoing some degree of absolute drawdown near the pr well i e redeveloped well during the redevelopment see fig 13 c normally it is expected that the absolute ground surface settlement should appear in the same place with groundwater drawdown but the results are just the opposite and meanwhile the deformation response of ground surface during the test seems not to be such apparent compared to the water level response this indicates that the soil response to the reciprocating action of water level rise and decline is complicated it is needed to conduct three dimensional soil fluid coupling numerical analysis to investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon the field data and computed aquifer parameters in this paper can provide references for the further numerical study 5 2 benefit and drawback of combined recharge the combined recharge is a proactive deformation control method the use of it seems to increase the project cost because the number of recharge wells will be twice that in the traditional single row recharge method but the benefit of this method i e contribution to the deformation control may far outweigh its drawback in a congested urban environment the excavations are typically surrounding by existing underground structures e g metro tunnels and building foundations with a close distance between each other zeng et al 2018a zheng et al 2014b the environment deformations induced by deep excavation should be strictly controlled in this condition the combined recharge can be seen as an important supplement to the traditional recharge method and may play a key role in restricting the environment settlement induced by groundwater drawdown hence compared to the deformation control the cost in a few more recharge wells may not be so important and most importantly if combined recharge is not designed at first and then the existing underground structures have suffered great settlement induced by groundwater drawdown the design and construction of follow up countermeasures may severely delay the project period and increase the project cost 6 concluding remarks this study developed a method referred to as the combined recharge to prevent redevelopment induced ground settlement the proposed method was verified by two field tests with and without use of combined recharge the test results are analyzed and compared with analytical solutions based on this research the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the case without combined recharge building settlements progressively increased during 7 times of redevelopment with the maximum reached to 2 5 mm the settlement shows a good correlation with the redevelopment of recharge wells this result indicates that it needs to gradually raise water level during recharge process to balance out the redevelopment induced settlement however when the water level is raised to exceed its initial value the recovery of water level after the stop of recharge will induce durative building settlement 2 in the case with combined recharge the test results show that if the recharge rate of ar well is roughly the same as or no less than the pumping rate of pr well there are no significant ground surface settlements during the redevelopment 3 the long term recharge test indicates that the building response are closely related to the water level change the dewatering induced settlements can be effectively restricted through artificial recharge if it is operated reasonably the recharge should maintain the existing water level to avoid further decline instead of greatly raising water level to uplift the building besides the recharge should be opened and closed progressively letting the water level rise and decline slowly which will help better use recharge for settlement control 4 from the case with combined recharge aquifer parameters can be calculated and with these parameters water level change can be predicted however before the calculation the hydraulic connection between aquifers leaking behavior should be confirmed if there exists leaking the theory to consider the leaking behavior e g hantush s solution should be adopted to evaluate the aquifer parameters and water level otherwise if use cooper s solution hydraulic conductivity of aquifer and the water level change will be over estimated conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

assistance of alessio domeneghetti associate editor spatiotemporal variability teleconnection and predictability of the korean precipitation related to large scale climate indices were examined based on leading patterns of observed monthly rx5day and total precipitation through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot cross correlation and lag regression analyses for the leading modes and global atmospheric circulation dataset were employed on a monthly basis the spatial pattern of the leading eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation represents a northern inland mode for boreal summer and a southern coastal mode in boreal winter the temporal evolution of the leading eot modes exhibits increasing trends during summer season and decadal variability for winter season the leading eot patterns of rx5day precipitation show more widespread coherent patterns than those of total precipitation during warm and cold seasons while the former explains less variance in precipitation variability than the latter the tropical enso forcing has a coherent teleconnection with september and november december precipitation patterns while the indian ocean dipole is identified as a driver for precipitation variability in september and november the monsoon circulation over the western north pacific also exhibits a significant negative correlation with winter precipitation eots while tropical cyclone indices are positively correlated with the fall precipitation eots the leading patterns of the september and december rx5day precipitation time series are predictable at up to six month lead time from the tropical pacific sea surface temperatures ssts while a somewhat weak predictable response from indian ocean ssts was only detected at longer lead times in addition predictability from the pacific ssts for above normal precipitation is greater than that for below normal precipitation keywords precipitation variability teleconnection el niño southern oscillation 1 introduction deciphering the physical mechanisms through which the large scale climate phenomena affect hydroclimatic processes is of great interest the korean peninsula experiences a large degree of spatiotemporal precipitation variability precipitation varies with fluctuation of various global regional scale climate indices cis including the el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod western north pacific monsoon and tropical cyclone activity these large scale climate indicators have been extensively studied because the extreme phases of these indicators can produce major hydrologic extremes of floods and droughts in many regions all over the globe in global and regional scale studies significant relationships have been reported between the large scale cis and hydro meteorological variables such as precipitation temperature and streamflow in the tropics and extratropics the effects of the enso on precipitation variability on a global and regional scale have been widely documented since the first investigation of walker 1923 on the influence of the southern oscillation so on rainfall fluctuations in indian monsoon many recent global scale studies have documented climatic links between enso tropical ocean sea surface temperature variability and global precipitation anomaly patterns e g bradley et al 1987 kiladis and diaz 1989 ropelewski and halpert 1989 in addition regional scale studies in low and middle latitudes e g douglas and englehart 1981 shukla and paolino 1983 kahya and dracup 1994 rasmusson and wallace 1983 redmond and koch 1991 price et al 1998 kug et al 2010 yeh et al 2017 mehr et al 2017 nourani et al 2017 and degefu and bewket 2017 have revealed statistically significant correlations between regional precipitation and enso forcing douglas and englehart 1981 revealed that the southeastern united states has a tendency for positive winter precipitation anomalies for the warm phase of enso event karabörk and kahya 2003 investigated the statistically significant correlation between two opposite phases of enso and precipitation patterns over turkey using harmonic analysis and showed the mid latitude precipitation responses to the enso forcing are detectable in the climate of two core regions in turkey the iod is considered one of the key cis of precipitation variability in the indian and pacific rim countries some studies of iod have noted the distinct behavior of the iod related precipitation anomalies relative to enso and other phenomena since saji et al 1999 reported a dipole mode of the indian ocean influencing precipitation fluctuations ashok et al 2001 2003 revealed that a significant statistical relationship exists between the iod and the indian monsoon precipitation variability as well as examined the remote response of australian precipitation anomalies in winter to the iod through an atmospheric general circulation model agcm the monsoon activity could also be considered as a ci for precipitation variability in the indian and pacific rim countries wang et al 2008 performed a comparative analysis on pros and cons of 25 existing east asian monsoon indicators from a viewpoint of interannual variabilities of precipitation and circulation suggested a new index extracted by principal component analysis and then stressed the important role of the precipitation during the mei yu season in quantifying the intensity of the east asian monsoon activity several recent studies for the korean peninsula have also suggested statistically significant responses of precipitation variability to large scale cis lee and julien 2015 2016 revealed that cold and warm enso phases are the dominant drivers of precipitation and temperature fluctuations over the korean peninsula based on harmonic and lag correlation analysis in the study on prediction of korean precipitation variability using the downscaling super ensemble method kim et al 2004 suggested that during winter precipitation variability is correlated with the second empirical orthogonal function eof mode of sea level pressure slp over east asia modulating moist flow from the western north pacific wnp and highlighted enhanced climatic response of the east asian monsoon activity to precipitation anomalies in winter moon et al 2005 examined the climatic links between seasonal precipitation and global sea surface temperature sst based on the principal components extracted by independent component analysis combined with wavelet transform they noted interannual inderdecadal variation and increasing trend during the spring and summer seasons showing the consistent precipitation related sst signals over indian and pacific oceans cha 2007 investigated the relationship between enso and iod mode events and the impacts of these two phenomena on the precipitation of the korean peninsula and indicated that the distribution of the indian ocean sst represents the southern and northern oscillation in enso year and eastern and western in iod year with above normal precipitation departure in both summer and winter seasons also kim et al 2012 carried out an exploratory analysis on the correlation of the pacific japan pattern with typhoon activity associated with extreme precipitation variability for all river basins in korea and revealed that the tropical cyclone tc activity occurs more frequently during positive pacific japan pj phase years than negative phase years as described above almost all aforementioned regional and global approaches concentrate on monthly or seasonal mean based precipitation variations and relatively little attention has been given to the far reaching effects of climate indicators on extreme precipitation variability since localized and intensified extreme precipitation events have a critical effect on people s livelihood and the environment understanding the underlying regional impacts of various climate indicators on extreme precipitation may provide a promising way to predict and respond unexpected natural hazards also the previous studies have focused mostly on the global scale remote influences of large scale modes of climate variability through perturbations to the large scale ocean atmospheric circulation and less on the influence of both global and regional cis on regional and local scale precipitation hence there has been less focus in the literature concerning the climate impacts of both global and regional cis on precipitation variability however the influence of cis on the east asian climatology is not limited to the global scale remote cis highlighting a gap in knowledge that requires the need for more information about the overall features of the hydrometeorological impacts modulated by various cis thus it is necessary to investigate systematically how both global and regional cis affect extreme and total precipitation variability in east asian regions in the super ensemble prediction analysis kim et al 2004 revealed strong and consistent climatic link between monsoon activity and korean precipitation variability from the visual inspection of the station location map in their papers a significant ci precipitation relationship over east asia cannot be completely discerned because of station coverage limitations in the present study we are motivated to expand on previous work by diagnosing the influences of global and regional cis on precipitation variability over the korean peninsula using an expanded surface dataset that can resolve local and regional features in this study for the purpose of investigating spatiotemporal patterns of rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula we employed empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot decomposition technique rather than the classical approach by empirical orthogonal function eof analysis because eots provide a straightforward interpretation of patterns within data with a minimum of computation king et al 2014 examined australian monthly precipitation variability through eot decomposition analysis and found that the first december eot mode shows notable predictability up to several month one year in advance given knowledge of tropical pacific ocean indian ocean sst also in a diagnostic study to understand the physical mechanism behind the effects of large scale climate indices on precipitation patterns in queensland australia klingaman et al 2013 used eot decomposition to identify remote and local drivers affecting the inter annual and decadal variability of seasonal precipitation patterns the present study mainly aims to investigate the spatial pattern and temporal behavior of rx5day and total precipitation anomalies over the korean peninsula through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot decomposition method van den dool et al 2000 to identify significant teleconnections between these leading eot modes of korean precipitation variability and climate indicators that represent large scale climate fluctuations and regional synoptic circulations and to demonstrate the predictability of rx5day and total precipitation patterns through knowledge of sea surface temperature sst anomalies using regression of the eot modes onto the sst fields at varying lead times 2 data the monthly precipitation gridded dataset was derived from station based observed precipitation data covering the entire korean peninsula the observational data were obtained from korea meteorological administration kma an affiliated organization of the ministry of environment moe the total precipitation timeseries cover more than 20 enso events spanning the time period 1904 through 2015 the observational records are selected only if they have less than a month missing data and each monthly precipitation data record is required to cover at least 43 years of observation between the years 1973 and 2015 thus spanning at least 10 enso episodes using these criteria 60 stations were used in our analysis as shown in fig 1 in order to estimate high resolution precipitation with a regular spaced grid the parameter elevation regression on independent slope model prism developed by daly et al 1994 2008 was employed for the observational precipitation data prism method is well suited to regions with mountainous terrain because it incorporates a conceptual framework that addresses the spatial scale and pattern of orographic precipitation using geographic information of the elevation distance topographic facet and coastal proximity daly et al 2008 this model is an independent model for each target grid which can estimate target grid value by weighting each station differently based on the similarity in elevation distance topographic facet and coastal proximity between observational station and target grid using this method we produced grid data 0 25 0 25 27 7 km 22 2 km of rx5day and total precipitation on a monthly basis from 1973 to 2015 for comparative analysis between large scale climate indicators and precipitation eot patterns several cis were applied in this present study taking into account both atmospheric and oceanic fluctuations we employed the oceanic niño index oni and the multivariate enso index as indicators for tropical enso forcing in addition to the soi that is widely used in atmospheric circulation analysis the oni is one of the main indicators for monitoring the tropical enso phenomena the positive phase of enso is represented by the condition that the oni index exceeds 0 5 while the negative phase of enso is represented when the oni index is less than 0 5 the oni is extracted by calculating the moving average of consecutive 3 month ssts over the east central pacific ocean also known as niño 3 4 index area of 120 170 w and 5 s 5 n the monthly oni time series applied in this analysis was derived from the sst dataset of the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc the multivariate enso index mei is derived from the leading modes calculated by unrotated decomposition technique for several air sea variables over the tropical pacific ocean including sst sea level pressure slp surface air temperature cloudiness fraction and zonal meridional surface wind noaa earth system research laboratory physical sciences division because it integrated both atmospheric and oceanic factors related to enso the mei may be considered as a better indicator of enso relative to other single variable cis in this analysis we employed the standardized bimonthly mei values regularly updated by the climate diagnostic center cdc that start in december 1949 january 1950 the soi as an atmospheric pressure based climate indicator is usually computed using the darwin tahiti mean sea level pressure mslp difference based on standardized darwin slps and standardized tahiti slps in the present analysis we used the dataset of soi calculated by the noaa climate prediction center unlike the oni and mei the positive phase of the soi represents la niña like conditions as an indicator of the iod we employ the dipole mode index dmi computed by the empirical approach by saji et al 1999 this index that we obtain from the noaa climate prediction center represents the magnitude of the anomalous sst gradient from the southeastern 90 110 e 10 s 0 to the western 50 70 e 10 s 10 n near equatorial indian ocean and is derived from the hadley centre global sea ice and sst hadisst dataset in the current analysis the dmi index was employed in cross correlation analysis as well as partial correlation analysis with the eot time series to remove the linear influence of the enso forcing on precipitation variability to examine the relationship between the previously introduced cis and the eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation we employ sst and atmospheric circulation datasets for sst data the extended reconstructed sst ersst v4 datasets huang et al 2014 are used in this study the ersst is a global monthly sst dataset calculated based on the international comprehensive ocean and atmosphere dataset icoads which is widely used in global and regional scale studies it is provided on a 2 0 2 0 grid that uses statistical techniques to provide global coverage and spans the period from january 1854 to the present the global atmospheric circulation fields are obtained from the reanalysis derived from the joint project of the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar which are available on noaa earth system research laboratory physical sciences division this dataset is continually updated to produce fields on a 2 5 2 5 grid using a state of the art numerical modeling system for prediction and data assimilation with continuously entrained observations the monthly ncep ncar reanalysis dataset is available for the period from 1948 to present links between precipitation eots and monsoon circulation variability are investigated using the wnpmi index over western north pacific using the methodological approach in wang et al 2008 the wnpmi index is calculated based on the difference between 850 hpa zonal winds u850 in the region 5 15 n 100 130 e and the region 20 30 n 110 140 e the former region represents the intensity of the monsoon westerlies from indochina peninsula to the philippines while the latter indicates the magnitude of the easterlies over the southeastern part of the wnp subtropical anticyclone the monthly tropical cyclone index tci quantifying the tropical cyclone activity is calculated based on the tropical cyclone tracks recorded by the ibtracs knapp et al 2010 and the national typhoon center ntc of kma for the period from 1973 through 2015 the tci is obtained from the frequency of tropical cyclones passing through the index area as shown in fig 2 3 eot and statistical analysis the general methodology used in this present analysis which follows the comprehensive empirical approach by van den dool et al 2000 can be briefly summarized in fig 3 and is described in more detail below the first step is to convert the original data to a monthly time series i e transformation of precipitation time series into standardized precipitation index spi for rx5day and total precipitation then eot techniques are performed for identification of the spatiotemporal variability of rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula the next step is to conduct both cross correlation and linear regression analyses to quantify the teleconnection between global and regional cis and leading eot precipitation modes the final step is to perform a lag regression analysis using the regression of sst data onto empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot modes with varying lead times to examine the potential predictability of rx5day and total korean precipitation relative to pacific tropical thermal forcing in this present analysis rx5day precipitation time series are generated following the recommendation of the climatic variability and predictability cci clivar panel the monthly highest five consecutive day precipitation is employed to define rx5day precipitation during the period from 1973 to 2015 the monthly rx5day and total precipitation time series are calculated for each station prior to the eot analysis to examine the ci precipitation teleconnection we converted the precipitation data to a spi formulated for effective assessment of wet and dry condition eot analysis decomposes a spi dataset with spatiotemporal variability into a set of orthogonal components namely eot patterns the first eot spatial modes are obtained by finding the point with the highest sum in explained variance of all other points which is designated as a base point by van den dool et al 2000 then the precipitation time series of the base point is defined as the first temporal mode of the precipitation pattern the second eot spatial modes are extracted by removing the influence of the base point on all other points using regression analysis for precipitation time series of the base point and all other points from this modified precipitation dataset the second base point is identified by detecting the point explaining the most variance of the residual precipitation record this procedure is repeated for subsequent modes until the desired number of modes is derived the following mathematical expressions of eot procedure are based on van den dool et al 2000 after detecting the base point s b 1 in space that explains the maximum possible variance at all other points its associated spatial mode e 1 s is defined as the first eot the temporal mode α 1 t associated with eot 1 is simply the original time series for its base point after extracting eot 1 the data are split into a portion of which variance is explained p e s t and a residual p r s t as follows p e s t α 1 t e 1 s p r s t p s t p e s t where α 1 t p s b 1 t e 1 s 1 n t t 1 nt p s t p s b 1 t 1 n t t 1 nt p s t 2 1 n t t 1 nt p s b 1 t 2 1 n t t 1 nt p s t 2 1 n t t 1 nt p s b 1 t 2 after dividing the data into explained and residual portions the procedure is repeated using the once reduced data the point in space that explains the most variance at all other points in p r s t becomes the base point for eot 2 the time series connected with eot 2 is represented by the series at its base point in the once reduced data after removing the variance explained by eot 2 from the data set the process is repeated again and so on until all of the domain variance in the original data is explained p e s t grows at the expense of p r s t reordering the variance in the original data as eot modes the total variance t v in the data is expressed by tv 1 n t n s t 1 n t s 1 n s p s t 2 where n t and n s is the numbers of points in time and space the amount of variance explained by a particular eot is related to the fraction of its explained variance e v to the total domain variance ev 1 n t n s t 1 n t s 1 n s p e s t 2 tv in this analysis we employ the revised eot decomposition technique used by smith 2004 who used a base point selection procedure based on the explained variance for the entire domain weighted dataset instead of the highest sum in explained variance of all other points due to the regional biases the first two eot modes were selected as leading patterns of rx5day and total precipitation variability since the subsequent eots after the first two eot calculations explain less than 5 of the variance following the procedure above eot 1 and eot 2 were obtained for monthly rx5day and total precipitation time series during 1973 2015 to investigate patterns of precipitation fluctuations across the korean peninsula due to the fact that eot decomposition technique is orthogonal in one either space or time while eof is orthogonal in both space and time eot method provides a potentially more intuitive interpretation of the resulting patterns following the approach by king et al 2014 correlation coefficients between the precipitation eot modes and six cis are calculated using spearman s correlation analysis with statistical significance assessed at the 5 level taking into account the fact that wmpmi and tci time series do not exhibit a normal distribution although the correlation analysis was performed by spearman s rank test the resultant correlation coefficients were in general agreement with those calculated by the commonly used pearson s correlation method not shown here the overall findings from correlation and regression analyses between precipitation eot modes and various cis are described using correlation and regression maps 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal structures of eots correlation maps for each eot associated with the highest value of explained variance for the domain weighted spi were plotted for each month the values displayed in these maps are the correlation coefficients between the precipitation eot time series at the base point and the precipitation time series at all other points each leading eot has the most explained variance for rx5day and total precipitation the spatial patterns of the leading eot base points and highest correlation values for each month reflect the climatological seasonal pattern of precipitation combined with the influence of midlatitude weather systems on the korean peninsula the second eot are also computed using the procedures discussed above fig 4 shows the resultant patterns for the leading two eots of july and december rx5day and total precipitation the base points of the first eots for rx5day and total precipitation show different locations with respect to months the locations of base points for rx5day precipitation are similar to those for total precipitation during the summer months in northern inland of the korean peninsula in the winter months the base points of leading eots for rx5day precipitation have a tendency to shift southward but more so for the total precipitation time series that shifts to the southernmost island in addition for entire months as shown in table 1 we categorized total eots into inland north south and coastal south east modes that take into account the locations of the base points the centers of the rx5day and total leading eot modes are located in coastal area 38 modes and inland area 10 modes overall the lower order eot modes show more variability in the locations of the base points locations of the base points indicate that out of twenty four rx5day total precipitation eots consisting of the leading two eots for each of twelve months 20 18 are identified as coastal modes and 4 6 are identified as inland modes as shown in table 1 breaking this into more detail the coastal mode consists of an east coast mode 8 8 and south coast mode 12 10 defined on the basis of the center of leading mode also the inland mode consists of the north inland mode 3 3 and south inland mode 1 3 consistent with the patterns shown in fig 4 table 1 indicates that the leading eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation represent a northern inland mode for boreal summer season and a southern coastal mode in winter season in addition more spatial homogeneity exists in both leading rx5day and total precipitation modes during the summer than in other seasons summer patterns are characterized by more widespread coherent precipitation while in the winter season the only leading mode of rx5day precipitation shows nationwide spatial homogeneity the total spatiotemporal variance related to the two leading eots varies as a function of months table 1 shows that the spatiotemporal variance related to each rx5day total eot mode ranges from 0 42 to 0 62 0 49 0 68 for each first eot mode while that for eot2 decreases on average to 0 14 at each month explained variance for the leading eots for total precipitation is higher than that associated with the first rx5day precipitation eots in all months due to the fact that total variables are more likely to be characterized by spatially homogeneous features as opposed to rx5day variables having more spatial incoherence king et al 2014 temporal behavior is now diagnosed for each of the eot modes of rx5day and total precipitation using moving average line employed by kim et al 2004 who defined temporal evolution of decomposed precipitation time series as increasing trend decreasing trend and decadal variability based on 5 year running mean plots also in order to investigate the statistically significant trends in the precipitation eot time series data the non parametric mann kendall mk test and linear regression analysis are employed for the leading eot modes considering the tests are simple and robust and can cope with missing values and values below a detection limit fig 4 lower panels indicates time series for the leading two modes and table 1 summarizes behavior for all modes for the rx5day precipitation eot modes the temporal cycle showed four increasing trends one decreasing trends and eight decadal variabilities the total precipitation eot time series show eleven notable temporal patterns including two increasing trends two decreasing trends and seven decadal variabilities the temporal evolution of the leading eot modes indicates increasing trends during summer season and primarily a decadal oscillation for winter season specifically the mk test statistic and p value of summer rx5day eot time series are 7 43 and 0 037at the 0 05 significance level and the regression coefficient of the best fitted linear model and r squared value are 0 036 and 0 89 also the mk test statistic and p value of summer total eot time series are 5 25 and 0 041at the 0 05 significance level and the regression coefficient and r squared value are 0 027 and 0 65 4 2 teleconnections between eots and cis eot modes were correlated with six climate indices representing spatially and temporally significant variability we mainly discuss outcomes involving rx5day precipitation eots except where total precipitation eots show noticeably different results compared to those of rx5day precipitation eots the correlation coefficients of each eot with six cis are shown for rx5day and total precipitation in table 2 in addition regression maps for ncep ncar reanalysis mslp and ersst v4 sst are shown in fig 5 for eot 1 during december and maps for other modes are also discussed many regression maps indicate notable signals consistent with the large scale spatial patterns reported in other studies the correlation coefficients for eot 1 and eot 2 versus the oni mei and soi are shown in table 2 and fig 6 the oni time series has significant negative correlations with the leading eots for rx5day precipitation in june and september whereas the leading eots for november and december exhibit positive correlations with the tropical pacific sst the mei correlations are similar to the results of oni related eot signals the soi exhibits positive correlations with the leading rx5day eots during summer season june while in the winter season december the first eot shows significant negative correlations with the soi also the correlations are weaker in warm season than in cold season because the enso phenomena are generally not yet in their mature phase or are already in their decay phase in addition to the leading eots the other lower order eots show relatively significant correlations in some months with enso indices in eastern and southern coastal areas of the korean peninsula the findings from the above correlation analysis suggest that the el niño la niña events make conditions more favorable for above below normal rx5day precipitation in northern inland and southern coastal areas of the korean peninsula the total precipitation eots also have significant correlations with enso indicators the oni mei and soi show slightly higher correlation coefficients with the rx5day precipitation eots compared with the eot modes for total precipitation but both correlation results show a similar seasonal cycle the linkages between the precipitation eot modes and the enso indicators can also be identified through regression analysis as shown in fig 5 positive eot precipitation modes exhibit an sst anomaly pattern consistent with a typical enso sst warm event consisting of warmer sst anomalies over the central eastern tropical pacific and cooler sst anomalies in the western equatorial pacific ocean fig 5a and b above normal signals in many rx5day and total precipitation eots are closely related to enso like sst patterns in addition to the tropical pacific sst pattern regressing mslp onto the first eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation fig 5c and d describes similar enso like slp patterns with higher pressure in the western north pacific and lower pressure in the eastern north pacific region this pattern reflects the pacific east asian teleconnection pea pattern which represents a damping of the east asian winter monsoon induced by a western north pacific anticyclone and enso warm phases over the eastern equatorial pacific ocean wang et al 2000 this phase of the pea teleconnection preferentially modulates rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula during enso events the iod is also associated with rx5day and total precipitation variability in the korean peninsula as shown in table 2 the leading rx5day precipitation eot modes are significantly correlated with the iod as quantified by the dmi index representing the anomalous sst gradient between the western and eastern tropical indian ocean the iod time series has significant negative correlations with the leading eots for rx5day precipitation in september while the leading eots for november exhibit positive correlations with the tropical indian ocean sst the total precipitation eot modes also demonstrate a similar correlation with the dmi in september and november the partial correlation of the dmi index against the eot modes was also examined to rule out that the iod was influencing korean precipitation only because of its covariability with enso however the resultant numbers of significant relationships are similar to the above result providing confidence that the iod influences korean precipitation in a manner independent of enso as reported by saji et al 1999 the correlation coefficient of monsoon circulation activity with each eot was calculated using the wnpmi index from the results of correlation analysis in table 2 the leading eots for rx5day and total precipitation exhibit significant negative correlations with the monsoon variability over the wnp region during november and december in the positive wnpmi phase anomalous cyclones are reinforced in the wnp area due to the intensification of wnp monsoon trough which is caused by the strengthening of westerlies over the u850 1 region in fig 2 from the philippine sea to the indochina peninsula and the enhancement of easterlies in the u850 2 region over the southern flank of the wnp subtropical high this positive wnpmi phase has an effect on drier than average precipitation anomaly in korean peninsula on the contrary the negative wnpmi phase is associated with the reinforced anomalous anticyclones in the wnp area due to the suppression of the monsoon trough which is caused by the weakening of westerlies over the u850 1 region and easterlies in the u850 2 region the wetter than average precipitation anomaly in november and december is attributed to the negative wnpmi phase the leading eots for total precipitation also show similarly significant correlation with the monsoon variability the monsoon indices show somewhat lower correlations with the leading eot modes for rx5day precipitation than those for total precipitation but exhibit a similar temporal pattern the monthly tci indices were calculated for the index area to the south part of the korean peninsula fig 2 each tci is correlated with the eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation from may to november as shown in table 2 five eots show the significant correlation with the tci time series indicating that increased and decreased frequency of tropical cyclones passing through the index area is associated with enhanced and suppressed precipitation the leading eots for september and october precipitation exhibit the strongest positive correlation with the tropical cyclone variability this indicates that the leading eot in fall season located in eastern coastal area over the korea peninsula show significant positive correlation with the tci the general results from the above analysis are consistent with the findings investigated by cha 2007 resulting in the significant correlation between tropical cyclones and seasonal precipitation patterns over the korean peninsula 4 3 predictability of precipitation patterns in addition to expanding our understanding of how cis affect korean precipitation variability it is also of great importance to improve prediction capability of this variability the previous correlation analysis did not take into account any time lag between the eot time series for rx5day and total precipitation and various cis if the cis applied here have a significant impact on the precipitation anomaly over the korean peninsula then it is worthwhile to quantify the degree of this influence by a time dependent cross correlation analysis between the two time series that would be useful for forecasting purposes to do this we correlated the monthly eots for the rx5day and total precipitation with cis at monthly time lags of lag 0 month to lag 17 months where the eots are lagging the cis the motivation to focus on the monthly time lag e g a time interval of 0 to 17 months is based on the fact that the climate signals used here are slowly evolving and this low frequency behavior may provide substantial value as a long range predictor the results of this analysis are presented in table 3 as the cross correlation coefficient values the overall correlation coefficients are calculated at 0 01 0 05 and 0 10 significance levels for better comparison the cross correlation coefficient between enso and each eot was computed for the oni the mei and the soi as shown in table 3 the december eot 1 exhibits significant positive correlations with the oni time series up to the preceding june while the september eot 1 exhibits the negative correlations with the oni up to the preceding june the cross correlation coefficient for the mei time series provides qualitatively consistent behavior consistent with the above results the december eot 1 exhibits significant negative correlations with the soi time series up to the preceding august whereas the first eot in september shows a positive correlation with the soi up to the preceding july no significant correlation for the enso signal was detected during january to july reflecting the fact that relationships between the enso indicators and each eot mode are generally not prominent at this time of year the outcomes from the cross correlation analysis above indicate that the teleconnected effects of the enso phenomena on the leading modes of rx5day precipitation in the korean peninsula are detectable at up to six month lead time additionally the leading eots for total precipitation also show significant lagged correlation with enso remote forcing as shown in table 3 the oni mei and soi from june to september august to december have significant negative positive correlations with the leading eot for total precipitation in september december these cis show slightly higher correlation coefficients with the rx5day precipitation eots compared with the eot modes for total precipitation but both correlation results show a similar seasonal cycle the above findings are consistent with the results reported by lee and julien 2017 who showed that the enso related teleconnections to korea resulted in drier than normal conditions during fall and wetter than normal conditions in winter season also the non linear precipitation response to enso in this study is similar to that found in australia as described in king et al 2014 power et al 2006 and cai et al 2011 the iod is also associated with rx5day and total precipitation variability in the korean peninsula in table 3 the iod from june to september has the negative correlations with the leading eot for rx5day and total precipitation in september while the leading eot modes for november precipitation show the positive correlation with september to november dmi indices these findings show lower potential for predictability of the rx5day and total precipitation in association with the iod indicators compared to those of enso indices reflecting the fact that the far reaching effects of the indian ocean ssts on the east asian climate variability are not strong compared to that of the pacific ocean sst due to their locations farther west over south asia in addition to the cross correlation analysis the pacific ocean ssts based on the ersst v4 dataset are regressed onto the eots with varying lead times to identify potential sources of predictability for monthly rx5day and total precipitation as shown in the figs 7 and 8 the above lag regressions of the pacific ocean ssts onto september and december eot 1 modes for rx5day and total precipitation demonstrate that the leading eots show notable lagged and concurrent regression with strong enso signals over the equatorial pacific the december lag regression suggests noticeable predictability from the tropical pacific ocean sst with positive regression coefficients decreasing as the lag increases the lagged regression signals continue until months prior to june at lag 6 and then the pacific sst related precipitation signals diminish the september lag 0 to lag 3 regression representing regression june to september ssts onto september eot 1 indicates a negative correlation with tropical pacific cold tongue ssts the negative signals extend to months prior to june at lag 3 and then do not exhibit substantial amplitude during january to may lag regression maps indicate coherent pacific ocean sst variability related to eots of korean precipitation despite noise in the sst precipitation relationship the sources identified above may provide promise to improve prediction of monthly precipitation variations over the korean peninsula in december for extreme high and low precipitation there is a different tendency in the enso precipitation relationship the lagged and concurrent sst regression onto the leading eot 1 for extreme high and low precipitation anomalies in december account for the aforementioned different tendency as shown in figs 9 and 10 these lag regression maps show that the regression coefficients of very wet extremes in december from pacific ssts are more evident than that of very dry december extremes the lower predictability of january april leading eots is attributed to weaker sst precipitation relationships in this time of year consequently these findings of the potential sources of climate predictability indicate important implications for the seasonal forecasting the major hydrologic extremes such as flood and drought events 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal variability of precipitation the spatiotemporal evolution of the leading eot modes exhibits increasing trends during summer season and decadal variability for winter season ho et al 2003 investigated long term temporal change in the korean peninsula by examining daily precipitation data over a period of 48 years from 1954 to 2001 and showed gradual increasing trend with time due to more frequent occurrences of extreme precipitation and increased cumulative precipitation also in the superensemble prediction analysis kim et al 2004 revealed that the time coefficients of the first two leading modes over the korean peninsula exhibit significant decadal temporal cycles in winter precipitation patterns these results are consistent with the outcomes of the current study that shows similar responses in korean precipitation associated with tropical enso forcing however visual inspection of the station location maps in previous papers indicates that the significant relationships over the korean peninsula were not sufficiently resolved due to the data coverage limitations our study resolves these issues through use of a high quality high resolution korean surface dataset and also provides additional information on the ci precipitation linkage over east asia which was not identified in previous studies 5 2 teleconnection and predictability of eots and cis the eot decomposition and cross correlation analyses described in the previous section demonstrate that leading mode of september precipitation has a negative correlation with the tropical thermal forcing over the pacific ocean while that of december precipitation shows a positive correlation with the tropical pacific sst variability in other words during the warm enso years below normal precipitation anomalies are observed in september while above normal precipitation departures are observed in december for the cold enso years the opposite is true fig 11 illustrates the comparison of standardized indices for below above normal precipitation in september and above below normal precipitation in december during the warm cold event years using the monthly precipitation data for both northern inland mode and southern coastal mode the scatterplots for the warm phase are mostly distributed in the upper left part of the plot while those for the cold phase are oppositely distributed in lower right part these notable patterns for monthly precipitation data suggest that september and december are characterized by opposite signed tendency for an enso event of a given sign what causes the anomalous precipitation over the korean peninsula is explained by circulation anomalies associated with enso forcing based on composite difference of circulation fields northerly wind cut off the moisture supply from equator towards the korean peninsula resulting in below normal precipitation activity in addition the decline in september precipitation is caused by the depression of the second rainy period by reduction of the tropical storms and typhoons over east asia during the warm phase years while increase of precipitation in september of the cold phase years is in association with the intensification of the second rainy period resulting from more frequent occurrences of tropical cyclones on the other hand in november and december anomalous southwesterly wind prevails over the korean peninsula and the northwestern part of the philippine sea anticyclone reflecting damping phases of east asia winter monsoon or a warmer than normal in winter the anomalous southerly wind transports moist and warm air toward the korean peninsula this northward transport is attributed to a wetter than normal climate over the korean peninsula the positive dipole mode of indian ocean favor heavy snow and lower surface temperature over the northern part of the korean peninsula in eastern eurasia kripalani et al 2010 the northerly winds are anomalously strong over that region and bring dry and cold air from the high latitudes to the korean peninsula thus the weak anomalous southerlies and the strong anomalous northerlies cut off the warm moisture supply towards the korean peninsula causing below normal precipitation activity in contrast the north pacific subtropical high is slightly displaced north westward in november southerly wind brings warm and wet air from the equator to the korean peninsula thus the strong anomalous southerlies will modulate the moisture supply towards the korean peninsula leading to above normal precipitation activity 5 3 comparison with previous studies the overall results of the analyses presented here are in general agreement with those of other recent studies from the viewpoint of positive negative response during winter fall season regarding the climatic impacts of the extreme phase of enso on hydroclimatic variables over the korean peninsula cha 2007 examined the teleconnection between the remote enso forcing and korean climate such as precipitation atmospheric circulation temperature and so on and revealed that the tropical enso forcing has a dominant impact on fluctuation of seasonal precipitation over south korea modulating enhancement suppression of its magnitude in addition from a viewpoint of enso precipitation signal seasons illustrated in the cross correlation analysis for the leading modes of the rx5day and total precipitation the drier period of september is fairly coincident with the finding by shin 2002 representing the suppression of early fall precipitation during the warm extreme event years therefore it is apparent that the findings from this study are considered as an additional confirmation of aforementioned climatic far reaching effects of the large scale cis on korean precipitation variability which indicate drier wetter conditions in early fall of the warm cold episode years and wetter drier conditions in winter of the extreme event years consequently in the light of the preceding discussions the overall outcomes from the present analyses provide further confirmative evidence of the significant climatic teleconnection between the large scale cis and hydroclimatic variability over midlatitude 6 conclusions in the current study we apply an empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot decomposition technique to rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula to quantify the remote impacts of large scale modes of climate variability as quantified through climate indices cis we demonstrated the potential for prediction of these precipitation patterns based on knowledge of monthly tropical sst fields using cross correlation and lag regression analyses for the leading eot modes and enso and iod indicators the spatiotemporal features of rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula are dominated by a northern inland mode during summer and southern coastal mode in winter the temporal evolution of the leading eot modes exhibits an increasing trend during summer and an interdecadal oscillation for winter season both leading rx5day and total precipitation modes show notable spatial homogeneity across the korean peninsula during the summer seasons with widespread coherent precipitation patterns while in the winter season the only leading rx5day eot shows nationwide spatial homogeneity the leading total precipitation eot modes explain more of the variance in korean precipitation variability than the leading rx5day eot modes the oni and mei time series that explain tropical pacific enso variability have significant negative correlations with the leading eots of rx5day precipitation in june and september whereas the leading eots for november and december exhibit positive correlations with the oni and mei time series consistent with these results the soi shows significant positive negative correlations with the first eot mode for rx5day precipitation during the boreal summer winter the three enso indicators generally show slightly higher correlation coefficients with the rx5day precipitation eots compared with the eot modes for total precipitation but both correlation results show a similar seasonal cycle the leading and second eot modes of rx5day and total precipitation are significantly positively correlated with the boreal fall iod as quantified by the dmi index while the two modes show a negative correlation with indian ocean sst anomalies in boreal winter the leading eots for rx5day and total precipitation also exhibit a significant positive correlation with an index of monsoon variability over the wnp region during november to december the leading eots for september and october precipitation exhibit the strongest positive correlation with the tropical cyclone variability from the results of cross correlation and lag regression analyses the leading eots for september and december rx5day precipitation have predictability up to six months lead time from tropical pacific ssts while a weak predictable response from indian ocean ssts was detected at longer lead time also the regression coefficients of the tropical pacific ssts onto very wet extremes in december are more evident than that for very dry december extremes

assistance of alessio domeneghetti associate editor spatiotemporal variability teleconnection and predictability of the korean precipitation related to large scale climate indices were examined based on leading patterns of observed monthly rx5day and total precipitation through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot cross correlation and lag regression analyses for the leading modes and global atmospheric circulation dataset were employed on a monthly basis the spatial pattern of the leading eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation represents a northern inland mode for boreal summer and a southern coastal mode in boreal winter the temporal evolution of the leading eot modes exhibits increasing trends during summer season and decadal variability for winter season the leading eot patterns of rx5day precipitation show more widespread coherent patterns than those of total precipitation during warm and cold seasons while the former explains less variance in precipitation variability than the latter the tropical enso forcing has a coherent teleconnection with september and november december precipitation patterns while the indian ocean dipole is identified as a driver for precipitation variability in september and november the monsoon circulation over the western north pacific also exhibits a significant negative correlation with winter precipitation eots while tropical cyclone indices are positively correlated with the fall precipitation eots the leading patterns of the september and december rx5day precipitation time series are predictable at up to six month lead time from the tropical pacific sea surface temperatures ssts while a somewhat weak predictable response from indian ocean ssts was only detected at longer lead times in addition predictability from the pacific ssts for above normal precipitation is greater than that for below normal precipitation keywords precipitation variability teleconnection el niño southern oscillation 1 introduction deciphering the physical mechanisms through which the large scale climate phenomena affect hydroclimatic processes is of great interest the korean peninsula experiences a large degree of spatiotemporal precipitation variability precipitation varies with fluctuation of various global regional scale climate indices cis including the el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod western north pacific monsoon and tropical cyclone activity these large scale climate indicators have been extensively studied because the extreme phases of these indicators can produce major hydrologic extremes of floods and droughts in many regions all over the globe in global and regional scale studies significant relationships have been reported between the large scale cis and hydro meteorological variables such as precipitation temperature and streamflow in the tropics and extratropics the effects of the enso on precipitation variability on a global and regional scale have been widely documented since the first investigation of walker 1923 on the influence of the southern oscillation so on rainfall fluctuations in indian monsoon many recent global scale studies have documented climatic links between enso tropical ocean sea surface temperature variability and global precipitation anomaly patterns e g bradley et al 1987 kiladis and diaz 1989 ropelewski and halpert 1989 in addition regional scale studies in low and middle latitudes e g douglas and englehart 1981 shukla and paolino 1983 kahya and dracup 1994 rasmusson and wallace 1983 redmond and koch 1991 price et al 1998 kug et al 2010 yeh et al 2017 mehr et al 2017 nourani et al 2017 and degefu and bewket 2017 have revealed statistically significant correlations between regional precipitation and enso forcing douglas and englehart 1981 revealed that the southeastern united states has a tendency for positive winter precipitation anomalies for the warm phase of enso event karabörk and kahya 2003 investigated the statistically significant correlation between two opposite phases of enso and precipitation patterns over turkey using harmonic analysis and showed the mid latitude precipitation responses to the enso forcing are detectable in the climate of two core regions in turkey the iod is considered one of the key cis of precipitation variability in the indian and pacific rim countries some studies of iod have noted the distinct behavior of the iod related precipitation anomalies relative to enso and other phenomena since saji et al 1999 reported a dipole mode of the indian ocean influencing precipitation fluctuations ashok et al 2001 2003 revealed that a significant statistical relationship exists between the iod and the indian monsoon precipitation variability as well as examined the remote response of australian precipitation anomalies in winter to the iod through an atmospheric general circulation model agcm the monsoon activity could also be considered as a ci for precipitation variability in the indian and pacific rim countries wang et al 2008 performed a comparative analysis on pros and cons of 25 existing east asian monsoon indicators from a viewpoint of interannual variabilities of precipitation and circulation suggested a new index extracted by principal component analysis and then stressed the important role of the precipitation during the mei yu season in quantifying the intensity of the east asian monsoon activity several recent studies for the korean peninsula have also suggested statistically significant responses of precipitation variability to large scale cis lee and julien 2015 2016 revealed that cold and warm enso phases are the dominant drivers of precipitation and temperature fluctuations over the korean peninsula based on harmonic and lag correlation analysis in the study on prediction of korean precipitation variability using the downscaling super ensemble method kim et al 2004 suggested that during winter precipitation variability is correlated with the second empirical orthogonal function eof mode of sea level pressure slp over east asia modulating moist flow from the western north pacific wnp and highlighted enhanced climatic response of the east asian monsoon activity to precipitation anomalies in winter moon et al 2005 examined the climatic links between seasonal precipitation and global sea surface temperature sst based on the principal components extracted by independent component analysis combined with wavelet transform they noted interannual inderdecadal variation and increasing trend during the spring and summer seasons showing the consistent precipitation related sst signals over indian and pacific oceans cha 2007 investigated the relationship between enso and iod mode events and the impacts of these two phenomena on the precipitation of the korean peninsula and indicated that the distribution of the indian ocean sst represents the southern and northern oscillation in enso year and eastern and western in iod year with above normal precipitation departure in both summer and winter seasons also kim et al 2012 carried out an exploratory analysis on the correlation of the pacific japan pattern with typhoon activity associated with extreme precipitation variability for all river basins in korea and revealed that the tropical cyclone tc activity occurs more frequently during positive pacific japan pj phase years than negative phase years as described above almost all aforementioned regional and global approaches concentrate on monthly or seasonal mean based precipitation variations and relatively little attention has been given to the far reaching effects of climate indicators on extreme precipitation variability since localized and intensified extreme precipitation events have a critical effect on people s livelihood and the environment understanding the underlying regional impacts of various climate indicators on extreme precipitation may provide a promising way to predict and respond unexpected natural hazards also the previous studies have focused mostly on the global scale remote influences of large scale modes of climate variability through perturbations to the large scale ocean atmospheric circulation and less on the influence of both global and regional cis on regional and local scale precipitation hence there has been less focus in the literature concerning the climate impacts of both global and regional cis on precipitation variability however the influence of cis on the east asian climatology is not limited to the global scale remote cis highlighting a gap in knowledge that requires the need for more information about the overall features of the hydrometeorological impacts modulated by various cis thus it is necessary to investigate systematically how both global and regional cis affect extreme and total precipitation variability in east asian regions in the super ensemble prediction analysis kim et al 2004 revealed strong and consistent climatic link between monsoon activity and korean precipitation variability from the visual inspection of the station location map in their papers a significant ci precipitation relationship over east asia cannot be completely discerned because of station coverage limitations in the present study we are motivated to expand on previous work by diagnosing the influences of global and regional cis on precipitation variability over the korean peninsula using an expanded surface dataset that can resolve local and regional features in this study for the purpose of investigating spatiotemporal patterns of rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula we employed empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot decomposition technique rather than the classical approach by empirical orthogonal function eof analysis because eots provide a straightforward interpretation of patterns within data with a minimum of computation king et al 2014 examined australian monthly precipitation variability through eot decomposition analysis and found that the first december eot mode shows notable predictability up to several month one year in advance given knowledge of tropical pacific ocean indian ocean sst also in a diagnostic study to understand the physical mechanism behind the effects of large scale climate indices on precipitation patterns in queensland australia klingaman et al 2013 used eot decomposition to identify remote and local drivers affecting the inter annual and decadal variability of seasonal precipitation patterns the present study mainly aims to investigate the spatial pattern and temporal behavior of rx5day and total precipitation anomalies over the korean peninsula through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot decomposition method van den dool et al 2000 to identify significant teleconnections between these leading eot modes of korean precipitation variability and climate indicators that represent large scale climate fluctuations and regional synoptic circulations and to demonstrate the predictability of rx5day and total precipitation patterns through knowledge of sea surface temperature sst anomalies using regression of the eot modes onto the sst fields at varying lead times 2 data the monthly precipitation gridded dataset was derived from station based observed precipitation data covering the entire korean peninsula the observational data were obtained from korea meteorological administration kma an affiliated organization of the ministry of environment moe the total precipitation timeseries cover more than 20 enso events spanning the time period 1904 through 2015 the observational records are selected only if they have less than a month missing data and each monthly precipitation data record is required to cover at least 43 years of observation between the years 1973 and 2015 thus spanning at least 10 enso episodes using these criteria 60 stations were used in our analysis as shown in fig 1 in order to estimate high resolution precipitation with a regular spaced grid the parameter elevation regression on independent slope model prism developed by daly et al 1994 2008 was employed for the observational precipitation data prism method is well suited to regions with mountainous terrain because it incorporates a conceptual framework that addresses the spatial scale and pattern of orographic precipitation using geographic information of the elevation distance topographic facet and coastal proximity daly et al 2008 this model is an independent model for each target grid which can estimate target grid value by weighting each station differently based on the similarity in elevation distance topographic facet and coastal proximity between observational station and target grid using this method we produced grid data 0 25 0 25 27 7 km 22 2 km of rx5day and total precipitation on a monthly basis from 1973 to 2015 for comparative analysis between large scale climate indicators and precipitation eot patterns several cis were applied in this present study taking into account both atmospheric and oceanic fluctuations we employed the oceanic niño index oni and the multivariate enso index as indicators for tropical enso forcing in addition to the soi that is widely used in atmospheric circulation analysis the oni is one of the main indicators for monitoring the tropical enso phenomena the positive phase of enso is represented by the condition that the oni index exceeds 0 5 while the negative phase of enso is represented when the oni index is less than 0 5 the oni is extracted by calculating the moving average of consecutive 3 month ssts over the east central pacific ocean also known as niño 3 4 index area of 120 170 w and 5 s 5 n the monthly oni time series applied in this analysis was derived from the sst dataset of the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc the multivariate enso index mei is derived from the leading modes calculated by unrotated decomposition technique for several air sea variables over the tropical pacific ocean including sst sea level pressure slp surface air temperature cloudiness fraction and zonal meridional surface wind noaa earth system research laboratory physical sciences division because it integrated both atmospheric and oceanic factors related to enso the mei may be considered as a better indicator of enso relative to other single variable cis in this analysis we employed the standardized bimonthly mei values regularly updated by the climate diagnostic center cdc that start in december 1949 january 1950 the soi as an atmospheric pressure based climate indicator is usually computed using the darwin tahiti mean sea level pressure mslp difference based on standardized darwin slps and standardized tahiti slps in the present analysis we used the dataset of soi calculated by the noaa climate prediction center unlike the oni and mei the positive phase of the soi represents la niña like conditions as an indicator of the iod we employ the dipole mode index dmi computed by the empirical approach by saji et al 1999 this index that we obtain from the noaa climate prediction center represents the magnitude of the anomalous sst gradient from the southeastern 90 110 e 10 s 0 to the western 50 70 e 10 s 10 n near equatorial indian ocean and is derived from the hadley centre global sea ice and sst hadisst dataset in the current analysis the dmi index was employed in cross correlation analysis as well as partial correlation analysis with the eot time series to remove the linear influence of the enso forcing on precipitation variability to examine the relationship between the previously introduced cis and the eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation we employ sst and atmospheric circulation datasets for sst data the extended reconstructed sst ersst v4 datasets huang et al 2014 are used in this study the ersst is a global monthly sst dataset calculated based on the international comprehensive ocean and atmosphere dataset icoads which is widely used in global and regional scale studies it is provided on a 2 0 2 0 grid that uses statistical techniques to provide global coverage and spans the period from january 1854 to the present the global atmospheric circulation fields are obtained from the reanalysis derived from the joint project of the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar which are available on noaa earth system research laboratory physical sciences division this dataset is continually updated to produce fields on a 2 5 2 5 grid using a state of the art numerical modeling system for prediction and data assimilation with continuously entrained observations the monthly ncep ncar reanalysis dataset is available for the period from 1948 to present links between precipitation eots and monsoon circulation variability are investigated using the wnpmi index over western north pacific using the methodological approach in wang et al 2008 the wnpmi index is calculated based on the difference between 850 hpa zonal winds u850 in the region 5 15 n 100 130 e and the region 20 30 n 110 140 e the former region represents the intensity of the monsoon westerlies from indochina peninsula to the philippines while the latter indicates the magnitude of the easterlies over the southeastern part of the wnp subtropical anticyclone the monthly tropical cyclone index tci quantifying the tropical cyclone activity is calculated based on the tropical cyclone tracks recorded by the ibtracs knapp et al 2010 and the national typhoon center ntc of kma for the period from 1973 through 2015 the tci is obtained from the frequency of tropical cyclones passing through the index area as shown in fig 2 3 eot and statistical analysis the general methodology used in this present analysis which follows the comprehensive empirical approach by van den dool et al 2000 can be briefly summarized in fig 3 and is described in more detail below the first step is to convert the original data to a monthly time series i e transformation of precipitation time series into standardized precipitation index spi for rx5day and total precipitation then eot techniques are performed for identification of the spatiotemporal variability of rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula the next step is to conduct both cross correlation and linear regression analyses to quantify the teleconnection between global and regional cis and leading eot precipitation modes the final step is to perform a lag regression analysis using the regression of sst data onto empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot modes with varying lead times to examine the potential predictability of rx5day and total korean precipitation relative to pacific tropical thermal forcing in this present analysis rx5day precipitation time series are generated following the recommendation of the climatic variability and predictability cci clivar panel the monthly highest five consecutive day precipitation is employed to define rx5day precipitation during the period from 1973 to 2015 the monthly rx5day and total precipitation time series are calculated for each station prior to the eot analysis to examine the ci precipitation teleconnection we converted the precipitation data to a spi formulated for effective assessment of wet and dry condition eot analysis decomposes a spi dataset with spatiotemporal variability into a set of orthogonal components namely eot patterns the first eot spatial modes are obtained by finding the point with the highest sum in explained variance of all other points which is designated as a base point by van den dool et al 2000 then the precipitation time series of the base point is defined as the first temporal mode of the precipitation pattern the second eot spatial modes are extracted by removing the influence of the base point on all other points using regression analysis for precipitation time series of the base point and all other points from this modified precipitation dataset the second base point is identified by detecting the point explaining the most variance of the residual precipitation record this procedure is repeated for subsequent modes until the desired number of modes is derived the following mathematical expressions of eot procedure are based on van den dool et al 2000 after detecting the base point s b 1 in space that explains the maximum possible variance at all other points its associated spatial mode e 1 s is defined as the first eot the temporal mode α 1 t associated with eot 1 is simply the original time series for its base point after extracting eot 1 the data are split into a portion of which variance is explained p e s t and a residual p r s t as follows p e s t α 1 t e 1 s p r s t p s t p e s t where α 1 t p s b 1 t e 1 s 1 n t t 1 nt p s t p s b 1 t 1 n t t 1 nt p s t 2 1 n t t 1 nt p s b 1 t 2 1 n t t 1 nt p s t 2 1 n t t 1 nt p s b 1 t 2 after dividing the data into explained and residual portions the procedure is repeated using the once reduced data the point in space that explains the most variance at all other points in p r s t becomes the base point for eot 2 the time series connected with eot 2 is represented by the series at its base point in the once reduced data after removing the variance explained by eot 2 from the data set the process is repeated again and so on until all of the domain variance in the original data is explained p e s t grows at the expense of p r s t reordering the variance in the original data as eot modes the total variance t v in the data is expressed by tv 1 n t n s t 1 n t s 1 n s p s t 2 where n t and n s is the numbers of points in time and space the amount of variance explained by a particular eot is related to the fraction of its explained variance e v to the total domain variance ev 1 n t n s t 1 n t s 1 n s p e s t 2 tv in this analysis we employ the revised eot decomposition technique used by smith 2004 who used a base point selection procedure based on the explained variance for the entire domain weighted dataset instead of the highest sum in explained variance of all other points due to the regional biases the first two eot modes were selected as leading patterns of rx5day and total precipitation variability since the subsequent eots after the first two eot calculations explain less than 5 of the variance following the procedure above eot 1 and eot 2 were obtained for monthly rx5day and total precipitation time series during 1973 2015 to investigate patterns of precipitation fluctuations across the korean peninsula due to the fact that eot decomposition technique is orthogonal in one either space or time while eof is orthogonal in both space and time eot method provides a potentially more intuitive interpretation of the resulting patterns following the approach by king et al 2014 correlation coefficients between the precipitation eot modes and six cis are calculated using spearman s correlation analysis with statistical significance assessed at the 5 level taking into account the fact that wmpmi and tci time series do not exhibit a normal distribution although the correlation analysis was performed by spearman s rank test the resultant correlation coefficients were in general agreement with those calculated by the commonly used pearson s correlation method not shown here the overall findings from correlation and regression analyses between precipitation eot modes and various cis are described using correlation and regression maps 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal structures of eots correlation maps for each eot associated with the highest value of explained variance for the domain weighted spi were plotted for each month the values displayed in these maps are the correlation coefficients between the precipitation eot time series at the base point and the precipitation time series at all other points each leading eot has the most explained variance for rx5day and total precipitation the spatial patterns of the leading eot base points and highest correlation values for each month reflect the climatological seasonal pattern of precipitation combined with the influence of midlatitude weather systems on the korean peninsula the second eot are also computed using the procedures discussed above fig 4 shows the resultant patterns for the leading two eots of july and december rx5day and total precipitation the base points of the first eots for rx5day and total precipitation show different locations with respect to months the locations of base points for rx5day precipitation are similar to those for total precipitation during the summer months in northern inland of the korean peninsula in the winter months the base points of leading eots for rx5day precipitation have a tendency to shift southward but more so for the total precipitation time series that shifts to the southernmost island in addition for entire months as shown in table 1 we categorized total eots into inland north south and coastal south east modes that take into account the locations of the base points the centers of the rx5day and total leading eot modes are located in coastal area 38 modes and inland area 10 modes overall the lower order eot modes show more variability in the locations of the base points locations of the base points indicate that out of twenty four rx5day total precipitation eots consisting of the leading two eots for each of twelve months 20 18 are identified as coastal modes and 4 6 are identified as inland modes as shown in table 1 breaking this into more detail the coastal mode consists of an east coast mode 8 8 and south coast mode 12 10 defined on the basis of the center of leading mode also the inland mode consists of the north inland mode 3 3 and south inland mode 1 3 consistent with the patterns shown in fig 4 table 1 indicates that the leading eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation represent a northern inland mode for boreal summer season and a southern coastal mode in winter season in addition more spatial homogeneity exists in both leading rx5day and total precipitation modes during the summer than in other seasons summer patterns are characterized by more widespread coherent precipitation while in the winter season the only leading mode of rx5day precipitation shows nationwide spatial homogeneity the total spatiotemporal variance related to the two leading eots varies as a function of months table 1 shows that the spatiotemporal variance related to each rx5day total eot mode ranges from 0 42 to 0 62 0 49 0 68 for each first eot mode while that for eot2 decreases on average to 0 14 at each month explained variance for the leading eots for total precipitation is higher than that associated with the first rx5day precipitation eots in all months due to the fact that total variables are more likely to be characterized by spatially homogeneous features as opposed to rx5day variables having more spatial incoherence king et al 2014 temporal behavior is now diagnosed for each of the eot modes of rx5day and total precipitation using moving average line employed by kim et al 2004 who defined temporal evolution of decomposed precipitation time series as increasing trend decreasing trend and decadal variability based on 5 year running mean plots also in order to investigate the statistically significant trends in the precipitation eot time series data the non parametric mann kendall mk test and linear regression analysis are employed for the leading eot modes considering the tests are simple and robust and can cope with missing values and values below a detection limit fig 4 lower panels indicates time series for the leading two modes and table 1 summarizes behavior for all modes for the rx5day precipitation eot modes the temporal cycle showed four increasing trends one decreasing trends and eight decadal variabilities the total precipitation eot time series show eleven notable temporal patterns including two increasing trends two decreasing trends and seven decadal variabilities the temporal evolution of the leading eot modes indicates increasing trends during summer season and primarily a decadal oscillation for winter season specifically the mk test statistic and p value of summer rx5day eot time series are 7 43 and 0 037at the 0 05 significance level and the regression coefficient of the best fitted linear model and r squared value are 0 036 and 0 89 also the mk test statistic and p value of summer total eot time series are 5 25 and 0 041at the 0 05 significance level and the regression coefficient and r squared value are 0 027 and 0 65 4 2 teleconnections between eots and cis eot modes were correlated with six climate indices representing spatially and temporally significant variability we mainly discuss outcomes involving rx5day precipitation eots except where total precipitation eots show noticeably different results compared to those of rx5day precipitation eots the correlation coefficients of each eot with six cis are shown for rx5day and total precipitation in table 2 in addition regression maps for ncep ncar reanalysis mslp and ersst v4 sst are shown in fig 5 for eot 1 during december and maps for other modes are also discussed many regression maps indicate notable signals consistent with the large scale spatial patterns reported in other studies the correlation coefficients for eot 1 and eot 2 versus the oni mei and soi are shown in table 2 and fig 6 the oni time series has significant negative correlations with the leading eots for rx5day precipitation in june and september whereas the leading eots for november and december exhibit positive correlations with the tropical pacific sst the mei correlations are similar to the results of oni related eot signals the soi exhibits positive correlations with the leading rx5day eots during summer season june while in the winter season december the first eot shows significant negative correlations with the soi also the correlations are weaker in warm season than in cold season because the enso phenomena are generally not yet in their mature phase or are already in their decay phase in addition to the leading eots the other lower order eots show relatively significant correlations in some months with enso indices in eastern and southern coastal areas of the korean peninsula the findings from the above correlation analysis suggest that the el niño la niña events make conditions more favorable for above below normal rx5day precipitation in northern inland and southern coastal areas of the korean peninsula the total precipitation eots also have significant correlations with enso indicators the oni mei and soi show slightly higher correlation coefficients with the rx5day precipitation eots compared with the eot modes for total precipitation but both correlation results show a similar seasonal cycle the linkages between the precipitation eot modes and the enso indicators can also be identified through regression analysis as shown in fig 5 positive eot precipitation modes exhibit an sst anomaly pattern consistent with a typical enso sst warm event consisting of warmer sst anomalies over the central eastern tropical pacific and cooler sst anomalies in the western equatorial pacific ocean fig 5a and b above normal signals in many rx5day and total precipitation eots are closely related to enso like sst patterns in addition to the tropical pacific sst pattern regressing mslp onto the first eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation fig 5c and d describes similar enso like slp patterns with higher pressure in the western north pacific and lower pressure in the eastern north pacific region this pattern reflects the pacific east asian teleconnection pea pattern which represents a damping of the east asian winter monsoon induced by a western north pacific anticyclone and enso warm phases over the eastern equatorial pacific ocean wang et al 2000 this phase of the pea teleconnection preferentially modulates rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula during enso events the iod is also associated with rx5day and total precipitation variability in the korean peninsula as shown in table 2 the leading rx5day precipitation eot modes are significantly correlated with the iod as quantified by the dmi index representing the anomalous sst gradient between the western and eastern tropical indian ocean the iod time series has significant negative correlations with the leading eots for rx5day precipitation in september while the leading eots for november exhibit positive correlations with the tropical indian ocean sst the total precipitation eot modes also demonstrate a similar correlation with the dmi in september and november the partial correlation of the dmi index against the eot modes was also examined to rule out that the iod was influencing korean precipitation only because of its covariability with enso however the resultant numbers of significant relationships are similar to the above result providing confidence that the iod influences korean precipitation in a manner independent of enso as reported by saji et al 1999 the correlation coefficient of monsoon circulation activity with each eot was calculated using the wnpmi index from the results of correlation analysis in table 2 the leading eots for rx5day and total precipitation exhibit significant negative correlations with the monsoon variability over the wnp region during november and december in the positive wnpmi phase anomalous cyclones are reinforced in the wnp area due to the intensification of wnp monsoon trough which is caused by the strengthening of westerlies over the u850 1 region in fig 2 from the philippine sea to the indochina peninsula and the enhancement of easterlies in the u850 2 region over the southern flank of the wnp subtropical high this positive wnpmi phase has an effect on drier than average precipitation anomaly in korean peninsula on the contrary the negative wnpmi phase is associated with the reinforced anomalous anticyclones in the wnp area due to the suppression of the monsoon trough which is caused by the weakening of westerlies over the u850 1 region and easterlies in the u850 2 region the wetter than average precipitation anomaly in november and december is attributed to the negative wnpmi phase the leading eots for total precipitation also show similarly significant correlation with the monsoon variability the monsoon indices show somewhat lower correlations with the leading eot modes for rx5day precipitation than those for total precipitation but exhibit a similar temporal pattern the monthly tci indices were calculated for the index area to the south part of the korean peninsula fig 2 each tci is correlated with the eot modes for rx5day and total precipitation from may to november as shown in table 2 five eots show the significant correlation with the tci time series indicating that increased and decreased frequency of tropical cyclones passing through the index area is associated with enhanced and suppressed precipitation the leading eots for september and october precipitation exhibit the strongest positive correlation with the tropical cyclone variability this indicates that the leading eot in fall season located in eastern coastal area over the korea peninsula show significant positive correlation with the tci the general results from the above analysis are consistent with the findings investigated by cha 2007 resulting in the significant correlation between tropical cyclones and seasonal precipitation patterns over the korean peninsula 4 3 predictability of precipitation patterns in addition to expanding our understanding of how cis affect korean precipitation variability it is also of great importance to improve prediction capability of this variability the previous correlation analysis did not take into account any time lag between the eot time series for rx5day and total precipitation and various cis if the cis applied here have a significant impact on the precipitation anomaly over the korean peninsula then it is worthwhile to quantify the degree of this influence by a time dependent cross correlation analysis between the two time series that would be useful for forecasting purposes to do this we correlated the monthly eots for the rx5day and total precipitation with cis at monthly time lags of lag 0 month to lag 17 months where the eots are lagging the cis the motivation to focus on the monthly time lag e g a time interval of 0 to 17 months is based on the fact that the climate signals used here are slowly evolving and this low frequency behavior may provide substantial value as a long range predictor the results of this analysis are presented in table 3 as the cross correlation coefficient values the overall correlation coefficients are calculated at 0 01 0 05 and 0 10 significance levels for better comparison the cross correlation coefficient between enso and each eot was computed for the oni the mei and the soi as shown in table 3 the december eot 1 exhibits significant positive correlations with the oni time series up to the preceding june while the september eot 1 exhibits the negative correlations with the oni up to the preceding june the cross correlation coefficient for the mei time series provides qualitatively consistent behavior consistent with the above results the december eot 1 exhibits significant negative correlations with the soi time series up to the preceding august whereas the first eot in september shows a positive correlation with the soi up to the preceding july no significant correlation for the enso signal was detected during january to july reflecting the fact that relationships between the enso indicators and each eot mode are generally not prominent at this time of year the outcomes from the cross correlation analysis above indicate that the teleconnected effects of the enso phenomena on the leading modes of rx5day precipitation in the korean peninsula are detectable at up to six month lead time additionally the leading eots for total precipitation also show significant lagged correlation with enso remote forcing as shown in table 3 the oni mei and soi from june to september august to december have significant negative positive correlations with the leading eot for total precipitation in september december these cis show slightly higher correlation coefficients with the rx5day precipitation eots compared with the eot modes for total precipitation but both correlation results show a similar seasonal cycle the above findings are consistent with the results reported by lee and julien 2017 who showed that the enso related teleconnections to korea resulted in drier than normal conditions during fall and wetter than normal conditions in winter season also the non linear precipitation response to enso in this study is similar to that found in australia as described in king et al 2014 power et al 2006 and cai et al 2011 the iod is also associated with rx5day and total precipitation variability in the korean peninsula in table 3 the iod from june to september has the negative correlations with the leading eot for rx5day and total precipitation in september while the leading eot modes for november precipitation show the positive correlation with september to november dmi indices these findings show lower potential for predictability of the rx5day and total precipitation in association with the iod indicators compared to those of enso indices reflecting the fact that the far reaching effects of the indian ocean ssts on the east asian climate variability are not strong compared to that of the pacific ocean sst due to their locations farther west over south asia in addition to the cross correlation analysis the pacific ocean ssts based on the ersst v4 dataset are regressed onto the eots with varying lead times to identify potential sources of predictability for monthly rx5day and total precipitation as shown in the figs 7 and 8 the above lag regressions of the pacific ocean ssts onto september and december eot 1 modes for rx5day and total precipitation demonstrate that the leading eots show notable lagged and concurrent regression with strong enso signals over the equatorial pacific the december lag regression suggests noticeable predictability from the tropical pacific ocean sst with positive regression coefficients decreasing as the lag increases the lagged regression signals continue until months prior to june at lag 6 and then the pacific sst related precipitation signals diminish the september lag 0 to lag 3 regression representing regression june to september ssts onto september eot 1 indicates a negative correlation with tropical pacific cold tongue ssts the negative signals extend to months prior to june at lag 3 and then do not exhibit substantial amplitude during january to may lag regression maps indicate coherent pacific ocean sst variability related to eots of korean precipitation despite noise in the sst precipitation relationship the sources identified above may provide promise to improve prediction of monthly precipitation variations over the korean peninsula in december for extreme high and low precipitation there is a different tendency in the enso precipitation relationship the lagged and concurrent sst regression onto the leading eot 1 for extreme high and low precipitation anomalies in december account for the aforementioned different tendency as shown in figs 9 and 10 these lag regression maps show that the regression coefficients of very wet extremes in december from pacific ssts are more evident than that of very dry december extremes the lower predictability of january april leading eots is attributed to weaker sst precipitation relationships in this time of year consequently these findings of the potential sources of climate predictability indicate important implications for the seasonal forecasting the major hydrologic extremes such as flood and drought events 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal variability of precipitation the spatiotemporal evolution of the leading eot modes exhibits increasing trends during summer season and decadal variability for winter season ho et al 2003 investigated long term temporal change in the korean peninsula by examining daily precipitation data over a period of 48 years from 1954 to 2001 and showed gradual increasing trend with time due to more frequent occurrences of extreme precipitation and increased cumulative precipitation also in the superensemble prediction analysis kim et al 2004 revealed that the time coefficients of the first two leading modes over the korean peninsula exhibit significant decadal temporal cycles in winter precipitation patterns these results are consistent with the outcomes of the current study that shows similar responses in korean precipitation associated with tropical enso forcing however visual inspection of the station location maps in previous papers indicates that the significant relationships over the korean peninsula were not sufficiently resolved due to the data coverage limitations our study resolves these issues through use of a high quality high resolution korean surface dataset and also provides additional information on the ci precipitation linkage over east asia which was not identified in previous studies 5 2 teleconnection and predictability of eots and cis the eot decomposition and cross correlation analyses described in the previous section demonstrate that leading mode of september precipitation has a negative correlation with the tropical thermal forcing over the pacific ocean while that of december precipitation shows a positive correlation with the tropical pacific sst variability in other words during the warm enso years below normal precipitation anomalies are observed in september while above normal precipitation departures are observed in december for the cold enso years the opposite is true fig 11 illustrates the comparison of standardized indices for below above normal precipitation in september and above below normal precipitation in december during the warm cold event years using the monthly precipitation data for both northern inland mode and southern coastal mode the scatterplots for the warm phase are mostly distributed in the upper left part of the plot while those for the cold phase are oppositely distributed in lower right part these notable patterns for monthly precipitation data suggest that september and december are characterized by opposite signed tendency for an enso event of a given sign what causes the anomalous precipitation over the korean peninsula is explained by circulation anomalies associated with enso forcing based on composite difference of circulation fields northerly wind cut off the moisture supply from equator towards the korean peninsula resulting in below normal precipitation activity in addition the decline in september precipitation is caused by the depression of the second rainy period by reduction of the tropical storms and typhoons over east asia during the warm phase years while increase of precipitation in september of the cold phase years is in association with the intensification of the second rainy period resulting from more frequent occurrences of tropical cyclones on the other hand in november and december anomalous southwesterly wind prevails over the korean peninsula and the northwestern part of the philippine sea anticyclone reflecting damping phases of east asia winter monsoon or a warmer than normal in winter the anomalous southerly wind transports moist and warm air toward the korean peninsula this northward transport is attributed to a wetter than normal climate over the korean peninsula the positive dipole mode of indian ocean favor heavy snow and lower surface temperature over the northern part of the korean peninsula in eastern eurasia kripalani et al 2010 the northerly winds are anomalously strong over that region and bring dry and cold air from the high latitudes to the korean peninsula thus the weak anomalous southerlies and the strong anomalous northerlies cut off the warm moisture supply towards the korean peninsula causing below normal precipitation activity in contrast the north pacific subtropical high is slightly displaced north westward in november southerly wind brings warm and wet air from the equator to the korean peninsula thus the strong anomalous southerlies will modulate the moisture supply towards the korean peninsula leading to above normal precipitation activity 5 3 comparison with previous studies the overall results of the analyses presented here are in general agreement with those of other recent studies from the viewpoint of positive negative response during winter fall season regarding the climatic impacts of the extreme phase of enso on hydroclimatic variables over the korean peninsula cha 2007 examined the teleconnection between the remote enso forcing and korean climate such as precipitation atmospheric circulation temperature and so on and revealed that the tropical enso forcing has a dominant impact on fluctuation of seasonal precipitation over south korea modulating enhancement suppression of its magnitude in addition from a viewpoint of enso precipitation signal seasons illustrated in the cross correlation analysis for the leading modes of the rx5day and total precipitation the drier period of september is fairly coincident with the finding by shin 2002 representing the suppression of early fall precipitation during the warm extreme event years therefore it is apparent that the findings from this study are considered as an additional confirmation of aforementioned climatic far reaching effects of the large scale cis on korean precipitation variability which indicate drier wetter conditions in early fall of the warm cold episode years and wetter drier conditions in winter of the extreme event years consequently in the light of the preceding discussions the overall outcomes from the present analyses provide further confirmative evidence of the significant climatic teleconnection between the large scale cis and hydroclimatic variability over midlatitude 6 conclusions in the current study we apply an empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot decomposition technique to rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula to quantify the remote impacts of large scale modes of climate variability as quantified through climate indices cis we demonstrated the potential for prediction of these precipitation patterns based on knowledge of monthly tropical sst fields using cross correlation and lag regression analyses for the leading eot modes and enso and iod indicators the spatiotemporal features of rx5day and total precipitation over the korean peninsula are dominated by a northern inland mode during summer and southern coastal mode in winter the temporal evolution of the leading eot modes exhibits an increasing trend during summer and an interdecadal oscillation for winter season both leading rx5day and total precipitation modes show notable spatial homogeneity across the korean peninsula during the summer seasons with widespread coherent precipitation patterns while in the winter season the only leading rx5day eot shows nationwide spatial homogeneity the leading total precipitation eot modes explain more of the variance in korean precipitation variability than the leading rx5day eot modes the oni and mei time series that explain tropical pacific enso variability have significant negative correlations with the leading eots of rx5day precipitation in june and september whereas the leading eots for november and december exhibit positive correlations with the oni and mei time series consistent with these results the soi shows significant positive negative correlations with the first eot mode for rx5day precipitation during the boreal summer winter the three enso indicators generally show slightly higher correlation coefficients with the rx5day precipitation eots compared with the eot modes for total precipitation but both correlation results show a similar seasonal cycle the leading and second eot modes of rx5day and total precipitation are significantly positively correlated with the boreal fall iod as quantified by the dmi index while the two modes show a negative correlation with indian ocean sst anomalies in boreal winter the leading eots for rx5day and total precipitation also exhibit a significant positive correlation with an index of monsoon variability over the wnp region during november to december the leading eots for september and october precipitation exhibit the strongest positive correlation with the tropical cyclone variability from the results of cross correlation and lag regression analyses the leading eots for september and december rx5day precipitation have predictability up to six months lead time from tropical pacific ssts while a weak predictable response from indian ocean ssts was detected at longer lead time also the regression coefficients of the tropical pacific ssts onto very wet extremes in december are more evident than that for very dry december extremes 
6797,operations of amount of large and medium reservoirs have remarkably changed runoff and sediment loads and consequently affected the fluvial processes intensively on the upper yellow river in this study time series of runoff and sediment transport rates of four major hydrological stations on the upper yellow river were used to analyze temporal and spatial variations of runoff and sediment loads mann kendall test and wavelet analysis were applied to analyze the datasets temporal variations in runoff and sediment loads were discerned in terms of changing trend abrupt change year and multi periods from the time series additionally a time series of runoffs was reconstructed based on a modeling scenario removing impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion to indicate the status without human disturbances comparison of the measured and reconstructed datasets was conducted to evaluate the impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion on hydrological variations the measured runoff and sediment loads showed obvious decreasing trends due to impoundment and water diversion however the reconstructed runoffs regarded as only affected by climate change showed no significant changing trend at a 95 confidence level confirming that instead of climate change human activities played the most important roles in variations the measured datasets indicated that the reservoir construction and operation caused an abrupt change in runoff in 1986 while the reconstructed datasets indicated another abrupt change in 1995 wavelet transform analysis distinguished the multi periodical features of the time series the first second and third dominant periodicities of the measured runoffs were 25 27 16 and 8 years respectively whereas the first three dominant periodicities of the reconstructed runoffs were 26 31 12 and 7 years respectively it was indicated that the high frequency periodicities of runoffs decreased while the low frequency periodicities increased owing to reservoir impoundment and water diversion keywords temporal variation runoff and sediment transport the upper yellow river abrupt change multiple periodical hydrological features 1 introduction rivers are efficient conveyors of water and sediment from headwaters to the sea williams 2012 in recent years studies of riverine sediment flux to oceans and their sediment transport processes have received greater attention related to climate change and human activities in river basins all over the world walling and fang 2003 syvitski et al 2005 wang et al 2007 consequently many large river deltas have retreated and their inhabitants have become increasingly vulnerable among world large rivers the yellow river provides an excellent illustration of the interactions among climate change extensive soil and water conservation hydropower development and sediment control measures walling 2006 flood vulnerable delta surface areas could increase more than 50 because of increased sediment trapping at upstream reservoirs and engineered floodplains combined with rising global sea level syvitski et al 2009 over the past 150 years the yellow river has been the most heavily loaded in the world creating the mega yellow river delta prograding into the epicontinental bohai sea however the delta has been starved and has retreated owing to the declining of water and sediment supply since 1995 wang et al 2007 the annual mean of sediment discharge has decreased from 1 6 billion tons yr to 10 million tons yr this has decreased riverine nutrients and total dissolved solids causing many aquatic ecosystems in the lower reaches and coastal regions to experience significant changes in biodiversity and biotic integrity chen et al 2005 quantitative analysis of the spatial and temporal variation of streamflow and sediment load provides a good reference for flood mitigation river channel stabilization and river basin and delta management zhao et al 2014 much attention has been paid to the middle reach of the loess plateau which is the source of nearly 90 of the aforementioned sediment load formerly sediment suspensions in the river s lower reaches triggered enormous flood catastrophes owing to the release of heavy sediment loads from the loess plateau wang et al 2016 comprehensive studies have analyzed variations in runoff and sediment loads in the middle and lower reaches wang et al 2016 showed that reduced sediment transport in the yellow river was caused by changes in water discharge and sediment concentration both influenced by regional climate changes and human activities over the loess plateau since the 1970s landscape engineering terracing and check dam and reservoir construction were the primary factors driving sediment reduction in addition large scale vegetation restoration projects have also reduced soil erosion since the 1990s yao et al 2017 apart from the major sediment yield region on the loess plateau the upper yellow river the main runoff producing region accounting for more than 50 of the total annual runoff has lost attention because fewer human activities have been performed there compared to the lower reach however the thirteen large and many more medium reservoirs have been constructed since 1960 on the stem and tributaries of the upper yellow river including the qingtongxia liujiaxia sanshenggong longyangxia etc the reservoirs are beneficial for irrigation and flood defense and they have changed the runoff and sediment loads to their downstream reaches impacting fluvial processes owing to reservoir operations on the upper yellow river upstream reservoirs have experienced sedimentation and bankfull discharges have decreased sharply since the 1990s shen et al 2007 simultaneously with recent land use changes and the implementation of water and soil conservation projects runoff and sediment loads have also dramatically decreased in the loess plateau the sediment load decreased by approximately 90 over the past 60 years wang et al 2016 all changes in the upper yellow river will eventually influence changes in the lower reaches facing this situation to help manage the river basin more attention should be given to figuring out how the discharges of water and sediment change the main runoff yield regions most of the earth s largest rivers suffer from anthropological disturbances our major concern is whether human activities play an important role in causing hydrological variations to large rivers the objectives of this study are to illustrate the inter annual and monthly variations in runoff and sediment loads in the upper yellow river and to reveal the impact of basin wide human activities e g dams and reservoirs soil conservation practices and water abstractions this study leverages datasets recorded at all gauging stations on the upper yellow river bwteen 1950 and 2014 we use the full descriptions of temporal and periodic variations of runoff and sediment loads additionally we discuss the effects of reservoirs and water diversions on the runoff and sediment load variations compared to between the measured time series of runoffs sediment transports and reconstructed data based on a modeling scenario removing the impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the upper yellow river from the ningxia province to the inner mongolia stretching about 1000 km from xiaheyan in the ningxia province to toudaoguai in inner mongolia fig 1 hydrological stations i e lanzhou xiaheyan qingtongxia shizuishan bayangaole sanhuhekou and toudaoguai have recorded discharges of water and sediments in the upper reach since 1950 the lanzhou station was the first hydrological station downstream of the liujiaxia dam thus its records help evaluate the dam effect and improve our analysis downstream of xiaheyan station the river flows to the northeast in the ordos plateau then it enters the yinchuan and hetao plains passing through the tengger desert hedong sandy ulan buh desert and the kubuqi desert ending at toudaoguai station large irrigation projects including the weining qingtongxia and hetao irrigations are located in this region they rely on water supplies from the upper yellow river 2 2 data we obtained continuous time series data of daily runoff and sediment loads of hydrological stations from the yellow river conservancy commission ministry of water resources china table 1 summarizes the basic information from these datasets according to the statistical analyses of the gauge station datasets and considering the locations four representative stations were selected for further analysis xiaheyan station on the province boundary between gansu and ningxia shizuishan station on the province boundary between ningxia and inner mongolia sanhuhekou station in inner mongolia and toudaoguai station the most downstream station in addition to the measured datasets a time series of runoffs was constructed based on the modeling scenario removing the impacts of reservoir impoundment and water diversion for agricultural irrigation and urban industry along the upper yellow river performed by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission equation 1 is applied in the reconstruction of the hydrological series 1 q res q 0 q

diversion and qrtn is the water return to the river channel analysis of the variation trend abrupt changes during the year and the periodicity of the measured and reconstructed datasets indicate the impacts to reservoirs and water diversion on the hydrological variation of the upper yellow river the sediment loads cannot currently be reconstructed using the above formula because channel scouring usually occurs downstream from the reservoir owing to sediment trapping 2 3 data proceeding methods trend testing has determined that the values of random variables generally increase or decrease over a statistical period hirsch et al 1982 a combination of statistical tests hydrological modeling and land use maps has proven effective for studying the temporal trends and abrupt changes in runoff and sediment loads in the river reach past the loess plateau he et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 zuo et al 2016 therefore the mann kendall mk tests mann 1945 kendall 1975 and wavelet analyses are combined and applied to advance the datasets and to distinguish the variation features of the runoff and sediment loads in terms of changing trends abrupt changing years and periodicities 1 mann kendall test the

the calculated z value was compared with the standard normal distribution table with two tailed confidence levels α 0 01 α 0 05 the null hypothesis h0 is invalid when z z 1 α 2 and thus the trend is statistically significant otherwise the h0 hypothesis is accepted that the trend is not statistically significant and there is no trend in the time series ozgur and murat 2014 a positive z value indicates an increasing trend in the time series while a negative value indicates a decreasing trend in this study we applied a significance level of p 0 05 so the increasing or decreasing trend will be accepted at a 95 confidence level the mk test was also used to determine the abrupt changing year for time series the statistic sk of the abrupt change test was calculated as following s k i 1 k r i 6 r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j j 1 2 i then the parameter uf k was computed using the following expression 7 u f k s k e s k var s k its mean and variance were determined by the equations e sk k k 1 4 8 v a r s k k k 1 2 k 5 72 where k 1 2 3 n then the time series will be ranged with inverted sequence and all the steps will be repeated the parameter ub k was computed similarly to uf k the curves of ub k and uf k were obtained in cartesian coordinates and the intersection points falling in the range of 1 96 and 1 96 at 95 confidence level were regarded as the abrupt change points 2 wavelet analysis the wavelet transform shows large advances in signal processing attracting much attention since its theoretical development in 1984 grossman and morlet 1984 an exploration of the wavelet transform as applied to daily river discharge records demonstrates its strong potential for quantifying stream flow variability equal for both periodic and non periodic features furthermore their locations in time are preserved smith et al 1998 wavelet transform analysis appears to be an effective tool for examining nonstationary and multiscale time series and transient phenomena in hydrological processes labat et al 2005 consequently considerable information can be obtained about the modes of a particular signal without losing information about when the modes occurred or how variable they were benson and daggett 2012 the continuous wavelet transform cwt is defined as the sum over time of the real signal x t multiplied by the scaled stretched or compressed shifted versions of the wavelet function ψ nakken 1999 9 x a b 1 a x t ψ t b a d t where the wavelet coefficients x are the result of the cwt of signal x t the function ψ t can be real or complex playing the role of a convolution kernel i e a wavelet the scale or dilation parameter a scales a function by compressing or stretching it whereas b is the translation of the wavelet function along the time axis the wavelet analysis signal highly correlates to the wavelet type the morlet wavelet is a periodic function enveloped by a gaussian function and is widely used to identify periodic oscillations of real life signals issac et al 2004 labat 2005 complex wavelet functions are effective at avoiding amplitude zero crossings in the time and frequency domains dziedziech et al 2015 therefore in this study the complex morlet wavelet function is applied to distinguish temporal runoff oscillations following numerous previous successful applications related to time variant and nonlinear dynamic systems zhang et al 2004 using wavelet transform wavelet coefficients and their variances are calculated wavelet power spectra and multi scale periodicity features are obtained with wavelet coefficients the shapes of wavelet spectra are controlled by the distribution of event time scales which in turn reflect the timing variability and the mechanism of water delivery to the river smith et al 1998 3 results 1 variation trends in the measured datasets of runoff and sediment load the full records of daily runoff and sediment transport rates at the given stations are shown in fig 2 generally high discharge and high sediment loads occur over the summer from the upstream to the downstream of the upper yellow river moreover the lower reach of the shizuishan showed spring peaks of runoff and sediment loads especially during peach blossom time probably owing to snow and ice melting for each station the runoff and sediment load during flood seasons decreased noticeably since 1970 since 1990 the natural distribution of runoff during flood season has totally changed and the discharge during non flood seasons has dominated accounting for more than 60 of the annual runoff sediment loads in flood season have also decreased significantly especially downstream as shown in fig 3 the annual average runoff of the xiaheyan shizuishan sanhuhekou and toudaoguai stations from 2000 to 2014 was 24 99 21 96 15 95 and 15 37 billion m3 yr respectively accounting for only 64 8 81 6 of the annual averages of these stations from 1950 to 1959 the annual average sediment load from 2000 to 2012 decreased to 0 041 0 058 0 053 and 0 043 billion tons yr at the four corresponding stations respectively accounting for only 17 5 37 1 of the annual averages from 1950 to 1959 from 1950 1989 the sediment load at xiaheyan station was 1 84 times higher than lanzhou station upstream which was not remarkably different from downstream stations i e shizuishan and toudaoguai the decreased runoff rate in the toudaoguai station was largest among the four hydrologic stations caused by less supplementary water and greater water diversion upstream the decrease of sediment load in the xiaheyan gauge station was the largest because of the reservoir sediment storage in the following sections the datasets of the representative stations are analyzed to show variations of hydrological features the mk test indicates decreasing trends in the time series of runoff and sediment loads of the representative stations see table 2 all z values are negative with confidence values 0 01 indicating that the runoff and sediment load decreases significantly on the upper yellow river the absolute z values of sediment load are higher than those of the runoff indicating that the reduction in sediment load is more notable the absolute z value of runoff is minimal at xiaheyan station and is maximal at toudaoguai station indicating that the reduction of runoff in the lower reach of the upper yellow river was more remarkable than that at the upper reach regarding the water and sediment trapped by reservoirs upstream of the xiaheyan station with less supplemental water along the river and greater water diversion runoff decreased from the upstream to the downstream and the decreasing rate was most notable at the downstream station toudaoguai however the absolute z value of sediment load was the maximal at the xiaheyan station not the toudaoguai station implying that the channel bed was scoured by clear or low sediment laden water flow released from upstream reservoirs the eroded bed materials were added to the water flow supplementing the sediment concentration downstream therefore the decreased rate downstream was smaller than that of upstream previous studies indicate that after the impoundment of the longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs the channel bed of the downstream varied remarkably because of reservoir impoundment and clean water low sediment load flow release an et al 2018 moreover at the xiaheyan section closest to the reservoir the lowest sediment concentration and transport occurred thus from xiaheyan to shizuishan the channel bed mainly experienced scouring whereas along the lower reach from bayangaole to toudaoguai the channel bed mainly experienced sedimentation tian et al 2013 an et al 2018 2 abrupt changes of measured runoff and sediment load datasets the results of abrupt change testing in terms of years of the time series of runoff and sediment loads for the representative stations are shown in table 3 abrupt changes did not occur synchronistically for the runoff and sediment loads the abrupt changing years differed for runoff and sediment load series for the different stations abrupt changes for the annual runoff occurred in 1986 for all stations when the longyangxia reservoir was constructed and put into combined operation with the liujiaxia reservoir both the storage and regulation capacities of the longyangxia were larger than liujiaxia the reservoir capacities were large enough to change the annual runoff and its temporal distribution within a year additionally water diversion increased greatly owing to industrial development and urbanization after 1986 according to the measurement by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission during the period 1986 2014 the annual average water diversion from the section of xiaheyan toudaoguai was up to 12 56 billion m3 yr thus the runoff was discontinuous since 1986 an abrupt change in annual sediment occurred in a disorderly fashion along the reach asynchronously with runoff the variation of sediment load was more complex compared to the runoff for instance an abrupt change was identified in 1989 at xiaheyan and in 1986 1978 and 1982 at shizuishan sanhuhekou and toudaoguai respectively the monthly average runoff discharge and sediment load distribution curves of the entire recorded period before and after the abrupt changing year are plotted in fig 4 at all stations the highest discharges and sediment loads i e equal or exceeding 1 and 10 decreased significantly after 1986 compared to those beforehand the peaks of discharge and sediment loads were reduced by about 50 additionally all high discharges and sediment loads with percentages of 1 40 decreased remarkably after 1986 however variations of low discharges and sediment loads with percentages equal or exceeding 50 were gentle and incomparable to variations of higher ones 3 periodicities in the measured runoff and sediment load datasets the multiple timescale periodicities of the runoff and sediment loads were obtained from complex morlet wavelet analyses the real parts of the wavelet coefficient are shown in the contour maps of fig 5 whereas fig 6 shows a wavelet variance indicating the magnitude of periodic fluctuation within the time series it is easy to locate the dominant periods with the help of a wavelet variance plot yang 2001 miao et al 2011 the series of runoff and sediment loads in the upper yellow river comprised several periods at different time scales furthermore the oscillation centers of various time scales formed interlacing positive and negative contours the average of annual runoff and sediment loads during 1950 2010 were chosen as the reference plane thus the magnitudes positive or negative of the real part of the wavelet coefficient in the contour maps reflect the plentiful or low flow areas within the time scale the runoff and sediment load series from the four stations exhibit obvious inter year and inter decade changes according to figs 5 and 6 the periodic behaviors and durations are identified in table 4 in the recorded period the annual runoff of the upper yellow river showed four periodicities 4 a 8 a 16 a and 25 or 27 a the dominant runoff periodicity was 27 a for the sanhuhekou station and 25 a for the other stations the annual sediment load showed periodicities of 3 a 4 a 8 a 9 a 11 a 22 a and 24 a with the dominant periodicity of 24 a for the toudaoguai and 22 a for the other stations water diversion played a role in influencing the periodicities of runoff and especially sediment load the intensive water diversion between shizuishan and sanhuhekou altered the runoff at the sanhuhekou station some of the diverted water was discharged back into the reach between sanhuhekou and toudaoguai and the runoff at toudaoguai was less affected compared to the upper stations 4 comparison of the measured and reconstructed runoff series the reconstructed annual runoff series based on the modeling scenario of removing the impacts of reservoir impoundment and water diversion for agriculture irrigation and urban industry for the period of 1956 2000 are plotted in fig 7 the reconstructed runoff series are assumed to be ones under natural condition undisturbed by human activities apart from the measured datasets the reconstructed runoff did not change significantly during the studied period the results of mk testing and wavelet analysis for the reconstructed runoff series are shown in fig 8 the z values of the mk test for the reconstructed runoff are all only about 1 3 of the corresponding values of the measured runoff fig 8 and tables 2 and 5 the natural runoff was stable and rarely changed over the past 50 years when no human interference was found additionally the dominant periodicity of the reconstructed runoff was found between 26 to 31 a longer than that of the measured datasets however the short periodicities were 5 7 and 11 a which were shorter than those of the measured values this indicates that human disturbance has shortened the period of low frequency flood while elongating the period of high frequency runoff on the upper yellow river changes in the wavelet variance indicate that the short periodicities are more intensively disturbed compared with long periodicities 4 discussion in the context of global warming and intensified human perturbations sustainable river management requires understanding the variation mechanisms of flow regimes and flooding therefore investigations of regional and global hydrological changes and their subsequent impacts on society have received considerable attention in recent years considering cropland expansion and urbanization water consumption for human use and river damming all of these things alter natural flow and sediment movement in river channels across the aquatic ecosystem wang et al 2007 in this study the upper yellow river was investigated to illustrate the inter annual and monthly variations in runoff and sediment loads and to reveal the impact of basin wide human activities on those variations our study methods and the perspectives of analyses used are good references for future investigations of other large river basins 1 multiple stresses influencing the hydrological features of the upper yellow river the yellow river basin has experienced multiple stresses and the hydrological features have been remarkably altered resulting in the deterioration of its ecological environment thus scientists have been concerned for decades wang et al 2016 datasets from gauge stations have been widely used to elucidate hydrological variations along the yellow river implications have been made based on sparsely distributed gauge stations wang et al 2007 used measured data from 1950 to 2005 at four gauge stations two upstream and two downstream to elucidate the decreases of sediment load to the river mouth from this perspective more careful and detailed recognition in hydrological variations of the upper yellow river are given based on more integral observations and comparison with modeling anthropic activities including elevated water consumption and hydropower exploitation are among the main stresses as of 2014 over 25 large reservoirs with capacities 100 million m3 have been constructed on the stem soil conservation projects including enormous check dams terraces and reforestation projects have played important roles in changing runoff and sediment loads there has been much interest in these rapid changes in the yellow river basin especially in the middle and lower reaches yang et al 1998 walling and fang 2003 syvitski et al 2005 wang et al 2016 both human activities and climatic changes are regarded as essential driving forces for these changes the operation of reservoirs has changed seasonal and inter annual allocations of water discharge and has facilitated a rapid increase in water consumption particularly in the lower reaches wang et al 2007 a rough estimation for the loess plateau suggest that 30 of the decrease in sediment load has resulted from climate change i e decrease of precipitation and 70 from human activities resulting in channel scouring of the lower reaches instead of severe flooding deposition that had been characteristic of the period prior to implementation of the water sediment regulation scheme wang et al 2007 2 trends of variations in runoff and sediment load in the upper yellow river previous studies mainly focused on hydrological trends at a limited number of stations emphasizing the attributions for runoff and sediment load variations mainly for middle and lower reaches of the yellow river neither of the variations in terms of abrupt changes or periodical features for the runoff and sediment load series were considered for the upper yellow river the major runoff producing region a detailed assessment of the variations in runoff and sediment load of the upper yellow river presented in this study helps clarify the changes in water and sediment load discharges and their attributions the results of this study show significant decreasing trends in both annual runoff and sediment loads the year 1986 was identified as the abrupt changing year of runoff in this study period slightly decreasing or non significant upward trends in annual precipitation and significant increases in air temperature were detected in this region zhang et al 2013 zuo et al 2016 kong et al 2018 adding the regional dry climate and high evaporation climate change could result in a slight but not considerable change in runoff the assumed natural runoff series reconstructed by removing the influence of impoundment and water diversion in this study indicates that influences of human activities played a dominant role in hydrological variations the reconstructed runoffs regarded as only affected by climate change showed no significant changing trend at a 95 confidence level confirming that instead of climate change human activities played the most important roles in variations a complex wavelet analysis and mk tests revealed that reservoir impoundment and water diversion shortened the period of low frequency flood but elongated the period of high frequency runoff in the upper yellow river water conservation projects targeting water and sediment yield tributaries of the upper yellow river have caused marked changes in the discharges of runoff and sediment considering the major tributaries zulihe qingshuihe kushuihe and the ten kongduis small rivers formed by ice flows the annual runoff from these tributaries to the stem increased from 340 million m3 yr from 1955 to 1989 to 440 million m3 yr from 1990 to 2009 whereas the annual sediment load from these tributaries to the stem decreased from 96 2 to 78 9 million tons yr for those two periods zhang et al 2013 moreover the completions and joint operations of the yanguoxia qingtongxia and sanshenggong reservoirs on the upper yellow river since the 1960 s i e the liujiaxia in 1968 and the longyangxia in 1985 showed extended discontinuous runoffs and sediment processes wang et al 2007 showed that the runoff and sediment discontinuity years correlated to reservoir operation years the joint operation of longyangxia and liujiaxia reduced the flow discharge of the flood season and increased the non flood season runoff moreover the duration of flood discharges at 2000 m3 s at the toudaoguai station decreased from 32 2 to 2 4 days owing to joint operations in 1986 shang et al 2008 sediment trapped in the upstream reservoirs longyangxia liujiaxia yanguoxia bapanxia qingtongxia and sanshenggong reached to 2 11 billion m3 from 1960 to 1989 and 800 million m3 from 1990 to 2003 significantly reducing the sediment load downstream zhang et al 2013 the reservoirs on the upper yellow river have strongly altered the regime and magnitude of streamflow and have trapped large amounts of sediment leading to severe siltation and stepwise reduction of the total volumes zhao et al 2014 large irrigation zones with an effective irrigation area of up to 1 million hm2 have caused remarkable reductions of water and sediment loads in the upper yellow river the annual water consumption by irrigation zones was near 7 88 billion m3 yr accompanying a sediment load reduction of 30 4 million tons yr from 1952 to 1989 with an increased annual water consumption and annual sediment load reduction by 18 and 8 respectively from 1990 to 2004 zhang et al 2013 the evolution of channel beds has also impacted the variation in sediment loads downstream about 410 million tons of sediment were deposited on the channel of the inner mongolia stretch from 1962 to 1991 with 14 million tons deposit per year and the aggradation aggravated remarkably since with 841 6 million tons deposit from 1991 to 2004 corresponding to an annual deposit of 64 7 million ons yr zhang et al 2013 consequently the abrupt changing trends and periodicities of the time series of runoff and sediment load are disorderly and asynchronous indicating complicated influences to the fluvial processes over time on one hand most sediment was trapped in reservoirs during impoundment on the other hand the downstream reach channel was also scoured owing to the low sediment loaded discharge from of the reservoirs altering the variation features of sediment load soil conservation practices in the upper tributaries changed the natural processes of rainfall runoff sediment yields causing the sediment load variation features to not coincide with the runoff 5 conclusions this study analyzed variations in runoff and sediment loads on the upper yellow river based on updated datasets of hydrological stations from the past 65 years changing trends abrupt change years and multi periodicities were discerned from the time series the impact of human activities on hydrological characteristics was evaluated based on comparison of the measured and reconstructed time series this indicated that the combined impact of lower precipitation and intensive human activities including soil conservation practices water and sediment retention within reservoirs water abstraction and sedimentation in channel beds resulted in distinct stepwise decreases in the runoff and sediment loads discharged from the upper yellow river runoff and sediment load variations were disorderly and asynchronous causing complicated influences to the fluvial processes for a long time the knowledge obtained from this study can provide useful information for water resource planning management and soil and water conservation in the upper yellow river ostensibly aiding predictions of runoff and sediment load variations in the lower reach author contribution

6797,operations of amount of large and medium reservoirs have remarkably changed runoff and sediment loads and consequently affected the fluvial processes intensively on the upper yellow river in this study time series of runoff and sediment transport rates of four major hydrological stations on the upper yellow river were used to analyze temporal and spatial variations of runoff and sediment loads mann kendall test and wavelet analysis were applied to analyze the datasets temporal variations in runoff and sediment loads were discerned in terms of changing trend abrupt change year and multi periods from the time series additionally a time series of runoffs was reconstructed based on a modeling scenario removing impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion to indicate the status without human disturbances comparison of the measured and reconstructed datasets was conducted to evaluate the impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion on hydrological variations the measured runoff and sediment loads showed obvious decreasing trends due to impoundment and water diversion however the reconstructed runoffs regarded as only affected by climate change showed no significant changing trend at a 95 confidence level confirming that instead of climate change human activities played the most important roles in variations the measured datasets indicated that the reservoir construction and operation caused an abrupt change in runoff in 1986 while the reconstructed datasets indicated another abrupt change in 1995 wavelet transform analysis distinguished the multi periodical features of the time series the first second and third dominant periodicities of the measured runoffs were 25 27 16 and 8 years respectively whereas the first three dominant periodicities of the reconstructed runoffs were 26 31 12 and 7 years respectively it was indicated that the high frequency periodicities of runoffs decreased while the low frequency periodicities increased owing to reservoir impoundment and water diversion keywords temporal variation runoff and sediment transport the upper yellow river abrupt change multiple periodical hydrological features 1 introduction rivers are efficient conveyors of water and sediment from headwaters to the sea williams 2012 in recent years studies of riverine sediment flux to oceans and their sediment transport processes have received greater attention related to climate change and human activities in river basins all over the world walling and fang 2003 syvitski et al 2005 wang et al 2007 consequently many large river deltas have retreated and their inhabitants have become increasingly vulnerable among world large rivers the yellow river provides an excellent illustration of the interactions among climate change extensive soil and water conservation hydropower development and sediment control measures walling 2006 flood vulnerable delta surface areas could increase more than 50 because of increased sediment trapping at upstream reservoirs and engineered floodplains combined with rising global sea level syvitski et al 2009 over the past 150 years the yellow river has been the most heavily loaded in the world creating the mega yellow river delta prograding into the epicontinental bohai sea however the delta has been starved and has retreated owing to the declining of water and sediment supply since 1995 wang et al 2007 the annual mean of sediment discharge has decreased from 1 6 billion tons yr to 10 million tons yr this has decreased riverine nutrients and total dissolved solids causing many aquatic ecosystems in the lower reaches and coastal regions to experience significant changes in biodiversity and biotic integrity chen et al 2005 quantitative analysis of the spatial and temporal variation of streamflow and sediment load provides a good reference for flood mitigation river channel stabilization and river basin and delta management zhao et al 2014 much attention has been paid to the middle reach of the loess plateau which is the source of nearly 90 of the aforementioned sediment load formerly sediment suspensions in the river s lower reaches triggered enormous flood catastrophes owing to the release of heavy sediment loads from the loess plateau wang et al 2016 comprehensive studies have analyzed variations in runoff and sediment loads in the middle and lower reaches wang et al 2016 showed that reduced sediment transport in the yellow river was caused by changes in water discharge and sediment concentration both influenced by regional climate changes and human activities over the loess plateau since the 1970s landscape engineering terracing and check dam and reservoir construction were the primary factors driving sediment reduction in addition large scale vegetation restoration projects have also reduced soil erosion since the 1990s yao et al 2017 apart from the major sediment yield region on the loess plateau the upper yellow river the main runoff producing region accounting for more than 50 of the total annual runoff has lost attention because fewer human activities have been performed there compared to the lower reach however the thirteen large and many more medium reservoirs have been constructed since 1960 on the stem and tributaries of the upper yellow river including the qingtongxia liujiaxia sanshenggong longyangxia etc the reservoirs are beneficial for irrigation and flood defense and they have changed the runoff and sediment loads to their downstream reaches impacting fluvial processes owing to reservoir operations on the upper yellow river upstream reservoirs have experienced sedimentation and bankfull discharges have decreased sharply since the 1990s shen et al 2007 simultaneously with recent land use changes and the implementation of water and soil conservation projects runoff and sediment loads have also dramatically decreased in the loess plateau the sediment load decreased by approximately 90 over the past 60 years wang et al 2016 all changes in the upper yellow river will eventually influence changes in the lower reaches facing this situation to help manage the river basin more attention should be given to figuring out how the discharges of water and sediment change the main runoff yield regions most of the earth s largest rivers suffer from anthropological disturbances our major concern is whether human activities play an important role in causing hydrological variations to large rivers the objectives of this study are to illustrate the inter annual and monthly variations in runoff and sediment loads in the upper yellow river and to reveal the impact of basin wide human activities e g dams and reservoirs soil conservation practices and water abstractions this study leverages datasets recorded at all gauging stations on the upper yellow river bwteen 1950 and 2014 we use the full descriptions of temporal and periodic variations of runoff and sediment loads additionally we discuss the effects of reservoirs and water diversions on the runoff and sediment load variations compared to between the measured time series of runoffs sediment transports and reconstructed data based on a modeling scenario removing the impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the upper yellow river from the ningxia province to the inner mongolia stretching about 1000 km from xiaheyan in the ningxia province to toudaoguai in inner mongolia fig 1 hydrological stations i e lanzhou xiaheyan qingtongxia shizuishan bayangaole sanhuhekou and toudaoguai have recorded discharges of water and sediments in the upper reach since 1950 the lanzhou station was the first hydrological station downstream of the liujiaxia dam thus its records help evaluate the dam effect and improve our analysis downstream of xiaheyan station the river flows to the northeast in the ordos plateau then it enters the yinchuan and hetao plains passing through the tengger desert hedong sandy ulan buh desert and the kubuqi desert ending at toudaoguai station large irrigation projects including the weining qingtongxia and hetao irrigations are located in this region they rely on water supplies from the upper yellow river 2 2 data we obtained continuous time series data of daily runoff and sediment loads of hydrological stations from the yellow river conservancy commission ministry of water resources china table 1 summarizes the basic information from these datasets according to the statistical analyses of the gauge station datasets and considering the locations four representative stations were selected for further analysis xiaheyan station on the province boundary between gansu and ningxia shizuishan station on the province boundary between ningxia and inner mongolia sanhuhekou station in inner mongolia and toudaoguai station the most downstream station in addition to the measured datasets a time series of runoffs was constructed based on the modeling scenario removing the impacts of reservoir impoundment and water diversion for agricultural irrigation and urban industry along the upper yellow river performed by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission equation 1 is applied in the reconstruction of the hydrological series 1 q res q 0 q in q out q div q rtn where qres is the reconstructed discharge q 0 is the measured discharge qin is the discharge flowing into a reservoir qout is the discharge out of the reservoir qdiv is the water diversion and qrtn is the water return to the river channel analysis of the variation trend abrupt changes during the year and the periodicity of the measured and reconstructed datasets indicate the impacts to reservoirs and water diversion on the hydrological variation of the upper yellow river the sediment loads cannot currently be reconstructed using the above formula because channel scouring usually occurs downstream from the reservoir owing to sediment trapping 2 3 data proceeding methods trend testing has determined that the values of random variables generally increase or decrease over a statistical period hirsch et al 1982 a combination of statistical tests hydrological modeling and land use maps has proven effective for studying the temporal trends and abrupt changes in runoff and sediment loads in the river reach past the loess plateau he et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 zuo et al 2016 therefore the mann kendall mk tests mann 1945 kendall 1975 and wavelet analyses are combined and applied to advance the datasets and to distinguish the variation features of the runoff and sediment loads in terms of changing trends abrupt changing years and periodicities 1 mann kendall test the mk test is a the rank based nonparametric test for assessing a trend s significance and it is widely used to evaluate changing trends and discontinuities in agro meteorological and hydrological time series hamed 2009 neeti and eastman 2011 shadmani et al 2012 chattopadhyay et al 2012 with mk if a trend is present the sign values will either increase or decrease constantly nishioka and takara 2004 burn and hag elnur 2002 the mk test is based on the correlation between the ranks of a time series and their time order for a time series x x1 x2 xn the test statistic is given by ozgur and murat 2014 2 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the length of the time series and the value of sgn xj xi was computed using the following formula 3 sgn x i x j 1 0 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 0 x j x i 0 when n is large enough n 10 the statistic s tends toward normality with mean e s and variance var s defined as the follows e s 0 4 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 p 1 q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 18 where tp is the number of ties for the p th value and q is the number of tied values i e equal values the standardized test statistic z was calculated according to the following expression 5 z s 1 v a r s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 s 0 s 0 the calculated z value was compared with the standard normal distribution table with two tailed confidence levels α 0 01 α 0 05 the null hypothesis h0 is invalid when z z 1 α 2 and thus the trend is statistically significant otherwise the h0 hypothesis is accepted that the trend is not statistically significant and there is no trend in the time series ozgur and murat 2014 a positive z value indicates an increasing trend in the time series while a negative value indicates a decreasing trend in this study we applied a significance level of p 0 05 so the increasing or decreasing trend will be accepted at a 95 confidence level the mk test was also used to determine the abrupt changing year for time series the statistic sk of the abrupt change test was calculated as following s k i 1 k r i 6 r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j j 1 2 i then the parameter uf k was computed using the following expression 7 u f k s k e s k var s k its mean and variance were determined by the equations e sk k k 1 4 8 v a r s k k k 1 2 k 5 72 where k 1 2 3 n then the time series will be ranged with inverted sequence and all the steps will be repeated the parameter ub k was computed similarly to uf k the curves of ub k and uf k were obtained in cartesian coordinates and the intersection points falling in the range of 1 96 and 1 96 at 95 confidence level were regarded as the abrupt change points 2 wavelet analysis the wavelet transform shows large advances in signal processing attracting much attention since its theoretical development in 1984 grossman and morlet 1984 an exploration of the wavelet transform as applied to daily river discharge records demonstrates its strong potential for quantifying stream flow variability equal for both periodic and non periodic features furthermore their locations in time are preserved smith et al 1998 wavelet transform analysis appears to be an effective tool for examining nonstationary and multiscale time series and transient phenomena in hydrological processes labat et al 2005 consequently considerable information can be obtained about the modes of a particular signal without losing information about when the modes occurred or how variable they were benson and daggett 2012 the continuous wavelet transform cwt is defined as the sum over time of the real signal x t multiplied by the scaled stretched or compressed shifted versions of the wavelet function ψ nakken 1999 9 x a b 1 a x t ψ t b a d t where the wavelet coefficients x are the result of the cwt of signal x t the function ψ t can be real or complex playing the role of a convolution kernel i e a wavelet the scale or dilation parameter a scales a function by compressing or stretching it whereas b is the translation of the wavelet function along the time axis the wavelet analysis signal highly correlates to the wavelet type the morlet wavelet is a periodic function enveloped by a gaussian function and is widely used to identify periodic oscillations of real life signals issac et al 2004 labat 2005 complex wavelet functions are effective at avoiding amplitude zero crossings in the time and frequency domains dziedziech et al 2015 therefore in this study the complex morlet wavelet function is applied to distinguish temporal runoff oscillations following numerous previous successful applications related to time variant and nonlinear dynamic systems zhang et al 2004 using wavelet transform wavelet coefficients and their variances are calculated wavelet power spectra and multi scale periodicity features are obtained with wavelet coefficients the shapes of wavelet spectra are controlled by the distribution of event time scales which in turn reflect the timing variability and the mechanism of water delivery to the river smith et al 1998 3 results 1 variation trends in the measured datasets of runoff and sediment load the full records of daily runoff and sediment transport rates at the given stations are shown in fig 2 generally high discharge and high sediment loads occur over the summer from the upstream to the downstream of the upper yellow river moreover the lower reach of the shizuishan showed spring peaks of runoff and sediment loads especially during peach blossom time probably owing to snow and ice melting for each station the runoff and sediment load during flood seasons decreased noticeably since 1970 since 1990 the natural distribution of runoff during flood season has totally changed and the discharge during non flood seasons has dominated accounting for more than 60 of the annual runoff sediment loads in flood season have also decreased significantly especially downstream as shown in fig 3 the annual average runoff of the xiaheyan shizuishan sanhuhekou and toudaoguai stations from 2000 to 2014 was 24 99 21 96 15 95 and 15 37 billion m3 yr respectively accounting for only 64 8 81 6 of the annual averages of these stations from 1950 to 1959 the annual average sediment load from 2000 to 2012 decreased to 0 041 0 058 0 053 and 0 043 billion tons yr at the four corresponding stations respectively accounting for only 17 5 37 1 of the annual averages from 1950 to 1959 from 1950 1989 the sediment load at xiaheyan station was 1 84 times higher than lanzhou station upstream which was not remarkably different from downstream stations i e shizuishan and toudaoguai the decreased runoff rate in the toudaoguai station was largest among the four hydrologic stations caused by less supplementary water and greater water diversion upstream the decrease of sediment load in the xiaheyan gauge station was the largest because of the reservoir sediment storage in the following sections the datasets of the representative stations are analyzed to show variations of hydrological features the mk test indicates decreasing trends in the time series of runoff and sediment loads of the representative stations see table 2 all z values are negative with confidence values 0 01 indicating that the runoff and sediment load decreases significantly on the upper yellow river the absolute z values of sediment load are higher than those of the runoff indicating that the reduction in sediment load is more notable the absolute z value of runoff is minimal at xiaheyan station and is maximal at toudaoguai station indicating that the reduction of runoff in the lower reach of the upper yellow river was more remarkable than that at the upper reach regarding the water and sediment trapped by reservoirs upstream of the xiaheyan station with less supplemental water along the river and greater water diversion runoff decreased from the upstream to the downstream and the decreasing rate was most notable at the downstream station toudaoguai however the absolute z value of sediment load was the maximal at the xiaheyan station not the toudaoguai station implying that the channel bed was scoured by clear or low sediment laden water flow released from upstream reservoirs the eroded bed materials were added to the water flow supplementing the sediment concentration downstream therefore the decreased rate downstream was smaller than that of upstream previous studies indicate that after the impoundment of the longyangxia and liujiaxia reservoirs the channel bed of the downstream varied remarkably because of reservoir impoundment and clean water low sediment load flow release an et al 2018 moreover at the xiaheyan section closest to the reservoir the lowest sediment concentration and transport occurred thus from xiaheyan to shizuishan the channel bed mainly experienced scouring whereas along the lower reach from bayangaole to toudaoguai the channel bed mainly experienced sedimentation tian et al 2013 an et al 2018 2 abrupt changes of measured runoff and sediment load datasets the results of abrupt change testing in terms of years of the time series of runoff and sediment loads for the representative stations are shown in table 3 abrupt changes did not occur synchronistically for the runoff and sediment loads the abrupt changing years differed for runoff and sediment load series for the different stations abrupt changes for the annual runoff occurred in 1986 for all stations when the longyangxia reservoir was constructed and put into combined operation with the liujiaxia reservoir both the storage and regulation capacities of the longyangxia were larger than liujiaxia the reservoir capacities were large enough to change the annual runoff and its temporal distribution within a year additionally water diversion increased greatly owing to industrial development and urbanization after 1986 according to the measurement by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission during the period 1986 2014 the annual average water diversion from the section of xiaheyan toudaoguai was up to 12 56 billion m3 yr thus the runoff was discontinuous since 1986 an abrupt change in annual sediment occurred in a disorderly fashion along the reach asynchronously with runoff the variation of sediment load was more complex compared to the runoff for instance an abrupt change was identified in 1989 at xiaheyan and in 1986 1978 and 1982 at shizuishan sanhuhekou and toudaoguai respectively the monthly average runoff discharge and sediment load distribution curves of the entire recorded period before and after the abrupt changing year are plotted in fig 4 at all stations the highest discharges and sediment loads i e equal or exceeding 1 and 10 decreased significantly after 1986 compared to those beforehand the peaks of discharge and sediment loads were reduced by about 50 additionally all high discharges and sediment loads with percentages of 1 40 decreased remarkably after 1986 however variations of low discharges and sediment loads with percentages equal or exceeding 50 were gentle and incomparable to variations of higher ones 3 periodicities in the measured runoff and sediment load datasets the multiple timescale periodicities of the runoff and sediment loads were obtained from complex morlet wavelet analyses the real parts of the wavelet coefficient are shown in the contour maps of fig 5 whereas fig 6 shows a wavelet variance indicating the magnitude of periodic fluctuation within the time series it is easy to locate the dominant periods with the help of a wavelet variance plot yang 2001 miao et al 2011 the series of runoff and sediment loads in the upper yellow river comprised several periods at different time scales furthermore the oscillation centers of various time scales formed interlacing positive and negative contours the average of annual runoff and sediment loads during 1950 2010 were chosen as the reference plane thus the magnitudes positive or negative of the real part of the wavelet coefficient in the contour maps reflect the plentiful or low flow areas within the time scale the runoff and sediment load series from the four stations exhibit obvious inter year and inter decade changes according to figs 5 and 6 the periodic behaviors and durations are identified in table 4 in the recorded period the annual runoff of the upper yellow river showed four periodicities 4 a 8 a 16 a and 25 or 27 a the dominant runoff periodicity was 27 a for the sanhuhekou station and 25 a for the other stations the annual sediment load showed periodicities of 3 a 4 a 8 a 9 a 11 a 22 a and 24 a with the dominant periodicity of 24 a for the toudaoguai and 22 a for the other stations water diversion played a role in influencing the periodicities of runoff and especially sediment load the intensive water diversion between shizuishan and sanhuhekou altered the runoff at the sanhuhekou station some of the diverted water was discharged back into the reach between sanhuhekou and toudaoguai and the runoff at toudaoguai was less affected compared to the upper stations 4 comparison of the measured and reconstructed runoff series the reconstructed annual runoff series based on the modeling scenario of removing the impacts of reservoir impoundment and water diversion for agriculture irrigation and urban industry for the period of 1956 2000 are plotted in fig 7 the reconstructed runoff series are assumed to be ones under natural condition undisturbed by human activities apart from the measured datasets the reconstructed runoff did not change significantly during the studied period the results of mk testing and wavelet analysis for the reconstructed runoff series are shown in fig 8 the z values of the mk test for the reconstructed runoff are all only about 1 3 of the corresponding values of the measured runoff fig 8 and tables 2 and 5 the natural runoff was stable and rarely changed over the past 50 years when no human interference was found additionally the dominant periodicity of the reconstructed runoff was found between 26 to 31 a longer than that of the measured datasets however the short periodicities were 5 7 and 11 a which were shorter than those of the measured values this indicates that human disturbance has shortened the period of low frequency flood while elongating the period of high frequency runoff on the upper yellow river changes in the wavelet variance indicate that the short periodicities are more intensively disturbed compared with long periodicities 4 discussion in the context of global warming and intensified human perturbations sustainable river management requires understanding the variation mechanisms of flow regimes and flooding therefore investigations of regional and global hydrological changes and their subsequent impacts on society have received considerable attention in recent years considering cropland expansion and urbanization water consumption for human use and river damming all of these things alter natural flow and sediment movement in river channels across the aquatic ecosystem wang et al 2007 in this study the upper yellow river was investigated to illustrate the inter annual and monthly variations in runoff and sediment loads and to reveal the impact of basin wide human activities on those variations our study methods and the perspectives of analyses used are good references for future investigations of other large river basins 1 multiple stresses influencing the hydrological features of the upper yellow river the yellow river basin has experienced multiple stresses and the hydrological features have been remarkably altered resulting in the deterioration of its ecological environment thus scientists have been concerned for decades wang et al 2016 datasets from gauge stations have been widely used to elucidate hydrological variations along the yellow river implications have been made based on sparsely distributed gauge stations wang et al 2007 used measured data from 1950 to 2005 at four gauge stations two upstream and two downstream to elucidate the decreases of sediment load to the river mouth from this perspective more careful and detailed recognition in hydrological variations of the upper yellow river are given based on more integral observations and comparison with modeling anthropic activities including elevated water consumption and hydropower exploitation are among the main stresses as of 2014 over 25 large reservoirs with capacities 100 million m3 have been constructed on the stem soil conservation projects including enormous check dams terraces and reforestation projects have played important roles in changing runoff and sediment loads there has been much interest in these rapid changes in the yellow river basin especially in the middle and lower reaches yang et al 1998 walling and fang 2003 syvitski et al 2005 wang et al 2016 both human activities and climatic changes are regarded as essential driving forces for these changes the operation of reservoirs has changed seasonal and inter annual allocations of water discharge and has facilitated a rapid increase in water consumption particularly in the lower reaches wang et al 2007 a rough estimation for the loess plateau suggest that 30 of the decrease in sediment load has resulted from climate change i e decrease of precipitation and 70 from human activities resulting in channel scouring of the lower reaches instead of severe flooding deposition that had been characteristic of the period prior to implementation of the water sediment regulation scheme wang et al 2007 2 trends of variations in runoff and sediment load in the upper yellow river previous studies mainly focused on hydrological trends at a limited number of stations emphasizing the attributions for runoff and sediment load variations mainly for middle and lower reaches of the yellow river neither of the variations in terms of abrupt changes or periodical features for the runoff and sediment load series were considered for the upper yellow river the major runoff producing region a detailed assessment of the variations in runoff and sediment load of the upper yellow river presented in this study helps clarify the changes in water and sediment load discharges and their attributions the results of this study show significant decreasing trends in both annual runoff and sediment loads the year 1986 was identified as the abrupt changing year of runoff in this study period slightly decreasing or non significant upward trends in annual precipitation and significant increases in air temperature were detected in this region zhang et al 2013 zuo et al 2016 kong et al 2018 adding the regional dry climate and high evaporation climate change could result in a slight but not considerable change in runoff the assumed natural runoff series reconstructed by removing the influence of impoundment and water diversion in this study indicates that influences of human activities played a dominant role in hydrological variations the reconstructed runoffs regarded as only affected by climate change showed no significant changing trend at a 95 confidence level confirming that instead of climate change human activities played the most important roles in variations a complex wavelet analysis and mk tests revealed that reservoir impoundment and water diversion shortened the period of low frequency flood but elongated the period of high frequency runoff in the upper yellow river water conservation projects targeting water and sediment yield tributaries of the upper yellow river have caused marked changes in the discharges of runoff and sediment considering the major tributaries zulihe qingshuihe kushuihe and the ten kongduis small rivers formed by ice flows the annual runoff from these tributaries to the stem increased from 340 million m3 yr from 1955 to 1989 to 440 million m3 yr from 1990 to 2009 whereas the annual sediment load from these tributaries to the stem decreased from 96 2 to 78 9 million tons yr for those two periods zhang et al 2013 moreover the completions and joint operations of the yanguoxia qingtongxia and sanshenggong reservoirs on the upper yellow river since the 1960 s i e the liujiaxia in 1968 and the longyangxia in 1985 showed extended discontinuous runoffs and sediment processes wang et al 2007 showed that the runoff and sediment discontinuity years correlated to reservoir operation years the joint operation of longyangxia and liujiaxia reduced the flow discharge of the flood season and increased the non flood season runoff moreover the duration of flood discharges at 2000 m3 s at the toudaoguai station decreased from 32 2 to 2 4 days owing to joint operations in 1986 shang et al 2008 sediment trapped in the upstream reservoirs longyangxia liujiaxia yanguoxia bapanxia qingtongxia and sanshenggong reached to 2 11 billion m3 from 1960 to 1989 and 800 million m3 from 1990 to 2003 significantly reducing the sediment load downstream zhang et al 2013 the reservoirs on the upper yellow river have strongly altered the regime and magnitude of streamflow and have trapped large amounts of sediment leading to severe siltation and stepwise reduction of the total volumes zhao et al 2014 large irrigation zones with an effective irrigation area of up to 1 million hm2 have caused remarkable reductions of water and sediment loads in the upper yellow river the annual water consumption by irrigation zones was near 7 88 billion m3 yr accompanying a sediment load reduction of 30 4 million tons yr from 1952 to 1989 with an increased annual water consumption and annual sediment load reduction by 18 and 8 respectively from 1990 to 2004 zhang et al 2013 the evolution of channel beds has also impacted the variation in sediment loads downstream about 410 million tons of sediment were deposited on the channel of the inner mongolia stretch from 1962 to 1991 with 14 million tons deposit per year and the aggradation aggravated remarkably since with 841 6 million tons deposit from 1991 to 2004 corresponding to an annual deposit of 64 7 million ons yr zhang et al 2013 consequently the abrupt changing trends and periodicities of the time series of runoff and sediment load are disorderly and asynchronous indicating complicated influences to the fluvial processes over time on one hand most sediment was trapped in reservoirs during impoundment on the other hand the downstream reach channel was also scoured owing to the low sediment loaded discharge from of the reservoirs altering the variation features of sediment load soil conservation practices in the upper tributaries changed the natural processes of rainfall runoff sediment yields causing the sediment load variation features to not coincide with the runoff 5 conclusions this study analyzed variations in runoff and sediment loads on the upper yellow river based on updated datasets of hydrological stations from the past 65 years changing trends abrupt change years and multi periodicities were discerned from the time series the impact of human activities on hydrological characteristics was evaluated based on comparison of the measured and reconstructed time series this indicated that the combined impact of lower precipitation and intensive human activities including soil conservation practices water and sediment retention within reservoirs water abstraction and sedimentation in channel beds resulted in distinct stepwise decreases in the runoff and sediment loads discharged from the upper yellow river runoff and sediment load variations were disorderly and asynchronous causing complicated influences to the fluvial processes for a long time the knowledge obtained from this study can provide useful information for water

6798,regionalization methods have been extensively discussed as the solution for runoff predictions in ungauged basins pub especially during the pub decade 2003 2012 at the same time research topics relevant to climate change appear to be an essential and attractive field for hydrologists in recent decades because the availability and quality of water resources are strongly affected by climate change however it is still unknown whether regionalization methods can be used to predict hydrological impacts of climate change for ungauged catchments or how much uncertainty of future predictions may result from the use of regionalization methods therefore in this study we investigate the transferability of regionalization methods i e spatial proximity and physical similarity methods regression method under changing climate conditions and compare the uncertainty resulting from regionalization methods with that from using climate models the investigation is based on 108 catchments in norway with large variability in climate conditions and geographic characteristics the study applies a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model wasmod with simple structure and six model parameters our result shows that a the differences in the predictions by the regionalization methods tend to increase in the future b the physical similarity method with parameter option i e the model parameters from the physically similar donor catchments are first averaged and then used to run the model for the target catchment shows higher transferability than other methods c the uncertainty contributions from climate models and regionalization methods to future runoff prediction are basin dependent and d the uncertainty of future runoff prediction due to regionalization methods can be higher than that from climate models in low precipitation areas this study provides insight to the choice of regionalization methods under changing climate conditions and the role of regionalization methods to the uncertainty contributions in future runoff predictions keywords regionalization methods ungauged basins climate change uncertainty variance decomposition 1 introduction from economic social and environmental perspectives runoff predictions have significant influence on the engineering design and sustainable water management using hydrological models is the most popular solution to this problem by hydrologists and water managers for runoff prediction of gauged basins the models are typically calibrated to get the optimized parameter set by comparing the simulated result with the observed runoff and then applying the optimised model parameter set to predict the runoff for the future period if the catchments lack observed runoff data i e ungauged basins hydrological models cannot be calibrated anymore and the model parameters are unknown he et al 2011 oudin et al 2010 since the majority of basins worldwide are effectively ungauged predictions in such basins become an interesting but challenging topic for hydrologists e g merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2007 sivapalan et al 2003 xu 2003 young 2006 brugan and aksoy 2018 taking these problems into consideration the international association of hydrological sciences iahs was motivated to establish a decade on predictions in ungauged basins pub 2003 2012 which was aiming to improve hydrological predictions in ungauged basins during the pub decade many new methods were developed for runoff predictions in ungauged basins e g xu 2003 merz and blöschl 2004 young 2006 parajka et al 2007 yang et al 2018a according to the review report from iahs after the pub decade the most common method to solve the pub problem is the use of so called regionalization methods hrachowitz et al 2013 researchers applied and compared regionalization methods in different regions using different models the conclusions about which approach performed best differ between the studies and depend on among other factors the study area and model choice e g he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2005 razavi and coulibaly 2013 reichl et al 2009 salinas et al 2013 samuel et al 2011 viglione et al 2013 for example parajka et al 2005 used the semi distributed hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model in austria and showed that the physical similarity method produced better results than regression and spatial proximity methods oudin et al 2008 used 913 catchments in france and concluded that spatial proximity yielded the highest accuracy followed by physical similarity and then regression methods applying regionalization methods in high latitude regions yang et al 2018a reported that the physical similarity methods perform best followed by spatial proximity methods and regression methods produce the worst simulations based on more than 100 catchments in norway the poorer performance of the regression methods in these studies may relate to the assumption of a linear relationship between catchment descriptors and model parameters which might not be valid in their cases however young 2006 using 260 catchments from the uk concluded that the regression method performed better than the proximity method based on a single physiographically nearest donor catchment all these studies show different outcomes and there is no consistent conclusion about which regionalization method performs best to address this problem parajka et al 2013 made a second comparison of regionalization methods based on 34 studies reported in the literature involving 3874 catchments their statistical result shows that spatial proximity and physical similarity methods overall perform better than the regression method studies evaluating regionalization methods have so far been using data for periods too short to show a pronounced influence by global warming however climate conditions are changing or are becoming non stationary ipcc 2014 and under non stationary climate conditions the reliability of transferring the conclusions or patterns needs to be investigated e g broderick et al 2016 li et al 2012 the simulation of hydrological consequences to climate change has received increasing attention from the hydrology communities which usually consists of three related fields i e a use general circulation models gcms to provide future global climate scenarios b use downscaling techniques both nested regional climate models and statistical methods for downscaling the gcm output to the scales compatible with hydrological models and c use hydrological models to simulate the effects of climate change on hydrological regimes at various scales progress and uncertainty involved in each field has been evaluated and reported extensively in the literature e g broderick et al 2016 chen et al 2011 etter et al 2017 xu 1999a xu et al 2005 to the future runoff prediction in ungauged catchments regionalization methods are almost equally essential as hydrological models global regional climate models and statistical downscaling methods however the transferability of regionalization methods under climate change has not achieved similar attention we are unaware of any studies that has evaluated how well different regionalization methods perform under different climate conditions which motivates our study therefore the main objectives of this study are to a evaluate the transferability of regionalization methods for climate change impact assessments and b compare the uncertainty contribution in the runoff predictions stemming from the choice of regionalization methods and the choice of climate models to fulfil those study aims we focus on the following specific research questions i how much will the runoff projections for the future period differ from the past period by regionalization methods ii will the regionalization method that performed best for the past period also show the best performance for the future period iii how much uncertainty stems from the regionalization methods when projecting runoff for the future period compared to other factors such as the uncertainty given by the climate models to answer the research questions stated above we assessed the transferability of five commonly used regionalization methods using a lumped conceptual hydrological model forcing by bias corrected data from five climate models during past period 1976 2005 and future period 2071 2100 for comparing the uncertainty contributions given by the climate models and regionalization methods the regionalized runoff predictions during 2071 2100 are analysed for 108 evenly distributed catchments throughout norway 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study was conducted using data for 108 independent i e not nested and evenly distributed catchments in norway one of europe s most mountainous countries located on the scandinavian peninsula due to the mountainous terrain and large latitudinal extension vormoor et al 2016 the variation in mean elevation of the catchments is large 80 1500 m see fig 1 a and the hydro climatological conditions differ much see fig 1b to e high pressure systems and extratropical cyclones dominate precipitation patterns along with orographic lifting variations in latitude and altitude determine temperature patterns in the study region the average annual precipitation over the 108 catchments is approximately 1950 mm with a strong decrease from coastal to interior areas see fig 1b three example catchments which are marked on fig 1b and 1c by black circles are selected to show the typical seasonal climate conditions for their regions the south western catchment located close to the coast shows much higher precipitation amounts in particular from september to may than the northern and south eastern basins see fig 1d for air temperature the largest difference between the catchments occurs in the period from october to march in this period the catchment located in the south eastern inland region shows the lowest temperature even lower than the northern basin located close to the coast in summary the climate in coastal area is wetter and maritime and changes to drier conditions in the interior regions 2 2 data 2 2 1 observed hydrological and meteorological data the precipitation and temperature data for each catchment was acquired from grid dataset with a resolution of 1 km retrieved from the senorge dataset by the norwegian meteorological institute tveito et al 2005 mohr 2009 jansson et al 2007 the discharge data are selected from the hydrometric observation network of the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve catchment descriptors are applied to quantify the catchment similarity index in physical similarity methods or build the relationship with model parameters for regression methods in this study the catchment descriptors used in this study are similar as those presented in yang et al 2018a table 1 shows a selection of indices from terrain characteristics and land use 2 2 2 climate model data typically bias corrected climate model data are used for impact studies hewitson et al 2014 the importance of using bias corrected data for hydrological modelling studies has been described in the special report of the ipcc seneviratne et al 2012 the main reason for using bias corrected data is that the raw simulation data from climate models often contain large systematic errors which are much reduced by the bias correction step e g teutschbein and seibert 2010 2013 in this study the data we used for each catchment is from bias corrected and downscaled climate model data with a spatial resolution of 1 km available for the periods 1976 2005 and 2071 2100 for the hydrological model simulations we use monthly precipitation and temperature data detailed information about the datasets as well as the downscaling and bias correction procedures is available in the report climate in norway 2100 hanssen bauer et al 2017 in this study we use data from a five global climate models see table 2 b one regional climate model rca4 kupiainen et al 2014 and c one representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 fig 2 shows a comparison between the bias corrected climate model data and the senorge dataset see section 2 2 1 for the past period the bias corrected climate model results agree well with the observations and there is almost no difference between the climate models and the observations for both precipitation and temperature due to the bias correction step for the future period on the other hand the data from climate models differ more between each other the median increase in air temperature is approximately 5 c and precipitation increases with approximately 21 from the past to the future period as climate affects the basic components of hydrologic cycle such as soil moisture evaporation and atmospheric water content gleick 1986 jiang et al 2007 yang et al 2018b the climate characteristics are often included in regionalization methods e g he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 the climate indices applied are the same as those presented in yang et al 2018a except that they are calculated from bias corrected climate model data used in this study table 2 summarised the climate indices calculated from 108 catchments for all five climate models for both past and future periods 3 methods 3 1 hydrological model 3 1 1 model description conceptual rainfall runoff models are commonly used for research on regionalization methods e g he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2005 reichl et al 2009 samuel et al 2011 however models with higher complexity and more parameters will likely be more influenced by over parameterization and equifinality problems e g li et al 2009 merz and blöschl 2004 schoups et al 2008 seibert 1999 wagener et al 2007 and the results might therefore lose generality thus a model with few parameters that are physically relevant and statistically independent should be an advantage yang et al 2018a considering these criteria we selected a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model called wasmod water and snow balance modeling system presented by xu et al 1996 and xu 2002 wasmod only has six parameters in total including the snow module and the model parameters are validated to be typically independent and statistically significant after calibration xu 2001 2003 the model equations are shown in table 3 because of the simple structure and few model parameters the model has been used and validated in many different climate regions in the world e g li et al 2015 2013 widén nilsson et al 2007 xu and halldin 1997 xu and singh 2002 additionally the model has also been applied in different regionalization studies xu 1999b xu 2003 muller wohlfeil et al 2003 yang et al 2018a and climate change studies xu 1999c li et al 2015 table 4 shows the parameter ranges used for the calibration of wasmod the parameters a 1 and a 2 are two temperature threshold parameters used in snow routine parameter a 3 is used for the computation of potential evapotranspiration parameter a 4 determines the value of actual evapotranspiration which is related to potential evapotranspiration and available water parameters a 5 and a 6 influence the generation of streamflow where a 5 influences base flow and a 6 the fast flow the base flow parameter should be higher in forested areas than in open areas or sandy soil and the fast flow parameter should increase with the degree of urbanization average basin slope and drainage density xu 2002 3 1 2 model calibration and evaluation as most of the model parameters cannot be directly determined from field measurement model calibration is an essential process for parameter estimation by optimising an objective function a traditional split sample test was conducted for model evaluation aiming to test the model validity in different periods coron et al 2012 wang et al 2017 in our study we divided the observation period from 1976 to 2005 into two distinct periods 1976 1990 and 1991 2005 both periods are used for calibration and validation in turn for the period of 1976 1990 the yearly mean precipitation is approximately 1885 mm and the yearly mean air temperature is 0 94 c precipitation equals approximately 2000 mm and temperature is 1 94 c in the period 1991 2005 thus temperature has increased by approximately 1 c and precipitation has increased by about 6 from the first to the second period in this study the model parameters are optimised to maximise the nse bias objective function viney et al 2009 which is a weighted combination of nash and sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and a logarithmic function of bias given by 1 f n s e 5 l n 1 p b i a s 2 5 where pbias is the bias and nse denotes the nash sutcliffe efficiency which are shown in eqs 2 and 3 respectively eq 1 can effectively maximise nse while at the same time minimize the bias vaze et al 2010 2 p b i a s 100 q s i m q r e f e r e n c e q r e f e r e n c e where q reference represents the observed runoff and q sim represents the simulated runoff 3 n s e 1 q s i m q r e f e r e n c e 2 q r e f e r e n c e q r e f e r e n c e 2 nse ranges between and 1 0 where a value equals to one indicates a perfect model fit and values smaller than zero indicate that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value for model calibration we first used a monte carlo method to find the best range of model parameters and then used a local search algorithm lagarias et al 1998 to refine the result for the monte carlo step we used 10 000 sets of parameters randomly sampled according to the ranges defined in table 4 for model evaluation we applied nse and pbias as criteria since they can assess the simulation from different aspects following moriasi et al 2007 we classify model performance into four categories using the limits shown in table 5 3 2 description of regionalization methods information from gauged basin so called donor catchments are often used for predicting runoff in ungauged basins kleeberg 1992 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 petroselli et al 2018 regionalization methods can help to select the best donor catchments for one particular ungauged target catchment the regionalization methods evaluated in this study include a spatial proximity method based on geographical distance b physical similarity method based on catchment characteristics similarity and c principal component regression pcr method spatial proximity and physical similarity methods are regarded as distance based regionalization methods by he et al 2011 for transferring parameter information from donor to target catchments in a previous study three donor catchments produced the best performance of the distance based regionalization methods for our study area yang et al 2018a we therefore use the same number of donor catchments in this study additionally we applied two different approaches for using the regionalized model parameters in the hydrological model the so called parameter option and output option oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2018a for parameter option approach the model parameters from the donor catchments are first averaged and then used to run the model for the target catchment while in the output option the model is first run using the parameters from the donor catchments on the target catchment and the outputs from the model are then averaged in total four distance based methods are applied in this study a the spatial proximity method with parameter option sp par b the spatial proximity method with output option sp out c the physical similarity method with parameter option phy par and d the physical similarity method with output option phy out unlike the distance based regionalization methods for the regression methods the regression equations are transferred to target catchment these equations are established by regression methods between the calibrated parameters of the hydrological model dependent variables and catchment descriptors independent variables in gauged catchments yang et al 2018a in this study principal component regression pcr method is applied which is a combination of principal component analysis pca with multiple regression methods according to the pca statistical procedure a set of observations of possibly correlated variables is converted into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components by orthogonal transformations based on these new principal components a multiple regression method is used to determine the function between model parameters and selected catchment descriptors in gauged donor catchments finally these functions are applied in ungauged locations to estimate the model parameters which will be used in the hydrological model to predict the streamflow for details about the methods used in this study see yang et al 2018a the catchment descriptors for physical similarity and regression methods have been summarized in tables 1 and 2 3 3 evaluating the transferability of regionalization methods 3 3 1 performance of regionalization methods we determine the performance of the regionalization methods using leave one out cross validation which is a commonly used strategy in many regionalization studies e g oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2013 samuel et al 2011 for each station we compute the performance of each regionalization method using a so called reference simulation since there is no observed runoff available for the future period for the reference simulation we use a model simulation applying the parameters obtained directly from the local calibration see defined in table 5 i e not involving any regionalization methods and drive the model with the bias corrected climate data for all runoff simulations for both the past and future period see section 2 2 2 our reference simulation follows a very typical approach for assessing climate change impacts on runoff e g chiew et al 2009 niemann and eltahir 2005 xu 1999c zheng et al 2009 guo et al 2018 this method assumes that hydrological models calibrated for the historical period are also valid for use in the future period with possibly different climate conditions vaze et al 2010 following this assumption we use the reference simulation to judge which regionalization method provides the best prediction of runoff for the future period we compute the performance of the regionalization methods using the nse and pbias measures presented in section 3 1 2 3 3 2 transferability of regionalization methods once we have determined the performance of regionalization methods we test how sensitive the long term runoff predictions in ungauged basins is to the choice of regionalization methods the sensitivity is measured as the change in performance of the regionalization methods from the past 1976 2005 to the future 2071 2100 period since nse and pbias evaluates the agreement between the regionalized and reference simulation from different aspects we need an additionally simple but comprehensive index to rank regionalization methods the proposed ranking index ri is based on the probability of good performance as described in section 3 1 2 as 4 ri i 1 m k 1 m 0 5 0 65 1 f nse ik d nse 0 5 15 15 f pbias ik d pbias where f n s e ik and f p b i a s ik stand for the probability density functions of nse and pbias for regionalization method i and climate model k as mentioned before we applied five regionalization methods and five climate models thus m 5 k a n d i 1 2 3 4 5 since the ranking index is based on probability of good performance higher values indicate better performance within each period and the optimal value is 1 in summary we evaluate the transferability of the regionalization methods using three different performance criteria a small change in performance of the regionalization method from the past to the future period indicates a good transferability capacity of the method for different climate conditions 3 4 quantifying the uncertainty contributions from climate models and regionalization methods the uncertainty in predictions of hydrological impact of climate change by hydrological models stems from different sources such as model parameters input data climate models and hydrological model structural e g meresa and romanowicz 2017 wine et al 2018 he et al 2018 the assessment of uncertainty contributions can help managers of water resources to understand the projections in more depth and make better decisions than when this information is neglected winkler 2016 for the uncertainty analysis presented below we applied data from all five climate models presented in section 2 2 2 and the five regionalization methods outlined in section 3 2 we quantify the uncertainties stemming from climate models and regionalization methods for yearly average runoff over 2071 2100 for all 108 study catchments we use variance decomposition to compute the contributions to the total uncertainty from the climate models and regionalization methods in this study we follow the approach described in déqué et al 2007 2012 the total variance of runoff v total can be splitted into the three different contributions as 5 v t o t a l v c l i m a t e v r e g i o n a l i z a t i o n v i n t e r a c t i o n where v climate and v regionalization are the individual parts of the variance explained by the climate models and regionalization methods respectively v interaction is the variance due to the interaction between climate models and regionalization methods statistically interaction effects occur when the effect of one factor depends on the levels of the second factor in our case this can occur when the response of the regionalization methods depends on the selection of climate models the variances in eq 5 can be computed as 6 v c l i m a t e 1 5 i 1 5 r i r 2 7 v r e g i o n a l i z a t i o n 1 5 j 1 5 r j r 2 8 v i n t e r a c t i o n 1 5 1 5 i 1 5 j 1 5 r i j r i r j r 2 where r ij is runoff simulation from climate model i and regionalization method j r represents the yearly average runoff simulation of all samples r i and r j are the average runoffs with respect to climate model i and regionalization method j for more details see déqué et al 2007 2012 4 results 4 1 evaluation of model performance by split sample test fig 3 shows the performance of wasmod using a split sample experiment the median nse value for the calibration period 1976 1990 is 0 86 and the 25 quantile value is approximately 0 8 which means that the model performance is higher than 0 8 for 75 of the catchments for the validation period 1991 2005 the median nse value is 0 75 and the 25 quantile value is around 0 70 the median pbias is close to zero during the calibration period 1976 1990 and for the validation period it is approximately 6 5 and the interval between 75 and 25 quantile increases from 4 to 12 when calibrating the model for the period 1991 2005 the model results are almost unbiased with an nse value approximately equals to 0 84 for the validation period 1976 1990 the median nse value is 0 78 and the bias is 3 0 in addition from the calibration to validation period the 50 interquartile range the interval between the 75 and 25 interquartile values increases from 0 08 to 0 14 for nse and from approximately 3 to 18 for the pbias according to the suggested performance classification by moriasi et al 2007 the model performance can be considered as very good for calibration and good for validation fig 4 a shows a map with model performance for the calibration period 1976 1990 the catchments with highest performance nse greater than 0 85 are mainly located in the interior area rather than the coastal regions there are more than 50 catchments with nse values larger than 0 85 for the validation period 1991 2005 the model performance generally decreased fig 4b many stations with poorer performance are located along the coast whereas catchments with higher performance are often situated inland for the validation period about half of the catchments show nse values higher than 0 75 and 8 catchments show nse values higher than 0 85 4 2 transferability evaluation of regionalization methods 4 2 1 visual difference between regionalization methods in different climates all climate models show increased temperature and precipitation in the future compared to the past period see section 2 2 2 to illustrate how this change in climate influences the runoff simulations we show the difference in terms of cumulative distribution functions between the regionalized and reference simulations for the past 1976 2005 and future period 2071 2100 in fig 5 the results are calculated based on the 30 year averaged monthly runoff for the 108 study catchments and using the ec earth rca4 climate model whose precipitation and temperature data are closest to the ensemble mean spanned by the five individual models comparing fig 5a and b we first see that the absolute difference between the regionalized and reference runoffs shows a large increase from past to future period for all regionalization methods for instance the maximum absolute difference in runoff between the regionalized and reference simulation is around 30 mm month for the past period but has increased to about 55 mm month for the future period the largest increase occurs for the spatial proximity methods second the difference between the regionalization methods themselves tends to increase in the future compared to the past period i e the range between the methods increases therefore we conclude that the regionalized simulations will differ more between each other for the future period which indicates that the selection of regionalization method will largely influence the accuracy of runoff predictions in ungauged basins 4 2 2 evaluation of regionalization methods by nash sutcliffe values fig 6 shows the probability density functions pdf of nse values for the five regionalization methods and five climate models during both periods first all regionalization methods perform worse in the future than in the past period for instance the mode value of nse decreased and the probability density of high nse values dropped from the past to future period based on data from all five climate models second the decrease in performance varies between the regionalization methods and climate models third by using different climate models the differences of regionalization method performances are not substantial which can be seen from median of nse values over 108 catchments for each regionalization method see right panel in fig 6 thus we conclude that the different climate models have small influence on the performance of the regionalization methods finally among all regionalization methods the phy par method performed best during both periods for all climate models compare the pdf curves in the third panel from the left and the median nse values in the right panel of fig 6 4 2 3 evaluation of regionalization methods by pbias values fig 7 shows probability density functions pdf of the simulated percentage bias pbias for the different regionalization methods and climate models for the 108 study catchments foremost the probability density curves change from narrow in the past to wide in the future period for all regionalization methods this pattern indicates that there are more catchments with higher errors in the future simulations than in the past period which can also see from the standard deviation of pbias values increases between the two periods right panel in fig 7 this result is consistent with the results presented in fig 6 where nse was used as performance criterion the different climate models have a small influence on the performance of the individual regionalization methods compare the rows in fig 7 for each regionalization method typically the shapes of the pdfs for the future period are similar between the climate models for each regionalization method furthermore the difference in mode values between the two periods is always smaller than 5 which also suggests that the choice of climate model has small influence on the regionalization performance in terms of pbias when comparing the different regionalization methods we find that the phy par method shows the smallest change in mode value between two periods see third column from the left and the right panel in fig 7 at the same time this method also shows lowest standard deviation of pbias for the future period see right panel in fig 7 thus the phy par method seems best suited for projections of average runoff in the following we examine how the pbias in the past period relates to the pbias in the future period fig 8 shows the pbias in modelled runoff by the five regionalization methods from the past to the future period using data from ec earth rca4 overall there is a strong positive correlation between the pbias for the past and future period thus biases given by the regionalization methods will likely persist from the past to future period moreover the value of the pbias for the past period is generally smaller than for the future period for example the pbias by sp par method varies within a range from 25 to 15 for the past period but the spread increases to a range from 45 to 35 for the future period in this case the uncertainty in simulated mean annual runoff due to the regionalization methods increases from the past to the future period comparing the methods in both periods the physical similarity approaches show similar spread in both periods whereas the other methods display larger differences compare with results presented in section 4 2 3 4 2 4 evaluation of regionalization methods by ranking index table 6 shows the ranking of the regionalization methods using the index ri proposed in section 3 3 2 as the evaluation criterion is probability based higher values mean better performance than lower values first the probability of being good performance for all regionalization methods in the future is lower than in the past period with an average decrease in ri of approximately 9 3 this result is consistent with those shown in figs 6 and 7 indicating that all regionalization methods will have higher likelihood of producing worse simulations in the future second the difference in ri between the regionalization methods increases from 7 14 0 939 0 875 0 939 100 for the past period to 10 8 0 918 0 825 0 918 100 for the future period these results are in line with those presented in section 4 2 1 see fig 5 third when comparing the regionalization methods in the past period the ri value for sp par approach 0 875 is smaller than for all other methods for the future period both spatial proximity methods show lower ri values less than 0 8 than other methods where the remaining methods all utilize catchment descriptors this result is partly related to the diversity of catchments characteristics in this study the spatial proximity methods do not seem able to capture the large variability in parameter values through space finally from the transferability aspect the phy par approach shows the smallest decrease 7 14 of probability for good performance from the past to the future period whereas the sp out and phy out methods show the largest decreases higher than 10 thus we conclude that the physical similarity method with the parameter option has the best transferability among all the transferability of regression method pcr is moderate when considering all methods 4 3 contribution of uncertainty from climate models and regionalization methods fig 9 shows boxplots of the variance decomposition for the predicted mean annual runoff for the 108 study catchments the contribution of the uncertainty from the climate models and regionalization methods varies strongly between the catchments from less than 10 to more than 90 overall the climate models show a larger contribution to the uncertainty median variance fraction equals to 51 compared to the regionalization methods median variance fraction equals to 40 the contribution of the interaction term between the climate models and regionalization methods is on the other hand of much smaller importance fig 10 shows a map of the variance decomposition results displaying the uncertainty contributions from climate models and regionalization methods for the individual catchments the uncertainty contributions vary largely between the basins which is consistent with other studies e g mendoza et al 2016 sunyer et al 2015 the regionalization methods typically dominate the uncertainty in most of the south eastern catchments and also in many of the catchments in middle and northern norway for the remaining catchments the climate models typically dominate the uncertainty in predicted mean annual runoff in almost all catchments the contribution of the interaction term between the climate models and regionalization methods is small with few exceptions therefore we can conclude that for most catchments the mean yearly runoff predictions from regionalization simulations do not depend on the selection of climate models catchments where the total uncertainty in the runoff predictions is dominated by the climate models tend to be located in coastal areas where precipitation is higher than in the inland regions fig 11 a displays the difference in uncertainty contributions between the climate models and regionalization methods against yearly mean precipitation for all study catchments when precipitation is higher than 3400 mm year the climate models give higher uncertainty than the regionalization methods at the same time the standard deviation in projected precipitation between the climate models also increases with precipitation amount fig 11b note that both panels use data from all climate model data during the future period 2071 2100 from the results in fig 11 it can be summarized that for catchments with high precipitation amounts or high variability of simulated precipitations between climate models the climate models dominate the total uncertainty of the runoff predictions however for catchments with precipitation lower than 3400 mm year climate models and regionalization methods both can dominate the total uncertainty of the runoff predictions thus we can conclude that the uncertainty contribution from regionalization methods is comparable with climate models for catchments with precipitation amounts lower than 3400 mm year in our study region fig 12 shows the normalized variances for climate models and regionalization methods computed using eqs 6 and 7 for simulated annual mean runoff the normalized variance for climate models is calculated by dividing vclimate for each catchment by the maximum value of vclimate for all catchments see also eqs 6 8 the same normalization is performed for the variance of the regionalization methods the normalized variances are much higher often a factor 10 or more in the coastal areas than the interior regions in the regions with high variances the climate models overall produce higher uncertainties than the regionalization methods these regions are characterized by higher precipitation amounts than the interior regions compare with fig 1 and the differences in projected precipitation by the climate models dominate over the parameter uncertainty given by the different regionalization methods on the contrary the variances from both climate models and regionalization methods are considerably smaller in the interior regions and some northern basins see also inset maps in fig 12 for many of these catchments the variance given by the regionalization methods exceeds the variance given by the climate models this result may be due to the lower precipitation magnitude and variability observed in these regions compare with fig 1b and fig 11b thus for areas with low precipitation amounts and variability the predicted runoff is more sensitive to variations in model parameter values given by the different regionalization methods than small changes in precipitation due to differences between climate models 5 discussion 5 1 model performance according to our results there are more than 50 catchments whose nse values are higher than 0 85 which is regarded as very good according to the classification presented by moriasi et al 2007 with a split sample test the model transferability can be assessed under different conditions including changes in climate klemeš 1986 in our case yearly mean precipitation has increased with approximately 115 mm and temperature has increased approximately 1 c from the period 1976 1990 to 1991 2005 our split sample test shows that nse values are higher than 0 7 and absolute values of pbias are lower than 15 for approximately 75 of catchments these high model performances indicate that the model is able to predict changes in runoff conditions under changing climate conditions the ability of wasmod for simulating runoff for different climate conditions has also been validated by xu 1999c 5 2 transferability of regionalization methods under climate change in this study we assessed the transferability of five regionalization methods under climate change we find that the capacity of the regionalized simulations to match the reference simulation declined from the past to the future period this behaviour may partly be explained by the argument from petheram et al 2012 who concluded that the correlation between catchment descriptors and the model performance becomes weaker for prediction than calibration mode in some cases our results showed systematic differences for the regionalization methods between the past and future period for example we found a positive correlation in the percentage bias pbias of simulated runoff between the two periods fig 8 according to this result we can deduce that for catchments where the regionalization method overestimates runoff for the past period will likely also overestimate runoff for the future period this has important implication for the choice of regionalization method when aiming for accurate predictions of average future runoff moreover the difference between the runoff simulations obtained by all regionalization methods appears to increase from the past to the future period thus for predicting runoff for the future period it is very important to select the methods with lowest uncertainty our results are similar to simulations using different hydrological models for gauged basins those simulations also tend to be more similar for the past historical period than the future projection period e g jiang et al 2007 each regionalization method performs differently under changed climate conditions using our ranking index we find that the physical similarity methods perform better than the spatial proximity methods for both periods see table 6 here the spatial proximity methods performs worse than in other studies e g oudin et al 2008 which may partly be explained by the fact that our network of available donor catchments has a lower density than in previous studies the density of donor catchments is considered as an important factor to impact the efficiency of spatial proximity methods lebecherel et al 2016 for the future period all regionalization methods that utilize catchment descriptors showed a better match with the reference simulation than the spatial proximity methods which only consider distance information from the past to future period the phy par approach shows the smallest decrease of the ranking index followed by regression and sp par methods and the largest drops are for sp out and phy out methods this result indicates that transferring model parameters as a whole set output option is most sensitive to changes in climate and therefore less robust than the remaining methods evaluated 5 3 contribution of uncertainty from climate models and regionalization methods as mentioned in many studies future predictions include uncertainty e g beven et al 2010 koutsoyiannis et al 2007 in this study we quantified the contribution of uncertainty from climate models regionalization methods and their interaction for predictions of runoff our analysis based on data from 108 catchments shows that overall the climate models contribute more to the total uncertainty than the regionalization methods this result is to some extent supported by earlier studies which have shown that the uncertainty stemming from climate models is larger than from the downscaling methods and or hydrological models e g addor et al 2014 chen et al 2011 etter et al 2017 osuch et al 2016 sunyer et al 2015 the interaction influence is considerably smaller and can almost be neglected which indicates that climate models and regionalization methods work almost independently from each other for runoff predictions while as our result is based on 108 catchments the result shows large variability between the catchments the climate models contribute most to the total uncertainty in coastal areas whereas the regionalization methods dominate the uncertainty in some inland regions the catchments where the uncertainty is dominated by climate models show higher precipitation amounts and variability than for the regions where the regionalization methods dominate the uncertainty furthermore the variance map shows that the uncertainty due to climate models shrinks considerably from the coast to inland whereas the variance by regionalization methods changes within a relatively narrow range for all catchments thus the regionalization methods dominate the total uncertainty in the inland regions because the climate models contribute considerably less to the uncertainty there than in the coastal regions in summary contribution of climate models to future prediction uncertainty is related to the precipitation amount and its variability in addition for regions with less precipitation or lower precipitation variability the uncertainty from regionalization methods cannot be neglected and can even be the dominant factor 6 conclusions in this study we evaluated the transferability of five regionalization methods for climate change studies using five different climate models the regionalization methods were tested against a reference simulation using locally calibrated parameters we also analysed whether the regionalization methods or the climate models dominated the total uncertainty in the predictions the study was performed using data from 108 catchments in norway a seasonally snow covered region with mountainous terrain the main conclusions from the study are summarized in the following points the match between simulations from all regionalization methods and the reference declined from the past to the future period while the performance in the future is positively correlated to the performance in the past period from past to future period the physical similarity method with the parameters averaged from the donor catchments phy par performs best whereas the distance based methods with output averaging option sp out and phy out are more sensitive to climate change impact the difference between the regionalised simulations tends to increase in the future compared to the past period for the runoff predictions of the future period the main source of uncertainty depends on catchment attributes the climate models appear to contribute most to the total uncertainty for basins with high amounts and variability in precipitation whereas the regionalization methods tend to dominate the uncertainty in catchments with lower amounts and variability in precipitation 7 declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work is supported by the research council of norway frinatek project 274310

6798,regionalization methods have been extensively discussed as the solution for runoff predictions in ungauged basins pub especially during the pub decade 2003 2012 at the same time research topics relevant to climate change appear to be an essential and attractive field for hydrologists in recent decades because the availability and quality of water resources are strongly affected by climate change however it is still unknown whether regionalization methods can be used to predict hydrological impacts of climate change for ungauged catchments or how much uncertainty of future predictions may result from the use of regionalization methods therefore in this study we investigate the transferability of regionalization methods i e spatial proximity and physical similarity methods regression method under changing climate conditions and compare the uncertainty resulting from regionalization methods with that from using climate models the investigation is based on 108 catchments in norway with large variability in climate conditions and geographic characteristics the study applies a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model wasmod with simple structure and six model parameters our result shows that a the differences in the predictions by the regionalization methods tend to increase in the future b the physical similarity method with parameter option i e the model parameters from the physically similar donor catchments are first averaged and then used to run the model for the target catchment shows higher transferability than other methods c the uncertainty contributions from climate models and regionalization methods to future runoff prediction are basin dependent and d the uncertainty of future runoff prediction due to regionalization methods can be higher than that from climate models in low precipitation areas this study provides insight to the choice of regionalization methods under changing climate conditions and the role of regionalization methods to the uncertainty contributions in future runoff predictions keywords regionalization methods ungauged basins climate change uncertainty variance decomposition 1 introduction from economic social and environmental perspectives runoff predictions have significant influence on the engineering design and sustainable water management using hydrological models is the most popular solution to this problem by hydrologists and water managers for runoff prediction of gauged basins the models are typically calibrated to get the optimized parameter set by comparing the simulated result with the observed runoff and then applying the optimised model parameter set to predict the runoff for the future period if the catchments lack observed runoff data i e ungauged basins hydrological models cannot be calibrated anymore and the model parameters are unknown he et al 2011 oudin et al 2010 since the majority of basins worldwide are effectively ungauged predictions in such basins become an interesting but challenging topic for hydrologists e g merz and blöschl 2004 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2007 sivapalan et al 2003 xu 2003 young 2006 brugan and aksoy 2018 taking these problems into consideration the international association of hydrological sciences iahs was motivated to establish a decade on predictions in ungauged basins pub 2003 2012 which was aiming to improve hydrological predictions in ungauged basins during the pub decade many new methods were developed for runoff predictions in ungauged basins e g xu 2003 merz and blöschl 2004 young 2006 parajka et al 2007 yang et al 2018a according to the review report from iahs after the pub decade the most common method to solve the pub problem is the use of so called regionalization methods hrachowitz et al 2013 researchers applied and compared regionalization methods in different regions using different models the conclusions about which approach performed best differ between the studies and depend on among other factors the study area and model choice e g he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2005 razavi and coulibaly 2013 reichl et al 2009 salinas et al 2013 samuel et al 2011 viglione et al 2013 for example parajka et al 2005 used the semi distributed hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning model in austria and showed that the physical similarity method produced better results than regression and spatial proximity methods oudin et al 2008 used 913 catchments in france and concluded that spatial proximity yielded the highest accuracy followed by physical similarity and then regression methods applying regionalization methods in high latitude regions yang et al 2018a reported that the physical similarity methods perform best followed by spatial proximity methods and regression methods produce the worst simulations based on more than 100 catchments in norway the poorer performance of the regression methods in these studies may relate to the assumption of a linear relationship between catchment descriptors and model parameters which might not be valid in their cases however young 2006 using 260 catchments from the uk concluded that the regression method performed better than the proximity method based on a single physiographically nearest donor catchment all these studies show different outcomes and there is no consistent conclusion about which regionalization method performs best to address this problem parajka et al 2013 made a second comparison of regionalization methods based on 34 studies reported in the literature involving 3874 catchments their statistical result shows that spatial proximity and physical similarity methods overall perform better than the regression method studies evaluating regionalization methods have so far been using data for periods too short to show a pronounced influence by global warming however climate conditions are changing or are becoming non stationary ipcc 2014 and under non stationary climate conditions the reliability of transferring the conclusions or patterns needs to be investigated e g broderick et al 2016 li et al 2012 the simulation of hydrological consequences to climate change has received increasing attention from the hydrology communities which usually consists of three related fields i e a use general circulation models gcms to provide future global climate scenarios b use downscaling techniques both nested regional climate models and statistical methods for downscaling the gcm output to the scales compatible with hydrological models and c use hydrological models to simulate the effects of climate change on hydrological regimes at various scales progress and uncertainty involved in each field has been evaluated and reported extensively in the literature e g broderick et al 2016 chen et al 2011 etter et al 2017 xu 1999a xu et al 2005 to the future runoff prediction in ungauged catchments regionalization methods are almost equally essential as hydrological models global regional climate models and statistical downscaling methods however the transferability of regionalization methods under climate change has not achieved similar attention we are unaware of any studies that has evaluated how well different regionalization methods perform under different climate conditions which motivates our study therefore the main objectives of this study are to a evaluate the transferability of regionalization methods for climate change impact assessments and b compare the uncertainty contribution in the runoff predictions stemming from the choice of regionalization methods and the choice of climate models to fulfil those study aims we focus on the following specific research questions i how much will the runoff projections for the future period differ from the past period by regionalization methods ii will the regionalization method that performed best for the past period also show the best performance for the future period iii how much uncertainty stems from the regionalization methods when projecting runoff for the future period compared to other factors such as the uncertainty given by the climate models to answer the research questions stated above we assessed the transferability of five commonly used regionalization methods using a lumped conceptual hydrological model forcing by bias corrected data from five climate models during past period 1976 2005 and future period 2071 2100 for comparing the uncertainty contributions given by the climate models and regionalization methods the regionalized runoff predictions during 2071 2100 are analysed for 108 evenly distributed catchments throughout norway 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study was conducted using data for 108 independent i e not nested and evenly distributed catchments in norway one of europe s most mountainous countries located on the scandinavian peninsula due to the mountainous terrain and large latitudinal extension vormoor et al 2016 the variation in mean elevation of the catchments is large 80 1500 m see fig 1 a and the hydro climatological conditions differ much see fig 1b to e high pressure systems and extratropical cyclones dominate precipitation patterns along with orographic lifting variations in latitude and altitude determine temperature patterns in the study region the average annual precipitation over the 108 catchments is approximately 1950 mm with a strong decrease from coastal to interior areas see fig 1b three example catchments which are marked on fig 1b and 1c by black circles are selected to show the typical seasonal climate conditions for their regions the south western catchment located close to the coast shows much higher precipitation amounts in particular from september to may than the northern and south eastern basins see fig 1d for air temperature the largest difference between the catchments occurs in the period from october to march in this period the catchment located in the south eastern inland region shows the lowest temperature even lower than the northern basin located close to the coast in summary the climate in coastal area is wetter and maritime and changes to drier conditions in the interior regions 2 2 data 2 2 1 observed hydrological and meteorological data the precipitation and temperature data for each catchment was acquired from grid dataset with a resolution of 1 km retrieved from the senorge dataset by the norwegian meteorological institute tveito et al 2005 mohr 2009 jansson et al 2007 the discharge data are selected from the hydrometric observation network of the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve catchment descriptors are applied to quantify the catchment similarity index in physical similarity methods or build the relationship with model parameters for regression methods in this study the catchment descriptors used in this study are similar as those presented in yang et al 2018a table 1 shows a selection of indices from terrain characteristics and land use 2 2 2 climate model data typically bias corrected climate model data are used for impact studies hewitson et al 2014 the importance of using bias corrected data for hydrological modelling studies has been described in the special report of the ipcc seneviratne et al 2012 the main reason for using bias corrected data is that the raw simulation data from climate models often contain large systematic errors which are much reduced by the bias correction step e g teutschbein and seibert 2010 2013 in this study the data we used for each catchment is from bias corrected and downscaled climate model data with a spatial resolution of 1 km available for the periods 1976 2005 and 2071 2100 for the hydrological model simulations we use monthly precipitation and temperature data detailed information about the datasets as well as the downscaling and bias correction procedures is available in the report climate in norway 2100 hanssen bauer et al 2017 in this study we use data from a five global climate models see table 2 b one regional climate model rca4 kupiainen et al 2014 and c one representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 fig 2 shows a comparison between the bias corrected climate model data and the senorge dataset see section 2 2 1 for the past period the bias corrected climate model results agree well with the observations and there is almost no difference between the climate models and the observations for both precipitation and temperature due to the bias correction step for the future period on the other hand the data from climate models differ more between each other the median increase in air temperature is approximately 5 c and precipitation increases with approximately 21 from the past to the future period as climate affects the basic components of hydrologic cycle such as soil moisture evaporation and atmospheric water content gleick 1986 jiang et al 2007 yang et al 2018b the climate characteristics are often included in regionalization methods e g he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 the climate indices applied are the same as those presented in yang et al 2018a except that they are calculated from bias corrected climate model data used in this study table 2 summarised the climate indices calculated from 108 catchments for all five climate models for both past and future periods 3 methods 3 1 hydrological model 3 1 1 model description conceptual rainfall runoff models are commonly used for research on regionalization methods e g he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2005 reichl et al 2009 samuel et al 2011 however models with higher complexity and more parameters will likely be more influenced by over parameterization and equifinality problems e g li et al 2009 merz and blöschl 2004 schoups et al 2008 seibert 1999 wagener et al 2007 and the results might therefore lose generality thus a model with few parameters that are physically relevant and statistically independent should be an advantage yang et al 2018a considering these criteria we selected a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model called wasmod water and snow balance modeling system presented by xu et al 1996 and xu 2002 wasmod only has six parameters in total including the snow module and the model parameters are validated to be typically independent and statistically significant after calibration xu 2001 2003 the model equations are shown in table 3 because of the simple structure and few model parameters the model has been used and validated in many different climate regions in the world e g li et al 2015 2013 widén nilsson et al 2007 xu and halldin 1997 xu and singh 2002 additionally the model has also been applied in different regionalization studies xu 1999b xu 2003 muller wohlfeil et al 2003 yang et al 2018a and climate change studies xu 1999c li et al 2015 table 4 shows the parameter ranges used for the calibration of wasmod the parameters a 1 and a 2 are two temperature threshold parameters used in snow routine parameter a 3 is used for the computation of potential evapotranspiration parameter a 4 determines the value of actual evapotranspiration which is related to potential evapotranspiration and available water parameters a 5 and a 6 influence the generation of streamflow where a 5 influences base flow and a 6 the fast flow the base flow parameter should be higher in forested areas than in open areas or sandy soil and the fast flow parameter should increase with the degree of urbanization average basin slope and drainage density xu 2002 3 1 2 model calibration and evaluation as most of the model parameters cannot be directly determined from field measurement model calibration is an essential process for parameter estimation by optimising an objective function a traditional split sample test was conducted for model evaluation aiming to test the model validity in different periods coron et al 2012 wang et al 2017 in our study we divided the observation period from 1976 to 2005 into two distinct periods 1976 1990 and 1991 2005 both periods are used for calibration and validation in turn for the period of 1976 1990 the yearly mean precipitation is approximately 1885 mm and the yearly mean air temperature is 0 94 c precipitation equals approximately 2000 mm and temperature is 1 94 c in the period 1991 2005 thus temperature has increased by approximately 1 c and precipitation has increased by about 6 from the first to the second period in this study the model parameters are optimised to maximise the nse bias objective function viney et al 2009 which is a weighted combination of nash and sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and a logarithmic function of bias given by 1 f n s e 5 l n 1 p b i a s 2 5 where pbias is the bias and nse denotes the nash sutcliffe efficiency which are shown in eqs 2 and 3 respectively eq 1 can effectively maximise nse while at the same time minimize the bias vaze et al 2010 2 p b i a s 100 q s i m q r e f e r e n c e q r e f e r e n c e where q reference represents the observed runoff and q sim represents the simulated runoff 3 n s e 1 q s i m q r e f e r e n c e 2 q r e f e r e n c e q r e f e r e n c e 2 nse ranges between and 1 0 where a value equals to one indicates a perfect model fit and values smaller than zero indicate that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value for model calibration we first used a monte carlo method to find the best range of model parameters and then used a local search algorithm lagarias et al 1998 to refine the result for the monte carlo step we used 10 000 sets of parameters randomly sampled according to the ranges defined in table 4 for model evaluation we applied nse and pbias as criteria since they can assess the simulation from different aspects following moriasi et al 2007 we classify model performance into four categories using the limits shown in table 5 3 2 description of regionalization methods information from gauged basin so called donor catchments are often used for predicting runoff in ungauged basins kleeberg 1992 blöschl and sivapalan 1995 petroselli et al 2018 regionalization methods can help to select the best donor catchments for one particular ungauged target catchment the regionalization methods evaluated in this study include a spatial proximity method based on geographical distance b physical similarity method based on catchment characteristics similarity and c principal component regression pcr method spatial proximity and physical similarity methods are regarded as distance based regionalization methods by he et al 2011 for transferring parameter information from donor to target catchments in a previous study three donor catchments produced the best performance of the distance based regionalization methods for our study area yang et al 2018a we therefore use the same number of donor catchments in this study additionally we applied two different approaches for using the regionalized model parameters in the hydrological model the so called parameter option and output option oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2018a for parameter option approach the model parameters from the donor catchments are first averaged and then used to run the model for the target catchment while in the output option the model is first run using the parameters from the donor catchments on the target catchment and the outputs from the model are then averaged in total four distance based methods are applied in this study a the spatial proximity method with parameter option sp par b the spatial proximity method with output option sp out c the physical similarity method with parameter option phy par and d the physical similarity method with output option phy out unlike the distance based regionalization methods for the regression methods the regression equations are transferred to target catchment these equations are established by regression methods between the calibrated parameters of the hydrological model dependent variables and catchment descriptors independent variables in gauged catchments yang et al 2018a in this study principal component regression pcr method is applied which is a combination of principal component analysis pca with multiple regression methods according to the pca statistical procedure a set of observations of possibly correlated variables is converted into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components by orthogonal transformations based on these new principal components a multiple regression method is used to determine the function between model parameters and selected catchment descriptors in gauged donor catchments finally these functions are applied in ungauged locations to estimate the model parameters which will be used in the hydrological model to predict the streamflow for details about the methods used in this study see yang et al 2018a the catchment descriptors for physical similarity and regression methods have been summarized in tables 1 and 2 3 3 evaluating the transferability of regionalization methods 3 3 1 performance of regionalization methods we determine the performance of the regionalization methods using leave one out cross validation which is a commonly used strategy in many regionalization studies e g oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2013 samuel et al 2011 for each station we compute the performance of each regionalization method using a so called reference simulation since there is no observed runoff available for the future period for the reference simulation we use a model simulation applying the parameters obtained directly from the local calibration see defined in table 5 i e not involving any regionalization methods and drive the model with the bias corrected climate data for all runoff simulations for both the past and future period see section 2 2 2 our reference simulation follows a very typical approach for assessing climate change impacts on runoff e g chiew et al 2009 niemann and eltahir 2005 xu 1999c zheng et al 2009 guo et al 2018 this method assumes that hydrological models calibrated for the historical period are also valid for use in the future period with possibly different climate conditions vaze et al 2010 following this assumption we use the reference simulation to judge which regionalization method provides the best prediction of runoff for the future period we compute the performance of the regionalization methods using the nse and pbias measures presented in section 3 1 2 3 3 2 transferability of regionalization methods once we have determined the performance of regionalization methods we test how sensitive the long term runoff predictions in ungauged basins is to the choice of regionalization methods the sensitivity is measured as the change in performance of the regionalization methods from the past 1976 2005 to the future 2071 2100 period since nse and pbias evaluates the agreement between the regionalized and reference simulation from different aspects we need an additionally simple but comprehensive index to rank regionalization methods the proposed ranking index ri is based on the probability of good performance as described in section 3 1 2 as 4 ri i 1 m k 1 m 0 5 0 65 1 f nse ik d nse 0 5 15 15 f pbias ik d pbias where f n s e ik and f p b i a s ik stand for the probability density functions of nse and pbias for regionalization method i and climate model k as mentioned before we applied five regionalization methods and five climate models thus m 5 k a n d i 1 2 3 4 5 since the ranking index is based on probability of good performance higher values indicate better performance within each period and the optimal value is 1 in summary we evaluate the transferability of the regionalization methods using three different performance criteria a small change in performance of the regionalization method from the past to the future period indicates a good transferability capacity of the method for different climate conditions 3 4 quantifying the uncertainty contributions from climate models and regionalization methods the uncertainty in predictions of hydrological impact of climate change by hydrological models stems from different sources such as model parameters input data climate models and hydrological model structural e g meresa and romanowicz 2017 wine et al 2018 he et al 2018 the assessment of uncertainty contributions can help managers of water resources to understand the projections in more depth and make better decisions than when this information is neglected winkler 2016 for the uncertainty analysis presented below we applied data from all five climate models presented in section 2 2 2 and the five regionalization methods outlined in section 3 2 we quantify the uncertainties stemming from climate models and regionalization methods for yearly average runoff over 2071 2100 for all 108 study catchments we use variance decomposition to compute the contributions to the total uncertainty from the climate models and regionalization methods in this study we follow the approach described in déqué et al 2007 2012 the total variance of runoff v total can be splitted into the three different contributions as 5 v t o t a l v c l i m a t e v r e g i o n a l i z a t i o n v i n t e r a c t i o n where v climate and v regionalization are the individual parts of the variance explained by the climate models and regionalization methods respectively v interaction is the variance due to the interaction between climate models and regionalization methods statistically interaction effects occur when the effect of one factor depends on the levels of the second factor in our case this can occur when the response of the regionalization methods depends on the selection of climate models the variances in eq 5 can be computed as 6 v c l i m a t e 1 5 i 1 5 r i r 2 7 v r e g i o n a l i z a t i o n 1 5 j 1 5 r j r 2 8 v i n t e r a c t i o n 1 5 1 5 i 1 5 j 1 5 r i j r i r j r 2 where r ij is runoff simulation from climate model i and regionalization method j r represents the yearly average runoff simulation of all samples r i and r j are the average runoffs with respect to climate model i and regionalization method j for more details see déqué et al 2007 2012 4 results 4 1 evaluation of model performance by split sample test fig 3 shows the performance of wasmod using a split sample experiment the median nse value for the calibration period 1976 1990 is 0 86 and the 25 quantile value is approximately 0 8 which means that the model performance is higher than 0 8 for 75 of the catchments for the validation period 1991 2005 the median nse value is 0 75 and the 25 quantile value is around 0 70 the median pbias is close to zero during the calibration period 1976 1990 and for the validation period it is approximately 6 5 and the interval between 75 and 25 quantile increases from 4 to 12 when calibrating the model for the period 1991 2005 the model results are almost unbiased with an nse value approximately equals to 0 84 for the validation period 1976 1990 the median nse value is 0 78 and the bias is 3 0 in addition from the calibration to validation period the 50 interquartile range the interval between the 75 and 25 interquartile values increases from 0 08 to 0 14 for nse and from approximately 3 to 18 for the pbias according to the suggested performance classification by moriasi et al 2007 the model performance can be considered as very good for calibration and good for validation fig 4 a shows a map with model performance for the calibration period 1976 1990 the catchments with highest performance nse greater than 0 85 are mainly located in the interior area rather than the coastal regions there are more than 50 catchments with nse values larger than 0 85 for the validation period 1991 2005 the model performance generally decreased fig 4b many stations with poorer performance are located along the coast whereas catchments with higher performance are often situated inland for the validation period about half of the catchments show nse values higher than 0 75 and 8 catchments show nse values higher than 0 85 4 2 transferability evaluation of regionalization methods 4 2 1 visual difference between regionalization methods in different climates all climate models show increased temperature and precipitation in the future compared to the past period see section 2 2 2 to illustrate how this change in climate influences the runoff simulations we show the difference in terms of cumulative distribution functions between the regionalized and reference simulations for the past 1976 2005 and future period 2071 2100 in fig 5 the results are calculated based on the 30 year averaged monthly runoff for the 108 study catchments and using the ec earth rca4 climate model whose precipitation and temperature data are closest to the ensemble mean spanned by the five individual models comparing fig 5a and b we first see that the absolute difference between the regionalized and reference runoffs shows a large increase from past to future period for all regionalization methods for instance the maximum absolute difference in runoff between the regionalized and reference simulation is around 30 mm month for the past period but has increased to about 55 mm month for the future period the largest increase occurs for the spatial proximity methods second the difference between the regionalization methods themselves tends to increase in the future compared to the past period i e the range between the methods increases therefore we conclude that the regionalized simulations will differ more between each other for the future period which indicates that the selection of regionalization method will largely influence the accuracy of runoff predictions in ungauged basins 4 2 2 evaluation of regionalization methods by nash sutcliffe values fig 6 shows the probability density functions pdf of nse values for the five regionalization methods and five climate models during both periods first all regionalization methods perform worse in the future than in the past period for instance the mode value of nse decreased and the probability density of high nse values dropped from the past to future period based on data from all five climate models second the decrease in performance varies between the regionalization methods and climate models third by using different climate models the differences of regionalization method performances are not substantial which can be seen from median of nse values over 108 catchments for each regionalization method see right panel in fig 6 thus we conclude that the different climate models have small influence on the performance of the regionalization methods finally among all regionalization methods the phy par method performed best during both periods for all climate models compare the pdf curves in the third panel from the left and the median nse values in the right panel of fig 6 4 2 3 evaluation of regionalization methods by pbias values fig 7 shows probability density functions pdf of the simulated percentage bias pbias for the different regionalization methods and climate models for the 108 study catchments foremost the probability density curves change from narrow in the past to wide in the future period for all regionalization methods this pattern indicates that there are more catchments with higher errors in the future simulations than in the past period which can also see from the standard deviation of pbias values increases between the two periods right panel in fig 7 this result is consistent with the results presented in fig 6 where nse was used as performance criterion the different climate models have a small influence on the performance of the individual regionalization methods compare the rows in fig 7 for each regionalization method typically the shapes of the pdfs for the future period are similar between the climate models for each regionalization method furthermore the difference in mode values between the two periods is always smaller than 5 which also suggests that the choice of climate model has small influence on the regionalization performance in terms of pbias when comparing the different regionalization methods we find that the phy par method shows the smallest change in mode value between two periods see third column from the left and the right panel in fig 7 at the same time this method also shows lowest standard deviation of pbias for the future period see right panel in fig 7 thus the phy par method seems best suited for projections of average runoff in the following we examine how the pbias in the past period relates to the pbias in the future period fig 8 shows the pbias in modelled runoff by the five regionalization methods from the past to the future period using data from ec earth rca4 overall there is a strong positive correlation between the pbias for the past and future period thus biases given by the regionalization methods will likely persist from the past to future period moreover the value of the pbias for the past period is generally smaller than for the future period for example the pbias by sp par method varies within a range from 25 to 15 for the past period but the spread increases to a range from 45 to 35 for the future period in this case the uncertainty in simulated mean annual runoff due to the regionalization methods increases from the past to the future period comparing the methods in both periods the physical similarity approaches show similar spread in both periods whereas the other methods display larger differences compare with results presented in section 4 2 3 4 2 4 evaluation of regionalization methods by ranking index table 6 shows the ranking of the regionalization methods using the index ri proposed in section 3 3 2 as the evaluation criterion is probability based higher values mean better performance than lower values first the probability of being good performance for all regionalization methods in the future is lower than in the past period with an average decrease in ri of approximately 9 3 this result is consistent with those shown in figs 6 and 7 indicating that all regionalization methods will have higher likelihood of producing worse simulations in the future second the difference in ri between the regionalization methods increases from 7 14 0 939 0 875 0 939 100 for the past period to 10 8 0 918 0 825 0 918 100 for the future period these results are in line with those presented in section 4 2 1 see fig 5 third when comparing the regionalization methods in the past period the ri value for sp par approach 0 875 is smaller than for all other methods for the future period both spatial proximity methods show lower ri values less than 0 8 than other methods where the remaining methods all utilize catchment descriptors this result is partly related to the diversity of catchments characteristics in this study the spatial proximity methods do not seem able to capture the large variability in parameter values through space finally from the transferability aspect the phy par approach shows the smallest decrease 7 14 of probability for good performance from the past to the future period whereas the sp out and phy out methods show the largest decreases higher than 10 thus we conclude that the physical similarity method with the parameter option has the best transferability among all the transferability of regression method pcr is moderate when considering all methods 4 3 contribution of uncertainty from climate models and regionalization methods fig 9 shows boxplots of the variance decomposition for the predicted mean annual runoff for the 108 study catchments the contribution of the uncertainty from the climate models and regionalization methods varies strongly between the catchments from less than 10 to more than 90 overall the climate models show a larger contribution to the uncertainty median variance fraction equals to 51 compared to the regionalization methods median variance fraction equals to 40 the contribution of the interaction term between the climate models and regionalization methods is on the other hand of much smaller importance fig 10 shows a map of the variance decomposition results displaying the uncertainty contributions from climate models and regionalization methods for the individual catchments the uncertainty contributions vary largely between the basins which is consistent with other studies e g mendoza et al 2016 sunyer et al 2015 the regionalization methods typically dominate the uncertainty in most of the south eastern catchments and also in many of the catchments in middle and northern norway for the remaining catchments the climate models typically dominate the uncertainty in predicted mean annual runoff in almost all catchments the contribution of the interaction term between the climate models and regionalization methods is small with few exceptions therefore we can conclude that for most catchments the mean yearly runoff predictions from regionalization simulations do not depend on the selection of climate models catchments where the total uncertainty in the runoff predictions is dominated by the climate models tend to be located in coastal areas where precipitation is higher than in the inland regions fig 11 a displays the difference in uncertainty contributions between the climate models and regionalization methods against yearly mean precipitation for all study catchments when precipitation is higher than 3400 mm year the climate models give higher uncertainty than the regionalization methods at the same time the standard deviation in projected precipitation between the climate models also increases with precipitation amount fig 11b note that both panels use data from all climate model data during the future period 2071 2100 from the results in fig 11 it can be summarized that for catchments with high precipitation amounts or high variability of simulated precipitations between climate models the climate models dominate the total uncertainty of the runoff predictions however for catchments with precipitation lower than 3400 mm year climate models and regionalization methods both can dominate the total uncertainty of the runoff predictions thus we can conclude that the uncertainty contribution from regionalization methods is comparable with climate models for catchments with precipitation amounts lower than 3400 mm year in our study region fig 12 shows the normalized variances for climate models and regionalization methods computed using eqs 6 and 7 for simulated annual mean runoff the normalized variance for climate models is calculated by dividing vclimate for each catchment by the maximum value of vclimate for all catchments see also eqs 6 8 the same normalization is performed for the variance of the regionalization methods the normalized variances are much higher often a factor 10 or more in the coastal areas than the interior regions in the regions with high variances the climate models overall produce higher uncertainties than the regionalization methods these regions are characterized by higher precipitation amounts than the interior regions compare with fig 1 and the differences in projected precipitation by the climate models dominate over the parameter uncertainty given by the different regionalization methods on the contrary the variances from both climate models and regionalization methods are considerably smaller in the interior regions and some northern basins see also inset maps in fig 12 for many of these catchments the variance given by the regionalization methods exceeds the variance given by the climate models this result may be due to the lower precipitation magnitude and variability observed in these regions compare with fig 1b and fig 11b thus for areas with low precipitation amounts and variability the predicted runoff is more sensitive to variations in model parameter values given by the different regionalization methods than small changes in precipitation due to differences between climate models 5 discussion 5 1 model performance according to our results there are more than 50 catchments whose nse values are higher than 0 85 which is regarded as very good according to the classification presented by moriasi et al 2007 with a split sample test the model transferability can be assessed under different conditions including changes in climate klemeš 1986 in our case yearly mean precipitation has increased with approximately 115 mm and temperature has increased approximately 1 c from the period 1976 1990 to 1991 2005 our split sample test shows that nse values are higher than 0 7 and absolute values of pbias are lower than 15 for approximately 75 of catchments these high model performances indicate that the model is able to predict changes in runoff conditions under changing climate conditions the ability of wasmod for simulating runoff for different climate conditions has also been validated by xu 1999c 5 2 transferability of regionalization methods under climate change in this study we assessed the transferability of five regionalization methods under climate change we find that the capacity of the regionalized simulations to match the reference simulation declined from the past to the future period this behaviour may partly be explained by the argument from petheram et al 2012 who concluded that the correlation between catchment descriptors and the model performance becomes weaker for prediction than calibration mode in some cases our results showed systematic differences for the regionalization methods between the past and future period for example we found a positive correlation in the percentage bias pbias of simulated runoff between the two periods fig 8 according to this result we can deduce that for catchments where the regionalization method overestimates runoff for the past period will likely also overestimate runoff for the future period this has important implication for the choice of regionalization method when aiming for accurate predictions of average future runoff moreover the difference between the runoff simulations obtained by all regionalization methods appears to increase from the past to the future period thus for predicting runoff for the future period it is very important to select the methods with lowest uncertainty our results are similar to simulations using different hydrological models for gauged basins those simulations also tend to be more similar for the past historical period than the future projection period e g jiang et al 2007 each regionalization method performs differently under changed climate conditions using our ranking index we find that the physical similarity methods perform better than the spatial proximity methods for both periods see table 6 here the spatial proximity methods performs worse than in other studies e g oudin et al 2008 which may partly be explained by the fact that our network of available donor catchments has a lower density than in previous studies the density of donor catchments is considered as an important factor to impact the efficiency of spatial proximity methods lebecherel et al 2016 for the future period all regionalization methods that utilize catchment descriptors showed a better match with the reference simulation than the spatial proximity methods which only consider distance information from the past to future period the phy par approach shows the smallest decrease of the ranking index followed by regression and sp par methods and the largest drops are for sp out and phy out methods this result indicates that transferring model parameters as a whole set output option is most sensitive to changes in climate and therefore less robust than the remaining methods evaluated 5 3 contribution of uncertainty from climate models and regionalization methods as mentioned in many studies future predictions include uncertainty e g beven et al 2010 koutsoyiannis et al 2007 in this study we quantified the contribution of uncertainty from climate models regionalization methods and their interaction for predictions of runoff our analysis based on data from 108 catchments shows that overall the climate models contribute more to the total uncertainty than the regionalization methods this result is to some extent supported by earlier studies which have shown that the uncertainty stemming from climate models is larger than from the downscaling methods and or hydrological models e g addor et al 2014 chen et al 2011 etter et al 2017 osuch et al 2016 sunyer et al 2015 the interaction influence is considerably smaller and can almost be neglected which indicates that climate models and regionalization methods work almost independently from each other for runoff predictions while as our result is based on 108 catchments the result shows large variability between the catchments the climate models contribute most to the total uncertainty in coastal areas whereas the regionalization methods dominate the uncertainty in some inland regions the catchments where the uncertainty is dominated by climate models show higher precipitation amounts and variability than for the regions where the regionalization methods dominate the uncertainty furthermore the variance map shows that the uncertainty due to climate models shrinks considerably from the coast to inland whereas the variance by regionalization methods changes within a relatively narrow range for all catchments thus the regionalization methods dominate the total uncertainty in the inland regions because the climate models contribute considerably less to the uncertainty there than in the coastal regions in summary contribution of climate models to future prediction uncertainty is related to the precipitation amount and its variability in addition for regions with less precipitation or lower precipitation variability the uncertainty from regionalization methods cannot be neglected and can even be the dominant factor 6 conclusions in this study we evaluated the transferability of five regionalization methods for climate change studies using five different climate models the regionalization methods were tested against a reference simulation using locally calibrated parameters we also analysed whether the regionalization methods or the climate models dominated the total uncertainty in the predictions the study was performed using data from 108 catchments in norway a seasonally snow covered region with mountainous terrain the main conclusions from the study are summarized in the following points the match between simulations from all regionalization methods and the reference declined from the past to the future period while the performance in the future is positively correlated to the performance in the past period from past to future period the physical similarity method with the parameters averaged from the donor catchments phy par performs best whereas the distance based methods with output averaging option sp out and phy out are more sensitive to climate change impact the difference between the regionalised simulations tends to increase in the future compared to the past period for the runoff predictions of the future period the main source of uncertainty depends on catchment attributes the

6799,in the united states fluvial flood risk is managed by the national flood insurance program nfip which delineates areas that have a 1 chance of flooding each year i e the 100 year floodplain development within and adjacent to riverine floodplains exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and runoff volume shortening the time to peak and altering the extent of the floodplain this paper improves understanding of how future development can alter the 100 year floodplain in a watershed in houston tx through land use projection hydrologic and hydraulic modeling and implements a novel method for considering the impact of both regional trends in development and site scale development policies on runoff response the methodology presented in this paper integrates future development scenarios from a machine learning land use projection model with distributed hydrologic modeling and coupled 1d 2d unsteady hydraulic modeling to produce future floodplain estimates current site scale detention requirements are represented within the hydrologic model to evaluate the regional effectiveness of these policies under future development conditions in 2050 results indicate that the 100 year floodplain can expand by up to 12 5 across the watershed as a result of projected development in 2050 using current stormwater mitigation policies and the number of parcels within the floodplain can increase by up to 18 8 this study demonstrates how incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds and how existing land use policies may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future development keywords floodplain management flood risk land use land cover change urbanization distributed hydrologic model 1 introduction historical land development trends and policies have greatly exacerbated flood impacts within many urban watersheds across the united states us leopold 1968 ntelekos et al 2010 this is especially true in watersheds along the us gulf of mexico michel kerjan et al 2012 which have experienced high population growth in recent decades hallegatte et al 2013 and are highly vulnerable to flood hazard due to their mild topographic slopes and tropical climates fluvial systems in these areas are characterized by slow draining streams and wide floodplains hupp 2000 and across the country are increasingly impacted by development encroachment into the floodplain montz and gruntfest 1986 pinter 2005 development within and adjacent to the floodplain exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and overall runoff volume shortening the time to peak and ultimately altering the extent of the floodplain hollis 1975 rosburg et al 2017 suriya and mudgal 2012 in the us fluvial flood risk is characterized and managed through the national flood insurance program nfip which delineates a regulatory 100 year floodplain the area that has a 1 chance of flooding each year known as the special flood hazard area sfha however there is often a disconnect between the sfha and observed flood damage nrc 2014 that can be attributed in part to outdated floodplain maps which do not take into account changing land cover impacts on watershed response blessing et al 2017 for example one study found that over 60 of floodplain maps were at least 10 years old birkland et al 2003 in high growth areas like houston tx located along the upper texas gulf coast substantial land development can occur within a span of a few decades that can significantly alter the hydrologic behavior and undermine the sfha s capability to accurately represent current flood risk for example a recent study found strong correlation between increased urbanization and higher surface runoff in the cypress creek watershed in houston tx between 2001 and 2011 kim et al 2016 thus there is a need to develop methods that can quantify the impact of incremental land use changes on floodplain extent in order to determine when sfha maps should be updated since nfip map revisions are often not able to keep pace with changing watershed conditions development may be occurring in areas that are vulnerable to flooding but have not been designated as sfhas yet this paradigm poses a critical challenge to planners and engineers who seek to design long term flood management strategies in the face of future development uncertainty in order to accurately quantify evolving riverine flood risk in urbanizing watersheds it is necessary to develop future land use projections and model their impacts on floodplain extent although there have been many studies documenting the increase in peak flows and runoff volumes associated with historical urbanization doubleday et al 2013 rose and peters 2001 sheng and wilson 2009 vogel et al 2011 these impacts do not uniformly translate to increases in floodplain extent wheater and evans 2009 there is limited understanding of floodplain sensitivity to increases in overland runoff rates and volumes since topographic factors stream characteristics and the presence of existing flood infrastructure influence the ability of a watershed to accommodate increases in overland flow although there have been a few studies that have explicitly quantified increases in the 100 year floodplain resulting from urbanization habete and ferreira 2017 suriya and mudgal 2012 these studies have not considered the effect of existing site scale development policies which are intended to mitigate the impacts of new development there has been little research conducted on the regional effectiveness of site scale development policies such as on site detention retention to offset impacts of urbanization although there have been some studies examining the local runoff response of these site scale detention features mogollón et al 2016 there has been no consideration of their efficacy at the regional scale in addition to the best of the authors knowledge there has been no research examining how well these systems are able to mitigate impacts of future development on floodplain extent based on these previous studies two key knowledge gaps emerge 1 the extent to which future urbanization will increase existing 100 year floodplains and 2 the effectiveness of current site scale development policies in offsetting floodplain impacts from new development previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of coupling land use projection modeling with hydrologic modeling for watershed response characterization and flood risk quantification for example du et al 2012 coupled the lumped hydrologic model hec hms with markov chain and cellular automata land use projection model ca markov to develop future land use scenarios in the qinhaui river watershed in china and evaluate their impact on runoff response finding an increase in daily runoff of up to 13 9 during flood events similarly choi and deal 2008 coupled the land use projection model leamluc with a semi distributed hydrologic model hspf to evaluate future urbanization impacts on watershed runoff in the midwestern us more recently pumo et al 2017 implemented a fully distributed physics based hydrologic model tribs a stochastic weather generator and a ca markov land use model to characterize the joint impacts of climate and urbanization on watershed hydrologic processes wijesekara et al 2012 also implemented a fully distributed model to project changes in streamflow in a canadian catchment until 2031 however there has been no implementation of this coupling methodology for floodplain evolution assessment these previous studies have primarily investigated annual or daily runoff impacts of urbanization without considering the impact that these changes may have on flood inundation potential this study aims to address the limited understanding of watershed sensitivity to future development and the regional impacts of site scale mitigation by utilizing an approach that integrates land use projection modeling with hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to quantify floodplain increases under a range of future development conditions by linking land use projection modeling with hydrologic hydraulic analysis this paper evaluates the impacts of both regional patterns of development as well as site scale mitigation actions effectively considering the crucial feedback loop between anthropogenic activities hydrologic response and natural hazard management first a land use projection model for the region is developed and used to predict a low and high growth scenario for the year 2050 a time horizon chosen because it generated enough new development to have significant hydrologic impacts these scenarios are represented within a distributed hydrologic model to evaluate the impact of urbanization patterns as well as site scale development requirements on 100 year overland flows flow hydrographs are linked to an unsteady hydraulic model to assess development impacts on water surface elevations and ultimately produce current and future 100 year floodplain depths and extents floodplain results are analyzed to characterize watershed response to future development identify potentially vulnerable regions of the watershed and provide information about the effectiveness of existing policies in mitigating future flood risk this approach is applied to a case study watershed in northwest harris county that has experienced rapid development in recent years has been highly vulnerable to riverine flooding and is expected to continue developing rapidly in the future the following sections outline the study area and provide an overview of the modeling approach this is followed by detailed methods for each modeling step land use projection hydrologic analysis and hydraulic analysis case study results are presented for current and future development conditions with increases in flood risk measured as increases in floodplain extent and inundated parcels these results are discussed within the context of regional flood management planning and local development policy this paper concludes with a summary of the value of this approach for regional planning purposes and provides recommendations for future work 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cypress creek watershed is located north of the city of houston in northwest harris county along the upper texas gulf coast fig 1 this watershed serves as a prime case study area to apply this modeling approach because it has experienced high rates of development in recent years and recent precipitation events have highlighted the severe flood vulnerability of residents within the watershed the watershed encompasses a 692 km2 drainage area features over 400 km of open drainage channels and contains a population of 347 334 hcfcd 2017 the elevation of the watershed ranges from 6 6 m to 95 4 m above mean sea level msl and features an average overland slope value of 0 51 although the northwestern portion of the watershed has steeper slopes and the southern portion has milder slopes the vast majority of overland slopes range from 0 to 2 the cypress creek watershed is currently partially developed with the majority of developed land located on the east side of the watershed the western portion of the watershed is primarily composed of agricultural and natural prairie land fig 1 cypress creek serves as the primary drainage conduit for the watershed draining west to east until flowing into the san jacinto river the stream is slow draining since it has largely remained in its natural state with vegetation lining the banks and natural meanders however due to the flat topographic slopes in the southwestern portion of the watershed and the limited conveyance capacity of the stream water spills over the watershed divide and into the neighboring addicks reservoir watershed during high intensity rain events hcfcd 2017 inter basin overflow can occur during rain events greater than a 5 yr magnitude 14 7 cm in 24 h and result in significant volumes of overflow during higher intensity events hcfcd 2017 this complex hydraulic phenomenon is somewhat unique and poses a challenge for modeling the rainfall runoff response of the watershed since overflow rates depend on both rainfall intensity and downstream water surface elevations thus traditional 1d models have been unable to simulate the runoff dynamics during extreme rain events and are unable to accurately represent the 100 year floodplain in this portion of the watershed the cypress creek watershed has experienced several major flooding events over the last few years that have inundated thousands of homes and resulted in substantial economic losses during a storm event in april 2016 known as the tax day flood for example over 2000 homes were flooded in the cypress creek watershed alone and peak water elevations throughout the watershed far exceeded previous records lindner and fitzgerald 2016 more recently during hurricane harvey thousands of residents in the watershed experienced severe inundation over a period of several days sebastian et al 2017 leaving hundreds stranded in their homes recent flood events in the cypress creek watershed are even more concerning when considering the rapid development simultaneously occurring in the area from 2000 to 2010 the population of the watershed grew by 70 on average while development rates in the western portion were as high as 390 in one zip code zheng 2011 2 2 methodological approach overview the methodology presented in this paper links land use projection modeling with hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to more accurately understand the potential impacts of a range of future development scenarios on the delineation of the 100 year floodplain this approach consists of three main components 1 land use projection modeling to produce future development scenarios 2 hydrologic modeling to quantify changes in basin and tributary discharge rates and 3 hydraulic modeling to assess increases in maximum water surface elevation and map changes in 100 year floodplain extent fig 2 future land use scenarios in the cypress creek watershed are developed for 2050 in the form of a low development scenario and a high development scenario these scenarios serve as input to a calibrated hydrologic model and their impacts on overland flow are modeled for a 100 year design storm discharge hydrographs produced within the hydrologic model are linked to a coupled 1d 2d unsteady hydraulic model this model routes discharge hydrographs through the channel to produce stage hydrographs along cypress creek and ultimately quantify the 100 year maximum water surface elevations finally the maximum water surface elevation is used to map the extent and depth of the 100 year floodplain the following sections describe the methodology of each component in the modeling approach in more detail 2 3 land use projection model in order to assess the impact of future development in the cypress creek watershed future land use scenarios for the year 2050 were developed based on historical urbanization patterns in the houston galveston region although there is considerable uncertainty introduced by utilizing historical development patterns to project future growth in 2050 this approach is reasonable when considering the unique characteristics of the houston region the city has largely expanded radially from the downtown center over the past 50 years mostly due to the lack of zoning regulations qian 2010 making it a relatively straightforward region to project development in the future land use projections developed in this study represent a business as usual situation where future development occurs in largely the same way it has occurred over the past half century a multi layer perceptron artificial neural network mlpnn which is a widely used pattern recognition model pijanowski et al 2002 was selected to predict where development is likely to occur in 2050 this model was selected because it has been shown to consistently outperform other commonly used land use change models lin et al 2011 artificial neural networks anns are particularly suitable for quantifying the relationships between urbanization and drivers of development because they do not make assumptions about the normality in datasets can capture nonlinear relationships and can account for complex interactions between driver variables ji 2000 the mlpnn developed in this study utilizes a multivariate function that predicts the probability of transitioning from undeveloped to developed at any location based on the values from the driver variables 2 3 1 model setup and scenario development a variety of datasets were used in this study to model urban growth land use land cover lulc maps were obtained from the national land cover dataset nlcd for the time periods 2001 2006 and 2011 at a 30 m resolution these land cover datasets were selected because of their accuracy direct comparison capability across time and because they capture a decade of lulc change homer et al 2015 based on the focus of this study urban growth and the dominant landscape features of the study area the land cover imagery was reclassified into six lulc classes which included developed barren forest grassland agriculture and wetlands the remaining datasets were used to develop the a priori drivers of urban growth however there is no universal set of drivers of urban growth instead drivers were selected based off of findings from previous studies arsanjani et al 2012 hu and lo 2007 shafizadeh moghadam and helbich 2013 thapa and murayama 2012 and available data within the study area sources of data for the development of urban growth drivers included the census bureau the national hydrography dataset nhd houston galveston area council hgac and texas education agency tea the drivers derived from the datasets were grouped into three categories biophysical infrastructural and socioeconomic table 1 euclidean distances were used to measure distance to coast streams developed downtown schools roads and parks the two categorical variables land cover type and census place were converted into continuous variables using the evidence likelihood transformation which calculates the relative frequency of pixels that were developed between 2001 and 2006 within each category and then assigns each category that value finally percent economically disadvantaged was used as a proxy for school district performance as found in a recent national study rothwell 2012 a critical component of predicting future urban growth is the selection of the drivers that are associated with regional patterns of lulc change the selection of drivers was done in two parts the first was a preliminary exploratory analysis of the association between the a priori drivers and historical changes in development and the second was a more rigorous backwards stepwise constant forcing procedure in the first part cramer s v was used to test the potential explanatory power of each driver layer and development that occurred between 2001 and 2006 cramer s v ranges from 0 to 1 where a high value would indicate that a driver has a strong association with urbanization and a very low value would indicate that the driver should likely be discarded for this analysis drivers were removed if they below a cramer s v value of 0 15 eastman 2012 the second part i e backwards stepwise constant forcing is conducted after the mlpnn transition model is finished running with all the remaining drivers this procedure examines the relative power of each driver variable and then iteratively removes drivers starting with those that have the least power until the skill of the model begins to decline this procedure not only removes drivers with relatively little power in determining where development will occur but also reduces the likelihood of overfitting transition potential modeling begins once the final set of drivers has been selected at this stage an mlpnn is trained on a sub sample of cells within the study area half of which transitioned to development and half of which remained the same from 2001 and 2006 to train the mlpnn constructs a network of neurons between the driver variables and the types of transitions that occurred the mlpnn iteratively adjusts the weights between neurons until an optimal solution is found i e minimizes the root mean square error and maximizes accuracy the mlpnn produces an accuracy rate which expresses the capacity of the model to find the best combination of driving factors based on self learning and self modification an accuracy rate within the vicinity of 80 is considered acceptable eastman 2006 model validation was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic auc which has been efficient at evaluating accuracy of lulc change models peterson et al 2008 auc is based on an examination of correctly and incorrectly predicted change and generates a curve termed the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 5 represents randomness or no skill and a value of 1 represents perfect skill sangermano et al 2010 this test was conducted by comparing a modeled transition potential map for the year 2011 with what was actually developed in 2011 the transition potential map is essentially a 2011 development suitability map that calculates the probability of transitioning from undeveloped to developed for each cell transitions were modeled using the mlpnn with its associated underlying driver variables finally future urban growth demand was modeled using a markov chain procedure which determined the amount of development expected to occur in 2050 based on the conditional probability of each land cover type transitioning to development and historic rates of change constraints to development e g parks conservation easements and water bodies were incorporated to prevent these areas from being erroneously developed the model produced two outputs 1 a probability map for the entire watershed depicting the probability each cell would become developed by 2050 and 2 a predicted development map which represented the model s best guess at which areas would become urbanized by 2050 these outputs were then used to derive two scenarios high and low growth the scenarios were derived by expanding the 2050 prediction by 15 for high growth and shrinking the 2050 prediction by 15 for low growth based on the best guess scenario plus minus 15 more area based on the probability map these scenarios capture much of the uncertainty within the model and also produce a range in development that could occur given changes in development trends and land use policies 2 3 2 model performance results much of the built up area within the cypress creek watershed in 2001 was located in the far eastern part of the watershed closest to downtown houston between 2001 and 2006 development expanded westward converting approximately 59 32 km2 of undeveloped land most of which was forest 46 and agricultural land 31 all the drivers except two i e distance to parks and census place had an acceptable association cramer s v value greater than 0 15 with development multiple iterations of backwards stepwise constant forcing removed all the drivers that did not affect model performance the result of this process eliminated all the drivers except land cover type distance to development distance to downtown and distance to schools the final model with the four remaining drivers had an acceptable mlpnn accuracy rate of 82 48 and actually performed better than the model with all of the drivers i e accuracy rate increased by 1 76 this is likely a result of overfitting in the initial model due to the presence of too many variables with relatively poor explanatory power finally auc was used to measure the prediction accuracy of the mlpnn by comparing the transition probability prediction map of 2011 against what was actually developed in 2011 which resulted in an auc of 0 809 which is considered acceptable shooshtari and gholamalifard 2015 2 4 hydrologic model this study utilizes vflo a physics based distributed hydrologic model to simulate the rainfall runoff process vflo solves conservation of mass and momentum equations using a finite element approach and represents the physical characteristics of a watershed in gridded cell format vieux and bedient 2004 in the model domain each grid cell contains parameters that represent elevation soil type land cover characteristics and a flow direction that is defined based on relative elevation compared to surrounding cells grid cells can be designated as overland or channel cells and channel cross sections can be extracted from digital elevation data the model performs rainfall runoff calcaulations within each grid cell and overland flow between cells is routed via the kinematic wave analogy kwa which is a simplification of the 1d saint venant equations a full description of the kwa derivation is documented in vieux and vieux 2002 infiltration is calculated at each grid cell using the green ampt equation which depends on soil parameters of hydraulic conductivity wetting front suction head effective porosity and soil depth rawls et al 1983 in this study modified puls routing is utilized to model channel flow for the tributaries of cypress creek since it is more suitable for representing channel storage in mild sloped watersheds vieux and bedient 2004 distributed models are particularly useful for representing spatially diverse land cover characteristics and modeling land cover evolution through time since calculations are made at the grid cell level in contrast traditional lumped modeling methods often rely on empirical parameters derived at a subbasin scale which may not be able to accurately represent localized development changes blessing et al 2017 vflo has been successfully utilized to model development scenarios low impact development features and flood mitigation infrastructure doubleday et al 2013 fang et al 2010 juan et al 2017 additionally vflo was chosen because it has been widely applied and validated in the houston region for both inland and coastal watersheds blessing et al 2017 ray et al 2011 vieux and bedient 2004 2 4 1 model setup and calibration validation vflo model setup requires detailed elevation soil type and land cover information the model domain was delineated based on the harris county flood control district hcfcd watershed boundary and utilized a grid cell resolution of 91 m 300 ft which was determined based on a maximum model size of roughly 100 000 cells 2008 lidar digital elevation dem data was obtained from the houston galveston area council hgac and was utilized in the model to determine the slope of each cell and the overland flow direction grid and to extract cross section profiles for channel cells in the model soil type information was obtained the texas natural resources information system tnris and processed in arcgis according to rawls et al 1983 to obtain estimates of hydraulic conductivity effective porosity wetting front capillary pressure head and soil depth land cover data to represent current conditions in the watershed was obtained at 30 m resolution from a 2011 dataset within the national land cover database nlcd vflo is able to represent land cover use through a manning s roughness coefficient and a percent imperviousness applied at each grid cell roughness coefficients indicate the amount of frictional losses between flowing water and ground surface and impact the veloctiy of overland flow kalyanapu et al 2009 consequently natural areas of high vegetation or forest will have higher roughness coefficients and lower flow rates while concrete or pavement areas will have low roughness and high flow rate land cover categories from nlcd are converted to manning s roughness coefficients based on kalyanapu et al 2009 and impervious percentages are designated based on nlcd guidelines nlcd 2011 the hydrologic model was calibrated using two significant rainfall events one on april 17th 2016 and the other occurring on may 26th 2016 rainfall data for both events comes from next generation weather radar nexrad level ii and was obtained at 4 km spatial resolution and at 5 min intervals radar data was then calibrated against local rain gauges before applying to the vflo model the first rain event in april 2016 was an extreme precipitation event that dropped over 38 cm in 12 h on some parts of the watershed and resulted in the tax day flood described in section 2 1 lindner and fitzgerald 2016 this storm exceeded a 500 yr frequency event in the western portion of the watershed and a 100 yr frequency on average throughout the study area lindner and fitzgerald 2016 the second storm occurring on may 26th 2016 resulted in 12 7 17 8 cm across the watershed corresponding to roughly a 10 yr frequency event these two events were chosen because they represent a range of frequency storm magnitudes and because they occurred during the same time period this latter point is important in order to isolate and calibrate to the most recent development conditions calibration procedure for the model focused on adjusting soil parameters of hydraulic conductivity and soil depth which control the rate of infiltration and available ground storage additionally channel roughness values were adjusted to fine tune the timing and peak of the rising limb of the stream hydrographs calibration efforts focused on capturing the rising limb and peak of the observed hydrographs since these are important characteristics for flood modeling purposes the initial soil saturation parameter within the model was adjusted for each calibration event based on the presence of rainfall within the previous two weeks since no significant rainfall was observed before the april 2016 storm the soil saturation to set to zero for the may 2016 event there were several centimeteres of rainfall that occurred one week before the event so the soil saturation was set to 20 five usgs streamflow gages along cypress creek were used as calibration points fig 3 a the average peak flow difference and nash sutcliffe efficiency across the five gages was 2 1 and 0 80 and 1 2 and 0 74 for the april 2016 and may 2016 storms respectively with negative values indicating under prediction by the vflo model based on these performance metrics and the overall shape and timing of the comparison hydrographs the authors believe these are satisfactory calibration results fig 3a shows hydrograph comparisons at the middle gage location which is the most reliable gauge based on rating curve measurements in the watershed and fig 3b shows a comparison of modeled peak streamflow vs observed although the falling limb of the hydrograph is not as well captured by the vflo model for the april 2016 event shown in fig 3a the rising limb and peak match well with observed demonstrating the model s ability to adequately capture the flood wave in addition to calibration the vflo model was also validated against two additional rainfall events one was a smaller event 15 1 cm that occurred on march 15th 2016 and the other was hurricane harvey s extreme rainfall 75 4 cm which occurred august 25th 30th 2017 rainfall data for these events was also from nexrad level ii radar at 4 km resolution the average peak flow difference across the five gages was 2 4 and 8 22 for the march 2016 and august 2017 storms respectively with negative values indicating model underprediction fig 3c shows the modeled vs observed peak flows for these two storms indicating acceptable performance for both events for the august 2017 event modeled results matched well with observed for all gages except gage 4 where the model predicted a significantly higher peak than the observed however it is possible that this gage was malfunctioning during the storm since the match at the next downstream gage 5 was good 7 1 difference in peak flow in order to ensure accurate comparison between current and future conditions a 100 year design storm was applied to the current conditions vflo model to generate 100 year flow hydrographs the 100 year rainfall hyetograph for this region corrseponds to 31 5 cm in 24 h and was applied according to the soil and water conservation society swcs guidelines for a type iii 24 h storm event which is the same rainfall methodology applied by harris county floodplain managers in modeling a 100 year event storey et al 2010 2 4 2 site scale detention modeling methodology although roughness coefficients from kalyanapu et al 2009 are used to represent frictional losses for current development in the watershed these values were not applied to represent future development these values assume no on site detention measures and thus represent development impacts under a no mitigation scenario instead this study derives new roughness values based on development criteria from the hcfcd which is the primary floodplain regulatory agency in harris county and the topographic conditions of the cypress creek watershed according to hcfcd s policy criteria and procedure manual storey et al 2010 new developments must adhere to peak discharge rate restrictions that are defined for a 10 year and 100 year storm event for developments smaller than 2 59 km2 a simple site runoff curve can be used to determine the maximum allowable peak discharge for developments larger than 2 59 km2 more rigorous hydrologic and hydraulic modeling is needed to determine the appropriate on site detention requirements as a point of reference the size of each grid cell in the vflo model is 0 008 km2 for the purposes of this study it was assumed that all new developments would be the size of a single vflo grid cell so on site detention could be modeled using the site runoff curve equations to constrain the maximum discharge rate these curves are determined based on the following equation 1 q b a m where q is peak flow rate a is development area b is a factor based on impervious percent of the development and m a factor based on the size of the development for development areas less than 0 08 km2 m is equal to one and the equation simplifies to a linear relationship using this equation each grid cell in the vflo model that is projected to become developed in 2050 should have a peak discharge of less than 0 14 m3 s this methodology for calculating and applying the maximum discharge rate to each individual cell is appropriate for small medium developments because given the linear nature of the site runoff curves a group of developed cells would have a combined peak discharge that is still in compliance with the detention requirements for their collective area for example a new development the size of ten vflo grid cells has a maximum allowable discharge ten times that of an individual developed cell however for larger developments greater than 0 08 km2 the m parameter changes to 0 823 which results in smaller peak flows than would be calculated by using m equal to one since this study only utilizes the approach for small medium developments it may over predict the flow impacts since in reality the watershed might feature large developments as well that have a lower peak flow per acre rate still this approach allows site scale policies to be approximated at the watershed scale to facilitate more accurate analysis of flood impacts and by assuming only small medium developments represents a more conservative worst case scenario for future development impacts on site detention features were modeled at the grid cell level by adjusting the overland roughness parameter which impacts the rate of flow from the cell additionally the slope value of each grid cell also impacts the peak flow from that cell since each cell across the watershed has a different slope value it is necessary to develop an appropriate roughness parameter that can ensure cells with varying slope values are all still in compliance with policy guidelines thus a characteristic slope value so for the entire watershed was defined based on the distribution of slopes since steeper slopes produce higher peak flow values the 90th percentile value of the slope distribution was chosen to ensure that all slope values less than this threshold would be in compliance with the peak flow restrictions i e q in eq 1 s0 is applied to a single design grid cell and a 100 year rainfall is applied on this cell the overland roughness parameter is iteratively adjusted until the peak flow from the design cell reaches q 0 14 m3 s as calculated from eq 1 this adjusted roughness value is defined as r0 and represents the increased roughness from the presence of on site detention features next r0 is applied to all newly developed cells and the 100 year peak flow from a random sample of 100 cells is computed to ensure that the vast majority of cells are in compliance using this updated roughness value and that no significant approximation errors are introduced it should be noted that s0 is only utilized to determine an appropriate roughness value r0 and the analysis is performed using the actual slope value of each grid cell this process is summarized in four main steps in fig 4 based on the distribution of slope values fig 4 step 2 the characteristic slope value s0 was determined to be 2 0 then by applying this 2 0 slope to a single vflo cell and evaluating the peak flow from a 100 yr rainfall fig 4 step 3 the new roughness value r0 was determined to be 0 2 compared to 0 0678 under a no mitigation scenario kalyanapu et al 2009 this representative roughness was applied to all newly developed cells within the watershed and the 100 year peak flow for a random sample of 100 cells was tested to ensure compliance across the watershed fig 4 step 4 of the 100 cells tested 89 complied with peak flow requirements and only 11 exceeded the peak flow threshold however most of these cells were within 5 of the required peak flow and all cells were within 10 of the requirement thus this performance was deemed acceptable for modeling site scale detention 2 5 hydraulic model for this project hydraulic analysis was conducted using a hydraulic model hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system developed by the u s army corps of engineers this model has been used in a wide variety of applications including floodplain assessment flood insurance studies and dam breach analysis bass et al 2017 butt et al 2013 knebl et al 2005 mclin et al 2001 the primary function of hec ras is to calculate water surface elevations at channel cross sections or modeled storage areas of interest for any given flow rate the latest version of the software version 5 0 3 hec 2016 is capable of computing water surface profiles by performing one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d or combined 1d 2d hydraulic calculations based on energy and momentum equations in this study the effective hydraulic model of cypress creek watershed developed by hcfcd was used as reference this model is a 1d steady model and is used as the basis for generating the 100 yr fema floodplain the model generates a static water surface profile i e maximum water surface elevation along the entire channel based on peak discharges inputted at specific channel cross sections while a 1d steady model is useful for floodplain assessment and floodway encroachment studies it is insufficient to model the hydraulic performances of intricate systems where volume and timing are crucial such as the cypress creek overflow area in order to simulate the hydrodynamics at this particular location the effective hcfcd model was modified and converted to a 1d 2d unsteady hydraulic model the main advantage of an unsteady model compared to a steady model is that it can simulate the water surface profiles of entire storm hydrographs instead of just peak flows which provides a better understanding of the system s flow and stage response over time this is crucial for modeling the overflow area in cypress creek because the overflow dynamics depend on both stage hydrograph timing and peak the hec ras model was validated using the same two precipitation events that were used to calibrate the hydrologic model and additionally validated against the august 2017 event for a total of three validation events for each storm event basin and tributary flow hydrographs from the hydrologic model served as boundary data to the hec ras model at specified cross sections observed stage hydrographs for each storm served as the downstream boundary condition for the hec ras model since a stage gauge was located close to the outlet of cypress creek fig 5 finally initial water levels were determined by setting base flow as 1 of peak flow for each storm event since base flow in cypress creek is negligible during normal conditions the creek is only fed by rainwater these initial conditions were implemented to improve model stability as recommended by hec 2016 validation locations were determined based on the presence of high water marks in addition to peak water levels recorded at gauges along cypress creek maximum water depths modeled in hec ras were compared to high water marks along cypress creek for the april 2016 may 2016 and august 2017 storms additionally for the april 2016 and august 2017 storm events there were several high water marks recorded in the overflow area which were used to ensure a good match between modeled overflow depths and observed depths the average peak depth difference was 0 01 m 0 3 m and 0 12 m for the april 2016 may 2016 and august 2017 storms respectively with negative values indicating model under prediction and a comparison between modeled water depth and observed depth for both storms is shown in fig 5 although the model slightly under predicted depth for the may 2016 event it produced good results for the april 2016 event which is close to a 100 year magnitude and for the august 2017 event which was greater than a 500 year event fig a1 shows more detailed performance results indicating the location of each high water mark and the absolute difference between modeled and observed peak depth 3 results 3 1 future development scenarios as shown in fig 6 the cypress creek watershed is currently partially developed with a majority of the watershed composed of agricultural and natural lands development projections for 2050 predict that new development will occur in areas adjacent to existing development such as the undeveloped lands located in the middle and eastern portion of the watershed and new development trends will push westward into areas currently dominated by natural and agricultural land cover a comparison of 2011 land use 2050 low development and 2050 high development shown in fig 6 illustrates the trend of westward development and shows that the primary difference between the low and high development scenarios is the amount of development located in the western portion of the watershed table 2 indicates that development in 2050 is projected to grow by 37 54 5 becoming the dominant land use type within the watershed while developed land sees the largest gains in 2050 natural lands are projected to experience the highest losses decreasing by 54 61 agricultural lands remain relatively constant shrinking by only 11 24 these results suggest that future development within the cypress creek watershed could disproportionately impact natural land such as forests and wetlands compared to pasture and crop land fig 6 demonstrates this trend further showing that large areas of natural land are projected to become developed in 2050 3 2 floodplain extent fig 7 illustrates the extent of the 100 year floodplain under each of the three scenarios 2011 conditions 2050 low development and 2050 high development a comparison of the three floodplains illustrates that increases in floodplain extent are moderate along the middle and downstream portion of the watershed but are more severe in the upstream portion which is magnified in fig 7a this magnified area corresponds to the inter basin overflow area where cypress creek spills over its banks and into the neighboring addicks reservoir watershed fig 7b shows a portion of the midstream of cypress creek in this region floodplain increases are much less severe than in the overflow area table 3 shows the change in 100 year floodplain extent and increase in inundated residential parcels between 2050 development scenarios and 2011 conditions the 100 year floodplain extent is projected to increase by 8 4 12 5 across the watershed which corresponds to an increase in inundated area of 9 13 km2 the impact to residential parcels is more severe ranging from 12 3 to 18 8 increase compared to current conditions across the watershed this corresponds to an additional 361 550 impacted parcels these estimates only include existing residential parcels and do not take into account newly developed parcels in 2050 thus it is likely that table 2 under estimates the true increase in residential flood risk across the watershed instead it represents existing parcels that could become designated as special flood hazard areas sfhas in the future due to growth of the floodplain extent table 4 displays similar flood risk statistics as table 3 for the overflow area alone within the overflow area the floodplain extent is projected to increase by 16 4 23 and increase the number of inundated parcels by 21 25 these impacts are considerably greater than results across the entire watershed fig 8 depicts the channel morphology and increase in maximum water level in meters for two different cross sections in cypress creek one located in the upstream overflow area inside box a in fig 7 and one located in the midstream portion of the watershed inside box b in fig 7 along the overflow area the increase in maximum water level ranges from 0 05 m to 0 07 m corresponding to a low and high development scenario respectively in contrast the midstream area sees a 0 2 m to 0 34 m increase in maximum water level fig 8 also highlights the differences in channel morphology between the two areas depicting the flat slopes and limited channel storage present in the overflow area and the relatively steeper slopes and high storage capacity in the midstream area although the ground elevation relative to msl is different in each location fig 8 shows the same elevation change 10 m between the two cross sections 4 discussion 4 1 watershed sensitivity to future development the results indicate that the 100 year floodplain can expand by nearly a quarter of its original size as a result of nearly four decades of projected urbanization in the cypress creek watershed in general across the watershed a 1 increase in development translated into about a 0 23 increase in the extent of the floodplain the overflow area in particular was much more sensitive to future urbanization with impacts two times more severe than across the entire watershed even under a low development scenario the floodplain is projected to increase by more than 20 in the overflow area indicating that this region is highly sensitive to urbanization impacts in contrast the middle and downstream portion of the watershed appear to be fairly resilient to increases in development since they are able to accommodate large increases in future development without substantial increases in floodplain extent the difference in floodplain impacts between the overflow area and the middle downstream portions of the watershed is largely determined by changes in slope and channel storage capacity in the overflow region the ground slope is mild and there is little storage capacity outside the channel as shown in fig 8 this results in a wide floodplain extent even under current conditions since relatively small increases in water elevation result in large increases in inundation extent furthermore since cypress creek already has limited storage capacity in this location described in section 2 increases in runoff volume resulting from new development cannot be effectively stored or conveyed through the channel instead excess runoff volume spills over the channel banks and drains through the overflow area resulting in substantial increases to the 100 year floodplain in this area in contrast the middle and downstream portion of the channel has a large amount of overbank storage which is able to constrain the floodplain extent previous studies have also shown that the presence of overbank storage capacity can improve flood wave attenuation by storing excess floodwater castellarin et al 2011 woltemade and potter 1994 although the middle and downstream portions of the watershed do not experience a significant increase in floodplain extent these areas are still impacted by excess runoff from new development the midstream portion of the watershed experienced the largest increase in water depth up to 0 34 m under a high development scenario in contrast the overflow area experiences only a small increase in water level under both development scenarios this difference in water level increase between the two areas suggests that in the downstream region the effects of urbanization are translated into increases in flood depth rather than flood extent due to the topographic conditions of the area consequently although floodplain expansion is constrained in the middle and downstream portions of watershed which limits the increase in the number of newly inundated parcels parcels that are already within the 100 year floodplain in these locations may experience greater flood hazard due to increased water levels thus although floodplain impacts may not be as widespread in the downstream areas of cypress creek new development could exacerbate risk for structures that are already vulnerable to flooding 4 2 effectiveness of site scale detention features in addition to understanding overall watershed sensitivity to development and identifying vulnerable locations this study also evaluated the effectiveness of existing detention requirements to mitigate impacts from future development based on floodplain extent results it is clear that on site detention policies are unable to completely mitigate the impacts of future development previous studies have argued that on site detention systems that are dispersed across a watershed can better alleviate the impacts from new development compared to large regional detentions systems fletcher et al 2013 because they are better able to replicate pre development hydrologic response mccuen and rawls 1979 mogollón et al 2016 although these systems can mitigate increase in peak flow aulenbach et al 2017 they are generally most effective for intermediate storms rather than extreme precipitation events konrad and burges 2001 roughness coefficients were increased substantially to replicate the effect of on site detention standards for this area that were intended to preserve pre development hydrologic conditions however the impact of increased imperviousness overwhelmed the study s on site detention proxy resulting in increases in floodplain extents that disproportionately affected specific areas these results suggest that in addition to limiting peak flow rates with on site detention other hydrologic characteristics should be considered such as limiting runoff volume with on site retention furthermore the method presented in this study could be used to determine the necessary level of site scale mitigation necessary to achieve no adverse impacts at a regional scale development policies should be crafted by examining multiple spatial scales in order to properly quantify the cumulative impacts of development and set mitigation criteria that produces no adverse impacts across the entire watershed the application of an integrated approach for land use projection modeling and hydrologic hydraulic modeling to the cypress creek watershed highlights its usefulness for quantifying the impacts of future development trends and local development policies by taking into account both where development occurs regionally through the land use change drivers within the urban growth model and how development is managed at the site scale through representation of site scale detention within the hydrologic model this methodology is able to more accurately delineate areas of future risk since it considers both the future drivers of flood hazard and the specific development policies that seek to mitigate this hazard consideration of the interaction of between both these factors has not been implemented within a hydrologic modeling framework before and represents a significant step forward in the evaluation of the long term impacts of land development floodplain managers and engineers could utilize a similar approach to evaluate the long term effectiveness of flood infrastructure or different development policies under nonstationary land use specifically by considering the regional effectiveness of existing site scale development policies decision makers at the city county level can understand whether these policies will be sufficient to mitigate the long term impacts from incremental new development more broadly this approach could be utilized to determine when fema floodplain maps should be updated due to significant changes in the floodplain extent and this can help mitigate the persistence of outdated flood maps although many floodplain managers recognize the need to update fema maps periodically in practice it is difficult to determine when a hydrologic region has changed significantly enough to warrant a map revision this paper advances a method that quantifies the expected growth in the floodplain over several decades and can consequently provide specific information about when and how often map revisions are needed 5 conclusions this paper presented an approach for quantifying the contributions of future urbanization on evolving flood risk by considering the impact of both regional development patterns and site scale development policies on 100 year floodplain evolution specifically future development scenarios generated from a land use projection model and existing development policies regulated at the county level were represented within a distributed hydrologic model and unsteady hydraulic model to quantify impacts on the 100 year floodplain results demonstrated that future development in 2050 will increase the 100 year floodplain extent by 8 4 12 5 across the watershed and increase the number of parcels inside the 100 year floodplain by 12 3 18 8 additionally results from this study indicate that current on site detention policies which only regulate peak flow discharges from new developments are insufficient to entirely mitigate impacts from new development the results of this study represent an important contribution toward better understanding how future urbanization can impact riverine flood hazard in the houston region by developing and implementing a method to represent site scale detention features within a watershed scale hydrologic model this study also provides a valuable methodological contribution illustrating how the effectiveness of local development policies can be evaluated within the context of long term land use changes there are still several limitations associated with the modeling approach presented in this paper that should be addressed with future research efforts one of the primary limitations of the current approach is the method for representing site scale policies since it is assumed that all new developments are the same size in reality runoff impacts could be considerably different between different sized developments and the configuration of development traditional designs vs open space configurations could also impact runoff response another major limitation of the results presented in this study is the uncertainty associated with future land use scenarios although the land use projection model was validated against 2011 land use data the extrapolation of this model to 2050 introduces considerable uncertainty in the future development estimates the authors have attempted to take this into account by considering a low and high estimate and thereby capturing a range of potential development conditions but there is a need for more thorough uncertainty quantification of these scenarios future work will focus on addressing these limitations by investigating how different development sizes and configurations could produce differing runoff response and by investigating uncertainty quantification methods for the land use projections and hydrologic hydraulic models to ultimate propagate uncertainty into floodplain impact results despite the limitations mentioned above the methods and results presented in this paper improve understanding about the extent to which incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds this approach could be applied to a range of other riverine systems across the world and can aid in investigating and evaluating development regulations that could be more effective in mitigating flooding acknowledgements this work was supported by the nsf pire grant no oise 1545837 and by the texas water resources institute

6799,in the united states fluvial flood risk is managed by the national flood insurance program nfip which delineates areas that have a 1 chance of flooding each year i e the 100 year floodplain development within and adjacent to riverine floodplains exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and runoff volume shortening the time to peak and altering the extent of the floodplain this paper improves understanding of how future development can alter the 100 year floodplain in a watershed in houston tx through land use projection hydrologic and hydraulic modeling and implements a novel method for considering the impact of both regional trends in development and site scale development policies on runoff response the methodology presented in this paper integrates future development scenarios from a machine learning land use projection model with distributed hydrologic modeling and coupled 1d 2d unsteady hydraulic modeling to produce future floodplain estimates current site scale detention requirements are represented within the hydrologic model to evaluate the regional effectiveness of these policies under future development conditions in 2050 results indicate that the 100 year floodplain can expand by up to 12 5 across the watershed as a result of projected development in 2050 using current stormwater mitigation policies and the number of parcels within the floodplain can increase by up to 18 8 this study demonstrates how incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds and how existing land use policies may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future development keywords floodplain management flood risk land use land cover change urbanization distributed hydrologic model 1 introduction historical land development trends and policies have greatly exacerbated flood impacts within many urban watersheds across the united states us leopold 1968 ntelekos et al 2010 this is especially true in watersheds along the us gulf of mexico michel kerjan et al 2012 which have experienced high population growth in recent decades hallegatte et al 2013 and are highly vulnerable to flood hazard due to their mild topographic slopes and tropical climates fluvial systems in these areas are characterized by slow draining streams and wide floodplains hupp 2000 and across the country are increasingly impacted by development encroachment into the floodplain montz and gruntfest 1986 pinter 2005 development within and adjacent to the floodplain exacerbates flood losses by increasing peak discharge and overall runoff volume shortening the time to peak and ultimately altering the extent of the floodplain hollis 1975 rosburg et al 2017 suriya and mudgal 2012 in the us fluvial flood risk is characterized and managed through the national flood insurance program nfip which delineates a regulatory 100 year floodplain the area that has a 1 chance of flooding each year known as the special flood hazard area sfha however there is often a disconnect between the sfha and observed flood damage nrc 2014 that can be attributed in part to outdated floodplain maps which do not take into account changing land cover impacts on watershed response blessing et al 2017 for example one study found that over 60 of floodplain maps were at least 10 years old birkland et al 2003 in high growth areas like houston tx located along the upper texas gulf coast substantial land development can occur within a span of a few decades that can significantly alter the hydrologic behavior and undermine the sfha s capability to accurately represent current flood risk for example a recent study found strong correlation between increased urbanization and higher surface runoff in the cypress creek watershed in houston tx between 2001 and 2011 kim et al 2016 thus there is a need to develop methods that can quantify the impact of incremental land use changes on floodplain extent in order to determine when sfha maps should be updated since nfip map revisions are often not able to keep pace with changing watershed conditions development may be occurring in areas that are vulnerable to flooding but have not been designated as sfhas yet this paradigm poses a critical challenge to planners and engineers who seek to design long term flood management strategies in the face of future development uncertainty in order to accurately quantify evolving riverine flood risk in urbanizing watersheds it is necessary to develop future land use projections and model their impacts on floodplain extent although there have been many studies documenting the increase in peak flows and runoff volumes associated with historical urbanization doubleday et al 2013 rose and peters 2001 sheng and wilson 2009 vogel et al 2011 these impacts do not uniformly translate to increases in floodplain extent wheater and evans 2009 there is limited understanding of floodplain sensitivity to increases in overland runoff rates and volumes since topographic factors stream characteristics and the presence of existing flood infrastructure influence the ability of a watershed to accommodate increases in overland flow although there have been a few studies that have explicitly quantified increases in the 100 year floodplain resulting from urbanization habete and ferreira 2017 suriya and mudgal 2012 these studies have not considered the effect of existing site scale development policies which are intended to mitigate the impacts of new development there has been little research conducted on the regional effectiveness of site scale development policies such as on site detention retention to offset impacts of urbanization although there have been some studies examining the local runoff response of these site scale detention features mogollón et al 2016 there has been no consideration of their efficacy at the regional scale in addition to the best of the authors knowledge there has been no research examining how well these systems are able to mitigate impacts of future development on floodplain extent based on these previous studies two key knowledge gaps emerge 1 the extent to which future urbanization will increase existing 100 year floodplains and 2 the effectiveness of current site scale development policies in offsetting floodplain impacts from new development previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of coupling land use projection modeling with hydrologic modeling for watershed response characterization and flood risk quantification for example du et al 2012 coupled the lumped hydrologic model hec hms with markov chain and cellular automata land use projection model ca markov to develop future land use scenarios in the qinhaui river watershed in china and evaluate their impact on runoff response finding an increase in daily runoff of up to 13 9 during flood events similarly choi and deal 2008 coupled the land use projection model leamluc with a semi distributed hydrologic model hspf to evaluate future urbanization impacts on watershed runoff in the midwestern us more recently pumo et al 2017 implemented a fully distributed physics based hydrologic model tribs a stochastic weather generator and a ca markov land use model to characterize the joint impacts of climate and urbanization on watershed hydrologic processes wijesekara et al 2012 also implemented a fully distributed model to project changes in streamflow in a canadian catchment until 2031 however there has been no implementation of this coupling methodology for floodplain evolution assessment these previous studies have primarily investigated annual or daily runoff impacts of urbanization without considering the impact that these changes may have on flood inundation potential this study aims to address the limited understanding of watershed sensitivity to future development and the regional impacts of site scale mitigation by utilizing an approach that integrates land use projection modeling with hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to quantify floodplain increases under a range of future development conditions by linking land use projection modeling with hydrologic hydraulic analysis this paper evaluates the impacts of both regional patterns of development as well as site scale mitigation actions effectively considering the crucial feedback loop between anthropogenic activities hydrologic response and natural hazard management first a land use projection model for the region is developed and used to predict a low and high growth scenario for the year 2050 a time horizon chosen because it generated enough new development to have significant hydrologic impacts these scenarios are represented within a distributed hydrologic model to evaluate the impact of urbanization patterns as well as site scale development requirements on 100 year overland flows flow hydrographs are linked to an unsteady hydraulic model to assess development impacts on water surface elevations and ultimately produce current and future 100 year floodplain depths and extents floodplain results are analyzed to characterize watershed response to future development identify potentially vulnerable regions of the watershed and provide information about the effectiveness of existing policies in mitigating future flood risk this approach is applied to a case study watershed in northwest harris county that has experienced rapid development in recent years has been highly vulnerable to riverine flooding and is expected to continue developing rapidly in the future the following sections outline the study area and provide an overview of the modeling approach this is followed by detailed methods for each modeling step land use projection hydrologic analysis and hydraulic analysis case study results are presented for current and future development conditions with increases in flood risk measured as increases in floodplain extent and inundated parcels these results are discussed within the context of regional flood management planning and local development policy this paper concludes with a summary of the value of this approach for regional planning purposes and provides recommendations for future work 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cypress creek watershed is located north of the city of houston in northwest harris county along the upper texas gulf coast fig 1 this watershed serves as a prime case study area to apply this modeling approach because it has experienced high rates of development in recent years and recent precipitation events have highlighted the severe flood vulnerability of residents within the watershed the watershed encompasses a 692 km2 drainage area features over 400 km of open drainage channels and contains a population of 347 334 hcfcd 2017 the elevation of the watershed ranges from 6 6 m to 95 4 m above mean sea level msl and features an average overland slope value of 0 51 although the northwestern portion of the watershed has steeper slopes and the southern portion has milder slopes the vast majority of overland slopes range from 0 to 2 the cypress creek watershed is currently partially developed with the majority of developed land located on the east side of the watershed the western portion of the watershed is primarily composed of agricultural and natural prairie land fig 1 cypress creek serves as the primary drainage conduit for the watershed draining west to east until flowing into the san jacinto river the stream is slow draining since it has largely remained in its natural state with vegetation lining the banks and natural meanders however due to the flat topographic slopes in the southwestern portion of the watershed and the limited conveyance capacity of the stream water spills over the watershed divide and into the neighboring addicks reservoir watershed during high intensity rain events hcfcd 2017 inter basin overflow can occur during rain events greater than a 5 yr magnitude 14 7 cm in 24 h and result in significant volumes of overflow during higher intensity events hcfcd 2017 this complex hydraulic phenomenon is somewhat unique and poses a challenge for modeling the rainfall runoff response of the watershed since overflow rates depend on both rainfall intensity and downstream water surface elevations thus traditional 1d models have been unable to simulate the runoff dynamics during extreme rain events and are unable to accurately represent the 100 year floodplain in this portion of the watershed the cypress creek watershed has experienced several major flooding events over the last few years that have inundated thousands of homes and resulted in substantial economic losses during a storm event in april 2016 known as the tax day flood for example over 2000 homes were flooded in the cypress creek watershed alone and peak water elevations throughout the watershed far exceeded previous records lindner and fitzgerald 2016 more recently during hurricane harvey thousands of residents in the watershed experienced severe inundation over a period of several days sebastian et al 2017 leaving hundreds stranded in their homes recent flood events in the cypress creek watershed are even more concerning when considering the rapid development simultaneously occurring in the area from 2000 to 2010 the population of the watershed grew by 70 on average while development rates in the western portion were as high as 390 in one zip code zheng 2011 2 2 methodological approach overview the methodology presented in this paper links land use projection modeling with hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to more accurately understand the potential impacts of a range of future development scenarios on the delineation of the 100 year floodplain this approach consists of three main components 1 land use projection modeling to produce future development scenarios 2 hydrologic modeling to quantify changes in basin and tributary discharge rates and 3 hydraulic modeling to assess increases in maximum water surface elevation and map changes in 100 year floodplain extent fig 2 future land use scenarios in the cypress creek watershed are developed for 2050 in the form of a low development scenario and a high development scenario these scenarios serve as input to a calibrated hydrologic model and their impacts on overland flow are modeled for a 100 year design storm discharge hydrographs produced within the hydrologic model are linked to a coupled 1d 2d unsteady hydraulic model this model routes discharge hydrographs through the channel to produce stage hydrographs along cypress creek and ultimately quantify the 100 year maximum water surface elevations finally the maximum water surface elevation is used to map the extent and depth of the 100 year floodplain the following sections describe the methodology of each component in the modeling approach in more detail 2 3 land use projection model in order to assess the impact of future development in the cypress creek watershed future land use scenarios for the year 2050 were developed based on historical urbanization patterns in the houston galveston region although there is considerable uncertainty introduced by utilizing historical development patterns to project future growth in 2050 this approach is reasonable when considering the unique characteristics of the houston region the city has largely expanded radially from the downtown center over the past 50 years mostly due to the lack of zoning regulations qian 2010 making it a relatively straightforward region to project development in the future land use projections developed in this study represent a business as usual situation where future development occurs in largely the same way it has occurred over the past half century a multi layer perceptron artificial neural network mlpnn which is a widely used pattern recognition model pijanowski et al 2002 was selected to predict where development is likely to occur in 2050 this model was selected because it has been shown to consistently outperform other commonly used land use change models lin et al 2011 artificial neural networks anns are particularly suitable for quantifying the relationships between urbanization and drivers of development because they do not make assumptions about the normality in datasets can capture nonlinear relationships and can account for complex interactions between driver variables ji 2000 the mlpnn developed in this study utilizes a multivariate function that predicts the probability of transitioning from undeveloped to developed at any location based on the values from the driver variables 2 3 1 model setup and scenario development a variety of datasets were used in this study to model urban growth land use land cover lulc maps were obtained from the national land cover dataset nlcd for the time periods 2001 2006 and 2011 at a 30 m resolution these land cover datasets were selected because of their accuracy direct comparison capability across time and because they capture a decade of lulc change homer et al 2015 based on the focus of this study urban growth and the dominant landscape features of the study area the land cover imagery was reclassified into six lulc classes which included developed barren forest grassland agriculture and wetlands the remaining datasets were used to develop the a priori drivers of urban growth however there is no universal set of drivers of urban growth instead drivers were selected based off of findings from previous studies arsanjani et al 2012 hu and lo 2007 shafizadeh moghadam and helbich 2013 thapa and murayama 2012 and available data within the study area sources of data for the development of urban growth drivers included the census bureau the national hydrography dataset nhd houston galveston area council hgac and texas education agency tea the drivers derived from the datasets were grouped into three categories biophysical infrastructural and socioeconomic table 1 euclidean distances were used to measure distance to coast streams developed downtown schools roads and parks the two categorical variables land cover type and census place were converted into continuous variables using the evidence likelihood transformation which calculates the relative frequency of pixels that were developed between 2001 and 2006 within each category and then assigns each category that value finally percent economically disadvantaged was used as a proxy for school district performance as found in a recent national study rothwell 2012 a critical component of predicting future urban growth is the selection of the drivers that are associated with regional patterns of lulc change the selection of drivers was done in two parts the first was a preliminary exploratory analysis of the association between the a priori drivers and historical changes in development and the second was a more rigorous backwards stepwise constant forcing procedure in the first part cramer s v was used to test the potential explanatory power of each driver layer and development that occurred between 2001 and 2006 cramer s v ranges from 0 to 1 where a high value would indicate that a driver has a strong association with urbanization and a very low value would indicate that the driver should likely be discarded for this analysis drivers were removed if they below a cramer s v value of 0 15 eastman 2012 the second part i e backwards stepwise constant forcing is conducted after the mlpnn transition model is finished running with all the remaining drivers this procedure examines the relative power of each driver variable and then iteratively removes drivers starting with those that have the least power until the skill of the model begins to decline this procedure not only removes drivers with relatively little power in determining where development will occur but also reduces the likelihood of overfitting transition potential modeling begins once the final set of drivers has been selected at this stage an mlpnn is trained on a sub sample of cells within the study area half of which transitioned to development and half of which remained the same from 2001 and 2006 to train the mlpnn constructs a network of neurons between the driver variables and the types of transitions that occurred the mlpnn iteratively adjusts the weights between neurons until an optimal solution is found i e minimizes the root mean square error and maximizes accuracy the mlpnn produces an accuracy rate which expresses the capacity of the model to find the best combination of driving factors based on self learning and self modification an accuracy rate within the vicinity of 80 is considered acceptable eastman 2006 model validation was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic auc which has been efficient at evaluating accuracy of lulc change models peterson et al 2008 auc is based on an examination of correctly and incorrectly predicted change and generates a curve termed the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 5 represents randomness or no skill and a value of 1 represents perfect skill sangermano et al 2010 this test was conducted by comparing a modeled transition potential map for the year 2011 with what was actually developed in 2011 the transition potential map is essentially a 2011 development suitability map that calculates the probability of transitioning from undeveloped to developed for each cell transitions were modeled using the mlpnn with its associated underlying driver variables finally future urban growth demand was modeled using a markov chain procedure which determined the amount of development expected to occur in 2050 based on the conditional probability of each land cover type transitioning to development and historic rates of change constraints to development e g parks conservation easements and water bodies were incorporated to prevent these areas from being erroneously developed the model produced two outputs 1 a probability map for the entire watershed depicting the probability each cell would become developed by 2050 and 2 a predicted development map which represented the model s best guess at which areas would become urbanized by 2050 these outputs were then used to derive two scenarios high and low growth the scenarios were derived by expanding the 2050 prediction by 15 for high growth and shrinking the 2050 prediction by 15 for low growth based on the best guess scenario plus minus 15 more area based on the probability map these scenarios capture much of the uncertainty within the model and also produce a range in development that could occur given changes in development trends and land use policies 2 3 2 model performance results much of the built up area within the cypress creek watershed in 2001 was located in the far eastern part of the watershed closest to downtown houston between 2001 and 2006 development expanded westward converting approximately 59 32 km2 of undeveloped land most of which was forest 46 and agricultural land 31 all the drivers except two i e distance to parks and census place had an acceptable association cramer s v value greater than 0 15 with development multiple iterations of backwards stepwise constant forcing removed all the drivers that did not affect model performance the result of this process eliminated all the drivers except land cover type distance to development distance to downtown and distance to schools the final model with the four remaining drivers had an acceptable mlpnn accuracy rate of 82 48 and actually performed better than the model with all of the drivers i e accuracy rate increased by 1 76 this is likely a result of overfitting in the initial model due to the presence of too many variables with relatively poor explanatory power finally auc was used to measure the prediction accuracy of the mlpnn by comparing the transition probability prediction map of 2011 against what was actually developed in 2011 which resulted in an auc of 0 809 which is considered acceptable shooshtari and gholamalifard 2015 2 4 hydrologic model this study utilizes vflo a physics based distributed hydrologic model to simulate the rainfall runoff process vflo solves conservation of mass and momentum equations using a finite element approach and represents the physical characteristics of a watershed in gridded cell format vieux and bedient 2004 in the model domain each grid cell contains parameters that represent elevation soil type land cover characteristics and a flow direction that is defined based on relative elevation compared to surrounding cells grid cells can be designated as overland or channel cells and channel cross sections can be extracted from digital elevation data the model performs rainfall runoff calcaulations within each grid cell and overland flow between cells is routed via the kinematic wave analogy kwa which is a simplification of the 1d saint venant equations a full description of the kwa derivation is documented in vieux and vieux 2002 infiltration is calculated at each grid cell using the green ampt equation which depends on soil parameters of hydraulic conductivity wetting front suction head effective porosity and soil depth rawls et al 1983 in this study modified puls routing is utilized to model channel flow for the tributaries of cypress creek since it is more suitable for representing channel storage in mild sloped watersheds vieux and bedient 2004 distributed models are particularly useful for representing spatially diverse land cover characteristics and modeling land cover evolution through time since calculations are made at the grid cell level in contrast traditional lumped modeling methods often rely on empirical parameters derived at a subbasin scale which may not be able to accurately represent localized development changes blessing et al 2017 vflo has been successfully utilized to model development scenarios low impact development features and flood mitigation infrastructure doubleday et al 2013 fang et al 2010 juan et al 2017 additionally vflo was chosen because it has been widely applied and validated in the houston region for both inland and coastal watersheds blessing et al 2017 ray et al 2011 vieux and bedient 2004 2 4 1 model setup and calibration validation vflo model setup requires detailed elevation soil type and land cover information the model domain was delineated based on the harris county flood control district hcfcd watershed boundary and utilized a grid cell resolution of 91 m 300 ft which was determined based on a maximum model size of roughly 100 000 cells 2008 lidar digital elevation dem data was obtained from the houston galveston area council hgac and was utilized in the model to determine the slope of each cell and the overland flow direction grid and to extract cross section profiles for channel cells in the model soil type information was obtained the texas natural resources information system tnris and processed in arcgis according to rawls et al 1983 to obtain estimates of hydraulic conductivity effective porosity wetting front capillary pressure head and soil depth land cover data to represent current conditions in the watershed was obtained at 30 m resolution from a 2011 dataset within the national land cover database nlcd vflo is able to represent land cover use through a manning s roughness coefficient and a percent imperviousness applied at each grid cell roughness coefficients indicate the amount of frictional losses between flowing water and ground surface and impact the veloctiy of overland flow kalyanapu et al 2009 consequently natural areas of high vegetation or forest will have higher roughness coefficients and lower flow rates while concrete or pavement areas will have low roughness and high flow rate land cover categories from nlcd are converted to manning s roughness coefficients based on kalyanapu et al 2009 and impervious percentages are designated based on nlcd guidelines nlcd 2011 the hydrologic model was calibrated using two significant rainfall events one on april 17th 2016 and the other occurring on may 26th 2016 rainfall data for both events comes from next generation weather radar nexrad level ii and was obtained at 4 km spatial resolution and at 5 min intervals radar data was then calibrated against local rain gauges before applying to the vflo model the first rain event in april 2016 was an extreme precipitation event that dropped over 38 cm in 12 h on some parts of the watershed and resulted in the tax day flood described in section 2 1 lindner and fitzgerald 2016 this storm exceeded a 500 yr frequency event in the western portion of the watershed and a 100 yr frequency on average throughout the study area lindner and fitzgerald 2016 the second storm occurring on may 26th 2016 resulted in 12 7 17 8 cm across the watershed corresponding to roughly a 10 yr frequency event these two events were chosen because they represent a range of frequency storm magnitudes and because they occurred during the same time period this latter point is important in order to isolate and calibrate to the most recent development conditions calibration procedure for the model focused on adjusting soil parameters of hydraulic conductivity and soil depth which control the rate of infiltration and available ground storage additionally channel roughness values were adjusted to fine tune the timing and peak of the rising limb of the stream hydrographs calibration efforts focused on capturing the rising limb and peak of the observed hydrographs since these are important characteristics for flood modeling purposes the initial soil saturation parameter within the model was adjusted for each calibration event based on the presence of rainfall within the previous two weeks since no significant rainfall was observed before the april 2016 storm the soil saturation to set to zero for the may 2016 event there were several centimeteres of rainfall that occurred one week before the event so the soil saturation was set to 20 five usgs streamflow gages along cypress creek were used as calibration points fig 3 a the average peak flow difference and nash sutcliffe efficiency across the five gages was 2 1 and 0 80 and 1 2 and 0 74 for the april 2016 and may 2016 storms respectively with negative values indicating under prediction by the vflo model based on these performance metrics and the overall shape and timing of the comparison hydrographs the authors believe these are satisfactory calibration results fig 3a shows hydrograph comparisons at the middle gage location which is the most reliable gauge based on rating curve measurements in the watershed and fig 3b shows a comparison of modeled peak streamflow vs observed although the falling limb of the hydrograph is not as well captured by the vflo model for the april 2016 event shown in fig 3a the rising limb and peak match well with observed demonstrating the model s ability to adequately capture the flood wave in addition to calibration the vflo model was also validated against two additional rainfall events one was a smaller event 15 1 cm that occurred on march 15th 2016 and the other was hurricane harvey s extreme rainfall 75 4 cm which occurred august 25th 30th 2017 rainfall data for these events was also from nexrad level ii radar at 4 km resolution the average peak flow difference across the five gages was 2 4 and 8 22 for the march 2016 and august 2017 storms respectively with negative values indicating model underprediction fig 3c shows the modeled vs observed peak flows for these two storms indicating acceptable performance for both events for the august 2017 event modeled results matched well with observed for all gages except gage 4 where the model predicted a significantly higher peak than the observed however it is possible that this gage was malfunctioning during the storm since the match at the next downstream gage 5 was good 7 1 difference in peak flow in order to ensure accurate comparison between current and future conditions a 100 year design storm was applied to the current conditions vflo model to generate 100 year flow hydrographs the 100 year rainfall hyetograph for this region corrseponds to 31 5 cm in 24 h and was applied according to the soil and water conservation society swcs guidelines for a type iii 24 h storm event which is the same rainfall methodology applied by harris county floodplain managers in modeling a 100 year event storey et al 2010 2 4 2 site scale detention modeling methodology although roughness coefficients from kalyanapu et al 2009 are used to represent frictional losses for current development in the watershed these values were not applied to represent future development these values assume no on site detention measures and thus represent development impacts under a no mitigation scenario instead this study derives new roughness values based on development criteria from the hcfcd which is the primary floodplain regulatory agency in harris county and the topographic conditions of the cypress creek watershed according to hcfcd s policy criteria and procedure manual storey et al 2010 new developments must adhere to peak discharge rate restrictions that are defined for a 10 year and 100 year storm event for developments smaller than 2 59 km2 a simple site runoff curve can be used to determine the maximum allowable peak discharge for developments larger than 2 59 km2 more rigorous hydrologic and hydraulic modeling is needed to determine the appropriate on site detention requirements as a point of reference the size of each grid cell in the vflo model is 0 008 km2 for the purposes of this study it was assumed that all new developments would be the size of a single vflo grid cell so on site detention could be modeled using the site runoff curve equations to constrain the maximum discharge rate these curves are determined based on the following equation 1 q b a m where q is peak flow rate a is development area b is a factor based on impervious percent of the development and m a factor based on the size of the development for development areas less than 0 08 km2 m is equal to one and the equation simplifies to a linear relationship using this equation each grid cell in the vflo model that is projected to become developed in 2050 should have a peak discharge of less than 0 14 m3 s this methodology for calculating and applying the maximum discharge rate to each individual cell is appropriate for small medium developments because given the linear nature of the site runoff curves a group of developed cells would have a combined peak discharge that is still in compliance with the detention requirements for their collective area for example a new development the size of ten vflo grid cells has a maximum allowable discharge ten times that of an individual developed cell however for larger developments greater than 0 08 km2 the m parameter changes to 0 823 which results in smaller peak flows than would be calculated by using m equal to one since this study only utilizes the approach for small medium developments it may over predict the flow impacts since in reality the watershed might feature large developments as well that have a lower peak flow per acre rate still this approach allows site scale policies to be approximated at the watershed scale to facilitate more accurate analysis of flood impacts and by assuming only small medium developments represents a more conservative worst case scenario for future development impacts on site detention features were modeled at the grid cell level by adjusting the overland roughness parameter which impacts the rate of flow from the cell additionally the slope value of each grid cell also impacts the peak flow from that cell since each cell across the watershed has a different slope value it is necessary to develop an appropriate roughness parameter that can ensure cells with varying slope values are all still in compliance with policy guidelines thus a characteristic slope value so for the entire watershed was defined based on the distribution of slopes since steeper slopes produce higher peak flow values the 90th percentile value of the slope distribution was chosen to ensure that all slope values less than this threshold would be in compliance with the peak flow restrictions i e q in eq 1 s0 is applied to a single design grid cell and a 100 year rainfall is applied on this cell the overland roughness parameter is iteratively adjusted until the peak flow from the design cell reaches q 0 14 m3 s as calculated from eq 1 this adjusted roughness value is defined as r0 and represents the increased roughness from the presence of on site detention features next r0 is applied to all newly developed cells and the 100 year peak flow from a random sample of 100 cells is computed to ensure that the vast majority of cells are in compliance using this updated roughness value and that no significant approximation errors are introduced it should be noted that s0 is only utilized to determine an appropriate roughness value r0 and the analysis is performed using the actual slope value of each grid cell this process is summarized in four main steps in fig 4 based on the distribution of slope values fig 4 step 2 the characteristic slope value s0 was determined to be 2 0 then by applying this 2 0 slope to a single vflo cell and evaluating the peak flow from a 100 yr rainfall fig 4 step 3 the new roughness value r0 was determined to be 0 2 compared to 0 0678 under a no mitigation scenario kalyanapu et al 2009 this representative roughness was applied to all newly developed cells within the watershed and the 100 year peak flow for a random sample of 100 cells was tested to ensure compliance across the watershed fig 4 step 4 of the 100 cells tested 89 complied with peak flow requirements and only 11 exceeded the peak flow threshold however most of these cells were within 5 of the required peak flow and all cells were within 10 of the requirement thus this performance was deemed acceptable for modeling site scale detention 2 5 hydraulic model for this project hydraulic analysis was conducted using a hydraulic model hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system developed by the u s army corps of engineers this model has been used in a wide variety of applications including floodplain assessment flood insurance studies and dam breach analysis bass et al 2017 butt et al 2013 knebl et al 2005 mclin et al 2001 the primary function of hec ras is to calculate water surface elevations at channel cross sections or modeled storage areas of interest for any given flow rate the latest version of the software version 5 0 3 hec 2016 is capable of computing water surface profiles by performing one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d or combined 1d 2d hydraulic calculations based on energy and momentum equations in this study the effective hydraulic model of cypress creek watershed developed by hcfcd was used as reference this model is a 1d steady model and is used as the basis for generating the 100 yr fema floodplain the model generates a static water surface profile i e maximum water surface elevation along the entire channel based on peak discharges inputted at specific channel cross sections while a 1d steady model is useful for floodplain assessment and floodway encroachment studies it is insufficient to model the hydraulic performances of intricate systems where volume and timing are crucial such as the cypress creek overflow area in order to simulate the hydrodynamics at this particular location the effective hcfcd model was modified and converted to a 1d 2d unsteady hydraulic model the main advantage of an unsteady model compared to a steady model is that it can simulate the water surface profiles of entire storm hydrographs instead of just peak flows which provides a better understanding of the system s flow and stage response over time this is crucial for modeling the overflow area in cypress creek because the overflow dynamics depend on both stage hydrograph timing and peak the hec ras model was validated using the same two precipitation events that were used to calibrate the hydrologic model and additionally validated against the august 2017 event for a total of three validation events for each storm event basin and tributary flow hydrographs from the hydrologic model served as boundary data to the hec ras model at specified cross sections observed stage hydrographs for each storm served as the downstream boundary condition for the hec ras model since a stage gauge was located close to the outlet of cypress creek fig 5 finally initial water levels were determined by setting base flow as 1 of peak flow for each storm event since base flow in cypress creek is negligible during normal conditions the creek is only fed by rainwater these initial conditions were implemented to improve model stability as recommended by hec 2016 validation locations were determined based on the presence of high water marks in addition to peak water levels recorded at gauges along cypress creek maximum water depths modeled in hec ras were compared to high water marks along cypress creek for the april 2016 may 2016 and august 2017 storms additionally for the april 2016 and august 2017 storm events there were several high water marks recorded in the overflow area which were used to ensure a good match between modeled overflow depths and observed depths the average peak depth difference was 0 01 m 0 3 m and 0 12 m for the april 2016 may 2016 and august 2017 storms respectively with negative values indicating model under prediction and a comparison between modeled water depth and observed depth for both storms is shown in fig 5 although the model slightly under predicted depth for the may 2016 event it produced good results for the april 2016 event which is close to a 100 year magnitude and for the august 2017 event which was greater than a 500 year event fig a1 shows more detailed performance results indicating the location of each high water mark and the absolute difference between modeled and observed peak depth 3 results 3 1 future development scenarios as shown in fig 6 the cypress creek watershed is currently partially developed with a majority of the watershed composed of agricultural and natural lands development projections for 2050 predict that new development will occur in areas adjacent to existing development such as the undeveloped lands located in the middle and eastern portion of the watershed and new development trends will push westward into areas currently dominated by natural and agricultural land cover a comparison of 2011 land use 2050 low development and 2050 high development shown in fig 6 illustrates the trend of westward development and shows that the primary difference between the low and high development scenarios is the amount of development located in the western portion of the watershed table 2 indicates that development in 2050 is projected to grow by 37 54 5 becoming the dominant land use type within the watershed while developed land sees the largest gains in 2050 natural lands are projected to experience the highest losses decreasing by 54 61 agricultural lands remain relatively constant shrinking by only 11 24 these results suggest that future development within the cypress creek watershed could disproportionately impact natural land such as forests and wetlands compared to pasture and crop land fig 6 demonstrates this trend further showing that large areas of natural land are projected to become developed in 2050 3 2 floodplain extent fig 7 illustrates the extent of the 100 year floodplain under each of the three scenarios 2011 conditions 2050 low development and 2050 high development a comparison of the three floodplains illustrates that increases in floodplain extent are moderate along the middle and downstream portion of the watershed but are more severe in the upstream portion which is magnified in fig 7a this magnified area corresponds to the inter basin overflow area where cypress creek spills over its banks and into the neighboring addicks reservoir watershed fig 7b shows a portion of the midstream of cypress creek in this region floodplain increases are much less severe than in the overflow area table 3 shows the change in 100 year floodplain extent and increase in inundated residential parcels between 2050 development scenarios and 2011 conditions the 100 year floodplain extent is projected to increase by 8 4 12 5 across the watershed which corresponds to an increase in inundated area of 9 13 km2 the impact to residential parcels is more severe ranging from 12 3 to 18 8 increase compared to current conditions across the watershed this corresponds to an additional 361 550 impacted parcels these estimates only include existing residential parcels and do not take into account newly developed parcels in 2050 thus it is likely that table 2 under estimates the true increase in residential flood risk across the watershed instead it represents existing parcels that could become designated as special flood hazard areas sfhas in the future due to growth of the floodplain extent table 4 displays similar flood risk statistics as table 3 for the overflow area alone within the overflow area the floodplain extent is projected to increase by 16 4 23 and increase the number of inundated parcels by 21 25 these impacts are considerably greater than results across the entire watershed fig 8 depicts the channel morphology and increase in maximum water level in meters for two different cross sections in cypress creek one located in the upstream overflow area inside box a in fig 7 and one located in the midstream portion of the watershed inside box b in fig 7 along the overflow area the increase in maximum water level ranges from 0 05 m to 0 07 m corresponding to a low and high development scenario respectively in contrast the midstream area sees a 0 2 m to 0 34 m increase in maximum water level fig 8 also highlights the differences in channel morphology between the two areas depicting the flat slopes and limited channel storage present in the overflow area and the relatively steeper slopes and high storage capacity in the midstream area although the ground elevation relative to msl is different in each location fig 8 shows the same elevation change 10 m between the two cross sections 4 discussion 4 1 watershed sensitivity to future development the results indicate that the 100 year floodplain can expand by nearly a quarter of its original size as a result of nearly four decades of projected urbanization in the cypress creek watershed in general across the watershed a 1 increase in development translated into about a 0 23 increase in the extent of the floodplain the overflow area in particular was much more sensitive to future urbanization with impacts two times more severe than across the entire watershed even under a low development scenario the floodplain is projected to increase by more than 20 in the overflow area indicating that this region is highly sensitive to urbanization impacts in contrast the middle and downstream portion of the watershed appear to be fairly resilient to increases in development since they are able to accommodate large increases in future development without substantial increases in floodplain extent the difference in floodplain impacts between the overflow area and the middle downstream portions of the watershed is largely determined by changes in slope and channel storage capacity in the overflow region the ground slope is mild and there is little storage capacity outside the channel as shown in fig 8 this results in a wide floodplain extent even under current conditions since relatively small increases in water elevation result in large increases in inundation extent furthermore since cypress creek already has limited storage capacity in this location described in section 2 increases in runoff volume resulting from new development cannot be effectively stored or conveyed through the channel instead excess runoff volume spills over the channel banks and drains through the overflow area resulting in substantial increases to the 100 year floodplain in this area in contrast the middle and downstream portion of the channel has a large amount of overbank storage which is able to constrain the floodplain extent previous studies have also shown that the presence of overbank storage capacity can improve flood wave attenuation by storing excess floodwater castellarin et al 2011 woltemade and potter 1994 although the middle and downstream portions of the watershed do not experience a significant increase in floodplain extent these areas are still impacted by excess runoff from new development the midstream portion of the watershed experienced the largest increase in water depth up to 0 34 m under a high development scenario in contrast the overflow area experiences only a small increase in water level under both development scenarios this difference in water level increase between the two areas suggests that in the downstream region the effects of urbanization are translated into increases in flood depth rather than flood extent due to the topographic conditions of the area consequently although floodplain expansion is constrained in the middle and downstream portions of watershed which limits the increase in the number of newly inundated parcels parcels that are already within the 100 year floodplain in these locations may experience greater flood hazard due to increased water levels thus although floodplain impacts may not be as widespread in the downstream areas of cypress creek new development could exacerbate risk for structures that are already vulnerable to flooding 4 2 effectiveness of site scale detention features in addition to understanding overall watershed sensitivity to development and identifying vulnerable locations this study also evaluated the effectiveness of existing detention requirements to mitigate impacts from future development based on floodplain extent results it is clear that on site detention policies are unable to completely mitigate the impacts of future development previous studies have argued that on site detention systems that are dispersed across a watershed can better alleviate the impacts from new development compared to large regional detentions systems fletcher et al 2013 because they are better able to replicate pre development hydrologic response mccuen and rawls 1979 mogollón et al 2016 although these systems can mitigate increase in peak flow aulenbach et al 2017 they are generally most effective for intermediate storms rather than extreme precipitation events konrad and burges 2001 roughness coefficients were increased substantially to replicate the effect of on site detention standards for this area that were intended to preserve pre development hydrologic conditions however the impact of increased imperviousness overwhelmed the study s on site detention proxy resulting in increases in floodplain extents that disproportionately affected specific areas these results suggest that in addition to limiting peak flow rates with on site detention other hydrologic characteristics should be considered such as limiting runoff volume with on site retention furthermore the method presented in this study could be used to determine the necessary level of site scale mitigation necessary to achieve no adverse impacts at a regional scale development policies should be crafted by examining multiple spatial scales in order to properly quantify the cumulative impacts of development and set mitigation criteria that produces no adverse impacts across the entire watershed the application of an integrated approach for land use projection modeling and hydrologic hydraulic modeling to the cypress creek watershed highlights its usefulness for quantifying the impacts of future development trends and local development policies by taking into account both where development occurs regionally through the land use change drivers within the urban growth model and how development is managed at the site scale through representation of site scale detention within the hydrologic model this methodology is able to more accurately delineate areas of future risk since it considers both the future drivers of flood hazard and the specific development policies that seek to mitigate this hazard consideration of the interaction of between both these factors has not been implemented within a hydrologic modeling framework before and represents a significant step forward in the evaluation of the long term impacts of land development floodplain managers and engineers could utilize a similar approach to evaluate the long term effectiveness of flood infrastructure or different development policies under nonstationary land use specifically by considering the regional effectiveness of existing site scale development policies decision makers at the city county level can understand whether these policies will be sufficient to mitigate the long term impacts from incremental new development more broadly this approach could be utilized to determine when fema floodplain maps should be updated due to significant changes in the floodplain extent and this can help mitigate the persistence of outdated flood maps although many floodplain managers recognize the need to update fema maps periodically in practice it is difficult to determine when a hydrologic region has changed significantly enough to warrant a map revision this paper advances a method that quantifies the expected growth in the floodplain over several decades and can consequently provide specific information about when and how often map revisions are needed 5 conclusions this paper presented an approach for quantifying the contributions of future urbanization on evolving flood risk by considering the impact of both regional development patterns and site scale development policies on 100 year floodplain evolution specifically future development scenarios generated from a land use projection model and existing development policies regulated at the county level were represented within a distributed hydrologic model and unsteady hydraulic model to quantify impacts on the 100 year floodplain results demonstrated that future development in 2050 will increase the 100 year floodplain extent by 8 4 12 5 across the watershed and increase the number of parcels inside the 100 year floodplain by 12 3 18 8 additionally results from this study indicate that current on site detention policies which only regulate peak flow discharges from new developments are insufficient to entirely mitigate impacts from new development the results of this study represent an important contribution toward better understanding how future urbanization can impact riverine flood hazard in the houston region by developing and implementing a method to represent site scale detention features within a watershed scale hydrologic model this study also provides a valuable methodological contribution illustrating how the effectiveness of local development policies can be evaluated within the context of long term land use changes there are still several limitations associated with the modeling approach presented in this paper that should be addressed with future research efforts one of the primary limitations of the current approach is the method for representing site scale policies since it is assumed that all new developments are the same size in reality runoff impacts could be considerably different between different sized developments and the configuration of development traditional designs vs open space configurations could also impact runoff response another major limitation of the results presented in this study is the uncertainty associated with future land use scenarios although the land use projection model was validated against 2011 land use data the extrapolation of this model to 2050 introduces considerable uncertainty in the future development estimates the authors have attempted to take this into account by considering a low and high estimate and thereby capturing a range of potential development conditions but there is a need for more thorough uncertainty quantification of these scenarios future work will focus on addressing these limitations by investigating how different development sizes and configurations could produce differing runoff response and by investigating uncertainty quantification methods for the land use projections and hydrologic hydraulic models to ultimate propagate uncertainty into floodplain impact results despite the limitations mentioned above the methods and results presented in this paper improve understanding about the extent to which incremental land use changes can significantly alter the reality of flood risk in urbanizing watersheds this approach could be applied to a range of other riverine systems across the world and can aid in investigating and evaluating development regulations that could be more effective in mitigating flooding acknowledgements this work was supported by the nsf pire grant no oise 1545837 and by the texas water resources institute
