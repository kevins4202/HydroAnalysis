estimated from the equation obtained from linear regression of the k values for degradation of ampr segments kampr by o3 vs segment length figure s4 the error values of k puc19 were calculated using error propagation for the linear relationship between k puc19 and kampr bthe degradation of ampr segments was modeled by the two step fac reaction model as described in the main text section 3 4 with k fac amp and k fac ampn cl as the rate constants of the first and second steps respectively with k fac ampn cl values for each ampr segment obtained from weighted linear regression of corresponding experimental k obs fac values over their regions of maximal slope vs fac 0 and with k fac n cl bp obtained from weighted linear regression of experimental k fac ampn cl values for each ampr segment vs

respectively csecond order rate constants for the gene ampr deactivation by o3 or fac were determined from the linear slopes of plots of log10 scale transforming activity loss vs oxidant exposure

deactivation kinetics of an antibiotic resistance gene arg by ozone o3 and free available chlorine fac were investigated in phosphate buffered solutions at ph 7 for o3 in the presence of tert butanol and ph 6 8 or 8 1 for fac we used a plasmid puc19 encoded ampicillin resistance gene ampr in both extracellular e and intracellular i forms the second order rate constant k o3 for degradation of 2686 base pair bp long e puc19 toward o3 which was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was calculated to be 2 105 m 1s 1 the deactivation rate constants of e puc19 by o3 measured with various recipient e coli strains were within a factor of 2 compared with the degradation rate constant for e puc19 the degradation deactivation kinetics of i puc19 were similar to those of e puc19 indicating only a minor influence of cellular components on o3 reactivity toward i puc19 for fac the degradation and deactivation rates of e puc19 were decreased in the presence of tert butanol implying involvement of direct fac as well as some radical e g oh reactions the degradation rates of e ampr segments by direct fac reaction could be explained by a previously reported two step sequential reaction model in which the rate constants increased linearly with e ampr segment length the deactivation rate constants of e puc19 during exposure to fac were variable by a factor of up to 4 3 for the different recipient strains revealing the role of dna repair in the observed deactivation efficiencies the degradation deactivation of e puc19 were significantly faster at ph 6 8 than at ph 8 1 owing to ph dependent fac speciation variation whereas i puc19 kinetics exhibited much smaller dependence on ph demonstrating intracellular plasmid dna reactions with fac occurred at cytoplasmic ph 7 5 our results are useful for predicting and or measuring the degradation deactivation efficiency of plasmid encoded args by water treatment with ozonation and chlorination graphical

human and animal health as it has lowered the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment against bacterial infections united nations 2019 although antibiotic resistance occurs naturally the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have accelerated its dissemination amongst bacterial communities by selecting bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes args responsible for antibiotic resistance traits davies and davies 2010 args are now considered as contaminants of concern in various aquatic environments as arg transfer via natural anthropogenic water cycles can potentially contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance to pathogens czekalski et al 2012 dodd 2012 pruden et al 2006 args exist in aquatic environments within bacterial cells i e intracellularly but also extracellularly where the latter are generated by lysis of dead cells or secretion from live cells zhang et al 2018 both extra e and intracellular i args are of concern considering the potential for dissemination of antibiotic resistance dodd 2012 nagler et al 2018 antibiotic resistance can be disseminated within bacterial populations by sharing of mobile args contained within bacteriophages plasmids and chromosomal dna through horizontal gene transfer hgt processes including conjugation cell to cell contact transduction viral delivery and transformation uptake of free dna thomas and nielsen 2005 disinfection and oxidation of drinking water and wastewater serve as important barriers to the spread of pathogenic microorganisms in urban water systems jacangelo and trussell 2002 free available chlorine fac and ozone o3 are widely used for disinfection and o3 is also employed for chemical contaminant elimination von gunten 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the efficacy of water disinfection and oxidation processes in mitigating args has received increasing attention dodd 2012 various studies have employed quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays of dna damage to show that fac and o3 are capable of degrading args alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 he et al 2019 pak et al 2016 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however fundamental kinetic parameters e g bimolecular rate constants and molecular level reaction models for arg degradation by these oxidants are still scarce which has hindered comparison and generalization of arg removal efficacies by different water disinfectants oxidants only a limited number of recent studies have reported such information on the degradation of plasmid borne and or chromosomal args he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 and none of these have specifically addressed o3 reactions with plasmid borne args furthermore kinetics of args deactivation i e loss of arg transforming activity where transforming activity is defined here as the ability of an intact arg to confer a resistance trait to a non resistant bacterial cell via the hgt process of transformation have been investigated in only a few studies chang et al 2017 he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 none of which have focused specifically on the deactivation of plasmid borne args by o3 and fac qpcr methods have been widely used to quantify structurally intact args and monitor their degradation in water disinfection oxidation alexander et al 2016 chang et al 2017 czekalski et al 2016 he et al 2019 mckinney and pruden 2012 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however it is important to note that most qpcr methods monitor only a part of a target arg s sequence e g segment sizes of 200 1000 base pairs bps but not the entire sequence related to the biological activity of the arg thus short segment based e g 200 bps qpcr methods may underestimate arg damage and associated loss of arg transforming activity chang et al 2017 he et al 2019 yoon et al 2018 moreover qpcr methods do not simulate uptake and repair of dna by recipient bacterial cells which can play important roles in modulating transforming activity of args chang et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 in addition the dna replication efficiency in qpcr methods can be different from that in bacterial cells subjected to gene transformation e g due to differences in dna polymerases correlations between the degradation of target arg segments typically measured by qpcr and the removal of arg transforming activity measured by transformation assay have been found for some plasmid borne chang et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 as well as chromosomal args he et al 2019 during treatment with certain water disinfectants and oxidants with explanations hypothesized based on molecular mechanisms of dna transformation for the relevant bacterial strains he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 nevertheless further study is needed of the relationships between degradation and deactivation of args by o3 and fac this investigation was in turn undertaken with the goals of i providing carefully determined kinetics parameters for degradation and deactivation of plasmid borne args by o3 and fac ii improving the fundamental understanding of how o3 and fac contribute to damage of plasmid dna and how that relates to observed arg degradation and deactivation kinetics and iii investigating the role of dna damage repair in governing observed arg deactivation kinetics by each oxidant an overarching aim of this work was to advance the quantitative and conceptual foundations for characterizing modeling and predicting the fate of plasmid borne args during water and wastewater chlorination and ozonation a plasmid puc19 carrying an ampicillin resistance gene ampr was used as an extracellular arg e arg and escherichia coli strain dh5α transformed with puc19 was used to represent an intracellular arg i arg the e and i puc19 were prepared in phosphate buffered solutions and exposed to different levels of o3 with tert butanol and fac without and with tert butanol the treated samples were analyzed by qpcr for quantifying ampr degradation arg transformation assays for quantifying ampr deactivation and agarose gel electrophoresis the observed kinetic behaviors were used to derive kinetic models and corresponding rate constants and then applied to predict degradation rate constants for the entire puc19 plasmid by each disinfectant the arg transformation assays employed five e coli strains with varying dna damage repair abilities in order to assess the influence of dna repair on observed arg deactivation kinetics finally degradation and deactivation kinetics of ampr were compared and discussed with respect to explaining and predicting the elimination efficiency of arg transforming activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents chemicals and

reactions a continuous flow quenched reaction system was used according to procedures described previously he et al 2019 all o3 experiments were carried out in the presence of tert butanol 10 mm to scavenge hydroxyl radical oh flyunt et al 2003b moreover 10 mm of tert butanol on its own had negligible effect on the ampr segment in a control test conducted in the absence of o3 chlorination was

using graphpad prism 7 or nonlinear regressions using microsoft excel solver for determining second order or pseudo first order rate constants and associated uncertainties standard errors or deviations for each ampr segment in its reactions with o3 and fac weighted linear regressions were applied to perform uncertainty weighted regression analyses of ampr segment specific second order rate constants vs segment length or pseudo first order rate constants of each segment vs fac concentrations according to previously reported methods he et al 2019 since these rate constants themselves carry associated uncertainties 3 results and discussions 3 1 degradation of e args by o3 solutions containing puc19 were exposed to increasing o3 exposures 0 0 15 mgo3 l min at ph 7 with oh scavenged by tert butanol the results fig 1a showed that the 192 bp e ampr segment was degraded by 1 2 log at an o3 exposure of 0 15 mgo3 l min whereas a 4 log decrease was achieved for the 851 bps e ampr segment at this o3 exposure the degradation of e ampr segments measured by qpcr followed linear kinetics with increasing o3 exposure r2 0 99 fig 1a indicating first order reaction kinetics with respect to e ampr and o3 respectively and overall second order reaction kinetics choi et al 2021a the second order rate constants for the e ampr segments degradation by o3 could be determined from the slopes of the curves shown in fig 1a i e k o3 amp 2 303 slope and were 1 6 0 1 104 3 1 0 2 104 4 6 0 3 104 and 6 1 0 3 104 m 1s 1 for the 192 400 603 and 851 bp segments respectively table 1 the increasing k o3 amp values of e ampr segments with increasing segment size can be explained by the increasing number of potential o3 reaction sites on longer segments our k o3 amp values were in good agreement with rate constants previously reported for similar length segments 266 1017 bp of the chromosomal blt gene of bacillus subtilis he et al 2019 indicating similar reactivities of plasmid borne and chromosomal dna toward o3 the k o3 plasmid of e puc19 could be predicted by extrapolating the k o3 amp of each segment to the entire plasmid i e k o 3 plasmid k o 3 amp 2686 bp amplicon length where amplicon length was 192 400 603 or 851 bp based on the assumption that the o3 reactivity per bp is the same across the entire plasmid the k o3 plasmid values predicted from the 192 400 603 and 851 bps segments were 2 2 0 1 105 2 1 0 1 105 2 0 0 1 105 and 1 9 0 1 105 m 1s 1 respectively yielding an average k o3 plasmid value of 2 1 0 2 105 m 1s 1 alternatively the k o3 plasmid of the entire plasmid could be predicted by incorporating the total bp number of puc19 2686 bps into the equation resulting from linear regression of k o3 amp vs the number of at gc bps in each ampr segment that is k o3 amp in m 1s 1 70 7 at gc 2 4 103 figure s4 this yielded a similar k o3 plasmid value of 1 9 0 4 105 m 1s 1 the slope of this linear equation 71 2 m at gc 1s 1 represents the sequence independent average rate constant for the reaction of o3 with a single base pair of double stranded ds plasmid dna a similar value of 65 7 m at gc 1s 1 has been reported for the sequence independent rate constant for the reaction of o3 with ds chromosomal dna using the blt gene he et al 2019 overall the k o3 plasmid of e puc19 is estimated to be 2 105 m 1s 1 based on the values obtained using the two different methods described above structural change of puc19 upon exposure to o3 was investigated by using agarose gel electrophoresis analyses fig 2a the intact puc19 before o3 exposure showed a band at a lower position than the linearized plasmid i e ecori treated puc19 since plasmid dna normally exists in a supercoiled form which migrates faster than its linear form in agarose gels the position of the band for the supercoiled form did not change upon o3 exposures in the presence of tert butanol 0 0 15 mgo3 l min this suggests that the puc19 retained its supercoiled structure without significant conformational change such as strand breakage despite the expected significant level of nucleoside degradation of the plasmid dna at the applied o3 exposures among nucleosides the reactivity of o3 is high with thymidine 3 0 104 m 1s 1 and guanosine 1 6 104 m 1s 1 intermediate with cytidine 3 5 103 m 1s 1 and low with adenosine 16 m 1s 1 theruvathu et al 2001 where the terms in parentheses are k values for the reaction of o3 with the neutral form of each nucleoside consistent with the order of o3 reactivity of the nucleoside monomers thymine and guanine bases were found to be the preferential degradation sites in ds plasmid dna exposed to o3 sawadaishi et al 1986 based on a detailed product study with thymine and thymidine flyunt et al 2002 ring opening products caused by c 5 c 6 double bond cleavage are expected to be formed from the reaction of o3 with pyrimidine bases contrary to the results of the present study the conversion of plasmid conformation from initial supercoiled to relaxed circular or linear forms was observed in a previous ozonation study sawadaishi et al 1985 this could be due to the formation of oh from the reaction of o3 with dna as it is well known that oh can induce dna strand breakage von sonntag 2006 in the current study oh was fully scavenged by tert butanol resulting in negligible plasmid conformational change 3 2 deactivation of e args by o3 the deactivation of e puc19 by o3 was investigated by analyzing the former s transforming activity using non ampicillin resistant recipient e coli cells having varying dna repair abilities the transforming activity loss rate of o3 treated e puc19 was variable depending on the recipient strain used fig 1a for the three repair deficient e coli mutants ab2480 uvra reca ab1186 uvra and ab2463 reca no transformant was detectable at the lowest o3 exposure applied 0 03 mgo3 l min indicating a 4 log decrease fig 1a by assuming second order reaction kinetics for e puc19 deactivation by o3 the k o3 transformation value was in turn estimated to be 2 5 105 m 1s 1 for the three e coli strains deficient in dna repair ability the loss of transforming activity was slower for e coli ab1157 wild type and dh5α reca enda than repair deficient e coli ab strains and followed first order kinetics with respect to o3 the k o3 transformation values were calculated to be 1 6 0 3 105 m 1s 1 for ab1157 and 1 0 0 2 105 m 1s 1 for dh5α from the slopes of plots of log10 scale transforming activity loss vs o3 exposure multiplied by a factor of 2 303 k o3 values for the degradation of e ampr segments the full e puc19 plasmid predicted and the loss of plasmid transforming activity as measured using the various recipient strains are compared in fig 3a and 3b the estimated degradation rate constant for the entire plasmid 2 105 m 1s 1 as noted above overestimated the rate constants for puc19 deactivation observed for strains ab1157 wild type and dh5α reca enda but the difference in the rate constants was small differing by factors of 1 3 and 2 1 respectively the plasmid deactivation rate constant estimated using the three dna repair deficient strains was 2 5 105 m 1s 1 which was also close to the predicted degradation rate constant for the entire plasmid differing by factors of 1 3 these results suggest that every instance of o3 induced dna damage e g base oxidation in puc19 effectively led to deactivation of the plasmid loss of transforming activity when the repair deficient uvra and or reca e coli strains were used for the wild type and dh5α reca enda e coli strains it appears that not every o3 induced dna lesion resulted in plasmid deactivation due to repair of some fraction of the dna damage by the recipient cells the reca protein encoded by the reca gene plays an important role in the repair of single strand gaps or double strand breakages by homologous recombination shinohara and ogawa 1995 the uvrabc proteins encoded by the uvra uvrb and uvrc genes are responsible for the nucleotide excision repair of various types of dna lesions such as the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6 4 photoproducts formed during uv irradiation kisker et al 2013 it is possible that reca or uvra is also capable of repairing some of the o3 induced dna damage which may explain the lower deactivation rate constant when using the wild type e coli as a recipient strain compared with the reca and or uvra deficient strains notably strain dh5α showed the lowest deactivation rate among the tested strains despite its lack of reca the same trend has also been observed during treatment of puc19 by uv and oh and explained by the lack of the enda gene in dh5α rendering it inherently more active for taking up intact plasmids and thus gene transformation nihemaiti et al 2020 3 3 degradation and deactivation of i args during exposure to o3 degradation and deactivation of i args were investigated by exposing e coli dh5α harboring puc19 to o3 at ph 7 in the presence of tert butanol 10 mm overall the kinetic behavior in the degradation and deactivation of i args fig 1b was similar to that for e args fig 1a and the k o3 values of i args were lower than those of e args by factors of only 1 2 1 5 p 0 05 table 1 k o3 for the degradation of i ampr segments i puc19 and the loss of plasmid transforming activities for the i args are compared in fig 3c and 3d the k o3 plasmid values predicted from the 192 400 603 and 851 bps segments were 1 6 0 1 105 1 6 0 1 105 1 7 0 1 105 and 1 5 0 1 105 m 1s 1 respectively yielding an average k o3 plasmid value of 1 6 0 2 105 m 1s 1 the k o3 transformation values were 1 1 0 5 105 m 1s 1 for ab1157 and 6 6 0 5 104 m 1s 1 for dh5α from the slopes of plots of log10 scale transforming activity loss vs o3 exposure the predicted i puc19 degradation rate constants therefore overestimated the deactivation rate constants by factors of 1 5 and 2 4 for ab1157 and dh5α respectively similar to the case of e args the deactivation rate constants for i args were too fast to be captured by the transformation assays using the three repair deficient e coli strains ab1886 ab2463 and ab2480 as shown in fig 1b and a k o3 transformation value for i args could only be estimated as 2 105 m 1s 1 when using these strains table 1 fig 3d overall our results show that the e coli cell envelope and other cellular constituents did not significantly hinder the ability of o3 to reach and react with intracellular puc19 3 4 degradation of e args during exposure to fac 1 effect of tert butanol and involvement of radical reaction solutions containing e puc19 were exposed to fac at ph 6 8 at different fac exposures 0 100 mgcl2 l min and quenched with thiosulfate to terminate the reaction the results fig 4 open symbols showed that the degradation of e ampr segments became gradually faster with increasing fac exposure the degradation rate was lowest for the 192 bp segment and increased with increasing length of the e ampr segments it was found that degradation of the e ampr segments in this study was considerably faster than degradation of similar length e blt gene segments in another recent study by our groups he et al 2019 when compared at the same fac exposure to test whether the faster degradation of the e ampr segment observed in the current study may be related to reactions involving radicals such as oh e puc19 was also exposed to fac in the presence of tert butanol 10 mm the results fig 4 filled symbols showed that degradation of the e ampr segments became significantly slower in the presence of tert butanol agarose gel electrophoresis analyses fig 2b showed that fac treatment in the absence of tert butanol resulted in gradual movement of the puc19 band upward with increasing fac exposure 0 46 mgcl2 l min and then downward with further increase of the fac exposure 46 188 mgcl2 l min this indicates conformational change of puc19 from the supercoiled to the linear form and then to another form that migrated faster than the linear form e g fragmented linear plasmid in contrast chlorination of puc19 in the presence of tert butanol fig 2c did not result in any change in the puc19 band position at the tested fac exposures indicating negligible plasmid conformational variation e g strand breakage from the initial supercoiled form the visual trends observed in gel images are also shown in a quantitative manner where the degree of plasmid conformational change is measured as a function of fac exposure figure s5 using quantitative agarose gel image analyses the enhanced ampr degradation and plasmid conformational changes in the absence of tert butanol indicate an involvement of strong radicals such as oh during chlorination of the plasmid dna previous studies have also reported formation of single and double strand breaks in plasmid dna during chlorination experiments conducted in the absence of radical scavenger though such behavior was attributed to formation of n centered radicals following thermal metal or light mediated homolysis of n chlorinated dna nucleobases hawkins and davies 2002 suquet et al 2010 we hypothesize that in the present case fac induced fenton like reactions associated with trace metal residues in the dna extracts may be primarily responsible for radical formation dna has high affinity for some transition metals e g cu i and fe ii and the reaction of dna metal complexes with fac or h2o2 is reported to generate oh ouameur et al 2005 prütz 1996a b suquet et al 2010 even though the plasmids used in this study were purified they could still have contained trace levels of transition metals in the form of dna metal complexes separate experiments showed the formation of formaldehyde at concentrations of up to 70 nm during treatment of puc19 2 mg l with fac 70 μm at ph 7 in the presence of excess tert butanol 50 mm while formaldehyde formation was negligible during chlorination under the same condition without puc19 figure s6 these data are consistent with formation of oh in this system as formaldehyde is one of the major products with 25 molar yield from the reaction of oh with tert butanol flyunt et al 2003a further investigation is warranted to test the hypothesis of dna metal complexes inducing fenton like reactions as a source of radical formation it should be noted that tert butanol would likely have little to no effect on reactions driven directly by n centered radicals formed at the dna nitrogen atoms as tert butanol is not expected to exhibit significant reactivities toward weaker radicals such as nh2 huie 2003 accordingly if n centered radicals were directly responsible for these reactions the addition of tert butanol should have little to no effect on the degradation kinetics of e ampr segments and puc19 in contrast to the observations reported here however it may be possible that cl formation and consequently oh formation via cl h2o cloh h oh cl h or cl oh cloh oh cl kläning and wolff 1985 through for example thermally or metal mediated homolysis of n chlorinated nucleobases may have contributed indirectly to the observed results 2 degradation kinetics of ampr by fac the observed accelerating kinetics for the degradation of ampr segments by direct reactions with fac i e in the presence of tert butanol can be interpreted according to a two step reaction model originally proposed by he et al he et al 2019 for chromosomal args eqs 1 and 2 1 2 in this model an initial reaction between fac and a hydrogen bonded nucleotide base pair within a given dna segment or amplicon amp leads to formation of an n chlorinated dna segment or amplicon ampn cl the forward step in eq 1 which can be dechlorinated to the parent form upon quenching with a strong reductant such as thiosulfate the reverse step in eq 1 the heterocyclic nh groups of guanosine and thymidine are the most likely sites of the initial attack represented by eq 1 based on their higher reactivities in comparison to the heterocyclic nh or exocyclic nh2 groups of cytidine or adenosine or the exocyclic nh2 group of guanosine prütz 1999 prütz 1996a in the presence of excess fac the fraction of n chlorinated bases in a given dna segment ampn cl will increase with increasing fac exposure noting that a segment of dna can sustain multiple such reversible hits up to a maximum number equal to the number of base pairs in the segment as the h bonds between base pairs in the dna segment are progressively disrupted by n chlorination the resulting unpaired nucleobases are activated toward fac and may then irreversibly react with fac to form stable c chlorinated products that cannot revert to the initial state upon thiosulfate treatment and that are detectable by qpcr due to blockage of dna polymerase eq 2 the observed irreversible degradation kinetics of the dna segment will gradually increase to a maximum at which point all nucleotide bases in the segment are n chlorinated consistent with the observed linearities of logarithmic scale ampr degradation curves with respect to fac exposure after reaching a certain threshold range of fac exposure values in general 40 60 mgcl2 l min fig 4 filled symbols further details on the two step fac reaction model can be found in the prior work he et al 2019 rate constants for each step of the degradation of ampr segments by fac were determined according to the above model as previously described he et al 2019 briefly k fac ampn cl of the second irreversible c chlorination step eq 2 was firstly determined and its values were 49 6 0 7 93 5 9 8 144 2 4 6 and 219 9 9 9 m 1s 1 for the 192 400 603 and 851 bp segments respectively figures s7 and s8 as k fac ampn cl can be assumed to be equal to the product of the rate constant for irreversible chlorination of a single n chlorinated bp k fac n cl bp and the number of total n chlorinated bps in a dna segment i e k fac ampn cl k fac n cl bp n cl bp k fac n cl bp bp when fully n chlorinated an average value of 0 26 0 01 m 1s 1 could be obtained for k fac n cl bp from the slope of a plot of k fac ampn cl vs bp for each ampr segment under conditions of full n chlorination figure s9b next the k fac amp values for the first n chlorination step eq 1 were determined for each segment by finding numerical solutions of eqs 1 and 2 via non linear regressions of the experimental data with k fac n cl bp constant as determined above and k fac amp as a master variable to be solved for further details of the non linear regressions are provided in si excel 1 the resulting values of k fac amp were 2 7 0 2 103 5 4 0 5 103 9 2 0 9 103 and 1 7 0 2 104 m 1s 1 for the 192 400 603 and 851 bp segments respectively linear regression of these data versus numbers of at gc bps per amplicon yielded 16 6 2 7 m at gc 1s 1 the k fac amp values from this study were larger by a factor of 2 on average than the reported rate constants for the chromosomally encoded blt and meca genes of b subtilis and staphylococcus aureus choi et al 2021a he et al 2019 when compared as the segment length normalized k fac amp values the two step fac reaction model could be applied to predict degradation kinetics for the entire e puc19 plasmid as a function of fac exposure using k fac plasmid and k fac plasmid n cl values for degradation of the whole plasmid k fac plasmid was estimated as 5 6 0 6 104 m 1s 1 by extrapolation from the linear regression equation for k fac amp vs the number of at gc bps in each ampr segment i e k fac amp 16 6 at gc 6 0 103 figure s9a k fac plasmid n cl for c chlorination of the fully n chlorinated plasmid was estimated as 7 0 102 m 1s 1 from the relationship k fac ampn cl k fac n cl bps n cl bps 0 26 2686 figure s9b using these rate constants for the whole plasmid in the two step fac reaction model a degradation profile of puc19 as a function of fac exposure was generated as shown by the dashed line in fig 4e based on the model prediction 4 log level degradation of e puc19 was achieved at an fac exposure of 40 mgcl2 l min 3 effect of ph degradation rate constants for e ampr segments were also examined at ph 8 1 by exposing solutions containing puc19 to fac in the absence of tert butanol the degradation of e ampr segments at ph 8 1 was much slower than at ph 6 8 both cases in the absence of tert butanol as shown in figure s10 the slower degradation of e ampr segments at higher ph could be attributed to the change in fac speciation from hocl to less reactive ocl hocl h ocl pk a 7 5 morris 1966 note that the two step fac reaction model was not applied to kinetic data obtained in the absence of tert butanol at phs 6 8 and 8 1 as these data involve not only fac but also likely oh reactions 3 5 deactivation of e puc19 during exposure to fac the deactivation of e puc19 by fac in the absence of tert butanol at ph 6 8 was compared using the e coli ab and dh5α strains as recipient cells as observed for o3 the kinetics of transforming activity loss for fac treated e puc19 also varied depending on the recipient strain used in contrast to the accelerating degradation kinetics observed for e ampr segments and e puc19 the loss of transforming activity for most e coli strains exhibited linear kinetics with respect to fac exposure fig 5 and apparent k fac transformation values could be obtained from the slopes of the resulting decay curves the reason for the deviations in kinetic behavior for degradation vs deactivation is currently unclear the rate constants for transforming activity loss decreased in the order of ab2463 reca 3 2 103 m 1s 1 ab1186 uvra 1 5 103 m 1s 1 ab1157 wild type 1 4 103 m 1s 1 and dh5α reca enda 5 4 102 m 1s 1 where the values in parentheses are k fac transformation for the e coli mutant ab2480 uvra reca no transformants were detectable even at the lowest fac exposure applied 2 4 mgcl2 l min indicating a 4 log decrease fig 5 by assuming second order reaction kinetics for e puc19 deactivation by fac consistent with the trends observed when using the other e coli recipient strains the k fac transformation value was estimated to be 4 103 m 1s 1 when using strain ab2480 thus k fac transformation for puc19 deactivation when using the double mutant ab2480 was 4 fold more rapid than when using the wild type ab1157 k fac transformation values for puc19 deactivation were in general 2 4 fold higher when using the ab strains as recipients than when using dh5α similar trends were observed for o3 consistent with the various dna repair abilities of these e coli strains see the above discussion in the o3 section the deactivation efficiency of e puc19 was also determined at ph 8 1 using dh5α as the recipient cell the result showed that e puc19 deactivation kinetics depended strongly on ph where k fac transformation at ph 6 8 5 4 102 m 1s 1 was 7 fold higher than at ph 8 1 82 m 1s 1 the effect of tert butanol on the kinetics of e puc19 deactivation was also investigated the results showed that deactivation of e puc19 using dh5α as recipient strain in the absence of tert butanol k fac transformation 5 4 102 m 1s 1 was faster than in the presence of tert butanol k fac transformation 3 6 102 m 1s 1 by a factor of 1 5 this behavior is consistent with an additional e puc19 degradation pathway induced by radicals during chlorination in the absence of tert butanol we also attempted to compare deactivation kinetics of puc19 with degradation kinetics for the entire plasmid puc19 each in the presence of tert butanol in which the two step fac reaction model was used to predict the degradation of e puc19 as a function of fac exposure see section 3 4 the predicted degradation profile for puc19 was in reasonable agreement with the experimental deactivation profile for puc19 aside from the curvature of the predicted degradation profile at low fac exposures resulting in overall underestimation of puc19 deactivation fig 4e the difference between the degradation model prediction and the experimental deactivation data indicates that there may be other factors unaccounted for by the model that contribute to puc19 transforming activity loss nevertheless our data show overall that fac induced dna damage in puc19 effectively leads to deactivation of the plasmid 3 6 degradation and deactivation of i args during exposure to fac degradation of i args was investigated by exposing cells of e coli dh5α harboring puc19 to fac at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 in the absence of tert butanol overall the kinetic behaviors of i arg degradation fig 6 appeared to be different from those of e arg degradation fig 4 there was a rapid initial degradation of i ampr segments 0 3 0 9 log losses at fac exposures of 0 5 20 mgcl2 l min whereas this initial rapid loss was not observed for the e ampr after the initial rapid decreases the degradation of the 603 and 851 bp i ampr segments exhibited accelerating kinetics with respect to fac exposure more evident under the ph 6 8 conditions whereas kinetics for the 192 and 400 bp segments were generally closer to linear degradation kinetics of i ampr segments after the initial rapid losses were similar at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 slightly faster at ph 6 8 than ph 8 1 whereas degradation kinetics of e ampr segments were significantly higher at ph 6 8 than ph 8 1 figure s10 furthermore the degradation kinetics of i ampr segments at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 which were similar were slower than for e ampr at ph 6 8 and faster than for e ampr at ph 8 1 figures s11 and s12 the initial rapid loss of i args was also observed in a previous study yoon et al 2017 and explained by fenton like processes initiated within e coli cells by reactions of fac following its penetration of the cell envelope with intracellular metal species e g fe ii or cu i that could generate free radicals and cause oxidative dna damage as an alternative hypothesis decreased efficacy of plasmid dna recovery from fac treated e coli cells compared with intact cells might also be responsible for the initial rapid i arg loss however the degree of initial ampr loss was found to increase with increasing size of the monitored ampr segment figure s13 this indicates that the initial rapid loss of i args is more likely related to dna degradation than to dna recovery as in the latter case the degree of observed i arg loss would likely be independent of ampr segment size the lack of a substantial ph effect on i arg degradation kinetics compared with e args was also observed in a previous study yoon et al 2017 and explained by the change of fac speciation after its transport into the cells due to cytoplasmic ph conditions ph 7 2 7 8 wilks and slonczewski 2007 in this scenario the reaction of fac with the i ampr would likely have occurred under conditions reflective of e ampr degradation at ph 7 5 consistent with the fact that i ampr degradation kinetics were intermediate between the e ampr kinetics observed at ph 6 8 and 8 1 deactivation of i args was also determined for the e coli dh5α exposed to fac at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 in the absence of tert butanol the plasmid was extracted from the chlorinated e coli samples and applied to the gene transformation assay using non resistant e coli dh5α the deactivation kinetics of i puc19 at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 differed by only a factor of 1 4 1 4 102 m 1s 1 and 1 0 102 m 1s 1 respectively fig 6e consistent with the weak ph dependence observed for i ampr degradation fac exposures of 68 mgcl2 l min at ph 6 8 and 94 mgcl2 l min at ph 8 1 were required to reach 4 log decreases of transforming activity for i puc19 the deactivation kinetics of i puc19 at ph 6 8 and 8 1 were slower than for e puc19 at ph 6 8 but faster than for e puc19 at ph 8 1 these trends in i puc19 deactivation kinetics are also consistent with a change of fac speciation in response to the cytoplasmic ph of e coli 7 5 as discussed above in the context of the observed kinetics of i ampr degradation 4 conclusions degradation of the ampr bearing plasmid puc19 by o3 was fast with a k value of 2 105 m 1s 1 the deactivation of puc19 by o3 was also rapid with k values similar to or slightly lower within a factor of 2 1 than those for the degradation of puc19 when assessed using e coli strains with varying dna repair abilities as recipient cells influence of cellular components on the reaction efficiency of o3 with intracellular plasmids was minor with e puc19 and i puc19 degradation and deactivation in generally good agreement considering the high o3 reactivity in gene degradation and deactivation efficient elimination of plasmid borne args appears to be feasible during ozonation of drinking water and wastewater effluent though further work with other bacterial strains including environmental strains plasmids and args is needed to confirm these findings can be generalized impacts of water matrix components such as suspended solids and dissolved organic matter should also be considered degradation of puc19 during chlorination was driven by direct reactions with fac as well as by reactions with radicals that may have been generated from incidental reactions of fac with plasmid dna extracts the kinetics of direct ampr segment degradation by fac accelerated with increasing fac exposure and could be described by a two step sequential reaction model degradation of puc19 by fac which could be predicted by the two step fac reaction model lagged the deactivation of the plasmid at low exposures 10 mgcl2 l min though kinetics of degradation and deactivation were in generally good agreement at higher exposures 20 mgcl2 l min o3 induced and fac induced plasmid dna damage were repairable by e coli recipient strains though the extent of dna repair was lower for the cases of o3 and fac when compared to those of uv and oh determined in previous work nihemaiti et al 2020 overall significant levels of plasmid borne arg degradation and deactivation appear to be achievable during water chlorination especially for extracellular args at near neutral ph as noted above for o3 further work with other bacterial strains plasmids and args in addition to consideration of water matrix effect e g suspended solids dissolved organic matter ammonia is needed to confirm the degree to which these findings can be generalized the findings from this study and our prior investigations nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 support the combination of qpcr analyses and kinetics based modeling approaches as useful tools to assess and predict the

estimated from the equation obtained from linear regression of the k values for degradation of ampr segments kampr by o3 vs segment length figure s4 the error values of k puc19 were calculated using error propagation for the linear relationship between k puc19 and kampr bthe degradation of ampr segments was modeled by the two step fac reaction model as described in the main text section 3 4 with k fac amp and k fac ampn cl as the rate constants of the first and second steps respectively with k fac ampn cl values for each ampr segment obtained from weighted linear regression of corresponding experimental k obs fac values over their regions of maximal slope vs fac 0 and with k fac n cl bp obtained from weighted linear regression of experimental k fac ampn cl values for each ampr segment vs bp n cl bp under conditions of full chlorination using the obtained k fac n cl bp value the k fac amp values for each segment were determined by fitting of the experimental data with the two step fac reaction model the error values for k fac amp indicate lower and upper values of the model outputs obtained by using the lower and higher range of the standard error of the k fac n cl bp value respectively csecond order rate constants for the gene ampr deactivation by o3 or fac were determined from the linear slopes of plots of log10 scale transforming activity loss vs oxidant exposure

deactivation kinetics of an antibiotic resistance gene arg by ozone o3 and free available chlorine fac were investigated in phosphate buffered solutions at ph 7 for o3 in the presence of tert butanol and ph 6 8 or 8 1 for fac we used a plasmid puc19 encoded ampicillin resistance gene ampr in both extracellular e and intracellular i forms the second order rate constant k o3 for degradation of 2686 base pair bp long e puc19 toward o3 which was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was calculated to be 2 105 m 1s 1 the deactivation rate constants of e puc19 by o3 measured with various recipient e coli strains were within a factor of 2 compared with the degradation rate constant for e puc19 the degradation deactivation kinetics of i puc19 were similar to those of e puc19 indicating only a minor influence of cellular components on o3 reactivity toward i puc19 for fac the degradation and deactivation rates of e puc19 were decreased in the presence of tert butanol implying involvement of direct fac as well as some radical e g oh reactions the degradation rates of e ampr segments by direct fac reaction could be explained by a previously reported two step sequential reaction model in which the rate constants increased linearly with e ampr segment length the deactivation rate constants of e puc19 during exposure to fac were variable by a factor of up to 4 3 for the different recipient strains revealing the role of dna repair in the observed deactivation efficiencies the degradation deactivation of e puc19 were significantly faster at ph 6 8 than at ph 8 1 owing to ph dependent fac speciation variation whereas i puc19 kinetics exhibited much smaller dependence on ph demonstrating intracellular plasmid dna reactions with fac occurred at cytoplasmic ph 7 5 our results are useful for predicting and or measuring the degradation deactivation efficiency of plasmid encoded args by water treatment with ozonation and chlorination graphical

human and animal health as it has lowered the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment against bacterial infections united nations 2019 although antibiotic resistance occurs naturally the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have accelerated its dissemination amongst bacterial communities by selecting bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes args responsible for antibiotic resistance traits davies and davies 2010 args are now considered as contaminants of concern in various aquatic environments as arg transfer via natural anthropogenic water cycles can potentially contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance to pathogens czekalski et al 2012 dodd 2012 pruden et al 2006 args exist in aquatic environments within bacterial cells i e intracellularly but also extracellularly where the latter are generated by lysis of dead cells or secretion from live cells zhang et al 2018 both extra e and intracellular i args are of concern considering the potential for dissemination of antibiotic resistance dodd 2012 nagler et al 2018 antibiotic resistance can be disseminated within bacterial populations by sharing of mobile args contained within bacteriophages plasmids and chromosomal dna through horizontal gene transfer hgt processes including conjugation cell to cell contact transduction viral delivery and transformation uptake of free dna thomas and nielsen 2005 disinfection and oxidation of drinking water and wastewater serve as important barriers to the spread of pathogenic microorganisms in urban water systems jacangelo and trussell 2002 free available chlorine fac and ozone o3 are widely used for disinfection and o3 is also employed for chemical contaminant elimination von gunten 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the efficacy of water disinfection and oxidation processes in mitigating args has received increasing attention dodd 2012 various studies have employed quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays of dna damage to show that fac and o3 are capable of degrading args alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 he et al 2019 pak et al 2016 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however fundamental kinetic parameters e g bimolecular rate constants and molecular level reaction models for arg degradation by these oxidants are still scarce which has hindered comparison and generalization of arg removal efficacies by different water disinfectants oxidants only a limited number of recent studies have reported such information on the degradation of plasmid borne and or chromosomal args he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 and none of these have specifically addressed o3 reactions with plasmid borne args furthermore kinetics of args deactivation i e loss of arg transforming activity where transforming activity is defined here as the ability of an intact arg to confer a resistance trait to a non resistant bacterial cell via the hgt process of transformation have been investigated in only a few studies chang et al 2017 he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 none of which have focused specifically on the deactivation of plasmid borne args by o3 and fac qpcr methods have been widely used to quantify structurally intact args and monitor their degradation in water disinfection oxidation alexander et al 2016 chang et al 2017 czekalski et al 2016 he et al 2019 mckinney and pruden 2012 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however it is important to note that most qpcr methods monitor only a part of a target arg s sequence e g segment sizes of 200 1000 base pairs bps but not the entire sequence related to the biological activity of the arg thus short segment based e g 200 bps qpcr methods may underestimate arg damage and associated loss of arg transforming activity chang et al 2017 he et al 2019 yoon et al 2018 moreover qpcr methods do not simulate uptake and repair of dna by recipient bacterial cells which can play important roles in modulating transforming activity of args chang et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 in addition the dna replication efficiency in qpcr methods can be different from that in bacterial cells subjected to gene transformation e g due to differences in dna polymerases correlations between the degradation of target arg segments typically measured by qpcr and the removal of arg transforming activity measured by transformation assay have been found for some plasmid borne chang et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 as well as chromosomal args he et al 2019 during treatment with certain water disinfectants and oxidants with explanations hypothesized based on molecular mechanisms of dna transformation for the relevant bacterial strains he et al 2019 nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 nevertheless further study is needed of the relationships between degradation and deactivation of args by o3 and fac this investigation was in turn undertaken with the goals of i providing carefully determined kinetics parameters for degradation and deactivation of plasmid borne args by o3 and fac ii improving the fundamental understanding of how o3 and fac contribute to damage of plasmid dna and how that relates to observed arg degradation and deactivation kinetics and iii investigating the role of dna damage repair in governing observed arg deactivation kinetics by each oxidant an overarching aim of this work was to advance the quantitative and conceptual foundations for characterizing modeling and predicting the fate of plasmid borne args during water and wastewater chlorination and ozonation a plasmid puc19 carrying an ampicillin resistance gene ampr was used as an extracellular arg e arg and escherichia coli strain dh5α transformed with puc19 was used to represent an intracellular arg i arg the e and i puc19 were prepared in phosphate buffered solutions and exposed to different levels of o3 with tert butanol and fac without and with tert butanol the treated samples were analyzed by qpcr for quantifying ampr degradation arg transformation assays for quantifying ampr deactivation and agarose gel electrophoresis the observed kinetic behaviors were used to derive kinetic models and corresponding rate constants and then applied to predict degradation rate constants for the entire puc19 plasmid by each disinfectant the arg transformation assays employed five e coli strains with varying dna damage repair abilities in order to assess the influence of dna repair on observed arg deactivation kinetics finally degradation and deactivation kinetics of ampr were compared and discussed with respect to explaining and predicting the elimination efficiency of arg transforming activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents chemicals and

reactions a continuous flow quenched reaction system was used according to procedures described previously he et al 2019 all o3 experiments were carried out in the presence of tert butanol 10 mm to scavenge hydroxyl radical oh flyunt et al 2003b moreover 10 mm of tert butanol on its own had negligible effect on the ampr segment in a control test conducted in the absence of o3 chlorination was performed in a batch reactor without and with tert butanol 10 mm to investigate the possible influence of radical reactions further details of the ozonation and chlorination experiments are provided

using graphpad prism 7 or nonlinear regressions using microsoft excel solver for determining second order or pseudo first order rate constants and associated uncertainties standard errors or deviations for each ampr segment in its reactions with o3 and fac weighted linear regressions were applied to perform uncertainty weighted regression analyses of ampr segment specific second order rate constants vs segment length or pseudo first order rate constants of each segment vs fac concentrations according to previously reported methods he et al 2019 since these rate constants themselves carry associated uncertainties 3 results and discussions 3 1 degradation of e args by o3 solutions containing puc19 were exposed to increasing o3 exposures 0 0 15 mgo3 l min at ph 7 with oh scavenged by tert butanol the results fig 1a showed that the 192 bp e ampr segment was degraded by 1 2 log at an o3 exposure of 0 15 mgo3 l min whereas a 4 log decrease was achieved for the 851 bps e ampr segment at this o3 exposure the degradation of e ampr segments measured by qpcr followed linear kinetics with increasing o3 exposure r2 0 99 fig 1a indicating first order reaction kinetics with respect to e ampr and o3 respectively and overall second order reaction kinetics choi et al 2021a the second order rate constants for the e ampr segments degradation by o3 could be determined from the slopes of the curves shown in fig 1a i e k o3 amp 2 303 slope and were 1 6 0 1 104 3 1 0 2 104 4 6 0 3 104 and 6 1 0 3 104 m 1s 1 for the 192 400 603 and 851 bp segments respectively table 1 the increasing k o3 amp values of e ampr segments with increasing segment size can be explained by the increasing number of potential o3 reaction sites on longer segments our k o3 amp values were in good agreement with rate constants previously reported for similar length segments 266 1017 bp of the chromosomal blt gene of bacillus subtilis he et al 2019 indicating similar reactivities of plasmid borne and chromosomal dna toward o3 the k o3 plasmid of e puc19 could be predicted by extrapolating the k o3 amp of each segment to the entire plasmid i e k o 3 plasmid k o 3 amp 2686 bp amplicon length where amplicon length was 192 400 603 or 851 bp based on the assumption that the o3 reactivity per bp is the same across the entire plasmid the k o3 plasmid values predicted from the 192 400 603 and 851 bps segments were 2 2 0 1 105 2 1 0 1 105 2 0 0 1 105 and 1 9 0 1 105 m 1s 1 respectively yielding an average k o3 plasmid value of 2 1 0 2 105 m 1s 1 alternatively the k o3 plasmid of the entire plasmid could be predicted by incorporating the total bp number of puc19 2686 bps into the equation resulting from linear regression of k o3 amp vs the number of at gc bps in each ampr segment that is k o3 amp in m 1s 1 70 7 at gc 2 4 103 figure s4 this yielded a similar k o3 plasmid value of 1 9 0 4 105 m 1s 1 the slope of this linear equation 71 2 m at gc 1s 1 represents the sequence independent average rate constant for the reaction of o3 with a single base pair of double stranded ds plasmid dna a similar value of 65 7 m at gc 1s 1 has been reported for the sequence independent rate constant for the reaction of o3 with ds chromosomal dna using the blt gene he et al 2019 overall the k o3 plasmid of e puc19 is estimated to be 2 105 m 1s 1 based on the values obtained using the two different methods described above structural change of puc19 upon exposure to o3 was investigated by using agarose gel electrophoresis analyses fig 2a the intact puc19 before o3 exposure showed a band at a lower position than the linearized plasmid i e ecori treated puc19 since plasmid dna normally exists in a supercoiled form which migrates faster than its linear form in agarose gels the position of the band for the supercoiled form did not change upon o3 exposures in the presence of tert butanol 0 0 15 mgo3 l min this suggests that the puc19 retained its supercoiled structure without significant conformational change such as strand breakage despite the expected significant level of nucleoside degradation of the plasmid dna at the applied o3 exposures among nucleosides the reactivity of o3 is high with thymidine 3 0 104 m 1s 1 and guanosine 1 6 104 m 1s 1 intermediate with cytidine 3 5 103 m 1s 1 and low with adenosine 16 m 1s 1 theruvathu et al 2001 where the terms in parentheses are k values for the reaction of o3 with the neutral form of each nucleoside consistent with the order of o3 reactivity of the nucleoside monomers thymine and guanine bases were found to be the preferential degradation sites in ds plasmid dna exposed to o3 sawadaishi et al 1986 based on a detailed product study with thymine and thymidine flyunt et al 2002 ring opening products caused by c 5 c 6 double bond cleavage are expected to be formed from the reaction of o3 with pyrimidine bases contrary to the results of the present study the conversion of plasmid conformation from initial supercoiled to relaxed circular or linear forms was observed in a previous ozonation study sawadaishi et al 1985 this could be due to the formation of oh from the reaction of o3 with dna as it is well known that oh can induce dna strand breakage von sonntag 2006 in the current study oh was fully scavenged by tert butanol resulting in negligible plasmid conformational change 3 2 deactivation of e args by o3 the deactivation of e puc19 by o3 was investigated by analyzing the former s transforming activity using non ampicillin resistant recipient e coli cells having varying dna repair abilities the transforming activity loss rate of o3 treated e puc19 was variable depending on the recipient strain used fig 1a for the three repair deficient e coli mutants ab2480 uvra reca ab1186 uvra and ab2463 reca no transformant was detectable at the lowest o3 exposure applied 0 03 mgo3 l min indicating a 4 log decrease fig 1a by assuming second order reaction kinetics for e puc19 deactivation by o3 the k o3 transformation value was in turn estimated to be 2 5 105 m 1s 1 for the three e coli strains deficient in dna repair ability the loss of transforming activity was slower for e coli ab1157 wild type and dh5α reca enda than repair deficient e coli ab strains and followed first order kinetics with respect to o3 the k o3 transformation values were calculated to be 1 6 0 3 105 m 1s 1 for ab1157 and 1 0 0 2 105 m 1s 1 for dh5α from the slopes of plots of log10 scale transforming activity loss vs o3 exposure multiplied by a factor of 2 303 k o3 values for the degradation of e ampr segments the full e puc19 plasmid predicted and the loss of plasmid transforming activity as measured using the various recipient strains are compared in fig 3a and 3b the estimated degradation rate constant for the entire plasmid 2 105 m 1s 1 as noted above overestimated the rate constants for puc19 deactivation observed for strains ab1157 wild type and dh5α reca enda but the difference in the rate constants was small differing by factors of 1 3 and 2 1 respectively the plasmid deactivation rate constant estimated using the three dna repair deficient strains was 2 5 105 m 1s 1 which was also close to the predicted degradation rate constant for the entire plasmid differing by factors of 1 3 these results suggest that every instance of o3 induced dna damage e g base oxidation in puc19 effectively led to deactivation of the plasmid loss of transforming activity when the repair deficient uvra and or reca e coli strains were used for the wild type and dh5α reca enda e coli strains it appears that not every o3 induced dna lesion resulted in plasmid deactivation due to repair of some fraction of the dna damage by the recipient cells the reca protein encoded by the reca gene plays an important role in the repair of single strand gaps or double strand breakages by homologous recombination shinohara and ogawa 1995 the uvrabc proteins encoded by the uvra uvrb and uvrc genes are responsible for the nucleotide excision repair of various types of dna lesions such as the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6 4 photoproducts formed during uv irradiation kisker et al 2013 it is possible that reca or uvra is also capable of repairing some of the o3 induced dna damage which may explain the lower deactivation rate constant when using the wild type e coli as a recipient strain compared with the reca and or uvra deficient strains notably strain dh5α showed the lowest deactivation rate among the tested strains despite its lack of reca the same trend has also been observed during treatment of puc19 by uv and oh and explained by the lack of the enda gene in dh5α rendering it inherently more active for taking up intact plasmids and thus gene transformation nihemaiti et al 2020 3 3 degradation and deactivation of i args during exposure to o3 degradation and deactivation of i args were investigated by exposing e coli dh5α harboring puc19 to o3 at ph 7 in the presence of tert butanol 10 mm overall the kinetic behavior in the degradation and deactivation of i args fig 1b was similar to that for e args fig 1a and the k o3 values of i args were lower than those of e args by factors of only 1 2 1 5 p 0 05 table 1 k o3 for the degradation of i ampr segments i puc19 and the loss of plasmid transforming activities for the i args are compared in fig 3c and 3d the k o3 plasmid values predicted from the 192 400 603 and 851 bps segments were 1 6 0 1 105 1 6 0 1 105 1 7 0 1 105 and 1 5 0 1 105 m 1s 1 respectively yielding an average k o3 plasmid value of 1 6 0 2 105 m 1s 1 the k o3 transformation values were 1 1 0 5 105 m 1s 1 for ab1157 and 6 6 0 5 104 m 1s 1 for dh5α from the slopes of plots of log10 scale transforming activity loss vs o3 exposure the predicted i puc19 degradation rate constants therefore overestimated the deactivation rate constants by factors of 1 5 and 2 4 for ab1157 and dh5α respectively similar to the case of e args the deactivation rate constants for i args were too fast to be captured by the transformation assays using the three repair deficient e coli strains ab1886 ab2463 and ab2480 as shown in fig 1b and a k o3 transformation value for i args could only be estimated as 2 105 m 1s 1 when using these strains table 1 fig 3d overall our results show that the e coli cell envelope and other cellular constituents did not significantly hinder the ability of o3 to reach and react with intracellular puc19 3 4 degradation of e args during exposure to fac 1 effect of tert butanol and involvement of radical reaction solutions containing e puc19 were exposed to fac at ph 6 8 at different fac exposures 0 100 mgcl2 l min and quenched with thiosulfate to terminate the reaction the results fig 4 open symbols showed that the degradation of e ampr segments became gradually faster with increasing fac exposure the degradation rate was lowest for the 192 bp segment and increased with increasing length of the e ampr segments it was found that degradation of the e ampr segments in this study was considerably faster than degradation of similar length e blt gene segments in another recent study by our groups he et al 2019 when compared at the same fac exposure to test whether the faster degradation of the e ampr segment observed in the current study may be related to reactions involving radicals such as oh e puc19 was also exposed to fac in the presence of tert butanol 10 mm the results fig 4 filled symbols showed that degradation of the e ampr segments became significantly slower in the presence of tert butanol agarose gel electrophoresis analyses fig 2b showed that fac treatment in the absence of tert butanol resulted in gradual movement of the puc19 band upward with increasing fac exposure 0 46 mgcl2 l min and then downward with further increase of the fac exposure 46 188 mgcl2 l min this indicates conformational change of puc19 from the supercoiled to the linear form and then to another form that migrated faster than the linear form e g fragmented linear plasmid in contrast chlorination of puc19 in the presence of tert butanol fig 2c did not result in any change in the puc19 band position at the tested fac exposures indicating negligible plasmid conformational variation e g strand breakage from the initial supercoiled form the visual trends observed in gel images are also shown in a quantitative manner where the degree of plasmid conformational change is measured as a function of fac exposure figure s5 using quantitative agarose gel image analyses the enhanced ampr degradation and plasmid conformational changes in the absence of tert butanol indicate an involvement of strong radicals such as oh during chlorination of the plasmid dna previous studies have also reported formation of single and double strand breaks in plasmid dna during chlorination experiments conducted in the absence of radical scavenger though such behavior was attributed to formation of n centered radicals following thermal metal or light mediated homolysis of n chlorinated dna nucleobases hawkins and davies 2002 suquet et al 2010 we hypothesize that in the present case fac induced fenton like reactions associated with trace metal residues in the dna extracts may be primarily responsible for radical formation dna has high affinity for some transition metals e g cu i and fe ii and the reaction of dna metal complexes with fac or h2o2 is reported to generate oh ouameur et al 2005 prütz 1996a b suquet et al 2010 even though the plasmids used in this study were purified they could still have contained trace levels of transition metals in the form of dna metal complexes separate experiments showed the formation of formaldehyde at concentrations of up to 70 nm during treatment of puc19 2 mg l with fac 70 μm at ph 7 in the presence of excess tert butanol 50 mm while formaldehyde formation was negligible during chlorination under the same condition without puc19 figure s6 these data are consistent with formation of oh in this system as formaldehyde is one of the major products with 25 molar yield from the reaction of oh with tert butanol flyunt et al 2003a further investigation is warranted to test the hypothesis of dna metal complexes inducing fenton like reactions as a source of radical formation it should be noted that tert butanol would likely have little to no effect on reactions driven directly by n centered radicals formed at the dna nitrogen atoms as tert butanol is not expected to exhibit significant reactivities toward weaker radicals such as nh2 huie 2003 accordingly if n centered radicals were directly responsible for these reactions the addition of tert butanol should have little to no effect on the degradation kinetics of e ampr segments and puc19 in contrast to the observations reported here however it may be possible that cl formation and consequently oh formation via cl h2o cloh h oh cl h or cl oh cloh oh cl kläning and wolff 1985 through for example thermally or metal mediated homolysis of n chlorinated nucleobases may have contributed indirectly to the observed results 2 degradation kinetics of ampr by fac the observed accelerating kinetics for the degradation of ampr segments by direct reactions with fac i e in the presence of tert butanol can be interpreted according to a two step reaction model originally proposed by he et al he et al 2019 for chromosomal args eqs 1 and 2 1 2 in this model an initial reaction between fac and a hydrogen bonded nucleotide base pair within a given dna segment or amplicon amp leads to formation of an n chlorinated dna segment or amplicon ampn cl the forward step in eq 1 which can be dechlorinated to the parent form upon quenching with a strong reductant such as thiosulfate the reverse step in eq 1 the heterocyclic nh groups of guanosine and thymidine are the most likely sites of the initial attack represented by eq 1 based on their higher reactivities in comparison to the heterocyclic nh or exocyclic nh2 groups of cytidine or adenosine or the exocyclic nh2 group of guanosine prütz 1999 prütz 1996a in the presence of excess fac the fraction of n chlorinated bases in a given dna segment ampn cl will increase with increasing fac exposure noting that a segment of dna can sustain multiple such reversible hits up to a maximum number equal to the number of base pairs in the segment as the h bonds between base pairs in the dna segment are progressively disrupted by n chlorination the resulting unpaired nucleobases are activated toward fac and may then irreversibly react with fac to form stable c chlorinated products that cannot revert to the initial state upon thiosulfate treatment and that are detectable by qpcr due to blockage of dna polymerase eq 2 the observed irreversible degradation kinetics of the dna segment will gradually increase to a maximum at which point all nucleotide bases in the segment are n chlorinated consistent with the observed linearities of logarithmic scale ampr degradation curves with respect to fac exposure after reaching a certain threshold range of fac exposure values in general 40 60 mgcl2 l min fig 4 filled symbols further details on the two step fac reaction model can be found in the prior work he et al 2019 rate constants for each step of the degradation of ampr segments by fac were determined according to the above model as previously described he et al 2019 briefly k fac ampn cl of the second irreversible c chlorination step eq 2 was firstly determined and its values were 49 6 0 7 93 5 9 8 144 2 4 6 and 219 9 9 9 m 1s 1 for the 192 400 603 and 851 bp segments respectively figures s7 and s8 as k fac ampn cl can be assumed to be equal to the product of the rate constant for irreversible chlorination of a single n chlorinated bp k fac n cl bp and the number of total n chlorinated bps in a dna segment i e k fac ampn cl k fac n cl bp n cl bp k fac n cl bp bp when fully n chlorinated an average value of 0 26 0 01 m 1s 1 could be obtained for k fac n cl bp from the slope of a plot of k fac ampn cl vs bp for each ampr segment under conditions of full n chlorination figure s9b next the k fac amp values for the first n chlorination step eq 1 were determined for each segment by finding numerical solutions of eqs 1 and 2 via non linear regressions of the experimental data with k fac n cl bp constant as determined above and k fac amp as a master variable to be solved for further details of the non linear regressions are provided in si excel 1 the resulting values of k fac amp were 2 7 0 2 103 5 4 0 5 103 9 2 0 9 103 and 1 7 0 2 104 m 1s 1 for the 192 400 603 and 851 bp segments respectively linear regression of these data versus numbers of at gc bps per amplicon yielded 16 6 2 7 m at gc 1s 1 the k fac amp values from this study were larger by a factor of 2 on average than the reported rate constants for the chromosomally encoded blt and meca genes of b subtilis and staphylococcus aureus choi et al 2021a he et al 2019 when compared as the segment length normalized k fac amp values the two step fac reaction model could be applied to predict degradation kinetics for the entire e puc19 plasmid as a function of fac exposure using k fac plasmid and k fac plasmid n cl values for degradation of the whole plasmid k fac plasmid was estimated as 5 6 0 6 104 m 1s 1 by extrapolation from the linear regression equation for k fac amp vs the number of at gc bps in each ampr segment i e k fac amp 16 6 at gc 6 0 103 figure s9a k fac plasmid n cl for c chlorination of the fully n chlorinated plasmid was estimated as 7 0 102 m 1s 1 from the relationship k fac ampn cl k fac n cl bps n cl bps 0 26 2686 figure s9b using these rate constants for the whole plasmid in the two step fac reaction model a degradation profile of puc19 as a function of fac exposure was generated as shown by the dashed line in fig 4e based on the model prediction 4 log level degradation of e puc19 was achieved at an fac exposure of 40 mgcl2 l min 3 effect of ph degradation rate constants for e ampr segments were also examined at ph 8 1 by exposing solutions containing puc19 to fac in the absence of tert butanol the degradation of e ampr segments at ph 8 1 was much slower than at ph 6 8 both cases in the absence of tert butanol as shown in figure s10 the slower degradation of e ampr segments at higher ph could be attributed to the change in fac speciation from hocl to less reactive ocl hocl h ocl pk a 7 5 morris 1966 note that the two step fac reaction model was not applied to kinetic data obtained in the absence of tert butanol at phs 6 8 and 8 1 as these data involve not only fac but also likely oh reactions 3 5 deactivation of e puc19 during exposure to fac the deactivation of e puc19 by fac in the absence of tert butanol at ph 6 8 was compared using the e coli ab and dh5α strains as recipient cells as observed for o3 the kinetics of transforming activity loss for fac treated e puc19 also varied depending on the recipient strain used in contrast to the accelerating degradation kinetics observed for e ampr segments and e puc19 the loss of transforming activity for most e coli strains exhibited linear kinetics with respect to fac exposure fig 5 and apparent k fac transformation values could be obtained from the slopes of the resulting decay curves the reason for the deviations in kinetic behavior for degradation vs deactivation is currently unclear the rate constants for transforming activity loss decreased in the order of ab2463 reca 3 2 103 m 1s 1 ab1186 uvra 1 5 103 m 1s 1 ab1157 wild type 1 4 103 m 1s 1 and dh5α reca enda 5 4 102 m 1s 1 where the values in parentheses are k fac transformation for the e coli mutant ab2480 uvra reca no transformants were detectable even at the lowest fac exposure applied 2 4 mgcl2 l min indicating a 4 log decrease fig 5 by assuming second order reaction kinetics for e puc19 deactivation by fac consistent with the trends observed when using the other e coli recipient strains the k fac transformation value was estimated to be 4 103 m 1s 1 when using strain ab2480 thus k fac transformation for puc19 deactivation when using the double mutant ab2480 was 4 fold more rapid than when using the wild type ab1157 k fac transformation values for puc19 deactivation were in general 2 4 fold higher when using the ab strains as recipients than when using dh5α similar trends were observed for o3 consistent with the various dna repair abilities of these e coli strains see the above discussion in the o3 section the deactivation efficiency of e puc19 was also determined at ph 8 1 using dh5α as the recipient cell the result showed that e puc19 deactivation kinetics depended strongly on ph where k fac transformation at ph 6 8 5 4 102 m 1s 1 was 7 fold higher than at ph 8 1 82 m 1s 1 the effect of tert butanol on the kinetics of e puc19 deactivation was also investigated the results showed that deactivation of e puc19 using dh5α as recipient strain in the absence of tert butanol k fac transformation 5 4 102 m 1s 1 was faster than in the presence of tert butanol k fac transformation 3 6 102 m 1s 1 by a factor of 1 5 this behavior is consistent with an additional e puc19 degradation pathway induced by radicals during chlorination in the absence of tert butanol we also attempted to compare deactivation kinetics of puc19 with degradation kinetics for the entire plasmid puc19 each in the presence of tert butanol in which the two step fac reaction model was used to predict the degradation of e puc19 as a function of fac exposure see section 3 4 the predicted degradation profile for puc19 was in reasonable agreement with the experimental deactivation profile for puc19 aside from the curvature of the predicted degradation profile at low fac exposures resulting in overall underestimation of puc19 deactivation fig 4e the difference between the degradation model prediction and the experimental deactivation data indicates that there may be other factors unaccounted for by the model that contribute to puc19 transforming activity loss nevertheless our data show overall that fac induced dna damage in puc19 effectively leads to deactivation of the plasmid 3 6 degradation and deactivation of i args during exposure to fac degradation of i args was investigated by exposing cells of e coli dh5α harboring puc19 to fac at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 in the absence of tert butanol overall the kinetic behaviors of i arg degradation fig 6 appeared to be different from those of e arg degradation fig 4 there was a rapid initial degradation of i ampr segments 0 3 0 9 log losses at fac exposures of 0 5 20 mgcl2 l min whereas this initial rapid loss was not observed for the e ampr after the initial rapid decreases the degradation of the 603 and 851 bp i ampr segments exhibited accelerating kinetics with respect to fac exposure more evident under the ph 6 8 conditions whereas kinetics for the 192 and 400 bp segments were generally closer to linear degradation kinetics of i ampr segments after the initial rapid losses were similar at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 slightly faster at ph 6 8 than ph 8 1 whereas degradation kinetics of e ampr segments were significantly higher at ph 6 8 than ph 8 1 figure s10 furthermore the degradation kinetics of i ampr segments at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 which were similar were slower than for e ampr at ph 6 8 and faster than for e ampr at ph 8 1 figures s11 and s12 the initial rapid loss of i args was also observed in a previous study yoon et al 2017 and explained by fenton like processes initiated within e coli cells by reactions of fac following its penetration of the cell envelope with intracellular metal species e g fe ii or cu i that could generate free radicals and cause oxidative dna damage as an alternative hypothesis decreased efficacy of plasmid dna recovery from fac treated e coli cells compared with intact cells might also be responsible for the initial rapid i arg loss however the degree of initial ampr loss was found to increase with increasing size of the monitored ampr segment figure s13 this indicates that the initial rapid loss of i args is more likely related to dna degradation than to dna recovery as in the latter case the degree of observed i arg loss would likely be independent of ampr segment size the lack of a substantial ph effect on i arg degradation kinetics compared with e args was also observed in a previous study yoon et al 2017 and explained by the change of fac speciation after its transport into the cells due to cytoplasmic ph conditions ph 7 2 7 8 wilks and slonczewski 2007 in this scenario the reaction of fac with the i ampr would likely have occurred under conditions reflective of e ampr degradation at ph 7 5 consistent with the fact that i ampr degradation kinetics were intermediate between the e ampr kinetics observed at ph 6 8 and 8 1 deactivation of i args was also determined for the e coli dh5α exposed to fac at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 in the absence of tert butanol the plasmid was extracted from the chlorinated e coli samples and applied to the gene transformation assay using non resistant e coli dh5α the deactivation kinetics of i puc19 at ph 6 8 and ph 8 1 differed by only a factor of 1 4 1 4 102 m 1s 1 and 1 0 102 m 1s 1 respectively fig 6e consistent with the weak ph dependence observed for i ampr degradation fac exposures of 68 mgcl2 l min at ph 6 8 and 94 mgcl2 l min at ph 8 1 were required to reach 4 log decreases of transforming activity for i puc19 the deactivation kinetics of i puc19 at ph 6 8 and 8 1 were slower than for e puc19 at ph 6 8 but faster than for e puc19 at ph 8 1 these trends in i puc19 deactivation kinetics are also consistent with a change of fac speciation in response to the cytoplasmic ph of e coli 7 5 as discussed above in the context of the observed kinetics of i ampr degradation 4 conclusions degradation of the ampr bearing plasmid puc19 by o3 was fast with a k value of 2 105 m 1s 1 the deactivation of puc19 by o3 was also rapid with k values similar to or slightly lower within a factor of 2 1 than those for the degradation of puc19 when assessed using e coli strains with varying dna repair abilities as recipient cells influence of cellular components on the reaction efficiency of o3 with intracellular plasmids was minor with e puc19 and i puc19 degradation and deactivation in generally good agreement considering the high o3 reactivity in gene degradation and deactivation efficient elimination of plasmid borne args appears to be feasible during ozonation of drinking water and wastewater effluent though further work with other bacterial strains including environmental strains plasmids and args is needed to confirm these findings can be generalized impacts of water matrix components such as suspended solids and dissolved organic matter should also be considered degradation of puc19 during chlorination was driven by direct reactions with fac as well as by reactions with radicals that may have been generated from incidental reactions of fac with plasmid dna extracts the kinetics of direct ampr segment degradation by fac accelerated with increasing fac exposure and could be described by a two step sequential reaction model degradation of puc19 by fac which could be predicted by the two step fac reaction model lagged the deactivation of the plasmid at low exposures 10 mgcl2 l min though kinetics of degradation and deactivation were in generally good agreement at higher exposures 20 mgcl2 l min o3 induced and fac induced plasmid dna damage were repairable by e coli recipient strains though the extent of dna repair was lower for the cases of o3 and fac when compared to those of uv and oh determined in previous work nihemaiti et al 2020 overall significant levels of plasmid borne arg degradation and deactivation appear to be achievable during water chlorination especially for extracellular args at near neutral ph as noted above for o3 further work with other bacterial strains plasmids and args in addition to consideration of water matrix effect e g suspended solids dissolved organic matter ammonia is needed to confirm the degree to which these findings can be generalized the findings from this study and our prior investigations nihemaiti et al 2020 yoon et al 2018 support the combination of qpcr analyses and kinetics based modeling approaches as useful tools to assess and predict the

16796,understanding the multidimensionality of microplastics is essential for a realistic assessment of the risks these particles pose to the environment and human health here we capture size shape area polymer volume and mass characteristics of 60 000 individual microplastic particles as continuous distributions particles originate from samples taken from different aquatic compartments including surface water and sediments from the marine and freshwater environment waste water effluents and freshwater organisms data were obtained using state of the art ftir imaging using the same automated imaging post processing software we introduce a workflow with two quality criteria that assure minimum data quality loss due to volumetric and filter area subsampling we find that probability density functions pdfs for particle length follow power law distributions with median slopes ranging from 2 2 for marine surface water to 3 1 for biota samples and that these slopes were compartment specific polymer specific pdfs for particle length demonstrated significant differences in slopes among polymers hinting at polymer specific sources removal or fragmentation processes furthermore we provide pdfs for particle width width to length ratio area specific surface area volume and mass distributions and propose how these can represent the full diversity of toxicologically relevant dose metrics required for the assessment of microplastic risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics probability density functions size distribution risk assessment environment human health 1 introduction environmental microplastic consists of a complex diverse mixture of particles with different sizes shapes and polymer types burns and boxall 2018 kooi and koelmans 2019 rochman et al 2019 discrete classifications of these properties are however unable to capture the full diversity of the microplastic mixture kooi and koelmans 2019 better parameterization of this mixture is needed for those seeking realistic risk assessments everaert et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 probability density functions pdfs are mathematical functions that describe the actual distribution of a certain microplastic characteristic as such they have the potential to capture the continuous nature of the different properties of these diverse mixtures kooi and koelmans 2019 the advantage of these pdfs as opposed to more traditional discrete binning or classification methods is the level of detail that is maintained when presenting the results distributions can be compared more easily since their presentation is independent of the chosen bin width or class additionally when the pdfs are parameterized the resulting functions can form the basis for probabilistic risk modeling de ruijter et al 2020 kooi and koelmans 2019 mohamed nor et al 2021 they allow for the accurate definition of the dose metrics that are relevant for ecological effects or toxicological effects on humans while retaining the diversity of environmental or dietary microplastic for risk characterization these dose metrics can be aligned for the exposure and effect assessment by taking into account the effect mechanism koelmans et al 2017 thus far pdfs have been parametrized for microplastic sizes shapes and densities kooi and koelmans 2019 and these parameters have been used for risk assessments in the marine and freshwater environment everaert et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 a similar probabilistic approach has been used to characterize microplastics in food and air resulting in a probabilistic exposure assessment for humans mohamed nor et al 2021 the parameterization by kooi and koelmans 2019 was based on best available information however data on individual particle characteristics was not available empirical data on particle size was obtained from published tables and graphs so only binned count data for arbitrary size classes was used despite being a commonly used method fitting a power law on binned data via linear regression on the log log scale can result in substantial biases of the parameter estimates because with binning one loses the information on trends in the data within a bin clauset et al 2009 newman 2005 white et al 2008 a better approach is the maximum likelihood estimation mle method clauset et al 2009 newman 2005 white et al 2008 for particle shape and density kooi and koelmans 2019 combined average relative abundances of shape categories and polymer types with estimates of 3d shape descriptions and polymer densities these also are less accurate than actual data on shape and polymer id on an individual particle level therefore here we aim to provide parameterizations of microplastic pdfs this time based on much higher quality datasets with characteristics on the individual microplastic particle level microplastic characteristics such as size shape and polymer type can be obtained on the individual particle level using fourier transform infrared ftir imaging or raman microspectroscopy or when combing visual selection with attenuated total reflection atr ftir when combining ftir imaging with automated analyses software like simple and the mpapp primpke et al 2020a 2019 the comparability between studies is greatly enhanced however this type of detailed analyses and the required sample preparation is very time consuming therefore most researchers analyze only a fraction of their sample and filter and assume that results obtained for these subsamples would apply to the whole sample and thus can be extrapolated back to 100 sample size lorenz et al 2019 mintenig et al 2020 although this is a common approach few studies assessed to what extent subsampling affects the assessment of particle property distributions abel et al 2021 brandt et al 2021 consequently before detailed analyses of the actual data can take place a better understanding of the adequacy of sample extrapolation is required aim of the present paper is to provide characteristics of microplastic particles across environmental compartments via continuous distributions secondary aims are to assess to what extent subsampling affects the accuracy of such distributions and to discuss how these distributions can be used to tackle the multidimensionality of microplastic with respect to dose metrics as used in risk assessment for the environment and human health we perform a meta analysis of data from five studies that used state of the art ftir imaging and automated image analyses software lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 mintenig et al 2020 pan et al 2021 primpke et al 2019 first we quantify the loss of accuracy in pdf quantification due to subsample extrapolation and set two quality criteria to assure representativeness the five studies focused on different aquatic compartments i e freshwater marine surface water and sediment waste water effluent and freshwater benthic invertebrates we present and compare pdfs for microplastic length width width to length ratio area specific surface area volume and mass for the different aquatic compartments additionally we parameterize and compare power law distributions using the mle method focusing on the aquatic compartment level the sample level and the polymer level the distributions are discussed in the context of a realistic risk assessment framework capable of accommodating all microplastic dose metrics that may be relevant given the effect mechanisms identified for particulate matter from the environment de ruijter et al 2020 kögel et al 2020 wright and kelly 2017 2 methods 2 1 data collection particle length width and polymer type data from five studies targeting different environmental compartments were used the environmental compartments include marine surface water and sediment lorenz et al 2019 freshwater surface water mintenig et al 2020 freshwater sediment mani et al 2019 pan et al 2021 waste water effluent mintenig et al 2020 primpke et al 2019 and benthic freshwater biota pan et al 2021 fig 1 note that results we obtain are specific for these datasets and do not necessarily apply to all sediment water or biota samples worldwide the studies differed regarding sampling methods and examined sample type table s1 but are comparable analytically particles 500 µm lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 or 300 µm mintenig et al 2020 pan et al 2021 have been analyzed using stereo microscopes and atr ftir analysis no data on particles 500 µm were available for the german waste water effluents primpke et al 2019 smaller particles were analyzed using µftir instruments from different manufacturers were used that either applied a focal plane array fpa detector bruker hyperion 3000 lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 primpke et al 2019 agilent cary 620 pan et al 2021 or a single element detector thermofischer scientific nicolet in10 mintenig et al 2020 further all ftir data were analyzed using the same reference database primpke et al 2018 and automated particle identification using the software simple and mpapp primpke et al 2020a 2019 the lower size detection limit depended on the µftir instrument and settings used and was either 11 µm lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 primpke et al 2019 or 20 µm mintenig et al 2020 pan et al 2021 image analysis provided information on the particle s length width and polymer type based on these variables other particle properties including width to length ratio w l surface area volume mass and specific surface area ssa were calculated particles were assumed to have an ellipsoid shape for surface area and volume calculations koelmans et al 2020 primpke et al 2020b simon et al 2018 since the height of particles cannot be measured using atr ftir and µftir imaging techniques it was assumed that the median w l ratio is equal to the median height to width ratio therefore the height was calculated as median w l ratio times width koelmans et al 2020 kooi and koelmans 2019 primpke et al 2020b simon et al 2018 particle mass was estimated by multiplying particle volume with the density of the detected polymer table s2 specific surface area was calculated as the surface area divided by the mass 2 2 extrapolation of subsample analyses most studies analyze only a part of their samples and or filter areas after which data are extrapolated to represent the full sample this assumes particle characteristics detected for the subsample would apply to the whole sample as well since in reality two microplastic particles are never identical this is a critical assumption using simulated samples and particles we tested to what extent subsampling and subsequent extrapolation influences the parameters of pdfs for particle size subsequently we set two quality criteria based on the minimum number of particles in a sample criterium 1 and the subsample percentage of the sample or filter criterium 2 to assure we adequately capture the size distribution of a full sample in order to be able to include a sample in the further data analyzes at least one of the criteria had to be met for details on these tests the reader is referred to the supporting information section s1 after this quality screening the number of particles included for each of the compartments was 3890 biota samples 10 356 effluent 19 676 freshwater sediment 1748 marine sediment 21 004 freshwater surface water and 2502 marine surface water 2 3 parameterization of probability density functions cumulative frequency distributions cfds were plotted for particle length width w l ratio area volume mass and specific surface area as well as relative abundances of polymer types per environmental compartment median and mean values quantile ranges and standard deviations for these different properties were calculated subsequently probability density functions pdfs were fitted for particle length width area volume and mass for the six compartments pdfs for length and width were also analyzed on the sample level and for length also on the polymer level the particle length distribution of microplastics has been shown to follow a power law shape eq s1 kaandorp et al 2021 kooi and koelmans 2019 mattsson et al 2021 and the same can be expected for width since particle height was calculated using the median w l ratio times the width particle height will also follow a power law profile if particles would be perfect spheres or squares one would expect a power law slope for volume of one third of the slope of length our particles are assumed to be ellipsoid shaped so we expect the volume and surface area to follow a power law as well however with a lower slope exponent compared to the ones for length and width given the large range in volumes several orders of magnitude and the relatively small range in densities particle mass is expected to also follow a power law distribution with a similar slope as the one for particle volume the reciprocal of specific surface area calculated as surface area divided by mass was found to also follow a power law distribution after visual inspection of histograms 2 3 1 fitting power laws power laws usually only apply to values greater than some minimum x m i n in our case the minimum particle length width area volume or mass this minimum size was determined using kolmogorov smirnov ks statistics clauset et al 2009 the maximum distance between the cumulative frequency distributions of the data and the model for a combination of x m i n and α was determined this calculation was optimized to minimize the difference between the two distributions resulting in the optimal x m i n the power law exponent α was then estimated as α 1 n ln i x i x m i n 1 according to maximum likelihood estimation mle method clauset et al 2009 newman 2005 to ensure good parameter estimates each fit was bootstrapped to obtain means and standard deviations of both x m i n and α calculations were performed with the powerlaw package gillespie 2014 the estimation method was applied on three different levels a the compartment level b the sample level and c a lumped aquatic system level 2 3 2 particle distributions per aquatic compartment to obtain average distributions for particle length width area volume and mass per aquatic compartment we applied the mle method on the datasets that were extrapolated to have an identical sample volume section 2 2 particles 5000 μm in length were excluded from the analysis since a portion of these particles were removed by sieves before the analyses but some slipped through therefore it is unknown what fraction of all 5000 um particles was actually analysed with a bootstrap n 100 the mean and standard deviation of both x m i n and α were determined additionally for particle length and width we calculated x m i n and α for each sample individually again only for particles 5000 µm in length for some samples only one or two unique particle sizes were reported these samples were excluded from power law fitting given the lack of continuous distribution data also we set a threshold of at least 10 particles for a sample to be included a final criterion was that the estimated mean α had to exceed two times the standard deviation of α based on bootstrapping n 500 having one power law exponent per sample we calculated median slopes per aquatic compartment an average power law exponent for aquatic microplastic was calculated by combining data for the four relevant aquatic compartments i e surface waters and sediments in both the marine and freshwater environment since the number of samples differed per aquatic compartment a random subset of 5 exponents per compartment was selected and the mean of these 20 exponent values was calculated to account for the random variability this process was bootstrapped n 10 000 based on these results one overall power law exponent for aquatic microplastic length and width was obtained 2 3 3 particle size distributions per polymer type besides calculating power law exponents per sample we calculated exponents per polymer type per sample for particle length only here the same quality criteria as for the sample level calculations applied i e 2 unique sizes 10 individual particles and the bootstrapped n 500 mean was required to exceed two times the standard deviation we compared exponent distributions per polymer type and tested if correlations between exponents of different polymer types across samples occur spearman s rank correlation test 2 3 4 comparison of the particle size distributions we tested for significant differences in power law exponent distributions between the different aquatic media or polymer types using a non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test followed by a pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test with a significance threshold of p 0 05 additionally spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated for the polymer specific power law exponents spearman s correlation provides a pairwise comparison on the sample level between two polymers contrary to kruskal wallis and pairwise wilcoxon rank sum tests that test for differences between groups the spearman s correlation coefficient would be 1 or 1 if the two polymers show a monotonic relationship that is if the exponent of one polymer in a certain sample would increase or decrease so would the exponent of the other polymer in the same sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of representative samples based on extrapolating an analysis was performed to verify to what extent subsampling negatively affects the representativeness of power law slopes obtained from extrapolated datasets based on the comparison of the fitted linear regression with the 1 1 lines we conclude that original datasets with 500 observations are acceptable figures s1 s2 similar to the particle number criterium we also checked for the representativeness of subsample percentages of the sample or filter here based on comparison of original versus extrapolated alpha values inferred from our simulated datasets we set the criterium threshold at 60 figures s3 s4 therefore after extrapolation based on the correction factor cf we excluded datasets with both 500 particles and 60 of the sample or filter analyzed from further analyses note that our 60 criterium meant for finding accurate power law slopes is consistent with two laboratory based criteria where it was recommended to analyze at least 50 of the filter brandt et al 2021 mintenig et al 2020 what both the theoretical and lab based approach did not take into account was the sample volume for instance a large sample analyzed for 40 might give a better representation of the actual environmental composition than a small sample analyzed for 80 after all for the estimation of a power law exponent for a sample we need a sufficient number of particles irrespective of the volume of that sample sample volume criteria for natural waters have been suggested koelmans et al 2019 however these are independent of subsample percentages ideally there would be a combined criterium based on expected plastic concentrations sample volume and subsample percentages with these two criteria in effect 39 out of the 129 samples were excluded from our analyses fig 1 black stars table s1 while the remaining 90 samples were composed of 9 marine surface samples 13 marine sediment samples 21 freshwater surface waters 11 freshwater sediments 8 effluent samples and 28 biota samples 3 2 characteristics of aquatic microplastics cumulative distribution functions cdfs for particle length width width to length w l ratio surface area volume mass and specific surface area capture the multidimensionality of microplastic characteristics fig 2 table s3 here we discuss the main features of these distributions while later on we illustrate how they can inform the risk characterization based on specific effect mechanisms that require the specific data from these distributions section 3 6 particle length has some clear discrete steps which is the result of the pixel based analyses when using µftir primpke et al 2020b fig 2a it is also clear that biota and freshwater surface water samples were analyzed with a detection limit of 20 µm as compared to 11 µm for the other samples freshwater sediment samples have been analyzed using two µftir instruments and with different settings which explains the rapid rise at 20 µm although the upper size limit of the samples is around 5000 µm and even larger for some fibers almost all the particles are 300 µm in length at least 25 of the particles have a length equal to the detection limit table s3 first quantile and for biota freshwater surface water freshwater sediment and marine sediment the median is also very close or equal to the detection limit table s3 this illustrates the need for detailed analyses where samples taken with meshes of 300 or 500 µm will not suffice to get representative plastic concentrations benthic invertebrate samples contained the largest portion of small particles where a length larger than 20 µm occurs for less than 40 of the particles we assume this is the result of size selective feeding where ingestion is limited by the mouth opening of the organisms bern 1990 jâms et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 fibers and particles have been combined in all of the analyses in this study here we defined fibers as particles that have a length to width ratio 3 and a diameter of 15 µm mintenig et al 2020 primpke et al 2019 for all samples 7 4 of the particles are classified as fibers in the marine environment hardly any fibers are found with percentages 0 1 for effluents this percentage is 7 0 for biota 8 6 for freshwater surface waters 9 2 and for freshwater sediments 13 4 the minimum length for fibers for the four compartments where fibers are abundant is 60 µm median lengths range from 100 to 140 µm and maximum values vary between 2060 and 7470 µm even more so than for length the width of at least half of the particles is 11 or 20 µm table s3 for biota freshwater surface water freshwater sediment and marine sediment even the upper quantile is very close to the detection limit indicating that 75 of the data has a width of 20 or 11 µm the width is calculated based on the pixel arrangement primpke et al 2020b 2019 and can therefore be smaller than the detection limit because of this interpolation the cdf is more smooth as compared to the cdf for particle length the w l ratio has a clear dominance of 1 i e the width is equal to the length this can be explained by the dominance of small particles combined with the pixel based analyses around 25 of the particles have a w l ratio 0 5 fig 2c table s3 the median w l ratio is 0 67 for all particles including fibers which was used to calculate the particle height and subsequently the volume this value is close to the values used in the mpapp 0 7 and by simon et al 0 69 which are both mean values of a smaller dataset primpke et al 2020b simon et al 2018 the mean value for all our particles is 0 69 too however since the data are not normally distributed the median value was used for further calculations particle area volume and weight show rather continuous distributions fig 2d 2e 2f still with rapid increases for the lower particle sizes particle volume and mass range over several orders of magnitude which is the result of the three dimensional shape of particles that already varies two orders of magnitude in length and width specific surface area fig 2g shows a rapid increase only for the larger values seemingly the inverse of the other distributions which makes sense given it was calculated as surface area divided by weight median values for the ssa range from 0 29 m2 g 1 for freshwater surface waters to 0 53 m2 g 1 for marine surface waters table s3 these values are in the same order of magnitude as ssa values reported for different microplastic polymers those ranged between 0 59 and 3 2 m2 g 1 godoy et al 2019 whereas particle mass is mainly influenced by the large variability in particle volumes polymer densities are all relatively comparable table s2 table s3 however relative abundances of these different polymer types are different for different aquatic compartments fig 3 the largest percentage of buoyant polymers is found in freshwater surface waters followed by effluents benthic biota and marine surface waters sediments have the lowest percentage of buoyant polymers which makes sense given that particles need to settle from the water column in order to reach the sediment processes like aggregation and biofouling can result in the settling of buoyant plastics to the sediment layer however these processes take time kooi et al 2018 effluents and freshwater sediments show the highest abundance of acrylates potentially most of these particles settle in river sediments before they reach the marine environment on the other hand polyamide and polychloroprene are mainly found in the marine environment so they could originate from another source than terrestrial inputs for fibers the polymer composition in the four compartments that contained substantial amounts i e biota effluents and the freshwater compartments differed little from the overall sample analyses with acrylates still the most abundant in freshwater sediments and rod shaped rubber type 3 particles mainly ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber dominating the polymer distribution for biota since all these distributions account for the actual multidimensionality of the particles they represent a powerful tool set to assess the environmentally relevant exposure to biota 3 3 microplastic particle size distributions for aquatic compartments power law distributions were fitted on all data per water type for particle length width area volume and mass table s4 figs 4 s5 s8 the minimum length for which the power law distributions are valid range from 56 21 µm for marine sediment to 354 86 µm for freshwater sediment mean standard deviation below this minimum length the observations start to deviate from the fitted distribution mean power law exponents for particle length range from 2 1 0 03 for marine surface water to 3 3 0 19 for freshwater sediment for particle width exponent values were very comparable to the ones found for particle length ranging between 1 96 0 03 for marine surface waters to 2 87 0 17 for freshwater sediments since many of the particles have a w l ratio of 1 fig 2c this was expected the minimum size for which the width distributions follow a power law distribution are somewhat lower between 22 and 127 µm table s4 figure s5 for particle area exponents are 1 3 1 7 times lower than for length with exponents ranging between 1 50 0 009 for marine surface waters and 2 00 0 065 for freshwater surface waters fig s6 for particle volume exponents were again lower compared to particle length for perfect spherical particles a three times lower exponent would be expected for volume compared to length given the ellipsoid shaped particles the decrease was expected to be less than that so the 1 4 2 1 times lower exponent values for volume compared to length seem reasonable for particle volume power law exponents ranged between 1 40 0 004 for biota and 1 68 0 08 for freshwater surface water fig s7 as expected exponents for particle mass differed little from those for volume with values ranging between 1 32 0 01 for marine surface waters and 1 65 0 07 for freshwater surface waters fig s8 the specific surface area ssa distributions per environmental compartment were parameterized as the reciprocal of ssa fig s9 table s4 the mean exponent values range between 1 98 0 30 marine surface water and 2 82 0 10 freshwater sediment what should be noted for all these distributions is that the fitted minimum size and exponent are not independent in general the exponent increases with increasing values of the minimum size for the presentation of the data we assumed independence with the mean value for the minimum size as starting point of the valid fitted power law domain figs 4 s5 s9 for the largest particles the power law distribution tends to overestimate the actual abundance however there are very few of these larger particles in the samples compared to the number of particles in the size ranges for which the power law is most accurate to further study the variability in particle size distributions power law distributions for particle length and width were fitted for individual samples fig 5 for length the estimated values for the minimum length for which the power law is valid ranged from 20 to 832 µm for the 68 datasets that met the quality criteria section 2 3 2 the exponents ranged from 1 4 to 7 9 for all samples the power law exponent distributions for particle length of most compartments did not differ significantly from one another p 0 05 only freshwater surface water differed significantly both from biota p 0 0056 and from freshwater sediment p 0 042 for particle width 64 datasets were included after taking into account the quality criteria minimum values for which the power law is valid ranged from 12 to 511 µm and power law exponents ranged from 1 7 to 7 0 for all samples for width only freshwater surface water and biota differed significantly p 0 034 there were no significant differences between the exponents for particle length and width when performing a pairwise comparison per environmental compartment besides the median values and ranges for the different compartments we also calculated one average aquatic microplastic power law slope based on the four aquatic compartments i e marine and freshwater sediment and surface water we found that the length distribution of aquatic microplastic can best be described using a power law with a slope of 2 68 with values for individual samples ranging between 1 76 and 4 62 fig 5 for width the best estimate for the slope is 2 64 3 4 microplastic particle size distributions per polymer type particle size distributions were calculated per polymer type per sample fig 6 in total 421 power law exponents were calculated that fulfilled the set thresholds section 2 3 3 for a total of 21 different polymer types comparison of the exponents for different polymer types irrespective of environmental compartment revealed significant differences between both polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp with acrylates polyamide polyethylene chlorinated and rubber type 3 p 0 05 pe also differed significantly with nitrile rubber median values of the power law exponents for pe 2 5 and pp 2 7 are low compared to those for these other polymers i e rubber type 3 3 0 nitrile rubber 3 1 acrylates 3 2 polyamide 3 2 and polyethylene chlorinated 3 3 this implies that relatively many large pe and pp particles are present in the samples compared to the other polymers there are several mechanisms that could explain the observed differences in polymer specific size distributions different entry size of polymer particles polymer specific removal processes and fragmentation kinetics the density of pe and pp is lower than the density of most of the other polymers table s2 and lower than that of water at the same time water samples are most abundant in our dataset fig 5 table s1 it is possible that size selective settling of larger particles occurs for the non buoyant plastics i e acrylates polyamide rubber type 3 and nitrile rubber with preferential removal of larger particles from the water surface the power law exponent values will increase further differences in fragmentation kinetics i e resistance to fragmentation could also affect the size distributions of different polymer types fragmentation is driven by environmental factors including uv radiation wind waves and biodegradation and the rate of fragmentation depends on physical thermal and mechanical properties of the polymer min et al 2020 little is known about actual fragmentation rates but polymers have been ranked on their probability of surface erosion with that probability increasing with decreasing hydrophobicity polyethylene and polypropylene have a low probability of surface erosion whereas polyamide and acrylates are more likely to experience surface erosion min et al 2020 therefore all of these mechanisms provide plausible explanations for the observed polymer specific size distributions the groupwise comparison among polymers indicates polymer specific particle size characteristics aside from this groupwise comparison we also tested for rank correlations i e spearman s rank correlation test with these correlations the focus is on the pairwise comparison on the sample level in other words are there differences in particle size characteristics between different sample locations we found significant correlations p 0 05 for 9 polymer pairs with correlation coefficients varying between 0 7 and 0 9 table s5 fig s10 for these polymers it is clear that size distributions are location dependent that is some samples have relatively more small particles for the two correlated polymers compared to other samples it is possible that differences in sources environmental conditions that influence aggregation and biofouling and physical processes that influence settling and burial explain the differences between the different locations environmental compartments alone do not seem to explain the difference in exponent values for different samples fig s10 some polymers that did not differ significantly in the group wise comparison do show a significant correlation with comparison on the polymer level a large spread in exponent values will likely cause the polymer to not differ significantly from other polymers on the other hand such a large spread can still result in significant correlations as long as the values are paired per sample location 3 5 general applicability of exponent values the compartments that we studied were heterogeneous for instance rivers in itself already represent a wide range of turbulence conditions furthermore the studied compartments contained subsets from different systems e g sediment from rhine and dommel surface water from meuse dommel and ditches adjacent to the dommel implying that different sediment morphologies and hydrodynamics are included nevertheless our data shows that the exponent values calibrated per compartment have low relative standard deviation table s4 we argue that the exponent values although operationally defined can be used in a generic way for similar compartments however we emphasize that it would still be best if scientists studying other environmental systems or areas use the workflow presented here to obtain system specific pdfs and exponent values exponent values calibrated for a specific compartment and set of conditions will always be most accurate only if such data are not available the exponent values provided here could be considered as best available proxies for other systems the values must then be used taking into account the uncertainty for example by probabilistic modeling using a range of exponent values we recommend this would anyway always be done when using the average value of 2 68 for aquatic microplastic another aspect related to applicability is the extent to which power law distributions and exponent values could make sense beyond the upper and lower bounds a recent study parameterized a theoretical particle length distributions for ocean surface waters based on a cascading fragmentation model and taking into account different size selective particle transport processes kaandorp et al 2021 although model assumptions differed from some of the environmental conditions in the present dataset they report a power law exponent value of 2 67 based on fractal fragmentation alone which is similar to the average exponent value of 2 68 that we found for aquatic microplastic i e when combining freshwater and marine surface waters and sediments the minimum size for which their power law regime was valid was in the order of several millimeters whereas in our study minimum sizes ranged from 50 to 350 µm this agreement may suggest a wider applicability above our present upper size limit in contrast at the lower end of the size range a study of nano fragmentation of expanded polystyrene in a closed and mixed system showed that particle size distributions followed a power law shape distribution from 5000 down to 0 1 µm mattsson et al 2021 the lower than expected abundance of the smallest particles based on the power law prediction fig 4 can be explained by size selective processes such as wind mixing aggregation settling and beaching kaandorp et al 2021 kooi et al 2018 however since we do not find a higher abundance of these smallest particles in sediments only aggregation and consequent settling would not explain this deviation from the power law regime another potential explanation relates to detection accuracy mattsson et al could detect particles down to 10 nm by combining three different instrumental analytical techniques each targeting a part of the total size range mattsson et al 2021 whereas in our study detection limits were 11 or 20 µm depending on the µftir instrument used in the theoretical fragmentation study data used for calibration reported values down to 100 µm kaandorp et al 2021 so it seems that with a lower size detection limit the minimum size for which the power law regime is valid is also lower an upper size limit for the power law regime is not clearly defined the five studies used here aimed at quantifying small particles and consequently could not always take very large sample volumes studies that focused on larger particles e g 300 or 500 µm using trawls found power law regimes to extend to larger particle sizes too cózar et al 2014 kaandorp et al 2021 similar to the minimum size the maximum size for which the power law regime is valid might mainly be a result of sampling design we therefore argue that the presented power law exponents are likely to be valid from 1 to 5000 µm that is the whole microplastic size range although further research to validate this is recommended especially for the low end of the size range it is possible that distributions beyond those limits still follow the same regime but since there is little data on this it is difficult to verify at this moment the here presented observations support published approaches that use power law extrapolations to rescale number concentration data obtained with methods that target only part of the microplastic size range to the full 1 to 5000 µm size range everaert et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 mohamed nor et al 2021 3 6 linking probability density functions to ecologically relevant dose metrics for risk assessment we have discussed the main features of the probability density functions pdfs of different microplastic properties for different compartments and polymers all of these properties can inform risk characterization based on specific interactions with organisms that would require data specific to these distributions here we discuss how these diverse interactions their dose metrics i e ecologically relevant metrics erm and associated diverse microplastic characteristics can be unified to refine prospective risk assessment the distribution of particle length and width figs 2a 2b 4 and s5 is relevant for quantifying bioavailability bioavailability can relate to size limits for tissue uptake or translocation mohamed nor et al 2021 or when for instance the mouth opening has to be larger than the width of the particle for ingestion to occur jâms et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 the average power law slopes for aquatic microplastic length and width table s4 are much higher than the previously reported value of 1 6 kooi and koelmans 2019 which implies that the relative abundance of microplastics that is bioavailable to organisms is higher too the shape of the particle fig 2c here expressed via the width to length ratio is important for shape specific toxicity long thin fibers for instance are considered more toxic au et al 2015 de ruijter et al 2020 gray and weinstein 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 we have shown that fibers make up a significant part of the particles in our data set so it is important to focus not only on the number of particles but also on the shape particle surface area is toxicologically relevant because it is the surface which makes contact with the biological system whereas the plastic itself is considered to have little toxicity surface area is considered to be the dose metric relevant for oxidative stress schmid and stoeger 2016 furthermore particle area is relevant for hazardous substances that bind to the surface e g toxic trace metals and pathogens fubini 1997 schmid and stoeger 2016 schwarze et al 2007 overall particle surface area thus can be considered a very significant toxicologically relevant characteristic of small microplastic particles riediker et al 2019 which emphasizes the importance of the environmentally relevant area distributions that now are available figs 2d s6 volume distributions figs 2e s7 would be required if one wants to quantify effects that depend on total volume ingested such as the food dilution effect mechanism de ruijter et al 2020 rauchschwalbe et al 2021 which can be used to correct species sensitivity distributions or other frameworks that target this effect mechanism koelmans et al 2020 similarly particle weight figs 2f s8 is relevant for effect mechanisms where the stressor needs to be expressed on a mass basis like for organic chemical exposure for which plastic associated chemical concentrations are mass based bakir et al 2016 velzeboer et al 2014 mass distributions are also required for realistic number to mass conversions that remain true to the material as it occurs in nature de ruijter et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 some effect mechanisms for particle toxicity correlate best with specific surface area i e area per mass m2 g 1 figs 2g s9 for instance in vitro cytotoxicity guthrie jr 1997 michel et al 2014 and inflammation stoeger et al 2006 tran et al 2000 are found to be related to the ssa of particles also the ssa can be a measure for chemical adsorption to microplastics godoy et al 2019 polymer type fig 3 influences transport and fate characteristics of the particles and therefore the bioavailability and accessibility for species living in different habitats besides bioavailability biological and chemical interactions can also be polymer specific endo and koelmans 2016 frère et al 2018 godoy et al 2019 velzeboer et al 2014 3 7 alignment of exposure and thresholds effect concentrations for different dose metrics for a consistent characterization of microplastic risk the dose metric used for the exposure assessment needs to be the same as the metric used for the effect assessment koelmans et al 2017 because there are different exposure and dose metrics we describe here a method to align and convert them the example is based on number concentrations however we provide equations to convert these into concentrations for other metrics as well a numerical example for all calculations in this workflow is provided as supporting information section s3 3 7 1 rescaling exposure data previously we have provided a method to rescale environmental microplastic number concentrations measured with methods that target different size ranges to the complete default microplastic size range i e 1 5000 μm or any other desired size range koelmans et al 2020 given an upper limit ul and lower limit ll of the measured and default size range a dimensionless correction factor c f meas is defined that rescales the measured m number concentration for a certain size range to the number concentration for the microplastic default d size range e g 1 to 5000 μm based on the power law distribution for length l with slope α l table s4 koelmans et al 2020 1 c f m e a s l u l d 1 α l l l d 1 α l u l m 1 α l l l m 1 α the measured exposure number concentration c m e a s l is multiplied with c f m e a s to obtain a rescaled exposure number concentration c e n v c f m e a s c m e a s that represents the complete environmentally relevant range for best accuracy a value for α l is preferably used that is calibrated for the particular environmental compartment such as that in table s4 the rationale for using compartment level exponent values i e table s4 is the ecological relevance for aquatic communities for which the habitat would be defined on a compartment level rather than a sample level mean values such as those for aquatic microplastics of 2 68 are better avoided unless the uncertainty around the mean is justified probabilistically 3 7 2 rescaling effect data the rescaled exposure concentrations as calculated using eq 1 represent the default microplastic size range and should be compared to threshold effect concentrations ec for a particular effect mechanism and thus erm which are expressed for the same default size range this requires two corrections the first correction is needed because only a part of the default microplastic size range is bioavailable to exert effects for instance ingestion of the particles often is considered to be a prerequisite for particle effects de ruijter et al 2020 in which case thus a correction for bioavailability via ingestion is required tissue uptake or translocation also are size restricted e g mohamed nor et al 2021 which thus also would require a size related bioavailability correction the required equation for these corrections is as follows the threshold effect concentration for the bioavailable size fraction of particles e c poly l can be related to the threshold effect concentration for the environmentally relevant 1 to 5000 μm range of particles e c env l by using a slight modification of the c f m e a s in eq 1 c f b i o 2 e c e n v e c p o l y c f b i o the only difference between c f m e a s and c f b i o is the use of ul b and ll b in the denominator for c f b i o representing the upper and lower size limit of the bioavailable size fraction respectively the second correction is required because reported effect concentrations almost always relate to monodisperse microplastic particles whereas in nature microplastic particles are polydisperse this second correction is specific for the erm under consideration because polydispersity is defined by the power law slope for that erm table s4 for a given effect threshold for erm x where x for instance is number mass volume area or specific surface area it does not matter if this threshold relates to mono or polydisperse particles as long as the magnitude of the threshold remains the same koelmans et al 2020 for instance if the erm is particle volume one would calculate total volume of the monodisperse particles at the threshold effect number concentration reported in literature and then calculate which number concentration of polydisperse particles has the same volume while using the power law slope for volume koelmans et al 2020 as this can be done for any erm x we here introduce a generic equation which preserves the erm of interest between mono and polydisperse particles at a certain erm threshold effect level 3 e c p o l y μ x p o l y e c m o n o μ x m o n o here e c m o n o l is the effect number concentration for monodisperse particles and μ x m o n o is the mean value for erm x for these monodisperse particles e g from literature test data if the erm is number μ x m o n o is 1 note that eq 3 can also be used to convert ec values for distributions with different degrees of polydispersity if the probability distribution of erm x follows a power law regime the mean erm value for the polydisperse particles μ x p o l y can be calculated as 4 μ x p o l y 1 α x 2 α x x u l 2 α x x l l 2 α x x u l 1 α x x l l 1 α x ul and ll relate to the upper and lower limit in erm x for which the mean is calculated and α x is the power law exponent value of erm x note this equation does not apply when α x is exactly 1 or 2 see section s2 for a derivation including versions for all α x values and table s4 for different exponent values calculation of the limits ul and ll differs for different dose metrics for length and width the limits are determined by the aforementioned bioavailability limits for length given the default microplastic size range ll and ul are equal to 1 and 5000 μm respectively if bioavailability relates to ingestion the limits for width would range between 1 μm ll and the mouth opening of the organism ul for surface area and volume ul and ll can be calculated using the appropriate ellipsoid equations see section 2 3 for which then the same minimum and maximum bioavailable values for length and width are used while for height a value of 0 67 width is used for mass the limits can be calculated by multiplying bioavailable ellipsoid volume with the average density table s3 for specific surface area the surface area is divided by the mass by combining eqs 2 to 4 the threshold effect concentration for the erm of choice e c e n v can be calculated now that the threshold effect concentration e c e n v and the exposure concentration c e n v are aligned and scaled to the full 1 to 5000 μm microplastic size range a consistent risk characterization can be done numerical example see section s3 note that the characterization is based on number concentrations which may seem counterintuitive if the actual erm would relate to e g volume mass or area however we can easily convert exposure and effect number concentrations into for instance equivalent volume mass or area concentrations μm3 l μg l μm2 l by multiplying them with the mean value of their respective power law distributions eq 4 which yields 5 c e n v e r m x μ x p o l y c e n v and e c e n v e r m x μ x p o l y e c e n v in this case the limits ll and ul in μ x p o l y eq 4 would relate to the values of the erm at the 1 and 5000 μm size limits respectively rather than to bioavailability limits in the risk characterization c e n v e r m x e c e n v e r m x however μ x p o l y cancels out eq 5 also defines the conversion of number to mass concentration or vice versa finally the above procedure applies to one erm at a time however microplastic particles are likely to cause multiple effects simultaneously once their respective threshold effect concentrations are exceeded this means that the approach offered here can be used to rank the impact thresholds for the different dose metrics of interest with the most sensitive one determining the ultimate risk 4 conclusions continuous power law distributions for microplastic particle characteristics length width area volume mass and specific surface area have been parameterized taking new quality criteria for accuracy loss due to subsampling into account we show how each of these particle characteristics links to a dose metric relevant for microplastic effect mechanisms we found that distributions of these characteristics differed for marine and freshwater surface waters and sediments waste water effluents and benthic freshwater biota we demonstrated that distributions for particle size were polymer specific with the presented distributions and scaling laws exposure data from environmental concentrations as well as effect concentrations obtained in experiments using monodisperse particles can be aligned and rescaled to obtain consistent risk characterizations that fully represent the multidimensionality of microplastic 5 contributors mk sp and aak designed the study data was collected and re analyzed by sp smm cl

16796,understanding the multidimensionality of microplastics is essential for a realistic assessment of the risks these particles pose to the environment and human health here we capture size shape area polymer volume and mass characteristics of 60 000 individual microplastic particles as continuous distributions particles originate from samples taken from different aquatic compartments including surface water and sediments from the marine and freshwater environment waste water effluents and freshwater organisms data were obtained using state of the art ftir imaging using the same automated imaging post processing software we introduce a workflow with two quality criteria that assure minimum data quality loss due to volumetric and filter area subsampling we find that probability density functions pdfs for particle length follow power law distributions with median slopes ranging from 2 2 for marine surface water to 3 1 for biota samples and that these slopes were compartment specific polymer specific pdfs for particle length demonstrated significant differences in slopes among polymers hinting at polymer specific sources removal or fragmentation processes furthermore we provide pdfs for particle width width to length ratio area specific surface area volume and mass distributions and propose how these can represent the full diversity of toxicologically relevant dose metrics required for the assessment of microplastic risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics probability density functions size distribution risk assessment environment human health 1 introduction environmental microplastic consists of a complex diverse mixture of particles with different sizes shapes and polymer types burns and boxall 2018 kooi and koelmans 2019 rochman et al 2019 discrete classifications of these properties are however unable to capture the full diversity of the microplastic mixture kooi and koelmans 2019 better parameterization of this mixture is needed for those seeking realistic risk assessments everaert et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 probability density functions pdfs are mathematical functions that describe the actual distribution of a certain microplastic characteristic as such they have the potential to capture the continuous nature of the different properties of these diverse mixtures kooi and koelmans 2019 the advantage of these pdfs as opposed to more traditional discrete binning or classification methods is the level of detail that is maintained when presenting the results distributions can be compared more easily since their presentation is independent of the chosen bin width or class additionally when the pdfs are parameterized the resulting functions can form the basis for probabilistic risk modeling de ruijter et al 2020 kooi and koelmans 2019 mohamed nor et al 2021 they allow for the accurate definition of the dose metrics that are relevant for ecological effects or toxicological effects on humans while retaining the diversity of environmental or dietary microplastic for risk characterization these dose metrics can be aligned for the exposure and effect assessment by taking into account the effect mechanism koelmans et al 2017 thus far pdfs have been parametrized for microplastic sizes shapes and densities kooi and koelmans 2019 and these parameters have been used for risk assessments in the marine and freshwater environment everaert et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 a similar probabilistic approach has been used to characterize microplastics in food and air resulting in a probabilistic exposure assessment for humans mohamed nor et al 2021 the parameterization by kooi and koelmans 2019 was based on best available information however data on individual particle characteristics was not available empirical data on particle size was obtained from published tables and graphs so only binned count data for arbitrary size classes was used despite being a commonly used method fitting a power law on binned data via linear regression on the log log scale can result in substantial biases of the parameter estimates because with binning one loses the information on trends in the data within a bin clauset et al 2009 newman 2005 white et al 2008 a better approach is the maximum likelihood estimation mle method clauset et al 2009 newman 2005 white et al 2008 for particle shape and density kooi and koelmans 2019 combined average relative abundances of shape categories and polymer types with estimates of 3d shape descriptions and polymer densities these also are less accurate than actual data on shape and polymer id on an individual particle level therefore here we aim to provide parameterizations of microplastic pdfs this time based on much higher quality datasets with characteristics on the individual microplastic particle level microplastic characteristics such as size shape and polymer type can be obtained on the individual particle level using fourier transform infrared ftir imaging or raman microspectroscopy or when combing visual selection with attenuated total reflection atr ftir when combining ftir imaging with automated analyses software like simple and the mpapp primpke et al 2020a 2019 the comparability between studies is greatly enhanced however this type of detailed analyses and the required sample preparation is very time consuming therefore most researchers analyze only a fraction of their sample and filter and assume that results obtained for these subsamples would apply to the whole sample and thus can be extrapolated back to 100 sample size lorenz et al 2019 mintenig et al 2020 although this is a common approach few studies assessed to what extent subsampling affects the assessment of particle property distributions abel et al 2021 brandt et al 2021 consequently before detailed analyses of the actual data can take place a better understanding of the adequacy of sample extrapolation is required aim of the present paper is to provide characteristics of microplastic particles across environmental compartments via continuous distributions secondary aims are to assess to what extent subsampling affects the accuracy of such distributions and to discuss how these distributions can be used to tackle the multidimensionality of microplastic with respect to dose metrics as used in risk assessment for the environment and human health we perform a meta analysis of data from five studies that used state of the art ftir imaging and automated image analyses software lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 mintenig et al 2020 pan et al 2021 primpke et al 2019 first we quantify the loss of accuracy in pdf quantification due to subsample extrapolation and set two quality criteria to assure representativeness the five studies focused on different aquatic compartments i e freshwater marine surface water and sediment waste water effluent and freshwater benthic invertebrates we present and compare pdfs for microplastic length width width to length ratio area specific surface area volume and mass for the different aquatic compartments additionally we parameterize and compare power law distributions using the mle method focusing on the aquatic compartment level the sample level and the polymer level the distributions are discussed in the context of a realistic risk assessment framework capable of accommodating all microplastic dose metrics that may be relevant given the effect mechanisms identified for particulate matter from the environment de ruijter et al 2020 kögel et al 2020 wright and kelly 2017 2 methods 2 1 data collection particle length width and polymer type data from five studies targeting different environmental compartments were used the environmental compartments include marine surface water and sediment lorenz et al 2019 freshwater surface water mintenig et al 2020 freshwater sediment mani et al 2019 pan et al 2021 waste water effluent mintenig et al 2020 primpke et al 2019 and benthic freshwater biota pan et al 2021 fig 1 note that results we obtain are specific for these datasets and do not necessarily apply to all sediment water or biota samples worldwide the studies differed regarding sampling methods and examined sample type table s1 but are comparable analytically particles 500 µm lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 or 300 µm mintenig et al 2020 pan et al 2021 have been analyzed using stereo microscopes and atr ftir analysis no data on particles 500 µm were available for the german waste water effluents primpke et al 2019 smaller particles were analyzed using µftir instruments from different manufacturers were used that either applied a focal plane array fpa detector bruker hyperion 3000 lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 primpke et al 2019 agilent cary 620 pan et al 2021 or a single element detector thermofischer scientific nicolet in10 mintenig et al 2020 further all ftir data were analyzed using the same reference database primpke et al 2018 and automated particle identification using the software simple and mpapp primpke et al 2020a 2019 the lower size detection limit depended on the µftir instrument and settings used and was either 11 µm lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 primpke et al 2019 or 20 µm mintenig et al 2020 pan et al 2021 image analysis provided information on the particle s length width and polymer type based on these variables other particle properties including width to length ratio w l surface area volume mass and specific surface area ssa were calculated particles were assumed to have an ellipsoid shape for surface area and volume calculations koelmans et al 2020 primpke et al 2020b simon et al 2018 since the height of particles cannot be measured using atr ftir and µftir imaging techniques it was assumed that the median w l ratio is equal to the median height to width ratio therefore the height was calculated as median w l ratio times width koelmans et al 2020 kooi and koelmans 2019 primpke et al 2020b simon et al 2018 particle mass was estimated by multiplying particle volume with the density of the detected polymer table s2 specific surface area was calculated as the surface area divided by the mass 2 2 extrapolation of subsample analyses most studies analyze only a part of their samples and or filter areas after which data are extrapolated to represent the full sample this assumes particle characteristics detected for the subsample would apply to the whole sample as well since in reality two microplastic particles are never identical this is a critical assumption using simulated samples and particles we tested to what extent subsampling and subsequent extrapolation influences the parameters of pdfs for particle size subsequently we set two quality criteria based on the minimum number of particles in a sample criterium 1 and the subsample percentage of the sample or filter criterium 2 to assure we adequately capture the size distribution of a full sample in order to be able to include a sample in the further data analyzes at least one of the criteria had to be met for details on these tests the reader is referred to the supporting information section s1 after this quality screening the number of particles included for each of the compartments was 3890 biota samples 10 356 effluent 19 676 freshwater sediment 1748 marine sediment 21 004 freshwater surface water and 2502 marine surface water 2 3 parameterization of probability density functions cumulative frequency distributions cfds were plotted for particle length width w l ratio area volume mass and specific surface area as well as relative abundances of polymer types per environmental compartment median and mean values quantile ranges and standard deviations for these different properties were calculated subsequently probability density functions pdfs were fitted for particle length width area volume and mass for the six compartments pdfs for length and width were also analyzed on the sample level and for length also on the polymer level the particle length distribution of microplastics has been shown to follow a power law shape eq s1 kaandorp et al 2021 kooi and koelmans 2019 mattsson et al 2021 and the same can be expected for width since particle height was calculated using the median w l ratio times the width particle height will also follow a power law profile if particles would be perfect spheres or squares one would expect a power law slope for volume of one third of the slope of length our particles are assumed to be ellipsoid shaped so we expect the volume and surface area to follow a power law as well however with a lower slope exponent compared to the ones for length and width given the large range in volumes several orders of magnitude and the relatively small range in densities particle mass is expected to also follow a power law distribution with a similar slope as the one for particle volume the reciprocal of specific surface area calculated as surface area divided by mass was found to also follow a power law distribution after visual inspection of histograms 2 3 1 fitting power laws power laws usually only apply to values greater than some minimum x m i n in our case the minimum particle length width area volume or mass this minimum size was determined using kolmogorov smirnov ks statistics clauset et al 2009 the maximum distance between the cumulative frequency distributions of the data and the model for a combination of x m i n and α was determined this calculation was optimized to minimize the difference between the two distributions resulting in the optimal x m i n the power law exponent α was then estimated as α 1 n ln i x i x m i n 1 according to maximum likelihood estimation mle method clauset et al 2009 newman 2005 to ensure good parameter estimates each fit was bootstrapped to obtain means and standard deviations of both x m i n and α calculations were performed with the powerlaw package gillespie 2014 the estimation method was applied on three different levels a the compartment level b the sample level and c a lumped aquatic system level 2 3 2 particle distributions per aquatic compartment to obtain average distributions for particle length width area volume and mass per aquatic compartment we applied the mle method on the datasets that were extrapolated to have an identical sample volume section 2 2 particles 5000 μm in length were excluded from the analysis since a portion of these particles were removed by sieves before the analyses but some slipped through therefore it is unknown what fraction of all 5000 um particles was actually analysed with a bootstrap n 100 the mean and standard deviation of both x m i n and α were determined additionally for particle length and width we calculated x m i n and α for each sample individually again only for particles 5000 µm in length for some samples only one or two unique particle sizes were reported these samples were excluded from power law fitting given the lack of continuous distribution data also we set a threshold of at least 10 particles for a sample to be included a final criterion was that the estimated mean α had to exceed two times the standard deviation of α based on bootstrapping n 500 having one power law exponent per sample we calculated median slopes per aquatic compartment an average power law exponent for aquatic microplastic was calculated by combining data for the four relevant aquatic compartments i e surface waters and sediments in both the marine and freshwater environment since the number of samples differed per aquatic compartment a random subset of 5 exponents per compartment was selected and the mean of these 20 exponent values was calculated to account for the random variability this process was bootstrapped n 10 000 based on these results one overall power law exponent for aquatic microplastic length and width was obtained 2 3 3 particle size distributions per polymer type besides calculating power law exponents per sample we calculated exponents per polymer type per sample for particle length only here the same quality criteria as for the sample level calculations applied i e 2 unique sizes 10 individual particles and the bootstrapped n 500 mean was required to exceed two times the standard deviation we compared exponent distributions per polymer type and tested if correlations between exponents of different polymer types across samples occur spearman s rank correlation test 2 3 4 comparison of the particle size distributions we tested for significant differences in power law exponent distributions between the different aquatic media or polymer types using a non parametric kruskal wallis rank sum test followed by a pairwise wilcoxon rank sum test with a significance threshold of p 0 05 additionally spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated for the polymer specific power law exponents spearman s correlation provides a pairwise comparison on the sample level between two polymers contrary to kruskal wallis and pairwise wilcoxon rank sum tests that test for differences between groups the spearman s correlation coefficient would be 1 or 1 if the two polymers show a monotonic relationship that is if the exponent of one polymer in a certain sample would increase or decrease so would the exponent of the other polymer in the same sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of representative samples based on extrapolating an analysis was performed to verify to what extent subsampling negatively affects the representativeness of power law slopes obtained from extrapolated datasets based on the comparison of the fitted linear regression with the 1 1 lines we conclude that original datasets with 500 observations are acceptable figures s1 s2 similar to the particle number criterium we also checked for the representativeness of subsample percentages of the sample or filter here based on comparison of original versus extrapolated alpha values inferred from our simulated datasets we set the criterium threshold at 60 figures s3 s4 therefore after extrapolation based on the correction factor cf we excluded datasets with both 500 particles and 60 of the sample or filter analyzed from further analyses note that our 60 criterium meant for finding accurate power law slopes is consistent with two laboratory based criteria where it was recommended to analyze at least 50 of the filter brandt et al 2021 mintenig et al 2020 what both the theoretical and lab based approach did not take into account was the sample volume for instance a large sample analyzed for 40 might give a better representation of the actual environmental composition than a small sample analyzed for 80 after all for the estimation of a power law exponent for a sample we need a sufficient number of particles irrespective of the volume of that sample sample volume criteria for natural waters have been suggested koelmans et al 2019 however these are independent of subsample percentages ideally there would be a combined criterium based on expected plastic concentrations sample volume and subsample percentages with these two criteria in effect 39 out of the 129 samples were excluded from our analyses fig 1 black stars table s1 while the remaining 90 samples were composed of 9 marine surface samples 13 marine sediment samples 21 freshwater surface waters 11 freshwater sediments 8 effluent samples and 28 biota samples 3 2 characteristics of aquatic microplastics cumulative distribution functions cdfs for particle length width width to length w l ratio surface area volume mass and specific surface area capture the multidimensionality of microplastic characteristics fig 2 table s3 here we discuss the main features of these distributions while later on we illustrate how they can inform the risk characterization based on specific effect mechanisms that require the specific data from these distributions section 3 6 particle length has some clear discrete steps which is the result of the pixel based analyses when using µftir primpke et al 2020b fig 2a it is also clear that biota and freshwater surface water samples were analyzed with a detection limit of 20 µm as compared to 11 µm for the other samples freshwater sediment samples have been analyzed using two µftir instruments and with different settings which explains the rapid rise at 20 µm although the upper size limit of the samples is around 5000 µm and even larger for some fibers almost all the particles are 300 µm in length at least 25 of the particles have a length equal to the detection limit table s3 first quantile and for biota freshwater surface water freshwater sediment and marine sediment the median is also very close or equal to the detection limit table s3 this illustrates the need for detailed analyses where samples taken with meshes of 300 or 500 µm will not suffice to get representative plastic concentrations benthic invertebrate samples contained the largest portion of small particles where a length larger than 20 µm occurs for less than 40 of the particles we assume this is the result of size selective feeding where ingestion is limited by the mouth opening of the organisms bern 1990 jâms et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 fibers and particles have been combined in all of the analyses in this study here we defined fibers as particles that have a length to width ratio 3 and a diameter of 15 µm mintenig et al 2020 primpke et al 2019 for all samples 7 4 of the particles are classified as fibers in the marine environment hardly any fibers are found with percentages 0 1 for effluents this percentage is 7 0 for biota 8 6 for freshwater surface waters 9 2 and for freshwater sediments 13 4 the minimum length for fibers for the four compartments where fibers are abundant is 60 µm median lengths range from 100 to 140 µm and maximum values vary between 2060 and 7470 µm even more so than for length the width of at least half of the particles is 11 or 20 µm table s3 for biota freshwater surface water freshwater sediment and marine sediment even the upper quantile is very close to the detection limit indicating that 75 of the data has a width of 20 or 11 µm the width is calculated based on the pixel arrangement primpke et al 2020b 2019 and can therefore be smaller than the detection limit because of this interpolation the cdf is more smooth as compared to the cdf for particle length the w l ratio has a clear dominance of 1 i e the width is equal to the length this can be explained by the dominance of small particles combined with the pixel based analyses around 25 of the particles have a w l ratio 0 5 fig 2c table s3 the median w l ratio is 0 67 for all particles including fibers which was used to calculate the particle height and subsequently the volume this value is close to the values used in the mpapp 0 7 and by simon et al 0 69 which are both mean values of a smaller dataset primpke et al 2020b simon et al 2018 the mean value for all our particles is 0 69 too however since the data are not normally distributed the median value was used for further calculations particle area volume and weight show rather continuous distributions fig 2d 2e 2f still with rapid increases for the lower particle sizes particle volume and mass range over several orders of magnitude which is the result of the three dimensional shape of particles that already varies two orders of magnitude in length and width specific surface area fig 2g shows a rapid increase only for the larger values seemingly the inverse of the other distributions which makes sense given it was calculated as surface area divided by weight median values for the ssa range from 0 29 m2 g 1 for freshwater surface waters to 0 53 m2 g 1 for marine surface waters table s3 these values are in the same order of magnitude as ssa values reported for different microplastic polymers those ranged between 0 59 and 3 2 m2 g 1 godoy et al 2019 whereas particle mass is mainly influenced by the large variability in particle volumes polymer densities are all relatively comparable table s2 table s3 however relative abundances of these different polymer types are different for different aquatic compartments fig 3 the largest percentage of buoyant polymers is found in freshwater surface waters followed by effluents benthic biota and marine surface waters sediments have the lowest percentage of buoyant polymers which makes sense given that particles need to settle from the water column in order to reach the sediment processes like aggregation and biofouling can result in the settling of buoyant plastics to the sediment layer however these processes take time kooi et al 2018 effluents and freshwater sediments show the highest abundance of acrylates potentially most of these particles settle in river sediments before they reach the marine environment on the other hand polyamide and polychloroprene are mainly found in the marine environment so they could originate from another source than terrestrial inputs for fibers the polymer composition in the four compartments that contained substantial amounts i e biota effluents and the freshwater compartments differed little from the overall sample analyses with acrylates still the most abundant in freshwater sediments and rod shaped rubber type 3 particles mainly ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber dominating the polymer distribution for biota since all these distributions account for the actual multidimensionality of the particles they represent a powerful tool set to assess the environmentally relevant exposure to biota 3 3 microplastic particle size distributions for aquatic compartments power law distributions were fitted on all data per water type for particle length width area volume and mass table s4 figs 4 s5 s8 the minimum length for which the power law distributions are valid range from 56 21 µm for marine sediment to 354 86 µm for freshwater sediment mean standard deviation below this minimum length the observations start to deviate from the fitted distribution mean power law exponents for particle length range from 2 1 0 03 for marine surface water to 3 3 0 19 for freshwater sediment for particle width exponent values were very comparable to the ones found for particle length ranging between 1 96 0 03 for marine surface waters to 2 87 0 17 for freshwater sediments since many of the particles have a w l ratio of 1 fig 2c this was expected the minimum size for which the width distributions follow a power law distribution are somewhat lower between 22 and 127 µm table s4 figure s5 for particle area exponents are 1 3 1 7 times lower than for length with exponents ranging between 1 50 0 009 for marine surface waters and 2 00 0 065 for freshwater surface waters fig s6 for particle volume exponents were again lower compared to particle length for perfect spherical particles a three times lower exponent would be expected for volume compared to length given the ellipsoid shaped particles the decrease was expected to be less than that so the 1 4 2 1 times lower exponent values for volume compared to length seem reasonable for particle volume power law exponents ranged between 1 40 0 004 for biota and 1 68 0 08 for freshwater surface water fig s7 as expected exponents for particle mass differed little from those for volume with values ranging between 1 32 0 01 for marine surface waters and 1 65 0 07 for freshwater surface waters fig s8 the specific surface area ssa distributions per environmental compartment were parameterized as the reciprocal of ssa fig s9 table s4 the mean exponent values range between 1 98 0 30 marine surface water and 2 82 0 10 freshwater sediment what should be noted for all these distributions is that the fitted minimum size and exponent are not independent in general the exponent increases with increasing values of the minimum size for the presentation of the data we assumed independence with the mean value for the minimum size as starting point of the valid fitted power law domain figs 4 s5 s9 for the largest particles the power law distribution tends to overestimate the actual abundance however there are very few of these larger particles in the samples compared to the number of particles in the size ranges for which the power law is most accurate to further study the variability in particle size distributions power law distributions for particle length and width were fitted for individual samples fig 5 for length the estimated values for the minimum length for which the power law is valid ranged from 20 to 832 µm for the 68 datasets that met the quality criteria section 2 3 2 the exponents ranged from 1 4 to 7 9 for all samples the power law exponent distributions for particle length of most compartments did not differ significantly from one another p 0 05 only freshwater surface water differed significantly both from biota p 0 0056 and from freshwater sediment p 0 042 for particle width 64 datasets were included after taking into account the quality criteria minimum values for which the power law is valid ranged from 12 to 511 µm and power law exponents ranged from 1 7 to 7 0 for all samples for width only freshwater surface water and biota differed significantly p 0 034 there were no significant differences between the exponents for particle length and width when performing a pairwise comparison per environmental compartment besides the median values and ranges for the different compartments we also calculated one average aquatic microplastic power law slope based on the four aquatic compartments i e marine and freshwater sediment and surface water we found that the length distribution of aquatic microplastic can best be described using a power law with a slope of 2 68 with values for individual samples ranging between 1 76 and 4 62 fig 5 for width the best estimate for the slope is 2 64 3 4 microplastic particle size distributions per polymer type particle size distributions were calculated per polymer type per sample fig 6 in total 421 power law exponents were calculated that fulfilled the set thresholds section 2 3 3 for a total of 21 different polymer types comparison of the exponents for different polymer types irrespective of environmental compartment revealed significant differences between both polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp with acrylates polyamide polyethylene chlorinated and rubber type 3 p 0 05 pe also differed significantly with nitrile rubber median values of the power law exponents for pe 2 5 and pp 2 7 are low compared to those for these other polymers i e rubber type 3 3 0 nitrile rubber 3 1 acrylates 3 2 polyamide 3 2 and polyethylene chlorinated 3 3 this implies that relatively many large pe and pp particles are present in the samples compared to the other polymers there are several mechanisms that could explain the observed differences in polymer specific size distributions different entry size of polymer particles polymer specific removal processes and fragmentation kinetics the density of pe and pp is lower than the density of most of the other polymers table s2 and lower than that of water at the same time water samples are most abundant in our dataset fig 5 table s1 it is possible that size selective settling of larger particles occurs for the non buoyant plastics i e acrylates polyamide rubber type 3 and nitrile rubber with preferential removal of larger particles from the water surface the power law exponent values will increase further differences in fragmentation kinetics i e resistance to fragmentation could also affect the size distributions of different polymer types fragmentation is driven by environmental factors including uv radiation wind waves and biodegradation and the rate of fragmentation depends on physical thermal and mechanical properties of the polymer min et al 2020 little is known about actual fragmentation rates but polymers have been ranked on their probability of surface erosion with that probability increasing with decreasing hydrophobicity polyethylene and polypropylene have a low probability of surface erosion whereas polyamide and acrylates are more likely to experience surface erosion min et al 2020 therefore all of these mechanisms provide plausible explanations for the observed polymer specific size distributions the groupwise comparison among polymers indicates polymer specific particle size characteristics aside from this groupwise comparison we also tested for rank correlations i e spearman s rank correlation test with these correlations the focus is on the pairwise comparison on the sample level in other words are there differences in particle size characteristics between different sample locations we found significant correlations p 0 05 for 9 polymer pairs with correlation coefficients varying between 0 7 and 0 9 table s5 fig s10 for these polymers it is clear that size distributions are location dependent that is some samples have relatively more small particles for the two correlated polymers compared to other samples it is possible that differences in sources environmental conditions that influence aggregation and biofouling and physical processes that influence settling and burial explain the differences between the different locations environmental compartments alone do not seem to explain the difference in exponent values for different samples fig s10 some polymers that did not differ significantly in the group wise comparison do show a significant correlation with comparison on the polymer level a large spread in exponent values will likely cause the polymer to not differ significantly from other polymers on the other hand such a large spread can still result in significant correlations as long as the values are paired per sample location 3 5 general applicability of exponent values the compartments that we studied were heterogeneous for instance rivers in itself already represent a wide range of turbulence conditions furthermore the studied compartments contained subsets from different systems e g sediment from rhine and dommel surface water from meuse dommel and ditches adjacent to the dommel implying that different sediment morphologies and hydrodynamics are included nevertheless our data shows that the exponent values calibrated per compartment have low relative standard deviation table s4 we argue that the exponent values although operationally defined can be used in a generic way for similar compartments however we emphasize that it would still be best if scientists studying other environmental systems or areas use the workflow presented here to obtain system specific pdfs and exponent values exponent values calibrated for a specific compartment and set of conditions will always be most accurate only if such data are not available the exponent values provided here could be considered as best available proxies for other systems the values must then be used taking into account the uncertainty for example by probabilistic modeling using a range of exponent values we recommend this would anyway always be done when using the average value of 2 68 for aquatic microplastic another aspect related to applicability is the extent to which power law distributions and exponent values could make sense beyond the upper and lower bounds a recent study parameterized a theoretical particle length distributions for ocean surface waters based on a cascading fragmentation model and taking into account different size selective particle transport processes kaandorp et al 2021 although model assumptions differed from some of the environmental conditions in the present dataset they report a power law exponent value of 2 67 based on fractal fragmentation alone which is similar to the average exponent value of 2 68 that we found for aquatic microplastic i e when combining freshwater and marine surface waters and sediments the minimum size for which their power law regime was valid was in the order of several millimeters whereas in our study minimum sizes ranged from 50 to 350 µm this agreement may suggest a wider applicability above our present upper size limit in contrast at the lower end of the size range a study of nano fragmentation of expanded polystyrene in a closed and mixed system showed that particle size distributions followed a power law shape distribution from 5000 down to 0 1 µm mattsson et al 2021 the lower than expected abundance of the smallest particles based on the power law prediction fig 4 can be explained by size selective processes such as wind mixing aggregation settling and beaching kaandorp et al 2021 kooi et al 2018 however since we do not find a higher abundance of these smallest particles in sediments only aggregation and consequent settling would not explain this deviation from the power law regime another potential explanation relates to detection accuracy mattsson et al could detect particles down to 10 nm by combining three different instrumental analytical techniques each targeting a part of the total size range mattsson et al 2021 whereas in our study detection limits were 11 or 20 µm depending on the µftir instrument used in the theoretical fragmentation study data used for calibration reported values down to 100 µm kaandorp et al 2021 so it seems that with a lower size detection limit the minimum size for which the power law regime is valid is also lower an upper size limit for the power law regime is not clearly defined the five studies used here aimed at quantifying small particles and consequently could not always take very large sample volumes studies that focused on larger particles e g 300 or 500 µm using trawls found power law regimes to extend to larger particle sizes too cózar et al 2014 kaandorp et al 2021 similar to the minimum size the maximum size for which the power law regime is valid might mainly be a result of sampling design we therefore argue that the presented power law exponents are likely to be valid from 1 to 5000 µm that is the whole microplastic size range although further research to validate this is recommended especially for the low end of the size range it is possible that distributions beyond those limits still follow the same regime but since there is little data on this it is difficult to verify at this moment the here presented observations support published approaches that use power law extrapolations to rescale number concentration data obtained with methods that target only part of the microplastic size range to the full 1 to 5000 µm size range everaert et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 mohamed nor et al 2021 3 6 linking probability density functions to ecologically relevant dose metrics for risk assessment we have discussed the main features of the probability density functions pdfs of different microplastic properties for different compartments and polymers all of these properties can inform risk characterization based on specific interactions with organisms that would require data specific to these distributions here we discuss how these diverse interactions their dose metrics i e ecologically relevant metrics erm and associated diverse microplastic characteristics can be unified to refine prospective risk assessment the distribution of particle length and width figs 2a 2b 4 and s5 is relevant for quantifying bioavailability bioavailability can relate to size limits for tissue uptake or translocation mohamed nor et al 2021 or when for instance the mouth opening has to be larger than the width of the particle for ingestion to occur jâms et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 the average power law slopes for aquatic microplastic length and width table s4 are much higher than the previously reported value of 1 6 kooi and koelmans 2019 which implies that the relative abundance of microplastics that is bioavailable to organisms is higher too the shape of the particle fig 2c here expressed via the width to length ratio is important for shape specific toxicity long thin fibers for instance are considered more toxic au et al 2015 de ruijter et al 2020 gray and weinstein 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 we have shown that fibers make up a significant part of the particles in our data set so it is important to focus not only on the number of particles but also on the shape particle surface area is toxicologically relevant because it is the surface which makes contact with the biological system whereas the plastic itself is considered to have little toxicity surface area is considered to be the dose metric relevant for oxidative stress schmid and stoeger 2016 furthermore particle area is relevant for hazardous substances that bind to the surface e g toxic trace metals and pathogens fubini 1997 schmid and stoeger 2016 schwarze et al 2007 overall particle surface area thus can be considered a very significant toxicologically relevant characteristic of small microplastic particles riediker et al 2019 which emphasizes the importance of the environmentally relevant area distributions that now are available figs 2d s6 volume distributions figs 2e s7 would be required if one wants to quantify effects that depend on total volume ingested such as the food dilution effect mechanism de ruijter et al 2020 rauchschwalbe et al 2021 which can be used to correct species sensitivity distributions or other frameworks that target this effect mechanism koelmans et al 2020 similarly particle weight figs 2f s8 is relevant for effect mechanisms where the stressor needs to be expressed on a mass basis like for organic chemical exposure for which plastic associated chemical concentrations are mass based bakir et al 2016 velzeboer et al 2014 mass distributions are also required for realistic number to mass conversions that remain true to the material as it occurs in nature de ruijter et al 2020 koelmans et al 2020 some effect mechanisms for particle toxicity correlate best with specific surface area i e area per mass m2 g 1 figs 2g s9 for instance in vitro cytotoxicity guthrie jr 1997 michel et al 2014 and inflammation stoeger et al 2006 tran et al 2000 are found to be related to the ssa of particles also the ssa can be a measure for chemical adsorption to microplastics godoy et al 2019 polymer type fig 3 influences transport and fate characteristics of the particles and therefore the bioavailability and accessibility for species living in different habitats besides bioavailability biological and chemical interactions can also be polymer specific endo and koelmans 2016 frère et al 2018 godoy et al 2019 velzeboer et al 2014 3 7 alignment of exposure and thresholds effect concentrations for different dose metrics for a consistent characterization of microplastic risk the dose metric used for the exposure assessment needs to be the same as the metric used for the effect assessment koelmans et al 2017 because there are different exposure and dose metrics we describe here a method to align and convert them the example is based on number concentrations however we provide equations to convert these into concentrations for other metrics as well a numerical example for all calculations in this workflow is provided as supporting information section s3 3 7 1 rescaling exposure data previously we have provided a method to rescale environmental microplastic number concentrations measured with methods that target different size ranges to the complete default microplastic size range i e 1 5000 μm or any other desired size range koelmans et al 2020 given an upper limit ul and lower limit ll of the measured and default size range a dimensionless correction factor c f meas is defined that rescales the measured m number concentration for a certain size range to the number concentration for the microplastic default d size range e g 1 to 5000 μm based on the power law distribution for length l with slope α l table s4 koelmans et al 2020 1 c f m e a s l u l d 1 α l l l d 1 α l u l m 1 α l l l m 1 α the measured exposure number concentration c m e a s l is multiplied with c f m e a s to obtain a rescaled exposure number concentration c e n v c f m e a s c m e a s that represents the complete environmentally relevant range for best accuracy a value for α l is preferably used that is calibrated for the particular environmental compartment such as that in table s4 the rationale for using compartment level exponent values i e table s4 is the ecological relevance for aquatic communities for which the habitat would be defined on a compartment level rather than a sample level mean values such as those for aquatic microplastics of 2 68 are better avoided unless the uncertainty around the mean is justified probabilistically 3 7 2 rescaling effect data the rescaled exposure concentrations as calculated using eq 1 represent the default microplastic size range and should be compared to threshold effect concentrations ec for a particular effect mechanism and thus erm which are expressed for the same default size range this requires two corrections the first correction is needed because only a part of the default microplastic size range is bioavailable to exert effects for instance ingestion of the particles often is considered to be a prerequisite for particle effects de ruijter et al 2020 in which case thus a correction for bioavailability via ingestion is required tissue uptake or translocation also are size restricted e g mohamed nor et al 2021 which thus also would require a size related bioavailability correction the required equation for these corrections is as follows the threshold effect concentration for the bioavailable size fraction of particles e c poly l can be related to the threshold effect concentration for the environmentally relevant 1 to 5000 μm range of particles e c env l by using a slight modification of the c f m e a s in eq 1 c f b i o 2 e c e n v e c p o l y c f b i o the only difference between c f m e a s and c f b i o is the use of ul b and ll b in the denominator for c f b i o representing the upper and lower size limit of the bioavailable size fraction respectively the second correction is required because reported effect concentrations almost always relate to monodisperse microplastic particles whereas in nature microplastic particles are polydisperse this second correction is specific for the erm under consideration because polydispersity is defined by the power law slope for that erm table s4 for a given effect threshold for erm x where x for instance is number mass volume area or specific surface area it does not matter if this threshold relates to mono or polydisperse particles as long as the magnitude of the threshold remains the same koelmans et al 2020 for instance if the erm is particle volume one would calculate total volume of the monodisperse particles at the threshold effect number concentration reported in literature and then calculate which number concentration of polydisperse particles has the same volume while using the power law slope for volume koelmans et al 2020 as this can be done for any erm x we here introduce a generic equation which preserves the erm of interest between mono and polydisperse particles at a certain erm threshold effect level 3 e c p o l y μ x p o l y e c m o n o μ x m o n o here e c m o n o l is the effect number concentration for monodisperse particles and μ x m o n o is the mean value for erm x for these monodisperse particles e g from literature test data if the erm is number μ x m o n o is 1 note that eq 3 can also be used to convert ec values for distributions with different degrees of polydispersity if the probability distribution of erm x follows a power law regime the mean erm value for the polydisperse particles μ x p o l y can be calculated as 4 μ x p o l y 1 α x 2 α x x u l 2 α x x l l 2 α x x u l 1 α x x l l 1 α x ul and ll relate to the upper and lower limit in erm x for which the mean is calculated and α x is the power law exponent value of erm x note this equation does not apply when α x is exactly 1 or 2 see section s2 for a derivation including versions for all α x values and table s4 for different exponent values calculation of the limits ul and ll differs for different dose metrics for length and width the limits are determined by the aforementioned bioavailability limits for length given the default microplastic size range ll and ul are equal to 1 and 5000 μm respectively if bioavailability relates to ingestion the limits for width would range between 1 μm ll and the mouth opening of the organism ul for surface area and volume ul and ll can be calculated using the appropriate ellipsoid equations see section 2 3 for which then the same minimum and maximum bioavailable values for length and width are used while for height a value of 0 67 width is used for mass the limits can be calculated by multiplying bioavailable ellipsoid volume with the average density table s3 for specific surface area the surface area is divided by the mass by combining eqs 2 to 4 the threshold effect concentration for the erm of choice e c e n v can be calculated now that the threshold effect concentration e c e n v and the exposure concentration c e n v are aligned and scaled to the full 1 to 5000 μm microplastic size range a consistent risk characterization can be done numerical example see section s3 note that the characterization is based on number concentrations which may seem counterintuitive if the actual erm would relate to e g volume mass or area however we can easily convert exposure and effect number concentrations into for instance equivalent volume mass or area concentrations μm3 l μg l μm2 l by multiplying them with the mean value of their respective power law distributions eq 4 which yields 5 c e n v e r m x μ x p o l y c e n v and e c e n v e r m x μ x p o l y e c e n v in this case the limits ll and ul in μ x p o l y eq 4 would relate to the values of the erm at the 1 and 5000 μm size limits respectively rather than to bioavailability limits in the risk characterization c e n v e r m x e c e n v e r m x however μ x p o l y cancels out eq 5 also defines the conversion of number to mass concentration or vice versa finally the above procedure applies to one erm at a time however microplastic particles are likely to cause multiple effects simultaneously once their respective threshold effect concentrations are exceeded this means that the approach offered here can be used to rank the impact thresholds for the different dose metrics of interest with the most sensitive one determining the ultimate risk 4 conclusions continuous power law distributions for microplastic particle characteristics length width area volume mass and specific surface area have been parameterized taking new quality criteria for accuracy loss due to subsampling into account we show how each of these particle characteristics links to a dose metric relevant for microplastic effect mechanisms we found that distributions of these characteristics differed for marine and freshwater surface waters and sediments waste water effluents and benthic freshwater biota we demonstrated that distributions for particle size were polymer specific with the presented distributions and scaling laws exposure data from environmental concentrations as well as effect concentrations obtained in experiments using monodisperse particles can be aligned and rescaled to obtain consistent risk characterizations that fully represent the multidimensionality of microplastic 5 contributors mk sp and aak designed the study data was collected and re analyzed by sp smm cl

case dark fermentative hydrogen production has drawn increasingly attentions due to its dual benefits of low operating cost low energy demand and simple operation conditions wong et al 2014 yang and wang 2018a moreover a versatile range of organic wastes such as wastewater sewage sludge food waste agricultural waste could be used as substrates for hydrogen production during dark fermentation among them biological hydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass is considered as the most promising mode kumari and das 2016 zhao et al 2017a which could simultaneously achieve the production of renewable hydrogen and the utilization of abundant organic waste despite the advantages mentioned above hydrogen production by dark fermentation is usually limited by the low yield to solve this many strategies have been developed and applied in dark fermentation to improve hydrogen production and yield yang and wang 2018b recently biochar was found to be an efficient additive in improving the performance of ad and have attracted more and more research interests bc is produced by thermal decomposition or pyrolysis of carbonaceous biomass such as agricultural residues and sewage sludge in a temperature range of 300 900 c lee et al 2017 with favorable properties such as high aromaticity a large surface area and diverse surface functional groups on surface sathishkumar et al 2020 the biomass immobilization function of bc by its excellent porosity with large surface area has been proven in many studies li et al 2020b kyriakou et al 2019 also trace minerals contained in biochar could serve as inexpensive nutrients to replace expensive additives sun et al 2020 bc could also functioned as ph buffer to mitigate the decrease of ph and acid inhibition sunyoto et al 2016 besides biochar could improve electron transfer efficiency between exoelectrogenic microorganisms through two completely different pathways 1 biochar prepared at high temperature acts as an electrical conductor and could directly transfer electron through conjugated π bond wang et al 2021 2 the biochar prepared at low temperature acts like a battery using surface quinone hydroquinone groups for reversible cycles for charging and discharging kluepfel et al 2014 sun et al 2017 although the benefits of bc on ad have been extensively confirmed the influence of biochar on the process of hydrolysis acidification during ad has been ignored and the potential mechanisms has not been explored the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps during ad has been widely studied eps is mainly composed of proteins and polysaccharides cheng et al 2020b yu et al 2008 the composition and spatial distribution of eps are vital to the metabolism of microorganisms and performance of ad yu et al 2008 nevertheless the effects of bc on the composition and function during dark fermentation has been rarely studied especially in lignocellulosic system furthermore the correlation between the electrochemical property of eps and the enhancement of dark fermentative hydrogen production by bc addition is unproven extracellular oxidation reduction potential orp of the fermentation system is an important parameter in controlling microbial metabolism by affecting the intracellular orp through the oxidized reduced nad nadh nad balance which could subsequently control gene expression enzyme synthesis and modify the whole metabolic pathways liu et al 2013 moscoviz et al 2016 to the best of the authors knowledge few studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of bc on the process of hydrolysis acidification during ad with lignocellulosics as substrate and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms therefore this study aims to 1 examine the effects of bcs with different physicochemical properties on mesophilic dark fermentative performance with pscb as substrate 2 systematically explore the effects of bc supplementation on multiple indicators including the contributions on changes of cell biomass extracellular orp cellulase hydrogenase activity nad nadh the characters of eps the electrochemical property of fermentation system 3 propose hypothesis to explain the mechanisms of enhanced fermentative performance by bc amendment 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic sludge and inoculum sewage sludge ss was taken from anaerobic pond bottom of lijiao sewage treatment plant guangzhou guangdong province china the ss was acclimated with hydrogen producing effluent and lignocellulosic residue in a long run before using the ss was withdrawn into serum bottle and mixed well with sterilized saline 1 1 v v after purging with nitrogen the bottle was heated at 90 c for 15 min to restrain methanogenic activities the bacterial suspension with cell number of 6 6 107 cells ml od600 0 89 0 01 after standing was withdrawn as seed inoculum 2 2 biochar preparation biochar was produced from fallen leaves through a pyrolysis process the fallen leaves were collected in scut at spring after drying crushing into powder and sieving the leaves were placed into alumina crucible and then put into muffle furnace with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 different bcs bc300 bc450 and bc600 were prepared at different holding temperatures 300 450 and 600 c respectively for 2 hours all the prepared bcs were sieved with a particle size of 150 μm before using 2 3 effect of bcs on dark hydrogen fermentative performance pscb was prepared as previously described bu et al 2019 the fermentation medium l 1 was prepared with 10 g pscb 0 5 g yeast extract 3 93 g k2hpo4 3h2o 1 5 g kh2po4 1 g mgcl2 6h2o 1 3 g nh4 2so4 0 1 g cacl2 2h2o 0 5 g l cysteine ph 7 0 0 3 fermentation was carried out in 120 ml serum bottles with 50 ml working volume 0 g l or 10 g l bc was added to the bottles before purging nitrogen and sterilization the hydrogen fermentation was initiated by inoculating with ss suspension 10 v v and incubating in the shaking incubator 37 c 150 rpm 2 4 measurements of cellulase hydrogenase activities and nad nadh samples of hydrogen fermentation at 60 h were collected to measure cellulase hydrogenase activity and nad nadh the cellulase activity was quantified by per milligram of reducing sugar released from avicel ph 105 catalyzed by cellulase from per gram of cell protein per hour and the hydrogenase activity was quantified by the amount of hydrogen evolved from na dithionite reduced methyl viologen and the detail procedures could be found in supplementary materials the concentrations of nad and nadh were measured using the nad nadh assay kit shanghai beyotime biotech co ltd china 2 5 electrochemical analysis cyclic voltammetry cv experiment was used to evaluate the electron transfer efficiency kapp of fermentation system the cv experiment was conducted in a single chamber cell equipped with a glassy carbon electrode as a working electrode a platinum wire as a counter electrode and ag agcl as a reference electrode the cv was measured using an electrochemical workstation chi660e china the headspace of the cell was purged with n2 for 3 min the scanning voltage of the working electrode was in the range of 1 5 1 2 v with scan rates of 20 200 mv s the electron transfer coefficient kapp was determined by the laviron equation to evaluate the electron transfer efficiency of fermentation system cheng et al 2020a differential pulse voltammetry dpv test was also conducted with three electrodes system to study the effect of biochar amendment on extracellular electroactive secreta and the test conditions of dpv were as follows scan range of potential 0 7 0 v amplitude 50 mv pulse width 0 3 s potential increment 10 mv quiet time 2 s 2 6 microbial community analysis high throughput sequencing was conducted to study the abundance and spatial distribution of bacteria in control and bc treated group at 84 h the microorganisms in bc600 treated group were divided into three fractions according to their binding affinity with bc termed suspended sus loosely attached loo and tightly absorbed tig fractions the samples of different fractions were prepared as previously described luo et al 2015 to avoid the effect of pscb in bc600 treated group when preparing bacterial samples 6 g l pscb was used as carbon source due to it could be completely degraded after fermentation by bc600 amendment microbial genomic dna were extracted by the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa according to the manufacturer protocol dna quantity and specificity were determined by nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and agarose gel electrophoresis respectively the v3 v4 hypervariable region of 16s rrna gene was amplified using 341f 806r primers from the genome dna to analyze the bacterial community as described in our previous study an et al 2018 2 7 analysis method metabolic products in liquid phase and hydrogen were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 1525 waters la us and a gas chromatograph fuli 9790 plus fuli china respectively as previously described an et al 2020 for h2 measurement the produced h2 and co2 accumulated in the headspace of the sealed serum bottle was withdrawn with a 25 ml injector by pressure difference and quickly injected into the injection port of chromatograph the mixed gas was brought into capillary column tdx 01 100 c by carrier gas nitrogen and then separated based on the adsorption desorption between carrier gas and capillary column the separated h2 entered the detector tcd 80 c and was converted into electrical signal to be recorded and generated chromatograms the h2 production was then calculated based on the peak area of the chromatogram electrical conductivity ec was measured by handheld multi parameter instrument pocket pro usa as previously described wu et al 2019b surface areas of bcs were analyzed by a surface area analyzer quadrasorb 2mp usa ft ir spectrophotometer thermo nicolet corporation usa was used to analyze the functional group on the surface of biochar within the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 with 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 micromorphology of different microorganisms absorbed on bc was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope zeiss ultra 60 germany elements of c n h o and s of bcs were measured by an elemental analyzer vario elcube germany eps were extracted as described in supplementary materials cheng et al 2020b the polysaccharide in eps was analyzed by the anthrone sulfuric acid with glucose as a standard solution yu et al 2008 and protein was determined with a bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit shanghai sangon biotech co ltd china excitation emission matrix eem analysis of eps was conducted by fluorescence spectrometer hitachi fl4500 japan wang et al 2019 hydrogen yield was fitted to the modified gompertz equation lay et al 1999 using origin 8 software in order to acquire the kinetic parameters for h2 production 2 h p m exp exp r m e p m λ t 1 where h is the cumulative hydrogen yield ml l pm is the maximum hydrogen yield potential ml l rm is the hydrogen production peak rate ml l h λ is the hydrogen production lag time h t is the fermentation time h and the value of e is 2 718 the data were analyzed statistically by student s t test using the software spss 17 0 spss inc chicago and a value of p 0 05 was considered statistically significant each experimental treatment was carried out in triplicate and the results are presented as averages standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochar characteristics bcs with different physicochemical properties were prepared under different temperatures according to the elemental analysis in table 1 total n h and o contents decreased while total c contents increased with the pyrolysis temperature increased bc600 had the lowest h c 0 56 and o c 0 03 molar ratios suggesting a high degree of aromatic condensation and the loss of h and o containing functional groups containing the conductivities and surface areas of bcs increased drastically as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 c to 600 c which was mainly due to higher degree of graphitization and carbonization 31 ftir spectra fig 1 identified the differences of peak intensity corresponded to a variety of surface functional groups on bcs the peak at 1600 cm 1 represented c o and c c bonds stretching of ketones and quinones group the peaks at 1060 1110 and 1176 cm 1 corresponded to c o deformation or c o c stretching vibrations in carbohydrates li et al 2020a shen et al 2020 and the peak at 1375 cm 1 represented o h bending in plane bending of phenolic oh related to ligneous syringyl units keiluweit et al 2010 the intensities of all these peaks decreased at higher temperatures indicating reduced thermolabile groups and potential cyclisation of aromatic compounds sui et al 2021 the same decreasing trend was observed for the vibration of phosphoric acid p o groups at 780 cm 1 sui et al 2021 methyl groups in the bands at 2923 cm 1 and 2851 cm 1 could be easily broken 400 c and the cleavage of these groups was responsible for the majority of mass loss during pyrolysis sui et al 2021 3 2 hydrogen fermentative performance bcs were supplemented in fermentation system separately to investigate their effects on hydrogen fermentation fig 2 a compared to the control group bc600 and bc450 improved final hydrogen production from 28 6 mm to 119 3 mm and 44 7 mm with an increase of 317 1 and 56 3 respectively according to table 2 the maximum rate and potential production of hydrogen fermentation were boosted 17 9 vs 120 9 ml l h and 689 9 vs 2723 8 ml l and the lag phase was also shortened in the presence of bc600 the prolonged lag phase by bc450 addition may be attributed to the release of organic binding metals from bc450 during hydrolysis since metals could be bonded to organic matter and the resulting organic binding metals could restrain the hydrolysis of organic matter by enhancing the stability and apparent activation energy of organic matter xu et al 2017 although ph buffering capacity of bc during dark fermentation process has been widely reported zhao et al 2017b bcs used in this study could not alleviate ph drop efficiently with the proceeding of fermentation fig 2b the ph buffering capacity of biochar can be attributed to the generation of carbonate on the surface during pyrolysis process and the content of carbonate could increase with increased pyrolysis temperature yuan et al 2011 with the consideration of the rare report on using leaves based biochar in dark fermentative system the poor buffering capacity of biochar observed in this work may be attributed to the particularity of raw material and low content of carbonate formed after pyrolysis at 108 h the soluble metabolite products smps in hydrogenogenic effluent mainly included acetate formate propionate butyrate and ethanol among them acetate was the most abundant smp in all test groups the acetate concentrations in the hydrogenogenic effluent treated with bc450 and bc600 were 1 45 and 2 75 higher than that of the control group fig 2c the enhanced acetate production leaded to significant higher hydrogen production due to the highest theoretical yield of hydrogen production by acetate pathway it should be noted that ethanol production was simultaneously boosted and the proportion of finally ethanol concentration was increased from 5 8 of control to 39 0 and 42 6 in the presence of bc450 and bc600 fig 2d respectively indicating ethanol type fermentation prevailed in the two groups li et al has reported that hydrogen production can be effectively improved by 118 4 using ethanoligenens harbinense yuan 3 from glucose with an simultaneous enhancement of ethanol and acetate production by 2 2 and 3 5 times than that of control by bc addition li et al 2020b it could be speculated that bc450 and bc600 stimulated the activity of particular microbes and enhanced the conversion of pscb leading to higher hydrogen production and yield 3 3 effect of bc addition on extracellular orp and nad nadh concentration the fluctuation of extracellular orp was observed to evaluate the effect of bcs on the overall oxidizing or reducing capacity of fermentation system as shown in fig 3 a the extracellular orp values dropped rapidly at initial 36 h indicating vast amounts of electrons were released into system during the process of glucose glycolysis and cell proliferation li et al 2020b wu et al 2019a compared with control group fermentation with bc600 presents lower extracellular orp and faster decrease during this phase suggesting the addition of bc600 may boosted the consumption rate of substrate li et al 2020b during 36 60 h the extracellular orp values in fermentations without bc kept at constant level while bc600 amend group was still decreasing after 72 h orp values of two groups started to increase indicating faster cell death and decelerating substrate utilization zhu et al 2020 these results demonstrated the redox activity of bc600 which was in line with previous study li et al 2020b wu et al 2019a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad and its reduced form nadh are essential cofactors for the metabolism of microorganisms which are also hypothesized to be the intracellular electron pool for extracellular electron transfer feng et al 2018a previous efforts suggested that nadh regeneration could be enhanced by means of metabolic engineering methods thereby manipulating the nadh nad ratio and increasing the release of intracellular electrons and power generation han et al 2016 in this study the nadh nad ratio was found to be promoted by bc600 amendment fig 3b which could be an important factor for improving hydrogen production since nadh dependent hydrogen production pathway is one of the fundamental hydrogen production approach zhang et al 2009 3 4 effects of bc600 on cellulase hydrogenase activities and cell biomass hydrolysis of substrate is considered as the rate limiting step during dark fermentation the cellulase activities at mid log phase was significantly promoted by bc600 amendment with an increase of 124 7 relative to the control group table 3 lü et al also reported that the activities of α glucosidase and protease were improved by bc amendment during ad lu et al 2020 moreover the hydrogenase activities were significantly promoted from 86 4 ml g cell protein h of the control to 136 6 ml g cell protein h of the bc600 treated group with an increase of 58 1 table 3 previous study indicated that the bioavailability of trace elements including fe and ni was enhanced by bc amendment during ad qi et al 2021 consequently fefe hydrogenases and nife hydrogenases in clostridia could be stimulated by the enhanced bioavailability of trace elements which consequently facilitates the production of hydrogen qi et al 2021 bc was successfully applied in fermentation as cell immobilization materials to provide some unique advantages compared with the suspended biomass system such as better process stability and higher biological activity yang and wang 2018b as shown in table 3 the concentration of cell protein was significantly promoted by an increase of 50 4 in bc600 treated fermentation system it was speculated that the functional bacteria with the capacity of high efficient hydrogen production from pscb could be immobilized on the surface of bc600 which may favor their interaction in the form of a mixed biofilm whose microbial community is different from the planktonic community 3 5 characteristic analysis of eps eps is a main constitute of biofilms and its total organic matter was reported to be 50 90 of biofilms wang et al 2019 which plays an important role in biochemical process during ad polysaccharide and protein in eps were measured to investigate whether the effect of bc600 on the property of eps the concentrations of polysaccharide and protein were 37 2 mg l and 94 2 mg l with bc600 addition which were significantly higher than control group fig 4 eps could absorb cu2 and fe3 ions through uronic acids and protein by complexation to improve and maintain the efficiency of intracellular enzymatic reaction yu et al 2013 the higher conductivity of eps by bc600 amendment could be attributed to the higher content of electrochemically active substances which may improve the electrochemical characteristic of methanogenic aggregates cheng et al 2020b eem analysis was conducted to further studying the difference of eps compositions five organics were identified by eem spectra at different regions on the basis of different excitation emission ex em wavelengths during ad for methane production cheng et al 2020b wang et al 2019 biodegradable organics like carbohydrates and proteins in the region of 300 400 250 350 nm excitation emission wavelengths could only be identified as shown in fig 5 li et al 2020c the fluorescence intensity of this region was stronger in the bc600 treated sample which further confirmed the excretion of protein and carbohydrates in eps could be enhanced by bc600 addition wang et al 2019 3 6 electrochemical analysis the electron transfer capacity in fermentation system was analyzed by electrochemical methods two distinct redox peaks with potentials of around 0 8 and 0 3 v were observed by cv analysis fig 6 a and b previous studies indicated that the potentials and shapes of redox peaks could be associated with electrochemically active eps and electroactive microorganisms and the peak currents are probably related to their abundance feng et al 2018b yuan et al 2011 the peak currents increased linearly with an increase in scan rates suggesting that these redox reactions were typical kinetically controlled processes yin et al 2018 therefore the value of electron transfer efficiency kapp was further determined according to the laviron equation cheng et al 2020a the value of kapp calculated from two redox peaks present in control and bc600 treated group were 1 7 10 3 and 5 1 10 3 s 1 respectively the result suggested that a faster eet rate could be triggered by conductive materials amendment which was beneficial for improving the electron transfer efficiency between electroactive microorganisms cheng et al 2020b jiang et al 2020 the extracellular electroactive mediators were further investigated by differential pulse voltammetry dpv on the basis of cv redox active compounds such as quinone cytochrome c c cyt flavin pyocyanin were reported as electron shuttles secreted by electroactive bacteria to complete the formation of biofilm extracellular electron transfer eet and interspecies interaction jia et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 dpv was used as an additional electrochemical technique with higher degree of sensitivity selectivity to study electroactive shuttles as previously reported pous et al 2016 yang et al 2017 as shown in this result by fig 6 c the characteristic peaks at 0 45 v and 0 150 v were detected in control and bc600 amend system which illustrated the existence of electroactive shuttles and could be attributed to flavin and cytochrome c respectively jia et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 c type cytochromes involved in the transmembrane electron transfer and flavin involved as free mediator in the eet process have been confirmed and their co existence could indicate the formation of electron transfer pathway between electroactive bacteria in our fermentation systems moreover it was observed that the peak currents flavin c cyt decreased from 0 274 μa 0 236 μa for control group to 0 236 μa 0 204 μa for bc600 amend group respectively this result indicated that eet between electroactive bacteria was prevailing in our systems due to the detected flavin c cyt and biochar amendment could potentially reduce the content of extracellular electroactive secreta even so the electron transfer efficiency of fermentation system was still enhanced by bc600 amendment as confirmed by cv test it has been demonstrated than eet could be occurred directly by conductive carbon based materials between electroactive microorganisms rather than electrically conductive flavin c type cytochrome involved in biological interspecies electrical connections liu et al 2012 wu et al 2020 the replacement of conductive secreta by biochar could possibly reduce the consumption of energy matter for electron transfer which may be an important reason in improving hydrogen production 3 7 effects of bc on bacterial community structure the influence of bc600 on the abundance and spatial distribution of bacteria was studied principal component analysis pca is a multivariate projection method which has been used in microbial ecology for refinement of microbiome data and comparison of complex communities by pca plot the relationship between inter otu variance could be presented by coordinate distance gloor et al 2017 jolliffe and cadima 2016 as shown in fig 7 a four samples control group and three cell fractions in bc600 treated group were evaluated by the pca plot which clearly illustrated the difference of bacterial community structures due to the observed distribution of four samples the dominant families in control group were lachnospiraceae hungateiclostridiaceae clostridiaceae fig 7b the addition of bc600 significantly improved the abundance of lachnospiraceae from 37 8 in control group to 84 6 62 5 and 72 7 in suspended loosely bound and tightly bound fraction respectively the main metabolites of lachnospiraceae include ethanol acetate and hydrogen which could explain the substantial increase of corresponding metabolites by bc600 amendment palomo briones et al 2017 in contrast the total relative abundances of hungateiclostridiaceae and clostridiaceae significantly decreased from 38 3 in the control to 2 2 7 0 and 7 4 in suspended loosely bound and tightly bound fraction respectively clostridiaceae and lachnospiraceae are involved in lignocellulose degrading with diverse glycoside hydrolases and endoglucanases suksong et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 it has been reported that lachnospiraceae possesses stronger hydrolysis efficiency than clostridiaceae during dark fermentation of pscb suksong et al 2019 which could be an important factor to explain the higher pscb degradation rate in the lachnospiraceae rich system by bc600 amendment in our study it is worth noting that the relative abundance of pseudomonadaceae increased significantly from 0 37 of the control and 0 70 of the suspended fraction in the bc600 treated group to 20 1 and 9 42 respectively in the loosely tightly bound fraction on bc600 indicating that pseudomonadaceae could be efficiently enriched and selectively colonized on bc600 pseudomonadaceae could use sugars and organic acids as carbon sources to produce hydrogen efficiently angel acosta et al 2020 babu et al 2013 hassan et al 2018 it has been reported that the relative abundance of pseudomonadaceae was positively correlated with the performance of hydrogen production yun and cho 2016 in addition as an electrochemical microorganism pseudomonadaceae could usually be enriched on the bioanode of mfc thus playing an important role in the electricity or hydrogen production of mfc babu et al 2013 dos passos et al 2019 pham et al 2008 compared with the control the abundance of clostridiaceae in the three cell fractions of bc600 treated group decreased significantly however similar with pseudomonadaceae clostridiaceae also obligately colonized on the bc600 surface clostridiaceae family appeared to be a determining factor affecting the electro fermentative performance in mixed culture toledo alarcón et al 2020 among the cell fractions in bc600 treated system peptostreptococcaceae almost only appeared in the cell fraction that tightly bound with bc600 although peptostreptococcaceae was reported not a hydrogen producing microorganism it can improve the performance of dark fermentation hung et al 2011 peptostreptococcaceae could interact with clostridiaceae to form aggregates with a network structure so that functional bacteria could effectively adsorbed on biochar hung et al 2011 moreover peptostreptococcaceae could accepts exogenous electron to reduce co2 for acetate production which plays a role as electron acceptor to complete the electro metabolic network li et al 2018 3 8 proposed mechanisms for enhanced hydrogen production with bc amendment the possible synergistic effects and eet pathways between predominate bacteria for improving mesophilic dark fermentative performance of pscb were proposed in fig 8 both the fermentable sugars produced from pscb by the cellulolytic enzyme and the organic acids generated from lachnospiraceae and clostridiaceae could be utilized by pseudomonadaceae to produce hydrogen the synergistic effect of pscb degradation hydrogen production between lachnospiraceae clostridiaceae and pseudomonadaceae was assumed to be the dominant factor to boost hydrogen production in terms of eet pseudomonadaceae clostridiaceae and peptostreptococcaceae may carry out electron transfer between each other through conductive bc600 higher electron transfer efficiency of fermentative system was achieved by bc600 amendment which may be important in accelerating eet between electrochemical bacteria the microcosmic ecological niche developed by bc600 amendment may favor the electron transfer and synergistic interaction between functional bacteria moscoviz et al 2016 considering that the electrical conductivity of biochar has a good correlation with the kinetic parameters of hydrogen production in this study fig s1 we speculate that conductivity of biochar plays a very important role during hydrolysis acidification by stimulating the syntrophic metabolism between electroactive microorganisms 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that mesophilic dark fermentative performance of biohydrogen production from pscb could be significantly improved by bc amendment cell biomass key enzyme activities nadh nad ratio and electron transfer efficiency of fermentation system were markedly improved by bc600 amendment additionally cellulolytic lachnospiraceae was efficiently enriched and electroactive bacteria such as pseudomonadaceae clostridiaceae and peptostreptococcaceae were selectively colonized on the surface of bc600 which could synergistically degrade pscb for hydrogen production and carry out syntrophic metabolism the possible mechanisms of enhancing hydrolysis acidogenesis and hydrogen production performance proposed in this study provide a new insight in understanding improved ad performance by bc

calorific value 142 kj g arizzi et al 2016 sivagurunathan et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 conventional hydrogen production processes are usually unsustainable and energy consuming hallenbeck 2009 in this case dark fermentative hydrogen production has drawn increasingly attentions due to its dual benefits of low operating cost low energy demand and simple operation conditions wong et al 2014 yang and wang 2018a moreover a versatile range of organic wastes such as wastewater sewage sludge food waste agricultural waste could be used as substrates for hydrogen production during dark fermentation among them biological hydrogen production from lignocellulosic biomass is considered as the most promising mode kumari and das 2016 zhao et al 2017a which could simultaneously achieve the production of renewable hydrogen and the utilization of abundant organic waste despite the advantages mentioned above hydrogen production by dark fermentation is usually limited by the low yield to solve this many strategies have been developed and applied in dark fermentation to improve hydrogen production and yield yang and wang 2018b recently biochar was found to be an efficient additive in improving the performance of ad and have attracted more and more research interests bc is produced by thermal decomposition or pyrolysis of carbonaceous biomass such as agricultural residues and sewage sludge in a temperature range of 300 900 c lee et al 2017 with favorable properties such as high aromaticity a large surface area and diverse surface functional groups on surface sathishkumar et al 2020 the biomass immobilization function of bc by its excellent porosity with large surface area has been proven in many studies li et al 2020b kyriakou et al 2019 also trace minerals contained in biochar could serve as inexpensive nutrients to replace expensive additives sun et al 2020 bc could also functioned as ph buffer to mitigate the decrease of ph and acid inhibition sunyoto et al 2016 besides biochar could improve electron transfer efficiency between exoelectrogenic microorganisms through two completely different pathways 1 biochar prepared at high temperature acts as an electrical conductor and could directly transfer electron through conjugated π bond wang et al 2021 2 the biochar prepared at low temperature acts like a battery using surface quinone hydroquinone groups for reversible cycles for charging and discharging kluepfel et al 2014 sun et al 2017 although the benefits of bc on ad have been extensively confirmed the influence of biochar on the process of hydrolysis acidification during ad has been ignored and the potential mechanisms has not been explored the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps during ad has been widely studied eps is mainly composed of proteins and polysaccharides cheng et al 2020b yu et al 2008 the composition and spatial distribution of eps are vital to the metabolism of microorganisms and performance of ad yu et al 2008 nevertheless the effects of bc on the composition and function during dark fermentation has been rarely studied especially in lignocellulosic system furthermore the correlation between the electrochemical property of eps and the enhancement of dark fermentative hydrogen production by bc addition is unproven extracellular oxidation reduction potential orp of the fermentation system is an important parameter in controlling microbial metabolism by affecting the intracellular orp through the oxidized reduced nad nadh nad balance which could subsequently control gene expression enzyme synthesis and modify the whole metabolic pathways liu et al 2013 moscoviz et al 2016 to the best of the authors knowledge few studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of bc on the process of hydrolysis acidification during ad with lignocellulosics as substrate and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms therefore this study aims to 1 examine the effects of bcs with different physicochemical properties on mesophilic dark fermentative performance with pscb as substrate 2 systematically explore the effects of bc supplementation on multiple indicators including the contributions on changes of cell biomass extracellular orp cellulase hydrogenase activity nad nadh the characters of eps the electrochemical property of fermentation system 3 propose hypothesis to explain the mechanisms of enhanced fermentative performance by bc amendment 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic sludge and inoculum sewage sludge ss was taken from anaerobic pond bottom of lijiao sewage treatment plant guangzhou guangdong province china the ss was acclimated with hydrogen producing effluent and lignocellulosic residue in a long run before using the ss was withdrawn into serum bottle and mixed well with sterilized saline 1 1 v v after purging with nitrogen the bottle was heated at 90 c for 15 min to restrain methanogenic activities the bacterial suspension with cell number of 6 6 107 cells ml od600 0 89 0 01 after standing was withdrawn as seed inoculum 2 2 biochar preparation biochar was produced from fallen leaves through a pyrolysis process the fallen leaves were collected in scut at spring after drying crushing into powder and sieving the leaves were placed into alumina crucible and then put into muffle furnace with a heating rate of 10 c min 1 different bcs bc300 bc450 and bc600 were prepared at different holding temperatures 300 450 and 600 c respectively for 2 hours all the prepared bcs were sieved with a particle size of 150 μm before using 2 3 effect of bcs on dark hydrogen fermentative performance pscb was prepared as previously described bu et al 2019 the fermentation medium l 1 was prepared with 10 g pscb 0 5 g yeast extract 3 93 g k2hpo4 3h2o 1 5 g kh2po4 1 g mgcl2 6h2o 1 3 g nh4 2so4 0 1 g cacl2 2h2o 0 5 g l cysteine ph 7 0 0 3 fermentation was carried out in 120 ml serum bottles with 50 ml working volume 0 g l or 10 g l bc was added to the bottles before purging nitrogen and sterilization the hydrogen fermentation was initiated by inoculating with ss suspension 10 v v and incubating in the shaking incubator 37 c 150 rpm 2 4 measurements of cellulase hydrogenase activities and nad nadh samples of hydrogen fermentation at 60 h were collected to measure cellulase hydrogenase activity and nad nadh the cellulase activity was quantified by per milligram of reducing sugar released from avicel ph 105 catalyzed by cellulase from per gram of cell protein per hour and the hydrogenase activity was quantified by the amount of hydrogen evolved from na dithionite reduced methyl viologen and the detail procedures could be found in supplementary materials the concentrations of nad and nadh were measured using the nad nadh assay kit shanghai beyotime biotech co ltd china 2 5 electrochemical analysis cyclic voltammetry cv experiment was used to evaluate the electron transfer efficiency kapp of fermentation system the cv experiment was conducted in a single chamber cell equipped with a glassy carbon electrode as a working electrode a platinum wire as a counter electrode and ag agcl as a reference electrode the cv was measured using an electrochemical workstation chi660e china the headspace of the cell was purged with n2 for 3 min the scanning voltage of the working electrode was in the range of 1 5 1 2 v with scan rates of 20 200 mv s the electron transfer coefficient kapp was determined by the laviron equation to evaluate the electron transfer efficiency of fermentation system cheng et al 2020a differential pulse voltammetry dpv test was also conducted with three electrodes system to study the effect of biochar amendment on extracellular electroactive secreta and the test conditions of dpv were as follows scan range of potential 0 7 0 v amplitude 50 mv pulse width 0 3 s potential increment 10 mv quiet time 2 s 2 6 microbial community analysis high throughput sequencing was conducted to study the abundance and spatial distribution of bacteria in control and bc treated group at 84 h the microorganisms in bc600 treated group were divided into three fractions according to their binding affinity with bc termed suspended sus loosely attached loo and tightly absorbed tig fractions the samples of different fractions were prepared as previously described luo et al 2015 to avoid the effect of pscb in bc600 treated group when preparing bacterial samples 6 g l pscb was used as carbon source due to it could be completely degraded after fermentation by bc600 amendment microbial genomic dna were extracted by the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa according to the manufacturer protocol dna quantity and specificity were determined by nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and agarose gel electrophoresis respectively the v3 v4 hypervariable region of 16s rrna gene was amplified using 341f 806r primers from the genome dna to analyze the bacterial community as described in our previous study an et al 2018 2 7 analysis method metabolic products in liquid phase and hydrogen were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 1525 waters la us and a gas chromatograph fuli 9790 plus fuli china respectively as previously described an et al 2020 for h2 measurement the produced h2 and co2 accumulated in the headspace of the sealed serum bottle was withdrawn with a 25 ml injector by pressure difference and quickly injected into the injection port of chromatograph the mixed gas was brought into capillary column tdx 01 100 c by carrier gas nitrogen and then separated based on the adsorption desorption between carrier gas and capillary column the separated h2 entered the detector tcd 80 c and was converted into electrical signal to be recorded and generated chromatograms the h2 production was then calculated based on the peak area of the chromatogram electrical conductivity ec was measured by handheld multi parameter instrument pocket pro usa as previously described wu et al 2019b surface areas of bcs were analyzed by a surface area analyzer quadrasorb 2mp usa ft ir spectrophotometer thermo nicolet corporation usa was used to analyze the functional group on the surface of biochar within the wavenumber range of 400 4000 cm 1 with 32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 micromorphology of different microorganisms absorbed on bc was observed by field emission scanning electron microscope zeiss ultra 60 germany elements of c n h o and s of bcs were measured by an elemental analyzer vario elcube germany eps were extracted as described in supplementary materials cheng et al 2020b the polysaccharide in eps was analyzed by the anthrone sulfuric acid with glucose as a standard solution yu et al 2008 and protein was determined with a bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit shanghai sangon biotech co ltd china excitation emission matrix eem analysis of eps was conducted by fluorescence spectrometer hitachi fl4500 japan wang et al 2019 hydrogen yield was fitted to the modified gompertz equation lay et al 1999 using origin 8 software in order to acquire the kinetic parameters for h2 production 2 h p m exp exp r m e p m λ t 1 where h is the cumulative hydrogen yield ml l pm is the maximum hydrogen yield potential ml l rm is the hydrogen production peak rate ml l h λ is the hydrogen production lag time h t is the fermentation time h and the value of e is 2 718 the data were analyzed statistically by student s t test using the software spss 17 0 spss inc chicago and a value of p 0 05 was considered statistically significant each experimental treatment was carried out in triplicate and the results are presented as averages standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 biochar characteristics bcs with different physicochemical properties were prepared under different temperatures according to the elemental analysis in table 1 total n h and o contents decreased while total c contents increased with the pyrolysis temperature increased bc600 had the lowest h c 0 56 and o c 0 03 molar ratios suggesting a high degree of aromatic condensation and the loss of h and o containing functional groups containing the conductivities and surface areas of bcs increased drastically as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 c to 600 c which was mainly due to higher degree of graphitization and carbonization 31 ftir spectra fig 1 identified the differences of peak intensity corresponded to a variety of surface functional groups on bcs the peak at 1600 cm 1 represented c o and c c bonds stretching of ketones and quinones group the peaks at 1060 1110 and 1176 cm 1 corresponded to c o deformation or c o c stretching vibrations in carbohydrates li et al 2020a shen et al 2020 and the peak at 1375 cm 1 represented o h bending in plane bending of phenolic oh related to ligneous syringyl units keiluweit et al 2010 the intensities of all these peaks decreased at higher temperatures indicating reduced thermolabile groups and potential cyclisation of aromatic compounds sui et al 2021 the same decreasing trend was observed for the vibration of phosphoric acid p o groups at 780 cm 1 sui et al 2021 methyl groups in the bands at 2923 cm 1 and 2851 cm 1 could be easily broken 400 c and the cleavage of these groups was responsible for the majority of mass loss during pyrolysis sui et al 2021 3 2 hydrogen fermentative performance bcs were supplemented in fermentation system separately to investigate their effects on hydrogen fermentation fig 2 a compared to the control group bc600 and bc450 improved final hydrogen production from 28 6 mm to 119 3 mm and 44 7 mm with an increase of 317 1 and 56 3 respectively according to table 2 the maximum rate and potential production of hydrogen fermentation were boosted 17 9 vs 120 9 ml l h and 689 9 vs 2723 8 ml l and the lag phase was also shortened in the presence of bc600 the prolonged lag phase by bc450 addition may be attributed to the release of organic binding metals from bc450 during hydrolysis since metals could be bonded to organic matter and the resulting organic binding metals could restrain the hydrolysis of organic matter by enhancing the stability and apparent activation energy of organic matter xu et al 2017 although ph buffering capacity of bc during dark fermentation process has been widely reported zhao et al 2017b bcs used in this study could not alleviate ph drop efficiently with the proceeding of fermentation fig 2b the ph buffering capacity of biochar can be attributed to the generation of carbonate on the surface during pyrolysis process and the content of carbonate could increase with increased pyrolysis temperature yuan et al 2011 with the consideration of the rare report on using leaves based biochar in dark fermentative system the poor buffering capacity of biochar observed in this work may be attributed to the particularity of raw material and low content of carbonate formed after pyrolysis at 108 h the soluble metabolite products smps in hydrogenogenic effluent mainly included acetate formate propionate butyrate and ethanol among them acetate was the most abundant smp in all test groups the acetate concentrations in the hydrogenogenic effluent treated with bc450 and bc600 were 1 45 and 2 75 higher than that of the control group fig 2c the enhanced acetate production leaded to significant higher hydrogen production due to the highest theoretical yield of hydrogen production by acetate pathway it should be noted that ethanol production was simultaneously boosted and the proportion of finally ethanol concentration was increased from 5 8 of control to 39 0 and 42 6 in the presence of bc450 and bc600 fig 2d respectively indicating ethanol type fermentation prevailed in the two groups li et al has reported that hydrogen production can be effectively improved by 118 4 using ethanoligenens harbinense yuan 3 from glucose with an simultaneous enhancement of ethanol and acetate production by 2 2 and 3 5 times than that of control by bc addition li et al 2020b it could be speculated that bc450 and bc600 stimulated the activity of particular microbes and enhanced the conversion of pscb leading to higher hydrogen production and yield 3 3 effect of bc addition on extracellular orp and nad nadh concentration the fluctuation of extracellular orp was observed to evaluate the effect of bcs on the overall oxidizing or reducing capacity of fermentation system as shown in fig 3 a the extracellular orp values dropped rapidly at initial 36 h indicating vast amounts of electrons were released into system during the process of glucose glycolysis and cell proliferation li et al 2020b wu et al 2019a compared with control group fermentation with bc600 presents lower extracellular orp and faster decrease during this phase suggesting the addition of bc600 may boosted the consumption rate of substrate li et al 2020b during 36 60 h the extracellular orp values in fermentations without bc kept at constant level while bc600 amend group was still decreasing after 72 h orp values of two groups started to increase indicating faster cell death and decelerating substrate utilization zhu et al 2020 these results demonstrated the redox activity of bc600 which was in line with previous study li et al 2020b wu et al 2019a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad and its reduced form nadh are essential cofactors for the metabolism of microorganisms which are also hypothesized to be the intracellular electron pool for extracellular electron transfer feng et al 2018a previous efforts suggested that nadh regeneration could be enhanced by means of metabolic engineering methods thereby manipulating the nadh nad ratio and increasing the release of intracellular electrons and power generation han et al 2016 in this study the nadh nad ratio was found to be promoted by bc600 amendment fig 3b which could be an important factor for improving hydrogen production since nadh dependent hydrogen production pathway is one of the fundamental hydrogen production approach zhang et al 2009 3 4 effects of bc600 on cellulase hydrogenase activities and cell biomass hydrolysis of substrate is considered as the rate limiting step during dark fermentation the cellulase activities at mid log phase was significantly promoted by bc600 amendment with an increase of 124 7 relative to the control group table 3 lü et al also reported that the activities of α glucosidase and protease were improved by bc amendment during ad lu et al 2020 moreover the hydrogenase activities were significantly promoted from 86 4 ml g cell protein h of the control to 136 6 ml g cell protein h of the bc600 treated group with an increase of 58 1 table 3 previous study indicated that the bioavailability of trace elements including fe and ni was enhanced by bc amendment during ad qi et al 2021 consequently fefe hydrogenases and nife hydrogenases in clostridia could be stimulated by the enhanced bioavailability of trace elements which consequently facilitates the production of hydrogen qi et al 2021 bc was successfully applied in fermentation as cell immobilization materials to provide some unique advantages compared with the suspended biomass system such as better process stability and higher biological activity yang and wang 2018b as shown in table 3 the concentration of cell protein was significantly promoted by an increase of 50 4 in bc600 treated fermentation system it was speculated that the functional bacteria with the capacity of high efficient hydrogen production from pscb could be immobilized on the surface of bc600 which may favor their interaction in the form of a mixed biofilm whose microbial community is different from the planktonic community 3 5 characteristic analysis of eps eps is a main constitute of biofilms and its total organic matter was reported to be 50 90 of biofilms wang et al 2019 which plays an important role in biochemical process during ad polysaccharide and protein in eps were measured to investigate whether the effect of bc600 on the property of eps the concentrations of polysaccharide and protein were 37 2 mg l and 94 2 mg l with bc600 addition which were significantly higher than control group fig 4 eps could absorb cu2 and fe3 ions through uronic acids and protein by complexation to improve and maintain the efficiency of intracellular enzymatic reaction yu et al 2013 the higher conductivity of eps by bc600 amendment could be attributed to the higher content of electrochemically active substances which may improve the electrochemical characteristic of methanogenic aggregates cheng et al 2020b eem analysis was conducted to further studying the difference of eps compositions five organics were identified by eem spectra at different regions on the basis of different excitation emission ex em wavelengths during ad for methane production cheng et al 2020b wang et al 2019 biodegradable organics like carbohydrates and proteins in the region of 300 400 250 350 nm excitation emission wavelengths could only be identified as shown in fig 5 li et al 2020c the fluorescence intensity of this region was stronger in the bc600 treated sample which further confirmed the excretion of protein and carbohydrates in eps could be enhanced by bc600 addition wang et al 2019 3 6 electrochemical analysis the electron transfer capacity in fermentation system was analyzed by electrochemical methods two distinct redox peaks with potentials of around 0 8 and 0 3 v were observed by cv analysis fig 6 a and b previous studies indicated that the potentials and shapes of redox peaks could be associated with electrochemically active eps and electroactive microorganisms and the peak currents are probably related to their abundance feng et al 2018b yuan et al 2011 the peak currents increased linearly with an increase in scan rates suggesting that these redox reactions were typical kinetically controlled processes yin et al 2018 therefore the value of electron transfer efficiency kapp was further determined according to the laviron equation cheng et al 2020a the value of kapp calculated from two redox peaks present in control and bc600 treated group were 1 7 10 3 and 5 1 10 3 s 1 respectively the result suggested that a faster eet rate could be triggered by conductive materials amendment which was beneficial for improving the electron transfer efficiency between electroactive microorganisms cheng et al 2020b jiang et al 2020 the extracellular electroactive mediators were further investigated by differential pulse voltammetry dpv on the basis of cv redox active compounds such as quinone cytochrome c c cyt flavin pyocyanin were reported as electron shuttles secreted by electroactive bacteria to complete the formation of biofilm extracellular electron transfer eet and interspecies interaction jia et al 2021 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 dpv was used as an additional electrochemical technique with higher degree of sensitivity selectivity to study electroactive shuttles as previously reported pous et al 2016 yang et al 2017 as shown in this result by fig 6 c the characteristic peaks at 0 45 v and 0 150 v were detected in control and bc600 amend system which illustrated the existence of electroactive shuttles and could be attributed to flavin and cytochrome c respectively jia et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 c type cytochromes involved in the transmembrane electron transfer and flavin involved as free mediator in the eet process have been confirmed and their co existence could indicate the formation of electron transfer pathway between electroactive bacteria in our fermentation systems moreover it was observed that the peak currents flavin c cyt decreased from 0 274 μa 0 236 μa for control group to 0 236 μa 0 204 μa for bc600 amend group respectively this result indicated that eet between electroactive bacteria was prevailing in our systems due to the detected flavin c cyt and biochar amendment could potentially reduce the content of extracellular electroactive secreta even so the electron transfer efficiency of fermentation system was still enhanced by bc600 amendment as confirmed by cv test it has been demonstrated than eet could be occurred directly by conductive carbon based materials between electroactive microorganisms rather than electrically conductive flavin c type cytochrome involved in biological interspecies electrical connections liu et al 2012 wu et al 2020 the replacement of conductive secreta by biochar could possibly reduce the consumption of energy matter for electron transfer which may be an important reason in improving hydrogen production 3 7 effects of bc on bacterial community structure the influence of bc600 on the abundance and spatial distribution of bacteria was studied principal component analysis pca is a multivariate projection method which has been used in microbial ecology for refinement of microbiome data and comparison of complex communities by pca plot the relationship between inter otu variance could be presented by coordinate distance gloor et al 2017 jolliffe and cadima 2016 as shown in fig 7 a four samples control group and three cell fractions in bc600 treated group were evaluated by the pca plot which clearly illustrated the difference of bacterial community structures due to the observed distribution of four samples the dominant families in control group were lachnospiraceae hungateiclostridiaceae clostridiaceae fig 7b the addition of bc600 significantly improved the abundance of lachnospiraceae from 37 8 in control group to 84 6 62 5 and 72 7 in suspended loosely bound and tightly bound fraction respectively the main metabolites of lachnospiraceae include ethanol acetate and hydrogen which could explain the substantial increase of corresponding metabolites by bc600 amendment palomo briones et al 2017 in contrast the total relative abundances of hungateiclostridiaceae and clostridiaceae significantly decreased from 38 3 in the control to 2 2 7 0 and 7 4 in suspended loosely bound and tightly bound fraction respectively clostridiaceae and lachnospiraceae are involved in lignocellulose degrading with diverse glycoside hydrolases and endoglucanases suksong et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 it has been reported that lachnospiraceae possesses stronger hydrolysis efficiency than clostridiaceae during dark fermentation of pscb suksong et al 2019 which could be an important factor to explain the higher pscb degradation rate in the lachnospiraceae rich system by bc600 amendment in our study it is worth noting that the relative abundance of pseudomonadaceae increased significantly from 0 37 of the control and 0 70 of the suspended fraction in the bc600 treated group to 20 1 and 9 42 respectively in the loosely tightly bound fraction on bc600 indicating that pseudomonadaceae could be efficiently enriched and selectively colonized on bc600 pseudomonadaceae could use sugars and organic acids as carbon sources to produce hydrogen efficiently angel acosta et al 2020 babu et al 2013 hassan et al 2018 it has been reported that the relative abundance of pseudomonadaceae was positively correlated with the performance of hydrogen production yun and cho 2016 in addition as an electrochemical microorganism pseudomonadaceae could usually be enriched on the bioanode of mfc thus playing an important role in the electricity or hydrogen production of mfc babu et al 2013 dos passos et al 2019 pham et al 2008 compared with the control the abundance of clostridiaceae in the three cell fractions of bc600 treated group decreased significantly however similar with pseudomonadaceae clostridiaceae also obligately colonized on the bc600 surface clostridiaceae family appeared to be a determining factor affecting the electro fermentative performance in mixed culture toledo alarcón et al 2020 among the cell fractions in bc600 treated system peptostreptococcaceae almost only appeared in the cell fraction that tightly bound with bc600 although peptostreptococcaceae was reported not a hydrogen producing microorganism it can improve the performance of dark fermentation hung et al 2011 peptostreptococcaceae could interact with clostridiaceae to form aggregates with a network structure so that functional bacteria could effectively adsorbed on biochar hung et al 2011 moreover peptostreptococcaceae could accepts exogenous electron to reduce co2 for acetate production which plays a role as electron acceptor to complete the electro metabolic network li et al 2018 3 8 proposed mechanisms for enhanced hydrogen production with bc amendment the possible synergistic effects and eet pathways between predominate bacteria for improving mesophilic dark fermentative performance of pscb were proposed in fig 8 both the fermentable sugars produced from pscb by the cellulolytic enzyme and the organic acids generated from lachnospiraceae and clostridiaceae could be utilized by pseudomonadaceae to produce hydrogen the synergistic effect of pscb degradation hydrogen production between lachnospiraceae clostridiaceae and pseudomonadaceae was assumed to be the dominant factor to boost hydrogen production in terms of eet pseudomonadaceae clostridiaceae and peptostreptococcaceae may carry out electron transfer between each other through conductive bc600 higher electron transfer efficiency of fermentative system was achieved by bc600 amendment which may be important in accelerating eet between electrochemical bacteria the microcosmic ecological niche developed by bc600 amendment may favor the electron transfer and synergistic interaction between functional bacteria moscoviz et al 2016 considering that the electrical conductivity of biochar has a good correlation with the kinetic parameters of hydrogen production in this study fig s1 we speculate that conductivity of biochar plays a very important role during hydrolysis acidification by stimulating the syntrophic metabolism between electroactive microorganisms 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that mesophilic dark fermentative performance of biohydrogen production from pscb could be significantly improved by bc amendment cell biomass key enzyme activities nadh nad ratio and electron transfer efficiency of fermentation system were markedly improved by bc600 amendment additionally cellulolytic lachnospiraceae was efficiently enriched and electroactive bacteria such as pseudomonadaceae clostridiaceae and peptostreptococcaceae were selectively colonized on the surface of bc600 which could synergistically degrade pscb for hydrogen production and carry out syntrophic metabolism the possible mechanisms of enhancing hydrolysis acidogenesis and hydrogen production performance proposed in this study provide a new insight in understanding improved ad performance by bc

16798,drinking water plumbing systems appear to be a unique environment for microorganisms as they contain few nutrients but a high mineral concentration interactions between mineral content and bacteria such as microbial calcium carbonate precipitation mcp however has not yet attracted too much attention in drinking water sector this study aims to carefully examine mcp behavior of two drinking water bacteria species which may potentially link scaling and biofouling processes in drinking water distribution systems evidence from cell density evolution chemical parameters and microscopy suggest that drinking water isolates can mediate caco3 precipitation through previously overlooked mcp mechanisms like ammonification or biosorption the results also illustrate the active control of bacteria on the mcp process as the calcium starts to concentrate onto cell surfaces only after reaching a certain cell density even though the cell surfaces are shown to be the ideal location for the caco3 nucleation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mcp dwds biofilm scale drinking water bacteria opportunistic pathogen 1 introduction microbial calcium carbonate precipitation mcp is an omnipresent phenomenon that has been extensively studied in various contexts ranging from natural processes such as sediment lithification to engineering applications like concrete restoration boquet et al 1973 dhami et al 2013 dupraz and visscher 2005 hammes et al 2003 caco3 precipitation generally results from a ph increase and co2 production mediated by different microbial metabolisms examples of the reported caco3 precipitating metabolisms include photosynthesis sulfate reduction methane oxidation denitrification ureolysis and amino acid deamination among these metabolisms ureolysis and photosynthesis are the most studied while the amino acid deamination remains poorly understood zhu and dittrich 2016 even though bacterial mcp has been commonly described as a passive process where caco3 is formed as a byproduct without much biological control there is also an emerging discussion about the involvement of active genetic regulation carried out by bacteria during this process dade robertson et al 2017 keren paz and kolodkin gal 2020 drinking water is a special environment for bacteria where the organic nutrient availability is extremely low but mineral concentrations suit the biological requirement the interaction between biological components and the abundant minerals can be one of the fundamental processes in the study of drinking water microbiology especially in biofilms despite the extensive investigation of mcp in concrete engineering and geological recycling zhu and dittrich 2016 the important role of calcium carbonate formation in biofilm has never been discussed in the context of a drinking water environment it has however been found to be important for different sources of drinking water supplies including ground water and surface water fujita et al 2000 liu et al 2017 meier et al 2017 obst et al 2006 in fact the multiple benefits mcp can bring to the biofilm growth including enhanced interspecific competitivity li et al 2016 better resistance towards chlorine attack keren paz et al 2018 improved nutrient availability oppenheimer shaanan et al 2016 and maintenance of calcium homeostasis anderson et al 1992 can potentially lead to increased difficulties of biofilm removal and scaling prevention simultaneously in the past biofilm and scaling have been discussed separately as different problems the former focuses on biological development the latter emphasizes the chemical crystallization process therefore a good understanding of the mcp process in drinking water may provide an important insight for numerous serious problems associated with both biofilm formation and scaling issues including pipe corrosion water discoloration regrowth of opportunistic pathogens etc hafid et al 2015 prest et al 2016 vaz moreira et al 2011 on the other hand the role of bacteria in scaling has also been greatly ignored drinking water normally represents an undersaturated environment for the precipitation of caco3 peng et al 2010 it is therefore unlikely that caco3 spontaneously precipitates without the assistance from a biofilm it also has been reported that bacteria can affect the morphology and polymorphs of crystals precipitated during mcp the biological components such as biopolymers made of amino acids or carbohydrates can serve as template for crystallization and even further stabilize the crystal structure enyedi et al 2020 the various caco3 species have different thermodynamic stabilities the precursor amorphous calcium carbonate acc being the least stable one without a clear crystalline structure followed by vaterite aragonite and calcite which are the crystalline polymorphs ranked in increasing thermodynamic stability species like acc or vaterite which have been very difficult to observe in chemical labs due to their unstable nature can be easily maintained by bacteria up to an age of half a year enyedi et al 2020 few previous studies reported possible mcp observations in drinking water without further investigation for instance biofilms have been identified as a hotspot of calcium accumulation especially on the upper surface of pvc drinking water pipes liu et al 2017 in addition calcite and vaterite species have also been found in simulated drinking water biofilm growing from both hard 280 mg l hardness and soft 49 mg l hardness groundwater shen et al 2018 nevertheless these studies did not identify related metabolisms or confirm the biological original of the caco3 species found in drinking water pipes or biofilm in this study the two bacterial species isolated from tap water are both common drinking water bacteria however they have very different cell structures and scientific relevance sphingobium species are rod shaped gram negative bacteria that have been widely found in drinking water distribution systems worldwide vaz moreira et al 2011 their strong capabilities to form biofilms and to resist antibiotics make them an important model organism for bacterial auto aggregation and biofilm formation studies blom et al 2010 douterelo et al 2014 ramalingam et al 2013 however so far there is no report about caco3 precipitation or mineralization of any other metals throughout the sphingobium genus the other species isolated in this study micrococcus luteus is a gram positive coccus that can be easily found in a variety of natural environments one of their most distinctive morphological characteristics is the tetrad shape where the bacterium divides in two planes to form a square of four bacteria it has been recognized as an opportunistic pathogen with a good resistance to chlorine disinfectants in drinking water environment that threatens immunocompromised patients fosse et al 1985 kao et al 2014 mir et al 1997 reith et al 2007 mir et al 1997 stated that m luteus has a strong resistance to chlorine compared to other freshwater bacterial isolates such as pseudomonas indicating a potential risk for drinking water quality even after disinfection treatment in this study we hypothesize that some drinking water bacterial isolates have the capability to mediate caco3 precipitation therefore we performed a comprehensive investigation on the mcp behavior of seven isolates of two bacterial species sphingobium limneticum and micrococcus luteus from tap water bacterial growth evolution of relevant chemical parameters and the development of caco3 crystals were monitored with optical density od ion chromatography ic inductive coupled plasma icp scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy edx over time x ray diffraction xrd was also performed for crystal identification to our knowledge this is the first study to carefully monitor the development of mcp both chemically and microscopically over time 2 material and methods 2 1 isolation and basic characterization of bacteria drinking water samples were collected in autoclaved scott bottles directly from the tap of the wetsus building leeuwarden the netherlands in april 2018 mixed thoroughly and plated onto a calcium enriched b 4 medium 2 5 g l calcium acetate sigma aldrich st louis missouri 5 g l glucose

oppenheimer shaanan et al 2016 the calcium acetate solution was autoclaved separately to avoid precipitation with organic matter at high temperatures from the colonies enriched on b 4 medium plates a

sphingobium limneticum and micrococcus luteus supplementary figure s1 have shown caco3 precipitating behavior and were studied in detail to understand some basic characteristics of the seven bacterial isolates their growth curves under various temperatures 20 c 25 c 30 c 37 c and ph values 7 10 5 with 0 5 interval were collected the optimal growth temperature and growth range of both species tended to be lower than previously reported for other isolates from fresh surface water for sphingobium limneticum or human body for micrococcus luteus with a higher tolerance of high ph values supplementary figure s2 4 akbar et al 2014 chen et al 2013 fosse et al 1985 kloss and musselwhite 1956 pindi et al 2013 reith et al 2007 sheu et al 2013 in general the optimal growth temperature and the range of temperature limit of the isolates in this study were in agreement with the conditions of their in situ drinking water environment 3 25 c prest et al 2016 the tolerance toward high ph allows the possibility for the isolates to perform mcp metabolism 3 2 caco3 precipitating metabolism to have a better understanding of the caco3 precipitating metabolism performed by the bacterial isolates the ph changes ammonium production and aqueous calcium ions in the medium during the bacterial growth were monitored for one representative isolates of each species sphingobium limneticum s3 and of micrococcus luteus m1 fig 1 the results suggest that even though the two bacterial species both perform mcp under aerobic heterotrophic conditions they employ very different metabolisms for sphingobium limneticum s3 ph and ammonium concentration increased along with the cell growth showing that the metabolism of the bacterium leads to ammonium production and thus to a ph increase in contrast the aqueous calcium concentration decreased until the lowest concentration 415 28 74 mg l at 62 h suggesting that caco3 precipitation was induced during the cell growth and ph increase however after the cell growth entered the stationary phase at 62 h even though the ammonium concentration kept increasing the calcium concentration didn t decrease further indicating that the precipitation of caco3 depends on the cell density possibly because of the continuous carbonate supply or nucleation sites preferred starting point of crystallization on the cell surface castanier et al 1999 rodriguez navarro et al 2012 in contrast micrococcus luteus m1 only showed an slightly increased ammonium concentration of 7 mg l at 87 h which then drastically decreased and finally ending below the detection level at 120 h the ph changes of the medium followed the same pattern as the ammonium concentration and no calcium decrease was observed these results suggested that the metabolism of micrococcus luteus m1 did not produce ammonium and the amount of caco3 that was precipitated was below detection level with icp the caco3 precipitation observed via microscopy methods therefore requires an alternative explanation which will be further discussed in the following section 3 3 development of mcp the development of caco3 crystals in the bacterial culture was monitored every 24 h using sem exemplary results are given in fig 2 in the first stage 24 h only bacterial cells could be observed the cells of micrococcus luteus m1 showed spherical shape and the cells sphingobium limneticum s3 showed rod shape which agrees perfectly with the characteristics of the identified species from the images at 48 h more bacterial cells were observed on the filter and small crystals aggregating on the cell surfaces could also be seen the bacterial shapes also became sharper than in the earlier stage indicating a better cell integrity after the drying process possibly due to the higher calcium content on the cell surface in the later phase at 72 h a thick biofilm covering the entire filter and crystals size 5 µm were present with a higher magnification inserts in fig 2 it can be seen that bacterial cells are located on the surface of the crystals at 96 h the crystals from both species grew further size 10 µm the crystal from sphingobium limneticum s3 showed an obvious bulky rhombohedral shape fig 2h that is commonly identified as calcite chen et al 2005 two types of crystals in different morphologies were observed in micrococcus luteus m1 fig 2h one was in the same spherical shape as the crystal observed at 72 h and the other one in the shape of a flat plate the possibilities that the crystals formed independently in the liquid medium and got trapped by the biofilm are negligible due to the fact that chemical crystallization of calcium carbonate is highly unlikely in undersaturated atkins et al 2018 the blank ca enriched medium was used as negative control and no bacterial cells or crystal formation was observed supplementary figure s5 which further illustrated that necessity of bioactivity for the caco3 formation furthermore the bacteria shaped cavities that could be observed in most of the crystals from both bacterial species also imply a close interaction between bacterial cells and the crystallization process fig 3 3 4 identification of calcium biominerals the chemical composition of the crystals was also monitored for the duration of the cell growth and three different stages could be observed from the mcp process exemplary results are given in fig 4 5 in general during the initial stage 24 h only the growth of bacterial cells could be observed with negligible amount of calcium detected on cell surface from the second stage 48 h calcium was found to be concentrated on the surface of the bacterial cells in the last stage 96 h most of large crystals observed in the samples from both species have a spherical shape with calcium carbon and oxygen elements identified on them xrd analysis provided further evidence that these spherically shaped crystals represent vaterite the least stable polymorph of calcium carbonate fig 6 a interestingly for sphingobium limneticum s3 a small number of large blocky crystals that resemble the common morphology of calcite could be observed indicating some vaterite further recrystallized into calcite fig 7 j k l and fig 4c as the ph increased during the growth of the bacteria fig 1a however the amount of calcite present in the sample was likely still too small to be detectable by xrd measurements large plate shaped calcium phosphate was found in medium of micrococcus luteus m1 fig 5c but the amount of calcium phosphate species may have been too small to be clearly detected by xrd fig 6a however from the sample of sphingobium limneticum s2 where a very special spiky crystal morphology was found fig 8h only hydroxyapatite could be identified from the xrd spectra fig 6b it could be concluded that calcium phosphate crystallization can also be induced by bacterial activities as phosphate is released from the degradation of yeast extract in the medium 3 5 variation in crystal morphologies crystals with different morphologies could be produced by the same bacterial isolate in the same medium solution fig 7 for micrococcus luteus m1 three different crystal morphologies spherical fig 7c plate shaped fig 7a and disk shaped fig 7b were produced by isolate m1 after 72 h incubation the spherical shaped caco3 was the most common morphology in the sample it was rare to find the disk shaped caco3 crystals which formed possibly only at the contact with the glass surface the variations in crystal morphology might be caused by different crystal growth patterns as the plate shaped and disk shaped precipitates seemed to grow by horizontal expansion the spherical shaped vaterite a more soluble polymorph of calcium carbonate see introduction crystals fig 7e f j grew by aggregation of smaller spherical shaped particles also on the surface of these spherical vaterites a tetrad shaped structure which is typical for micrococcus species could be easily found together with bacteria shaped cavities these observations suggest that the as tetrads aggregated bacterial cells may serve as nucleation template for the initial crystallization process as shown in fig 7d in the sample of isolate m2 48 h bacteria were found to have a very rough surface composited of nano scale granules with very high calcium content supplementary figure s6 suggesting that calcium get adsorbed onto the cell surface which may potentially lead to crystallization and caco3 growth these calcium nanogranule layer on the cell surface is quite thick as it made the cells look twice as big as their original size after further incubation of the same sample spherical precipitates with diameters higher than 10 µm were observed with highly calcified bacterial cells on their surface fig 7e co occurrence of morphological variated crystals by the same bacterial isolate were also observed for sphingobium limneticum especially in isolate s4 fig 7j k l but it seemed that the morphological differences represented different stages during a phase transition from vaterite the spherical shape to calcite rhombohedral shape also the role of bacteria in crystal shaping seems to be different in the three different stages in the early stage fig 7j many bacterial cells were found on the surface of the spherical crystal but in the intermediate stage fig 7k much less bacterial cells could be observed on the rather smooth crystal surface and cavities that resemble the bacterial shapes were found at the edge of the rhombohedron in the last stage dense biofilm aggregated only at the two vertices of the smooth surface crystal different crystal morphologies could also be caused by different bacterial isolates even though spherical shaped caco3 crystals produced by the isolate m1 and m2 of the micrococcus luteus looked similar they were still slightly different from each other the crystal of m2 fig 7e had a much more regular spherical shape than the ones in m1 fig 7c possibly because the crystal of m2 grew by layers but those of m1 grew by aggregation for the isolate m3 the caco3 crystal had a peanut shape ca 50 µm and individual cells were observed on the crystal surface instead of the biofilm similarily shaped vaterite was reported in ammonia solution by proteus mirabilis chen et al 2009 noticeably calcified individual bacterial cells were not so commonly found in the samples of sphingobium limneticum as the ones of micrococcus luteus instead cavities of bacterial shape were more often observed on the surface of crystals produced by the sphingobium species illustrating that the surface of gram positive micrococcus luteus interacts with calcium very differently compared to the gram negative sphingobium species fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 role of bacteria in caco3 precipitation and crystal morphology we hypothesize that bacteria play an important role in mediating caco3 precipitation which can also potentially explain scale formation in drinking water pipes in undersaturated conditions to examine this hypothesis the caco3 precipitating behavior of two drinking water isolates were characterized our investigation suggests that bacterial activities play a key role in the formation of calcium carbonate in terms of creating favorable precipitation conditions shaping the crystal morphology and crystal phase regulating the start of precipitation in this study all caco3 precipitations observed started on the surface of bacterial cells possibly because cell metabolism creates favorable precipitating conditions in a highly local manner generally to initiate the caco3 precipitation process a local supersaturation of calcium and carbonate ions needs to be reached first then a hydrated calcium carbonate precursor acc that consists of dynamically ordered liquid like oxyanion polymers or dollops is formed before an anhydrous final polymorph vaterite aragonite calcite can develop gebauer and cölfen 2011 tlili et al 2006 in addition to the basic requirements such as the availability of calcium and carbonate other environmental factors such as ph and available nucleation sites determine whether the precipitation dehydration process is thermodynamically feasible tlili et al 2006 most often bacterial cells assist the precipitation process by increasing the ph the carbonate concentration and or by providing nucleation sites hammes et al 2002 for instance the ca2 proton pump and negatively charged surface polymers e g carboxyl groups in the polysaccharides allow calcium enrichment on the cell surface or the extracellular polymeric substances eps structures around the cells the breakdown of organic carbon and nitrogen can result in an increase in bicarbonate and ammonia concentration which in turn can increase the local ph and provide bicarbonate castanier et al 1999 hammes et al 2002 in turn the chemicals species and environment required for precipitation of calcium carbonate are all best available on cell surface the two species studied here however appeared to have very different mechanisms to create such a favorable condition for the calcium carbonate precipitation for sphingobium limneticum this metabolism involves ammonia production which is a common way for aerobic heterotrophic mcp bacteria to modify the environmental ph while many mcp metabolisms are anaerobic or photosynthetic currently there are only two reported mcp metabolisms that involve ammonium production namely ureolysis and deamination of amino acids zhu and dittrich 2016 in this study all bacterial isolates were urease negative which meant that the ammonia production observed from sphingobium limneticum was caused by ammonification the chemical reactions involved in the mcp mechanisms are given here as eqs 1 5 and are discussed in detail below 1 c 3 h 7 n o 2 3 o 2 n h 3 3 c o 2 2 h 2 o 2 n h 3 h 2 o nh 4 o h 3 c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 h hco 3 4 co n h 2 2 h 2 o 2 n h 3 c o 2 5 c a 2 hco 3 cac o 3 h theoretically 1 mol of amino acid can produce 1 mol of ammonia and 3 mol of carbon dioxide eq 1 which further equilibrate in water to form ammonium hydroxide ions eq 2 and bicarbonate eq 3 the formation of ammonium causes the rise of ph and therefore induce the formation of caco3 eq 5 hence the production of ammonia should be directly proportional to the caco3 precipitated however in the results of this study regarding sphingobium limneticum s3 the cell growth followed an exponential pattern whilst the increase of ammonium was linear interestingly the caco3 precipitation followed the pattern of the bacterial growth which leveled off as it entered the stationary phase despite the continued increase of ammonium and ph similar observations were also reported in a previous study on ureolytical calcium carbonate precipitation induced by bacillus species in a urea and calcium enriched nutrient broth at 25 c stocks fischer et al 1999 noticeably the hydrolysis of one urea molecule actually produces 2 ammonia ions eq 4 which means that ureolysis can increase the ph twice as efficiently as deamination hammes et al 2003 it seems that the cell concentration is the limiting factor for the mcp process rather than ph regulation this assumption is corroborated by the fact that even when the ph in the bulk solution is high only the cell surface environment can provide a favorable condition for caco3 precipitation besides the mcp metabolisms reported in the literature so far there might be other unknown mcp mechanisms meier et al 2017 found that some groundwater bacteria that acidify their immediate environment can also induce mcp indicating that increasing the ph may not be as necessary as conventionally expected for mcp meier et al 2017 in our study the ph values of micrococcus luteus m1 did not increase much during the whole incubation period and only a small and short increase in ammonium concentration was observed however caco3 precipitates could still be found under microscope intriguingly the bacterial cells observed in early stage of the incubation were fully covered with nano scale crystals on their surface a similar observation was reported when micrococcus luteus was used for copper recovery from wastewater through biosorption letnik et al 2017 it is therefore possible that here caco3 precipitation was induced by the biosorption of calcium ions to our knowledge the precipitation of caco3 through biosorption alone has not been discussed previously but the biosorption of a bacterial cell in general has been extensively discussed in the past decades for instance extracted cell walls of bacillus subtilis were found to capture a wide range of metals such as ca2 mn2 zn2 from aqueous solution and various functional groups such as amino carboxyl phosphoryl hydroxyl groups were found to play an important role in the metal uptake beveridge et al 1997 beveridge and murray 1976 fein et al 1997 in addition the electronegative nature of bacterial cell membranes may also contribute to the biosorption capability of micrococcus luteus schultze lam et al 1996 even though the mcp mechanism of specific micrococcus luteus species is not well understood the strong interactions between micrococcus luteus and calcium and other metal ions have also been reported and applied in different industries for instance micrococcus luteus has been used for monumental stone conservation without identification of an mcp metabolism tiano et al 1999 benka coker ekundayo 1998 suggested that micrococcus luteus has a high tolerance to the presence of different metals benka coker and ekundayo 1998 moreover micrococcus luteus showed the highest biosorption capability for the recovery of gold copper thorium and uranium in aqueous environments compared to a wide range of bacterial species letnik et al 2017 levchenko et al 2001 nakajima and tsuruta 2002 wong et al 2001 therefore precipitation induced by biosorption alone might be a novel mechanism responsible for the formation of caco3 especially explaining the mcp observed for micrococcus luteus in our study though further investigations will be required to obtain additional evidence in addition to the discussion of biochemical metabolisms the role of bacteria in mcp can be also reflected by their influence on crystal morphologies there has been a continuous discussion on whether the polymorphs of mcp are isolate specific or environment specific in some cases different bacterial isolates produce very different crystal morphologies or even different polymorphs anbu et al 2016 while in the other cases these factors are only subject to different environmental conditions such as ph substrate calcium supply or ca2 mg2 ratio meier et al 2017 rodriguez navarro et al 2012 sánchez navas et al 2009 zhao and zhao 2017 in this study specifically only spherical vaterite crystals were found in the three different micrococcus luteus isolates where ph change was minimal during the cell growth this is possibly due to the fact that eps can carry negative charges or contain hydrophobic area which can interact or further stabilize the intermediate product of caco3 crystallization product such as vaterite e g vaterite enyedi et al 2020 consequently without increased environmental ph the supersaturation of caco3 could not overcome the energy barrier for the next polymorph however in the case of the sphingobium isolates where the ph continued to increase until reaching a value of ph 8 both vaterite and calcite including a transitional phase between the two states were found in the sample therefore it is reasonable to argue that polymorphs depend on the chemical regulation and biopolymer production by bacteria conversely variations in morphology were found among the vaterite crystals produced by the different isolates for instance the vaterite produced by coccus shaped micrococcus luteus tended to be spherical while the ones of rod shaped sphingobium tended to be elliptical it seems that these morphological variations are related to the shape of the cells and their growth pattern another highlight of this study is the observation that the microbial caco3 precipitation behavior of the two isolates is density dependent traditionally mcp mediated by heterotrophic bacteria has been described as a passive bio mineralization process where the formation of caco3 is induced as a byproduct resulting from the ammonia and carbon dioxide production which also emphasis a lack of control and regulation by bacteria on the process however in this study very little calcium was deposited on the bacterial surface in the early stage of bacterial growth fig 4 5 and no other precipitation e g on the surface of substrate or on the surface of plastic vessel was observed in the early stage of bacterial growth when ammonia and carbonate production had already started in the case of micrococcus luteus such a phenomenon was even more obvious since only carbon and nitrogen were identified at cell surfaces possibly because the surface polymers that adsorb ca2 could only be expressed at a certain cell density in general it is known that bacteria can perform quorum sensing which means that they can sense the cell density through different environmental cues and modify their metabolic behavior accordingly norris et al 1996 e g if cell density reaches high levels the cells in the community starts to produce more biofilm components such eps minogue et al 2005 consequently if mcp only takes place after the bacterial numbers reach a certain concentration it is tempting to speculate the active role of bacteria in the caco3 precipitation with an evolutionary benefit even though the specific molecules that interact with ca2 still need to be identified since the two distinctive mcp metabolisms showed a density dependent feature the natural selection favoring the trait might be strong lately the discussion that mcp is actively regulated by bacteria has started among scientists as relevant evidence slowly piles up dade robertson et al 2017 keren paz and kolodkin gal 2020 another study has also reported that mutations in urease gene ure a c eps esph amyloid like fibres gene tasa and acidic exopolysaccharides production gene ywq c f operon in bacillus subtilis strongly inhibit mcp on agar plates oppenheimer shaanan et al 2016 others showed that the special biofilm structure caused by presence of calcite crystals can create a protective barrier against disinfectants keren paz et al 2018 a benefit during inter specific resource competition has also been observed for pseudomonas species li et al 2016 nevertheless mcp does not seem to benefit bacteria in an individual state with the risks of cell encrustation and cell death as many calcified cell cocoons have been repeatedly observed in different studies anbu et al 2016 castanier et al 1999 including ours this adverse effect of mcp may explain the caco3 free state of bacteria at lower cell densities 4 2 caco3 precipitating activities of drinking water bacteria in this first study to examine mcp activities by drinking water bacteria the scope was limited to aerobic heterotrophic conditions however the two bacterial species already exhibit distinctive mcp metabolisms other calcium precipitating autotrophic metabolisms such as methane oxidation and sulfate reduction have also been detected in drinking water system ling et al 2016 seth and edyvean 2006 zhu and dittrich 2016 also even though we provided a higher nutrient concentrations in the medium than normally available in a drinking water environment other studies that simulated the actual conditions in drinking water systems also suggested the involvement of bacteria in the scaling process for instance liu et al 2017 observed distinctive ca2 capture performance by different in situ drinking water biofilms that differed in microbial composition suggesting the probable involvement of microbial activities in scale formation another example is the study by shen et al 2018 where softened groundwater hardness 49 mg l ph 7 5 7 8 was directly used to grow biofilm on pvc coupons in a cdc biofilm reactor for 10 months with total organic carbon concentrations 1 1 6 mg l comparable to the drinking water environment 1 3 mg l zlatanović et al 2017 vaterite caco3 was observed together with a high content of protein from the biofilm formed which indicated the role of biofilm in caco3 formation in the natural environment especially in the ones in under saturated conditions which are generally found in drinking water systems where the calcium concentration is lower than 120 mg l and ph stays neutral peng et al 2010 to further confirm the role of biofilm in mcp under low nutrient conditions more studies in a drinking water simulated set up need to be performed conclusions in conclusion this study characterizes both chemically and microscopically the development of microbial calcium carbonate precipitation by two bacterial species native to drinking water two distinctive density dependent mcp metabolisms amino acids deamination and biosorption were identified for the two bacterial species the active regulatory role of bacteria on the mcp process was also implied both vaterite and calcite have been observed as product of mcp and the morphological variances of mcp crystals are strain specific as some specific types of bacteria can cause microbiological scaling innovative technologies that target the mcp metabolism may simultaneously manage the microbial

16798,drinking water plumbing systems appear to be a unique environment for microorganisms as they contain few nutrients but a high mineral concentration interactions between mineral content and bacteria such as microbial calcium carbonate precipitation mcp however has not yet attracted too much attention in drinking water sector this study aims to carefully examine mcp behavior of two drinking water bacteria species which may potentially link scaling and biofouling processes in drinking water distribution systems evidence from cell density evolution chemical parameters and microscopy suggest that drinking water isolates can mediate caco3 precipitation through previously overlooked mcp mechanisms like ammonification or biosorption the results also illustrate the active control of bacteria on the mcp process as the calcium starts to concentrate onto cell surfaces only after reaching a certain cell density even though the cell surfaces are shown to be the ideal location for the caco3 nucleation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mcp dwds biofilm scale drinking water bacteria opportunistic pathogen 1 introduction microbial calcium carbonate precipitation mcp is an omnipresent phenomenon that has been extensively studied in various contexts ranging from natural processes such as sediment lithification to engineering applications like concrete restoration boquet et al 1973 dhami et al 2013 dupraz and visscher 2005 hammes et al 2003 caco3 precipitation generally results from a ph increase and co2 production mediated by different microbial metabolisms examples of the reported caco3 precipitating metabolisms include photosynthesis sulfate reduction methane oxidation denitrification ureolysis and amino acid deamination among these metabolisms ureolysis and photosynthesis are the most studied while the amino acid deamination remains poorly understood zhu and dittrich 2016 even though bacterial mcp has been commonly described as a passive process where caco3 is formed as a byproduct without much biological control there is also an emerging discussion about the involvement of active genetic regulation carried out by bacteria during this process dade robertson et al 2017 keren paz and kolodkin gal 2020 drinking water is a special environment for bacteria where the organic nutrient availability is extremely low but mineral concentrations suit the biological requirement the interaction between biological components and the abundant minerals can be one of the fundamental processes in the study of drinking water microbiology especially in biofilms despite the extensive investigation of mcp in concrete engineering and geological recycling zhu and dittrich 2016 the important role of calcium carbonate formation in biofilm has never been discussed in the context of a drinking water environment it has however been found to be important for different sources of drinking water supplies including ground water and surface water fujita et al 2000 liu et al 2017 meier et al 2017 obst et al 2006 in fact the multiple benefits mcp can bring to the biofilm growth including enhanced interspecific competitivity li et al 2016 better resistance towards chlorine attack keren paz et al 2018 improved nutrient availability oppenheimer shaanan et al 2016 and maintenance of calcium homeostasis anderson et al 1992 can potentially lead to increased difficulties of biofilm removal and scaling prevention simultaneously in the past biofilm and scaling have been discussed separately as different problems the former focuses on biological development the latter emphasizes the chemical crystallization process therefore a good understanding of the mcp process in drinking water may provide an important insight for numerous serious problems associated with both biofilm formation and scaling issues including pipe corrosion water discoloration regrowth of opportunistic pathogens etc hafid et al 2015 prest et al 2016 vaz moreira et al 2011 on the other hand the role of bacteria in scaling has also been greatly ignored drinking water normally represents an undersaturated environment for the precipitation of caco3 peng et al 2010 it is therefore unlikely that caco3 spontaneously precipitates without the assistance from a biofilm it also has been reported that bacteria can affect the morphology and polymorphs of crystals precipitated during mcp the biological components such as biopolymers made of amino acids or carbohydrates can serve as template for crystallization and even further stabilize the crystal structure enyedi et al 2020 the various caco3 species have different thermodynamic stabilities the precursor amorphous calcium carbonate acc being the least stable one without a clear crystalline structure followed by vaterite aragonite and calcite which are the crystalline polymorphs ranked in increasing thermodynamic stability species like acc or vaterite which have been very difficult to observe in chemical labs due to their unstable nature can be easily maintained by bacteria up to an age of half a year enyedi et al 2020 few previous studies reported possible mcp observations in drinking water without further investigation for instance biofilms have been identified as a hotspot of calcium accumulation especially on the upper surface of pvc drinking water pipes liu et al 2017 in addition calcite and vaterite species have also been found in simulated drinking water biofilm growing from both hard 280 mg l hardness and soft 49 mg l hardness groundwater shen et al 2018 nevertheless these studies did not identify related metabolisms or confirm the biological original of the caco3 species found in drinking water pipes or biofilm in this study the two bacterial species isolated from tap water are both common drinking water bacteria however they have very different cell structures and scientific relevance sphingobium species are rod shaped gram negative bacteria that have been widely found in drinking water distribution systems worldwide vaz moreira et al 2011 their strong capabilities to form biofilms and to resist antibiotics make them an important model organism for bacterial auto aggregation and biofilm formation studies blom et al 2010 douterelo et al 2014 ramalingam et al 2013 however so far there is no report about caco3 precipitation or mineralization of any other metals throughout the sphingobium genus the other species isolated in this study micrococcus luteus is a gram positive coccus that can be easily found in a variety of natural environments one of their most distinctive morphological characteristics is the tetrad shape where the bacterium divides in two planes to form a square of four bacteria it has been recognized as an opportunistic pathogen with a good resistance to chlorine disinfectants in drinking water environment that threatens immunocompromised patients fosse et al 1985 kao et al 2014 mir et al 1997 reith et al 2007 mir et al 1997 stated that m luteus has a strong resistance to chlorine compared to other freshwater bacterial isolates such as pseudomonas indicating a potential risk for drinking water quality even after disinfection treatment in this study we hypothesize that some drinking water bacterial isolates have the capability to mediate caco3 precipitation therefore

sphingobium limneticum and micrococcus luteus supplementary figure s1 have shown caco3 precipitating behavior and were studied in detail to understand some basic characteristics of the seven bacterial isolates their growth curves under various temperatures 20 c 25 c 30 c 37 c and ph values 7 10 5 with 0 5 interval were collected the optimal growth temperature and growth range of both species tended to be lower than previously reported for other isolates from fresh surface water for sphingobium limneticum or human body for micrococcus luteus with a higher tolerance of high ph values supplementary figure s2 4 akbar et al 2014 chen et al 2013 fosse et al 1985 kloss and musselwhite 1956 pindi et al 2013 reith et al 2007 sheu et al 2013 in general the optimal growth temperature and the range of temperature limit of the isolates in this study were in agreement with the conditions of their in situ drinking water environment 3 25 c prest et al 2016 the tolerance toward high ph allows the possibility for the isolates to perform mcp metabolism 3 2 caco3 precipitating metabolism to have a better understanding of the caco3 precipitating metabolism performed by the bacterial isolates the ph changes ammonium production and aqueous calcium ions in the medium during the bacterial growth were monitored for one representative isolates of each species sphingobium limneticum s3 and of micrococcus luteus m1 fig 1 the results suggest that even though the two bacterial species both perform mcp under aerobic heterotrophic conditions they employ very different metabolisms for sphingobium limneticum s3 ph and ammonium concentration increased along with the cell growth showing that the metabolism of the bacterium leads to ammonium production and thus to a ph increase in contrast the aqueous calcium concentration decreased until the lowest concentration 415 28 74 mg l at 62 h suggesting that caco3 precipitation was induced during the cell growth and ph increase however after the cell growth entered the stationary phase at 62 h even though the ammonium concentration kept increasing the calcium concentration didn t decrease further indicating that the precipitation of caco3 depends on the cell density possibly because of the continuous carbonate supply or nucleation sites preferred starting point of crystallization on the cell surface castanier et al 1999 rodriguez navarro et al 2012 in contrast micrococcus luteus m1 only showed an slightly increased ammonium concentration of 7 mg l at 87 h which then drastically decreased and finally ending below the detection level at 120 h the ph changes of the medium followed the same pattern as the ammonium concentration and no calcium decrease was observed these results suggested that the metabolism of micrococcus luteus m1 did not produce ammonium and the amount of caco3 that was precipitated was below detection level with icp the caco3 precipitation observed via microscopy methods therefore requires an alternative explanation which will be further discussed in the following section 3 3 development of mcp the development of caco3 crystals in the bacterial culture was monitored every 24 h using sem exemplary results are given in fig 2 in the first stage 24 h only bacterial cells could be observed the cells of micrococcus luteus m1 showed spherical shape and the cells sphingobium limneticum s3 showed rod shape which agrees perfectly with the characteristics of the identified species from the images at 48 h more bacterial cells were observed on the filter and small crystals aggregating on the cell surfaces could also be seen the bacterial shapes also became sharper than in the earlier stage indicating a better cell integrity after the drying process possibly due to the higher calcium content on the cell surface in the later phase at 72 h a thick biofilm covering the entire filter and crystals size 5 µm were present with a higher magnification inserts in fig 2 it can be seen that bacterial cells are located on the surface of the crystals at 96 h the crystals from both species grew further size 10 µm the crystal from sphingobium limneticum s3 showed an obvious bulky rhombohedral shape fig 2h that is commonly identified as calcite chen et al 2005 two types of crystals in different morphologies were observed in micrococcus luteus m1 fig 2h one was in the same spherical shape as the crystal observed at 72 h and the other one in the shape of a flat plate the possibilities that the crystals formed independently in the liquid medium and got trapped by the biofilm are negligible due to the fact that chemical crystallization of calcium carbonate is highly unlikely in undersaturated atkins et al 2018 the blank ca enriched medium was used as negative control and no bacterial cells or crystal formation was observed supplementary figure s5 which further illustrated that necessity of bioactivity for the caco3 formation furthermore the bacteria shaped cavities that could be observed in most of the crystals from both bacterial species also imply a close interaction between bacterial cells and the crystallization process fig 3 3 4 identification of calcium biominerals the chemical composition of the crystals was also monitored for the duration of the cell growth and three different stages could be observed from the mcp process exemplary results are given in fig 4 5 in general during the initial stage 24 h only the growth of bacterial cells could be observed with negligible amount of calcium detected on cell surface from the second stage 48 h calcium was found to be concentrated on the surface of the bacterial cells in the last stage 96 h most of large crystals observed in the samples from both species have a spherical shape with calcium carbon and oxygen elements identified on them xrd analysis provided further evidence that these spherically shaped crystals represent vaterite the least stable polymorph of calcium carbonate fig 6 a interestingly for sphingobium limneticum s3 a small number of large blocky crystals that resemble the common morphology of calcite could be observed indicating some vaterite further recrystallized into calcite fig 7 j k l and fig 4c as the ph increased during the growth of the bacteria fig 1a however the amount of calcite present in the sample was likely still too small to be detectable by xrd measurements large plate shaped calcium phosphate was found in medium of micrococcus luteus m1 fig 5c but the amount of calcium phosphate species may have been too small to be clearly detected by xrd fig 6a however from the sample of sphingobium limneticum s2 where a very special spiky crystal morphology was found fig 8h only hydroxyapatite could be identified from the xrd spectra fig 6b it could be concluded that calcium phosphate crystallization can also be induced by bacterial activities as phosphate is released from the degradation of yeast extract in the medium 3 5 variation in crystal morphologies crystals with different morphologies could be produced by the same bacterial isolate in the same medium solution fig 7 for micrococcus luteus m1 three different crystal morphologies spherical fig 7c plate shaped fig 7a and disk shaped fig 7b were produced by isolate m1 after 72 h incubation the spherical shaped caco3 was the most common morphology in the sample it was rare to find the disk shaped caco3 crystals which formed possibly only at the contact with the glass surface the variations in crystal morphology might be caused by different crystal growth patterns as the plate shaped and disk shaped precipitates seemed to grow by horizontal expansion the spherical shaped vaterite a more soluble polymorph of calcium carbonate see introduction crystals fig 7e f j grew by aggregation of smaller spherical shaped particles also on the surface of these spherical vaterites a tetrad shaped structure which is typical for micrococcus species could be easily found together with bacteria shaped cavities these observations suggest that the as tetrads aggregated bacterial cells may serve as nucleation template for the initial crystallization process as shown in fig 7d in the sample of isolate m2 48 h bacteria were found to have a very rough surface composited of nano scale granules with very high calcium content supplementary figure s6 suggesting that calcium get adsorbed onto the cell surface which may potentially lead to crystallization and caco3 growth these calcium nanogranule layer on the cell surface is quite thick as it made the cells look twice as big as their original size after further incubation of the same sample spherical precipitates with diameters higher than 10 µm were observed with highly calcified bacterial cells on their surface fig 7e co occurrence of morphological variated crystals by the same bacterial isolate were also observed for sphingobium limneticum especially in isolate s4 fig 7j k l but it seemed that the morphological differences represented different stages during a phase transition from vaterite the spherical shape to calcite rhombohedral shape also the role of bacteria in crystal shaping seems to be different in the three different stages in the early stage fig 7j many bacterial cells were found on the surface of the spherical crystal but in the intermediate stage fig 7k much less bacterial cells could be observed on the rather smooth crystal surface and cavities that resemble the bacterial shapes were found at the edge of the rhombohedron in the last stage dense biofilm aggregated only at the two vertices of the smooth surface crystal different crystal morphologies could also be caused by different bacterial isolates even though spherical shaped caco3 crystals produced by the isolate m1 and m2 of the micrococcus luteus looked similar they were still slightly different from each other the crystal of m2 fig 7e had a much more regular spherical shape than the ones in m1 fig 7c possibly because the crystal of m2 grew by layers but those of m1 grew by aggregation for the isolate m3 the caco3 crystal had a peanut shape ca 50 µm and individual cells were observed on the crystal surface instead of the biofilm similarily shaped vaterite was reported in ammonia solution by proteus mirabilis chen et al 2009 noticeably calcified individual bacterial cells were not so commonly found in the samples of sphingobium limneticum as the ones of micrococcus luteus instead cavities of bacterial shape were more often observed on the surface of crystals produced by the sphingobium species illustrating that the surface of gram positive micrococcus luteus interacts with calcium very differently compared to the gram negative sphingobium species fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 role of bacteria in caco3 precipitation and crystal morphology we hypothesize that bacteria play an important role in mediating caco3 precipitation which can also potentially explain scale formation in drinking water pipes in undersaturated conditions to examine this hypothesis the caco3 precipitating behavior of two drinking water isolates were characterized our investigation suggests that bacterial activities play a key role in the formation of calcium carbonate in terms of creating favorable precipitation conditions shaping the crystal morphology and crystal phase regulating the start of precipitation in this study all caco3 precipitations observed started on the surface of bacterial cells possibly because cell metabolism creates favorable precipitating conditions in a highly local manner generally to initiate the caco3 precipitation process a local supersaturation of calcium and carbonate ions needs to be reached first then a hydrated calcium carbonate precursor acc that consists of dynamically ordered liquid like oxyanion polymers or dollops is formed before an anhydrous final polymorph vaterite aragonite calcite can develop gebauer and cölfen 2011 tlili et al 2006 in addition to the basic requirements such as the availability of calcium and carbonate other environmental factors such as ph and available nucleation sites determine whether the precipitation dehydration process is thermodynamically feasible tlili et al 2006 most often bacterial cells assist the precipitation process by increasing the ph the carbonate concentration and or by providing nucleation sites hammes et al 2002 for instance the ca2 proton pump and negatively charged surface polymers e g carboxyl groups in the polysaccharides allow calcium enrichment on the cell surface or the extracellular polymeric substances eps structures around the cells the breakdown of organic carbon and nitrogen can result in an increase in bicarbonate and ammonia concentration which in turn can increase the local ph and provide bicarbonate castanier et al 1999 hammes et al 2002 in turn the chemicals species and environment required for precipitation of calcium carbonate are all best available on cell surface the two species studied here however appeared to have very different mechanisms to create such a favorable condition for the calcium carbonate precipitation for sphingobium limneticum this metabolism involves ammonia production which is a common way for aerobic heterotrophic mcp bacteria to modify the environmental ph while many mcp metabolisms are anaerobic or photosynthetic currently there are only two reported mcp metabolisms that involve ammonium production namely ureolysis and deamination of amino acids zhu and dittrich 2016 in this study all bacterial isolates were urease negative which meant that the ammonia production observed from sphingobium limneticum was caused by ammonification the chemical reactions involved in the mcp mechanisms are given here as eqs 1 5 and are discussed in detail below 1 c 3 h 7 n o 2 3 o 2 n h 3 3 c o 2 2 h 2 o 2 n h 3 h 2 o nh 4 o h 3 c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 h hco 3 4 co n h 2 2 h 2 o 2 n h 3 c o 2 5 c a 2 hco 3 cac o 3 h theoretically 1 mol of amino acid can produce 1 mol of ammonia and 3 mol of carbon dioxide eq 1 which further equilibrate in water to form ammonium hydroxide ions eq 2 and bicarbonate eq 3 the formation of ammonium causes the rise of ph and therefore induce the formation of caco3 eq 5 hence the production of ammonia should be directly proportional to the caco3 precipitated however in the results of this study regarding sphingobium limneticum s3 the cell growth followed an exponential pattern whilst the increase of ammonium was linear interestingly the caco3 precipitation followed the pattern of the bacterial growth which leveled off as it entered the stationary phase despite the continued increase of ammonium and ph similar observations were also reported in a previous study on ureolytical calcium carbonate precipitation induced by bacillus species in a urea and calcium enriched nutrient broth at 25 c stocks fischer et al 1999 noticeably the hydrolysis of one urea molecule actually produces 2 ammonia ions eq 4 which means that ureolysis can increase the ph twice as efficiently as deamination hammes et al 2003 it seems that the cell concentration is the limiting factor for the mcp process rather than ph regulation this assumption is corroborated by the fact that even when the ph in the bulk solution is high only the cell surface environment can provide a favorable condition for caco3 precipitation besides the mcp metabolisms reported in the literature so far there might be other unknown mcp mechanisms meier et al 2017 found that some groundwater bacteria that acidify their immediate environment can also induce mcp indicating that increasing the ph may not be as necessary as conventionally expected for mcp meier et al 2017 in our study the ph values of micrococcus luteus m1 did not increase much during the whole incubation period and only a small and short increase in ammonium concentration was observed however caco3 precipitates could still be found under microscope intriguingly the bacterial cells observed in early stage of the incubation were fully covered with nano scale crystals on their surface a similar observation was reported when micrococcus luteus was used for copper recovery from wastewater through biosorption letnik et al 2017 it is therefore possible that here caco3 precipitation was induced by the biosorption of calcium ions to our knowledge the precipitation of caco3 through biosorption alone has not been discussed previously but the biosorption of a bacterial cell in general has been extensively discussed in the past decades for instance extracted cell walls of bacillus subtilis were found to capture a wide range of metals such as ca2 mn2 zn2 from aqueous solution and various functional groups such as amino carboxyl phosphoryl hydroxyl groups were found to play an important role in the metal uptake beveridge et al 1997 beveridge and murray 1976 fein et al 1997 in addition the electronegative nature of bacterial cell membranes may also contribute to the biosorption capability of micrococcus luteus schultze lam et al 1996 even though the mcp mechanism of specific micrococcus luteus species is not well understood the strong interactions between micrococcus luteus and calcium and other metal ions have also been reported and applied in different industries for instance micrococcus luteus has been used for monumental stone conservation without identification of an mcp metabolism tiano et al 1999 benka coker ekundayo 1998 suggested that micrococcus luteus has a high tolerance to the presence of different metals benka coker and ekundayo 1998 moreover micrococcus luteus showed the highest biosorption capability for the recovery of gold copper thorium and uranium in aqueous environments compared to a wide range of bacterial species letnik et al 2017 levchenko et al 2001 nakajima and tsuruta 2002 wong et al 2001 therefore precipitation induced by biosorption alone might be a novel mechanism responsible for the formation of caco3 especially explaining the mcp observed for micrococcus luteus in our study though further investigations will be required to obtain additional evidence in addition to the discussion of biochemical metabolisms the role of bacteria in mcp can be also reflected by their influence on crystal morphologies there has been a continuous discussion on whether the polymorphs of mcp are isolate specific or environment specific in some cases different bacterial isolates produce very different crystal morphologies or even different polymorphs anbu et al 2016 while in the other cases these factors are only subject to different environmental conditions such as ph substrate calcium supply or ca2 mg2 ratio meier et al 2017 rodriguez navarro et al 2012 sánchez navas et al 2009 zhao and zhao 2017 in this study specifically only spherical vaterite crystals were found in the three different micrococcus luteus isolates where ph change was minimal during the cell growth this is possibly due to the fact that eps can carry negative charges or contain hydrophobic area which can interact or further stabilize the intermediate product of caco3 crystallization product such as vaterite e g vaterite enyedi et al 2020 consequently without increased environmental ph the supersaturation of caco3 could not overcome the energy barrier for the next polymorph however in the case of the sphingobium isolates where the ph continued to increase until reaching a value of ph 8 both vaterite and calcite including a transitional phase between the two states were found in the sample therefore it is reasonable to argue that polymorphs depend on the chemical regulation and biopolymer production by bacteria conversely variations in morphology were found among the vaterite crystals produced by the different isolates for instance the vaterite produced by coccus shaped micrococcus luteus tended to be spherical while the ones of rod shaped sphingobium tended to be elliptical it seems that these morphological variations are related to the shape of the cells and their growth pattern another highlight of this study is the observation that the microbial caco3 precipitation behavior of the two isolates is density dependent traditionally mcp mediated by heterotrophic bacteria has been described as a passive bio mineralization process where the formation of caco3 is induced as a byproduct resulting from the ammonia and carbon dioxide production which also emphasis a lack of control and regulation by bacteria on the process however in this study very little calcium was deposited on the bacterial surface in the early stage of bacterial growth fig 4 5 and no other precipitation e g on the surface of substrate or on the surface of plastic vessel was observed in the early stage of bacterial growth when ammonia and carbonate production had already started in the case of micrococcus luteus such a phenomenon was even more obvious since only carbon and nitrogen were identified at cell surfaces possibly because the surface polymers that adsorb ca2 could only be expressed at a certain cell density in general it is known that bacteria can perform quorum sensing which means that they can sense the cell density through different environmental cues and modify their metabolic behavior accordingly norris et al 1996 e g if cell density reaches high levels the cells in the community starts to produce more biofilm components such eps minogue et al 2005 consequently if mcp only takes place after the bacterial numbers reach a certain concentration it is tempting to speculate the active role of bacteria in the caco3 precipitation with an evolutionary benefit even though the specific molecules that interact with ca2 still need to be identified since the two distinctive mcp metabolisms showed a density dependent feature the natural selection favoring the trait might be strong lately the discussion that mcp is actively regulated by bacteria has started among scientists as relevant evidence slowly piles up dade robertson et al 2017 keren paz and kolodkin gal 2020 another study has also reported that mutations in urease gene ure a c eps esph amyloid like fibres gene tasa and acidic exopolysaccharides production gene ywq c f operon in bacillus subtilis strongly inhibit mcp on agar plates oppenheimer shaanan et al 2016 others showed that the special biofilm structure caused by presence of calcite crystals can create a protective barrier against disinfectants keren paz et al 2018 a benefit during inter specific resource competition has also been observed for pseudomonas species li et al 2016 nevertheless mcp does not seem to benefit bacteria in an individual state with the risks of cell encrustation and cell death as many calcified cell cocoons have been repeatedly observed in different studies anbu et al 2016 castanier et al 1999 including ours this adverse effect of mcp may explain the caco3 free state of bacteria at lower cell densities 4 2 caco3 precipitating activities of drinking water bacteria in this first study to examine mcp activities by drinking water bacteria the scope was limited to aerobic heterotrophic conditions however the two bacterial species already exhibit distinctive mcp metabolisms other calcium precipitating autotrophic metabolisms such as methane oxidation and sulfate reduction have also been detected in drinking water system ling et al 2016 seth and edyvean 2006 zhu and dittrich 2016 also even though we provided a higher nutrient concentrations in the medium than normally available in a drinking water environment other studies that simulated the actual conditions in drinking water systems also suggested the involvement of bacteria in the scaling process for instance liu et al 2017 observed distinctive ca2 capture performance by different in situ drinking water biofilms that differed in microbial composition suggesting the probable involvement of microbial activities in scale formation another example is the study by shen et al 2018 where softened groundwater hardness 49 mg l ph 7 5 7 8 was directly used to grow biofilm on pvc coupons in a cdc biofilm reactor for 10 months with total organic carbon concentrations 1 1 6 mg l comparable to the drinking water environment 1 3 mg l zlatanović et al 2017 vaterite caco3 was observed together with a high content of protein from the biofilm formed which indicated the role of biofilm in caco3 formation in the natural environment especially in the ones in under saturated conditions which are generally found in drinking water systems where the calcium concentration is lower than 120 mg l and ph stays neutral peng et al 2010 to further confirm the role of biofilm in mcp under low nutrient conditions more studies in a drinking water simulated set up need to be performed conclusions in conclusion this study characterizes both chemically and microscopically the development of microbial calcium carbonate precipitation by two bacterial species native to drinking water two distinctive density dependent mcp metabolisms amino acids deamination and biosorption were identified for the two

16799,the present study investigated the performance in nitrogen removal and associated nitrogen transformation processes in seven mesocosms fed with saline water 0 to 30 to simulate tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cws the highly effective and steady removal of nh4 n 84 74 averagely was obtained at various salinities while the rates varied from 6 34 to 89 19 and 22 54 to 87 48 for no3 n and total nitrogen tn respectively overall nitrogen removal efficiencies were greater at lower salinities molecular biological analyses verified the co occurrence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and nitrification in the mesocosms reportedly contributing to nitrogen removal in tf cws the absolute copy numbers of nitrogen functional genes and total bacterial 16s rrna were 2 54 103 7 35 107 and 3 21 107 7 82 109 copies g 1 dg dry gravel respectively with the dominant phyla i e chloroflexi proteobacteria actinobacteriota cyanobacteria and firmicutes accounting for over 80 of the sequences the relative abundances of the genera related to nitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes i e denitrification anammox and dnra varied from 0 16 to 0 89 and from 3 66 to 11 59 respectively while quantitative relationships confirmed nh4 n transformation rate was jointly controlled by amoa hzsb nxra and nrfa and no3 n removal rate by nirs nosz narg qnorb and nxra these findings may shed light on quantitative molecular mechanisms for nitrogen removal in tf cws for the saline water treatment providing a sustainable solution to nitrogen pollution problem in the estuary ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords salinity gradients nitrogen transformation functional gene community structure tidal flow constructed wetlands 1 introduction in recent years human induced eutrophication has attracted great attention worldwide due to its threat to aquatic ecosystems in particular estuarine systems sun et al 2017 in china the water quality of the yangtze river estuary has been seriously deteriorated due to the rapid urbanization and industrial development in the yangtze river delta in last few decades the illegal discharge of domestic industrial wastewater fertilizer overuse and construction within floodplains have been the sources of water pollution while nitrogen is considered a major contributor to eutrophication problems in the estuarine waters and adjacent seas chen et al 2012 nevertheless the combination of nitrogen pollution and high salinity found in the estuary has posed new challenges for conventional treatment technologies constructed wetlands cws have been widely utilized for wastewater treatment for its great performance and cost effectiveness and considered environmentally friendly rai et al 2013 these systems are divided into two main types horizontal flow constructed wetlands hf cws and vertical flow constructed wetlands vf cws vf cws provide a suitable environment for nitrification process by increasing the oxygen transfer ability and further enhance the removal of ammonium yet the removal rate of tn in vf cws is always deficient which is mainly due to the limitations of denitrification process on the contrary hf cws could provide appropriate conditions for denitrification process but suffer from insufficient oxygen supply in beds therefore novel technologies should be developed to create favorable living and metabolic conditions for microorganisms associated with nitrogen cycling at present tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cws are selected to treat saline water due to its ability to provide advantageous habitats for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms tidal flow implies a repeated operation in which cws are repeatedly filled with water and then drained in this process oxygen will diffuse into the beds and then be squeezed out continuously facilitating the metabolism of inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and organic matters previous studies reported that tf cws achieved high removal efficiencies for tn no3 n nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod with the values ranging from 77 51 95 35 94 82 99 22 72 15 80 22 and 89 33 97 46 respectively zhi and ji 2014 zhi et al 2015 in addition to tidal cycles storm surges reductions in rainfall and run off rising sea levels and temperatures anthropogenic disruption of natural drainage routes and mariculture effluents might all increase the salinity of tidal wetlands in a natural setting chyan et al 2017 as the above mentioned issues are becoming the new normal the application of artificial tidal wetlands to the removal of nitrogen from saline wastewater is on the rise globally it was reported that a vf cw could achieve high removal efficiencies of tn and nh4 n 90 39 99 82 for the saline sewage treatment 18 salinity by heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying bacterial communities where obligate halophilic and aerobic denitrifiers zobellella were dominant fu et al 2018 a study investigated the substrate enzyme activities and nitrogen removal rates in vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands for the mariculture wastewater treatment and the results revealed that high salinity levels i e 29 and 36 could enhance the activity of enzymes and nitrogen removal rates li et al 2018 besides liang et al 2017 prepared a review to demonstrate the latest knowledge on the utilization of constructed wetlands for treating saline wastewater in which the removal efficiencies of inorganic nitrogen nh4 n and dissolved organic carbon doc decreased from 78 to 56 from 98 to 83 and from 91 to 71 with the salinity increasing from 0 to 30 wu et al 2008 as a major challenge salinity can potentially have adverse effects on macrophytes and associated microorganisms in various habitats by reducing nutrient uptake exposing tissues to toxic ions and increasing osmotic stress chyan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 it has been reported that high sodium chloride levels could interfere with cellular processes of plants by disturbing mitosis and altering enzyme activity janousek and folger 2013 while sodium concentration would affect photosynthetic rate biomass evapotranspiration stomatal conductance root shoot ratio and seed germination bai et al 2014 as a result salinity would not only reduce the tolerance of some wetland macrophytes to water depth due to the inhibited growth chyan et al 2017 but also induce a shift in the plant composition as salinity increases above 10 janousek and folger 2013 in this regard salt tolerant plants halophytes would have greater potential for application in the removal of excess nitrogen from saline water previous research also suggests that salinity increase would impact microbial activity related to nitrogen removal ammonia oxidation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa demonstrates varying responses to salinity in various habitats moderate salinity 10 20 was reportedly associated with increased potential nitrification rates and aoa that was more abundant than aob across salinity gradients in the plum island sound estuary bernhard et al 2010 while investigations conducted in other estuaries showed the opposite tendency li et al 2015 santos et al 2018 with higher abundances of aob occurring at higher salinity levels indicating that ammonia oxidizing microbes possessed different salinity adaptation levels as well as niche preferences increasing salinity can influence nitrification process directly by restricting the nitrifiers fitness and indirectly by constraining the oxygen availability which can further impact the growth and metabolism of nitrifiers zhou et al 2017 the nitrifiers appear to metabolize optimally at the median salinity but would be inhibited if salinity exceeds 20 wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 however denitrification exhibits inconsistent relationships with salinity denitrifiers were found to be negatively associated with salinities of 0 40 in certain estuaries whereas no association was detected with salinities between 2 and 30 in other places fear et al 2005 giblin et al 2010 salinity can also regulate denitrification process by changing the accessibility of organic matter which is important for heterotrophic organisms franklin et al 2017 thus the influence of salinity on nitrification could alter the nitrate availability resulting in the variation of denitrification pathway wang et al 2018 furthermore dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra is reportedly favored over denitrification under high salinity conditions that can be found in marine and coastal ecosystems where sulfides are abundant leading to the competition between dnra and denitrification for nitrate giblin et al 2013 wang et al 2018 meanwhile previous reports suggested salinity could also exhibit a vital impact on anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox lin et al 2021 phylogenetically six anammox bacterial genera have been discovered so far including candidatus anammoximicrobium candidatus scalindua candidatus anammoxoglobus candidatus brocadia candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia as the geographic distributions of these organisms demonstrate that they have species specific or genus specific habitats zhang et al 2020a in general candidatus scalindua mainly exists in marine ecosystems able to tolerate high salinity while the other five genera are normally found in freshwater habitats and more sensitive to salinity variations zhang et al 2020c however few efforts have been made to address the influence of salinity on nitrogen removal in tidal flow constructed wetlands with little information on the underlying molecular mechanism that regulates the nitrogen transformation process for saline water treatment the lack of quantitative links between nitrogen functional genes and nitrogen removal processes limits the ability to reliably predict long term effluent quality and to optimize treatment processes the overall goal of this study was to illustrate the impact of salinity on nitrogen removal in tf cws and understand the quantitative molecular mechanisms in nitrogen transformation processes specifically the following five aims were pursued 1 to evaluate the treatment performance under different salinity levels 2 to determine the absolute abundance of nitrogen functional genes 3 to reveal the quantitative links between functional genes and nitrogen transformation processes 4 to identify the key functional genes regulating nitrogen removal in artificial tidal wetlands for saline water treatment and 5 to assess the microbial diversity and community composition associated with nitrogen transformation this study would offer a new insight into the nitrogen removal in tidal flow constructed wetlands used for saline water treatment providing a sustainable solution to nitrogen pollution problems in estuarine coastal and marine ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 artificial tidal wetlands setup and operation seven pvc mesocosms were set up as lab scale tf cws in the greenhouse on the campus of shanghai jiao tong university sjtu shanghai china n31 2 5 46 e121 26 25 14 the mesocosm had a total volume of 96 l l w h 40 cm 20 cm 120 cm with a working volume of 50 l initial porosity 52 08 each mesocosm was filled with a 10 cm layer of coarse gravel ø 8 12 mm as a water distribution zone at the bottom and an 80 cm layer of lava rock ø 5 10 mm as a treatment zone fig s1 the present study was to simulate the situation of salt marsh wetland in yangtze river estuary china which was dominated by the plants of phragmites australis and spartina alterniflora among the seven mesocosms therefore three were planted with p australis pa 100 plants m2 three were planted with s alterniflora sa 100 plants m2 and the remaining were unplanted np in order to collect microbial samples without disturbing the whole substrate a perforated pvc pipe l d 100 cm 3 cm was filled with the same substrate materials and wrapped with a nylon mesh before being vertically installed in the center of each mesocosm based on our previous research on the water quality of the yangtze river estuary zhang et al 2021 each mesocosm was fed with synthetic water a combination of tap water nacl kh2po4 kno3 and nh4cl sigma aldrich st louis mo to give initial concentrations of 0 5 1 5 and 0 2 mg l for nh4 n no3 n and total phosphorus tp respectively compared with the salinity range of 10 20 considered most favorable for s alterniflora the optimal salinity for p australis is reportedly about 3 but it would be stressed if the salinity exceeds 6 gao et al 2017 in this study therefore the p australis mesocosms were exposed to three salinity levels 0 pa0 4 pa4 and 8 pa8 throughout the experimental period while the s alterniflora mesocosms operated at salinities of 8 sa8 15 sa15 and 30 sa30 and the salinity level remained at 8 np8 for the unplanted mesocosm the synthetic water was prepared every two days in a feeding tank which was then pumped into the mesocosms through flumes in the distribution layer the experiment began on april 1 2019 and lasted for a total of 457 days including a start up stage 91 days for the development of biofilms and plant roots in the substrate and an operational stage 366 days that ended on june 30 2020 throughout the experimental period the mesocosms received intermittent flows and were drained every 48 h using a metering pump and programmable timer to create flood and drain cycles 24 h fill 24 h drain the most effective flow regimes for nitrogen removal based on our pre tests fig s2 in the wet phase the mesocosms were filled with synthetic water for 24 h as the substrate and plant roots were exposed to the air for 24 h during the dry phase after the water was completely drained from the mesocosms leading to a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 32 m3 m2 d 2 2 sample collection and determination water samples were collected from the mesocosms weekly and were analyzed immediately at the analytical testing center at shanghai jiao tong university the ph temperature t redox potential eh and dissolved oxygen do were determined in situ with a multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi usa with influent values varying from 6 75 to 7 55 from 16 6 c to 31 7 c from 288 1 mv to 372 3 mv and from 3 71 mg l to 10 56 mg l respectively suggesting the influent parameters changed with the seasonality no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were evaluated by a uv 1800 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan and total nitrogen tn and total organic carbon toc were measured by a multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany the influent concentrations of no2 n tn and toc were 0 010 mg l 2 11 3 16 mg l and 2 55 8 41 mg l respectively while no2 n was not detected in the effluent all variables were analyzed based on standard analytical methods sun et al 2019 microbial samples from the seven mesocosms were sampled for molecular analyses at the end of the experiment by extracting the pvc pipe the gravel and rock were removed from the pipe and then thoroughly mixed to create one homogeneous sample to properly represent the whole substrate in the mesocosm the samples were stored at 80 c for subsequent dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing the power soil dna isolation kits were utilized to extract and purify the genomic dna from samples omega usa and the extracted dna was determined by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and placed at 80 c until use the primer pairs 338f 806r were used to amplify bacterial 16s rrna gene zhang et al 2018 and the pcr conditions and primer sequences utilized in this study were listed in table s1 subsequently the pcr products were sequenced by majorbio shanghai china using the illumina miseq pe300 platform and the sequencing data were analyzed by qiime software zhang et al 2020b meanwhile the ambiguous and low quality reads were removed and raw sequences were demultiplexed the frame shift errors were detected by hmm frame algorithm along with hidden markov models of various genes from the fungene database and sequences with these errors were discarded fish et al 2013 then filtered sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus according to 97 similarity with the pick otu py function using usearch method the chimeric and singletons sequences were discarded during the otu picking finally equal sequence depth was applied to rarefy every sample for downstream analyses based on the smallest sequences number among all samples 2 4 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr quantitative analysis was performed on the bacterial 16s rrna gene and target fragments of the nine functional genes bacterial ammonia monooxygenase aob amoa archaeal ammonia monooxygenase aoa amoa nitrite oxidoreductase nxra dnra functional gene nrfa membrane bound nitrate reductase narg nitrous oxide reductase nosz nitrite reductase nirs nitric oxide reductase qnorb and hydrazine synthase β subunit hzsb all primers listed in table s1 were synthesized by a company majorbio shanghai china which were diluted to a concentration of 10 µmol l the qpcr was employed on a real time pcr detection system in final 10 µl volume reaction mixtures consisting of the following components 5 µl 2 sybr green qpcr master mix 0 05 u ml taq dna polymerase 2 gotaq flexi buffer 0 4 mm dntps 4 mm mgcl2 and sybr green dye 1 µl template dna 1 10 ng 3 6 µl sterile water and 0 4 µl forward and reverse primers 0 4 µm furthermore qpcr was conducted by a three step thermal cycling program and the parameters and protocol for each target gene are listed in table s1 each qpcr amplification was employed in 40 cycles and followed by several analyses for melting curve sterile water was utilized as a negative control and the qpcr data were normalized to copies g 1 dg the plasmids containing specific total bacterial 16s rrna and nine functional genes i e nosz narg qnorb nirs aoa amoa hzsb nrfa nxra and aob amoa were manufactured by a company majorbio shanghai china the plasmids were diluted to produce a series of 10 fold levels and then utilized for qpcr standard curves meanwhile the r2 value exceeded 0 95 for each standard curve suggesting linear relationships over the concentration ranges utilized in this study and the amplification efficiencies varied from 90 to 106 98 on average 2 5 statistical analyses the effluent and influent levels of toc tn no3 n and nh4 n along with surface area a 0 4 m 0 2 m and hydraulic retention time hrt 48 h were applied to calculate nitrogen transformation rates g m3 d removal efficiencies and mass removal rates g m2 d the normality of the data was determined by k s test using spss 19 0 software package and the results show that the p values were greater than 0 05 revealing the normality of the data pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to reveal the relationships among parameters i e water quality variables microbial abundance and alpha diversity using spss 19 0 software package stepwise regression models spss 19 0 usa were constructed to evaluate the quantitative response relationships between nitrogen functional genes and nitrogen transformation rates the t test and analysis of variance anova were applied to demonstrate the differences among parameters the total bacterial 16s rrna sequences were grouped into various otus based on 97 similarity by mothur software which would be utilized to determine the alpha diversity chao1 shannon good s coverage otu numbers and simpson the r software was used to conduct heatmap venn circos and ternary analyses the canonical correlation analysis cca was carried out by canoco software and principal coordinate analysis pcoa was assessed using r software all statistical differences were considered as the significance level of p 0 05 and the figures were analyzed by origin 8 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of salinity on nitrogen removal the nitrogen removal performance of the artificial tidal wetland mesocosms was investigated under combined conditions of plant species and influent salinity levels during the operation a stable nh4 n removal efficiency of approximately 84 74 was obtained for all the mesocosms fig 1 among which no significant differences were found t test p 0 05 based on the removal rates retention time and bottom area of the mesocosm the nh4 n transformation rate was calculated to be 0 24 g m3 d fig s3 which was also higher than the values revealed by zhang et al 2021 the enhanced treatment performance in nh4 n removal might be due to the facilitated nitrification process as previous research suggested that the nitrifying bacteria would cease functioning at the do of below 0 5 mg l wang et al 2015b high do levels of 3 71 10 56 mg l and 0 73 5 61 mg l observed in influents and effluents respectively fig s4 indicates the sufficient oxygen supply for efficient biotransformation of nh4 n to either no2 n or no3 n zhi and ji 2014 nonetheless greater variation was observed in no3 n removal among the mesocosms 6 34 89 19 fig 1 at the salinity of 8 the no3 n removal efficiency in np8 6 34 9 28 was significantly lower than that of pa8 38 54 82 27 and sa8 49 94 77 60 t test p 0 01 showing the crucial role of plants in tidal flow constructed wetlands as plants could not only remove inorganic n particularly nh4 n and no3 n through active and direct uptake but also facilitate microbially mediated nitrogen cycling processes including denitrification dnra nitrification and anammox zhang et al 2021 for p australis mesocosms the no3 n removal efficiency of pa4 55 39 89 19 was slightly but significantly higher than that of pa0 37 02 61 32 and pa8 t test p 0 05 while significantly greater values were obtained for s alterniflora mesocosms sa8 and sa15 57 28 75 83 than sa30 12 77 18 84 t test p 0 01 the results suggest the mesocosms tended to remove more no3 n at lower salinities which agrees with previous studies chyan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2017 found that high salinity obviously had an inhibitory impact on plant uptake of n as well as the metabolic activity of microorganisms associated with nitrogen cycles meanwhile no significant difference was found in no3 n removal efficiency among seasons probably because temperatures 16 6 c to 31 7 c recorded in the greenhouse as shown in fig s4 fell in the metabolic temperature range 15 0 35 0 c reported for nitrogen transformation organisms wang et al 2015a wang et al 2016 the no3 n transformation rate varied between 0 07 0 67 g m3 d for all mesocosms fig s3 whereas no no2 n accumulation was observed possibly due to efficient nitrification and denitrification processes nitrification includes two oxidation steps oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n by ammonia oxidizing microorganisms and oxidation of no2 n to no3 n by nitrite oxidizing microbes as the former grows almost twice as slowly as the latter chyan et al 2017 as to denitrification no2 n is reduced approximately 1 6 times faster than no3 n chyan et al 2017 hence it is reasonable to find no2 n absent from our artificial tidal wetlands mesocosms for tn removal efficiencies of 22 54 87 48 were achieved for the mesocosms fig 1 resembling the variation in no3 n meanwhile tn transformation rates of 0 34 0 94 g m3 d and tn removal rates of 0 21 0 60 g m2 d were obtained for all the mesocosms fig s3 maltais landry et al 2009 achieved the tn removal rate of 0 80 g m2 d in aerated cws as 0 70 1 21 g m2 d was reported by liu et al 2013 for non aerated vertical flow constructed wetlands vf cws and 0 45 to 9 56 g m2 d found in other similar studies zhi et al 2015 compared with the previous studies mentioned above therefore our results suggest the tf cws displayed operational flexibility and promising performance for n removal both no3 n and nh4 n with lower capital costs and less required space for the same treatment level overall these results reveal that salinity played a crucial role in regulating the n cycling in artificial tidal wetlands with increasing concern about the threats of salinity intrusion related to climate change and rising sea level 3 2 nitrogen removal mechanisms 3 2 1 diversity of bacterial 16s rrna sequences a total of 299 392 bacterial 16s rrna sequences were retrieved from the seven artificial tidal wetland mesocosms pa0 43 471 pa4 40 765 pa8 31 655 sa8 41 698 sa15 45 790 sa30 46 920 and np8 49 093 which were grouped into 3696 otus table s2 the coverage estimate was 0 98 0 99 demonstrating that these results were reliable for otu numbers there were no significant differences among various treatments 1559 2715 as chao1 richness estimate varied from 1568 35 to 2731 00 simpson diversity indices were 0 0059 0 0637 with shannon diversity indices varying from 4 52 to 6 13 no significant differences were found in the values of the above mentioned indices either among different salinity levels or between two plant species previous studies illustrated that salinity had a certain impact on the microbial alpha diversity in the wetlands and differences were found between p australis and s alterniflora systems behera et al 2017 liang et al 2017 which is inconsistent with the results obtained in this study which needs to be further explored for the specific reasons the venn diagram shows that 1194 otus were common for the seven mesocosms while there were 419 otus unique for s1 pa0 and pa4 421 for s2 pa8 sa8 and np8 and 276 for s3 sa15 and sa30 fig 2 based on the salinity gradients of influent water the seven microbial samples were divided into three groups namely s1 s2 and s3 representing the name of each group however earlier studies have illustrated that unique otus played a vital role in determining the cluster variation of microbes in the ecosystem lin et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 3 2 2 community structure of bacterial 16s rrna gene to reveal the microbes associated with nitrification denitrification dnra and anammox the relative abundance was determined by high throughput sequencing analyses at phylum and genus levels of bacterial 16s rrna gene in artificial tidal wetland mesocosms proteobacteria actinobacteriota chloroflexi cyanobacteria and firmicutes accounted for over 80 of the relative abundance while proteobacteria was the dominated phylum 21 50 39 95 followed by chloroflexi 10 10 24 49 actinobacteriota 7 05 28 04 firmicutes 5 65 30 49 and cyanobacteria 1 36 30 66 fig 2 obviously the relative abundance of phylum firmicutes in np was much higher than that in pa and sa this phenomenon might be explained by the fact that a majority of microorganisms in the phylum firmicutes could produce spores to resist extreme conditions such as dehydration high salinity and nutrient deprivation fimlaid and shen 2015 fang et al 2018 compared with the other six wetlands the np8 system had no plants to supply nutrients so it might have created less favorable conditions for microbes screening out microbes with strong resistance further research is needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms besides many microorganisms in this phylum can participate in the nitrogen cycle and their metabolic type is heterotrophic such as bacillus and clostridium fimlaid and shen 2015 fang et al 2018 moreover heatmap analysis also exhibited the similar bacterial compositions and the phylum planctomycetes were discovered with the relative abundance ranging from 0 43 to 1 75 fig 2 showing the potential to perform anammox process zhang et al 2020c meanwhile the relative abundance of this phylum in np was slightly higher than that in pa and sa it is well known that a majority of microbes in the phylum are anaerobic and show an autotrophic metabolic pattern zhang et al 2021 therefore the presence of plants may have a negative impact on these microorganisms as plants could release oxygen and organic matter into the wetland system through their roots based on the circos and ternary analyses the relative abundance of the phylum actinobacteriota gradually decreased with increasing salinity while the phylum cyanobacteria displayed the opposite trend fig 3 this might be explained by the fact that actinobacteriota has lower tolerance to high salinity and cyanobacteria that usually cause red tides in the ocean have greater adaptability to salinity variation wang et al 2018 the phylum detected in this study included a series of microbes involved in n transformations and the relative abundance of the associated genera were shown in table 1 three genera were discovered for nitrification nitrosomonas nitrospina and nitrospira while nitrosomonas was associated with ammonia oxidization and the other genera were related to nitrite oxidation wang et al 2017 it is noteworthy that nitrospira bacteria were able to carry out complete nitrification directly converting ammonium and nitrite to nitrate i e comammox process daims et al 2015 as to the relative abundances of nitrifying genera the smallest value 0 16 was obtained for sa30 compared to 0 67 0 89 for the other treatments previous research suggested that nitrification could occur over a certain range of salinity 10 20 but would be inhibited at the salinity above this range wang et al 2018 although the relative abundances of nitrosomonas 0 08 0 48 and nitrospira 0 07 0 47 were higher than those of nitrospina 0 01 0 07 all these three genera were detected in different salinity treatments 0 30 which agrees with previous reports that suggested certain nitrifying bacteria could be found at various salinity levels although certain bacteria might adapt to a wider range of salinities such as nitrosomonas and nitrospira wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 according to the high throughput sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna gene a total of 21 denitrifying genera were detected in artificial tidal wetlands such as clostridium flavobacterium pseudomonas etc and there were some noticeable differences found among the seven mesocosms table 1 at 8 salinity the relative abundances in np8 3 56 were much lower than those in pa8 7 33 and sa8 10 98 suggesting the significant role played by plants in tf cws meanwhile the relative abundance of denitrifying genera decreased with increasing salinity in pa and sa mesocosms indicating that high salinity had an inhibitory effect on denitrification processes which is in agreement with previous studies giblin et al 2010 wang et al 2018 the phenomenon can be explained by the reasons as follows firstly high salinity levels may reduce microbial respiration rates in tf cws decreasing the o2 consumption and then restraining the anaerobic denitrifying pathway wang et al 2018 secondly the nitrifying genera possessed the ability to convert nh4 n to no2 n and no3 n providing reaction substrates for denitrification process however the metabolic activity of nitrifying genera reduced at high salinity levels decreasing the no3 n availability for denitrifying genera which would further inhibit the following denitrification process wang et al 2018 it was reported that dnra organisms preferred to live in high salt environments possessing a good tolerance to salinity and this process was first discovered in the marine habitat jahangir et al 2017 in this study certain denitrifying genera were discovered such as clostridium photobacterium and desulfovibrio which were reportedly able to execute dnra process zhang et al 2021 suggesting that dnra obviously might have played a role in no3 n reduction in tf cws which could not be neglected for anammox process only three genera were found candidatus scalindua candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia as the relative abundances of anammox genera were 0 10 0 51 it is clear that the relative abundances of candidatus scalindua increased with salinity in pa and sa mesocosms whereas the other two genera showed the opposite reactions with the decreased abundance at higher salinity levels this might be because candidatus scalindua mainly prospers in the marine environment while candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia mostly prevail in freshwater ecosystems zhang et al 2020a taken together our results suggest anammox process might have play a significant role in the loss of nitrogen and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions although the bacteria related to the process only accounted for a small percentage of total microorganisms in artificial tidal wetland mesocosms the pcoa analysis was used to determine the community structure of total bacteria in the mesocosms with the results showing that the bacterial assemblages were clustered along salinity gradients rather than by plant species fig 4 s1 pa0 and pa4 s2 pa8 sa8 and np8 and s3 sa15 and sa30 this phenomenon confirms that salinity would be the key factor affecting the microbial community composition in artificial tidal wetlands the pc1 and pc2 axes explained 47 80 and 22 95 of the similarity of microbial community structure in different samples respectively to further reveal the relationships between water quality parameters and microbial community cca analysis was conducted based on otu levels the cca1 and cca2 explained 30 64 and 23 59 respectively as shown in fig 4 salinity tn do no3 n nh4 n and toc appeared to be the major factors among the detected water quality parameters specifically toc could serve as a carbon source and electron donor in several microbial pathways such as denitrification and dnra which may be important for the niche separation of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes zhang et al 2021 in this study toc levels varied from 2 55 to 8 41 mg l in the influent compared to 2 19 to 5 17 mg l in the effluent fig s4 3 2 3 dynamics of nitrogen functional genes the absolute copy numbers of bacterial 16s rrna and another nine functional genes involved in nitrogen transformations were evaluated by the corresponding genes abundance via qpcr the absolute abundances of total bacterial 16s rrna gene varied from 3 21 107 to 7 82 109 copies g 1 dg showing significant potential for n removal fig 5 the nxra aob amoa and aoa amoa were applied to determine the number of nitrifiers fig 5 aob amoa abundance 9 97 104 2 35 107 copies g 1 dg was 1 2 magnitude higher than that of aoa amoa 8 98 103 8 79 105 copies g 1 dg t test p 0 01 suggesting that ammonia oxidizing bacteria were the main microbial groups converting nh4 n to no2 n in artificial tidal wetlands zhang et al 2021 the functional gene of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nxra abundance ranged from 4 22 104 to 7 99 106 copies g 1 dg and the copy numbers of anammox bacterial functional gene hzsb were 5 54 103 7 97 105 copies g 1 dg it is worth noting that the absolute abundances of aob amoa and nxra genes were at the same level and the variation trends of these two genes across salinity gradients were similar while the relative abundance of the corresponding genera nitrosomonas aob amoa and nitrospira nxra showed the semblable variation tendency the dnra pathway was quantified by nrfa and the abundance ranged between 7 90 103 and 7 23 105 copies g 1 dg it is noteworthy that the nrfa abundance increased with salinity in the pa and sa mesocosms consistent with the fact that dnra mainly occurs in saline environments zhang et al 2021 collectively these results reveal that the aerobic nh4 n oxidation have played a significant role in nh4 n removal in tf cw mesocosms owing to the higher amoa and nxra abundances than the value of hzsb gene t test p 0 01 the nirs nosz narg and qnorb were used to enumerate denitrifiers fig 5 which executed the four steps of denitrification pathway from no3 n to no2 n narg from no2 n to no nirs from no to n2o qnorb and from n2o to n2 nosz the nirs abundance varied from 7 00 105 to 7 35 107 copies g 1 dg which was much higher than that of narg gene 1 85 104 4 46 106 copies g 1 dg t test p 0 05 which explains why no2 n was not accumulated in the system the nosz gene functioned to convert n2o into n2 as the final step in the denitrification process zhi and ji 2014 the nosz abundance ranged from 8 98 103 to 8 47 105 copies g 1 dg higher than the value of qnorb gene 2 54 103 9 68 104 copies g 1 dg t test p 0 05 suggesting the fully completed denitrification without n2o emissions overall except for nrfa the abundances of the other nine genes decreased with increasing salinity in the pa and sa mesocosms t test p 0 05 as the abundances of these genes were higher in the presence of the plants than their absence t test p 0 05 which adequately reveals the quantitative molecular mechanisms of inorganic nitrogen removal in artificial tidal wetlands under the optimum salinity conditions the absolute abundance of nitrogen cycling functional genes in sa was generally higher than that in pa mainly because these two macrophytes had different strategies for inorganic nitrogen metabolism previous studies demonstrated that p australis was conservative in the utilization of nitrogen and could conserve a fraction of nitrogen in the plant for later use however s alterniflora metabolized all the nitrogen absorbed from the environment which was a consumable nitrogen utilization mode zhao et al 2010 therefore s alterniflora had advantages in growth and metabolism with the addition of nutrients nitrogen which would further promote the mitosis and proliferation of nitrogen cycling microbes in tidal flow constructed wetlands 3 3 quantitative response relationships although the underlying nitrogen functional genes behind each specific nitrogen transformation process are well studied how these functional genes from different processes work together for n removal is still descriptive hence the current study was trying to quantify the response relationships among the genes to link micro scale functional genes with macro scale nitrogen processes to achieve a quantitative understanding of key microbial genes that govern the n removal processes three equations of tn no3 n and nh4 n were established with r2 values varying from 0 989 to 0 999 table 2 the results indicate that aoa amoa aob amoa hzsb 16s rrna nxra hzsb and nrfa 16s rrna were responsible for the nh4 n transformation the first and second variables aoa amoa aob amoa hzsb 16s rrna and nxra hzsb were directly associated with nh4 n removal in the aerobic nitrification and anaerobic anammox ammonia oxidation and were therefore positively related to the nh4 n transformation rate the third variable nrfa 16s rrna was directly associated with nh4 n production in the dnra process and was therefore negatively correlated to the nh4 n transformation rate simply put the nh4 n conversion was collectively determined by nitrification anammox and dnra pathways as the genes amoa and hzsb were major roles in nh4 n oxidation making the greatest contribution in the nh4 n removal in artificial tidal wetland mesocosms zhang et al 2021 the negative quantitative relationships between nrfa 16s rrna and the nh4 n transformation rate suggest that the less studied dnra pathway may have been underestimated by previous research and obviously could increase nh4 n levels in tf cws the no3 n transformation rate was numerically determined by nirs nosz narg qnorb and nxra the level of no3 n reduction was dependent on the ratio of narg nirs qnorb nosz because these four functional genes were directly associated with the reduction of no3 n while the no3 n accumulation rate was positively correlated with the ratio of nxra narg 16s rrna for the nxra gene possessed the ability to convert no2 n to no3 n the tn transformation associated with dnra anammox denitrification and nitrification pathways was collectively determined by aob amoa hzsb aoa amoa nxra nirs nosz 16s rrna and narg nrfa qnorb nxra hzsb nirs at the molecular level the results suggest the co existence of anammox denitrification and nitrification processes could greatly enhance the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and other pollutants in artificial tidal wetlands used for the treatment of saline wastewater while dnra pathway could convert no3 n to nh4 n providing reaction substrates for nitrification and anammox organisms accelerating the conversion and removal of nitrogen in the system here the specific molecular mechanisms are illustrated in fig 6 3 4 environmental implications and significance the pearson correlation analysis was carried out to determine the relationships between the microbial diversity and abundance and the water quality parameters our results suggest that salinity nh4 n no3 n and tn were significantly correlated with bacterial diversity and functional genes abundance p 0 05 table s3 and table s4 while the inorganic nitrogen was negatively related to the absolute abundance of amoa nosz hzsb and nrfa as reaction substrates in n cycles nh4 n could be utilized by nitrification and anammox whereas no3 n should have a significant impact on denitrification and dnra cheng et al 2016 shan et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 although ph has been considered one of the significant factors affecting biological processes saeed and sun 2012 no relationship was observed between ph and microbes in the current study since nitrification would consume alkalinity a substantial drop in ph would occur with significant nitrification chyan et al 2017 nitrification is reportedly more efficient at ph 7 2 but would be depressed at ph 6 0 chyan et al 2017 saeed and sun 2012 however denitrification appears to be constrained at ph 8 0 or ph 6 0 but would be expected to be greatest in the ph range 7 0 8 0 chyan et al 2013 since the ph values varied from 7 19 to 7 96 during the operation no significant depression in biological activities was observed in artificial tidal wetland mesocosms although effluent nitrogen could be easily monitored and analyzed the data alone would not be enough to accurately predict the dynamic variations of water quality over the long run without insights into the quantitative molecular mechanisms that govern the removal pathways in this study the equations with functional gene data are crucial for an in depth understanding of these mechanisms as the insights obtained from these equations will improve engineering applications via incorporating various parameters of functional genes into the design of a more efficient treatment system for nitrogen removal as a large amount of inorganic nitrogen is still being discharged into rivers and lakes ending up in the estuary and nearby coastal waters causing eutrophication and algae blooms in saline ecosystems wang et al 2018 which makes it more important to address the environmental implications and nitrogen removal mechanisms in artificial tidal wetlands used for treating polluted saline water 4 conclusions due to the lower performance of conventional treatment systems in nitrogen removal from saline water the current study was to develop a more efficient system by testing seven artificial tidal wetland mesocosms at various salinity levels molecular biological analyses verify the co existence of dnra denitrification anammox and nitrification in the mesocosms which could collectively contribute to the development of nitrogen removal quantitative relationships also confirm that nh4 n transformation rate was jointly controlled by amoa hzsb nxra and nrfa while no3 n removal rate was collectively determined by nirs nosz narg qnorb and nxra the main pathways limiting tn transformation rate were the second step of denitrification and first step of nitrification all these results would help develop an efficient natural treatment system to protect estuarine ecosystems from water pollution a problem that is worsened by saltwater intrusion caused by overuse of groundwater and sea level rise declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments this

16799,the present study investigated the performance in nitrogen removal and associated nitrogen transformation processes in seven mesocosms fed with saline water 0 to 30 to simulate tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cws the highly effective and steady removal of nh4 n 84 74 averagely was obtained at various salinities while the rates varied from 6 34 to 89 19 and 22 54 to 87 48 for no3 n and total nitrogen tn respectively overall nitrogen removal efficiencies were greater at lower salinities molecular biological analyses verified the co occurrence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and nitrification in the mesocosms reportedly contributing to nitrogen removal in tf cws the absolute copy numbers of nitrogen functional genes and total bacterial 16s rrna were 2 54 103 7 35 107 and 3 21 107 7 82 109 copies g 1 dg dry gravel respectively with the dominant phyla i e chloroflexi proteobacteria actinobacteriota cyanobacteria and firmicutes accounting for over 80 of the sequences the relative abundances of the genera related to nitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes i e denitrification anammox and dnra varied from 0 16 to 0 89 and from 3 66 to 11 59 respectively while quantitative relationships confirmed nh4 n transformation rate was jointly controlled by amoa hzsb nxra and nrfa and no3 n removal rate by nirs nosz narg qnorb and nxra these findings may shed light on quantitative molecular mechanisms for nitrogen removal in tf cws for the saline water treatment providing a sustainable solution to nitrogen pollution problem in the estuary ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords salinity gradients nitrogen transformation functional gene community structure tidal flow constructed wetlands 1 introduction in recent years human induced eutrophication has attracted great attention worldwide due to its threat to aquatic ecosystems in particular estuarine systems sun et al 2017 in china the water quality of the yangtze river estuary has been seriously deteriorated due to the rapid urbanization and industrial development in the yangtze river delta in last few decades the illegal discharge of domestic industrial wastewater fertilizer overuse and construction within floodplains have been the sources of water pollution while nitrogen is considered a major contributor to eutrophication problems in the estuarine waters and adjacent seas chen et al 2012 nevertheless the combination of nitrogen pollution and high salinity found in the estuary has posed new challenges for conventional treatment technologies constructed wetlands cws have been widely utilized for wastewater treatment for its great performance and cost effectiveness and considered environmentally friendly rai et al 2013 these systems are divided into two main types horizontal flow constructed wetlands hf cws and vertical flow constructed wetlands vf cws vf cws provide a suitable environment for nitrification process by increasing the oxygen transfer ability and further enhance the removal of ammonium yet the removal rate of tn in vf cws is always deficient which is mainly due to the limitations of denitrification process on the contrary hf cws could provide appropriate conditions for denitrification process but suffer from insufficient oxygen supply in beds therefore novel technologies should be developed to create favorable living and metabolic conditions for microorganisms associated with nitrogen cycling at present tidal flow constructed wetlands tf cws are selected to treat saline water due to its ability to provide advantageous habitats for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms tidal flow implies a repeated operation in which cws are repeatedly filled with water and then drained in this process oxygen will diffuse into the beds and then be squeezed out continuously facilitating the metabolism of inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no2 n and no3 n and organic matters previous studies reported that tf cws achieved high removal efficiencies for tn no3 n nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod with the values ranging from 77 51 95 35 94 82 99 22 72 15 80 22 and 89 33 97 46 respectively zhi and ji 2014 zhi et al 2015 in addition to tidal cycles storm surges reductions in rainfall and run off rising sea levels and temperatures anthropogenic disruption of natural drainage routes and mariculture effluents might all increase the salinity of tidal wetlands in a natural setting chyan et al 2017 as the above mentioned issues are becoming the new normal the application of artificial tidal wetlands to the removal of nitrogen from saline wastewater is on the rise globally it was reported that a vf cw could achieve high removal efficiencies of tn and nh4 n 90 39 99 82 for the saline sewage treatment 18 salinity by heterotrophic nitrifying aerobic denitrifying bacterial communities where obligate halophilic and aerobic denitrifiers zobellella were dominant fu et al 2018 a study investigated the substrate enzyme activities and nitrogen removal rates in vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands for the mariculture wastewater treatment and the results revealed that high salinity levels i e 29 and 36 could enhance the activity of enzymes and nitrogen removal rates li et al 2018 besides liang et al 2017 prepared a review to demonstrate the latest knowledge on the utilization of constructed wetlands for treating saline wastewater in which the removal efficiencies of inorganic nitrogen nh4 n and dissolved organic carbon doc decreased from 78 to 56 from 98 to 83 and from 91 to 71 with the salinity increasing from 0 to 30 wu et al 2008 as a major challenge salinity can potentially have adverse effects on macrophytes and associated microorganisms in various habitats by reducing nutrient uptake exposing tissues to toxic ions and increasing osmotic stress chyan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 it has been reported that high sodium chloride levels could interfere with cellular processes of plants by disturbing mitosis and altering enzyme activity janousek and folger 2013 while sodium concentration would affect photosynthetic rate biomass evapotranspiration stomatal conductance root shoot ratio and seed germination bai et al 2014 as a result salinity would not only reduce the tolerance of some wetland macrophytes to water depth due to the inhibited growth chyan et al 2017 but also induce a shift in the plant composition as salinity increases above 10 janousek and folger 2013 in this regard salt tolerant plants halophytes would have greater potential for application in the removal of excess nitrogen from saline water previous research also suggests that salinity increase would impact microbial activity related to nitrogen removal ammonia oxidation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa demonstrates varying responses to salinity in various habitats moderate salinity 10 20 was reportedly associated with increased potential nitrification rates and aoa that was more abundant than aob across salinity gradients in the plum island sound estuary bernhard et al 2010 while investigations conducted in other estuaries showed the opposite tendency li et al 2015 santos et al 2018 with higher abundances of aob occurring at higher salinity levels indicating that ammonia oxidizing microbes possessed different salinity adaptation levels as well as niche preferences increasing salinity can influence nitrification process directly by restricting the nitrifiers fitness and indirectly by constraining the oxygen availability which can further impact the growth and metabolism of nitrifiers zhou et al 2017 the nitrifiers appear to metabolize optimally at the median salinity but would be inhibited if salinity exceeds 20 wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 however denitrification exhibits inconsistent relationships with salinity denitrifiers were found to be negatively associated with salinities of 0 40 in certain estuaries whereas no association was detected with salinities between 2 and 30 in other places fear et al 2005 giblin et al 2010 salinity can also regulate denitrification process by changing the accessibility of organic matter which is important for heterotrophic organisms franklin et al 2017 thus the influence of salinity on nitrification could alter the nitrate availability resulting in the variation of denitrification pathway wang et al 2018 furthermore dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra is reportedly favored over denitrification under high salinity conditions that can be found in marine and coastal ecosystems where sulfides are abundant leading to the competition between dnra and denitrification for nitrate giblin et al 2013 wang et al 2018 meanwhile previous reports suggested salinity could also exhibit a vital impact on anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox lin et al 2021 phylogenetically six anammox bacterial genera have been discovered so far including candidatus anammoximicrobium candidatus scalindua candidatus anammoxoglobus candidatus brocadia candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia as the geographic distributions of these organisms demonstrate that they have species specific or genus specific habitats zhang et al 2020a in general candidatus scalindua mainly exists in marine ecosystems able to tolerate high salinity while the other five genera are normally found in freshwater habitats and more sensitive to salinity variations zhang et al 2020c however few efforts have been made to address the influence of salinity on nitrogen removal in tidal flow constructed wetlands with little information on the underlying molecular mechanism that regulates the nitrogen transformation process for saline water treatment the lack of quantitative links between nitrogen functional genes and nitrogen removal processes limits the ability to reliably predict long term effluent quality and to optimize treatment processes the overall goal of this study was to illustrate the impact of salinity on nitrogen removal in tf cws and understand the quantitative molecular mechanisms in nitrogen transformation processes specifically the following five aims were pursued 1 to evaluate the treatment performance under different salinity levels 2 to determine the absolute abundance of nitrogen functional genes 3 to reveal the quantitative links between functional genes and nitrogen transformation processes 4 to identify the key functional genes regulating nitrogen removal in artificial tidal wetlands for saline water treatment and 5 to assess the microbial diversity and community composition associated with nitrogen transformation this study would offer a new insight into the nitrogen removal in tidal flow constructed wetlands used for saline water treatment providing a sustainable solution to nitrogen pollution problems in estuarine coastal and marine ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 artificial tidal wetlands setup and operation seven pvc mesocosms were set up as lab scale tf cws in the greenhouse on the campus of shanghai jiao tong university sjtu shanghai china n31 2 5 46 e121 26 25 14 the mesocosm had a total volume of 96 l l w h 40 cm 20 cm 120 cm with a working volume of 50 l initial porosity 52 08 each mesocosm was filled with a 10 cm layer of coarse gravel ø 8 12 mm as a water distribution zone at the bottom and an 80 cm layer of lava rock ø 5 10 mm as a treatment zone fig s1 the present study was to simulate the situation of salt marsh wetland in yangtze river estuary china which was dominated by the plants of phragmites australis and spartina alterniflora among the seven mesocosms therefore three were planted with p australis pa 100 plants m2 three were planted with s alterniflora sa 100 plants m2 and the remaining were unplanted np in order to collect microbial samples without disturbing the whole substrate a perforated pvc pipe l d 100 cm 3 cm was filled with the same substrate materials and wrapped with a nylon mesh before being vertically installed in the center of each mesocosm based on our previous research on the water quality of the yangtze river estuary zhang et al 2021 each mesocosm was fed with synthetic water a combination of tap water nacl kh2po4 kno3 and nh4cl sigma aldrich st louis mo to give initial concentrations of 0 5 1 5 and 0 2 mg l for nh4 n no3 n and total phosphorus tp respectively compared with the salinity range of 10 20 considered most favorable for s alterniflora the optimal salinity for p australis is reportedly about 3 but it would be stressed if the salinity exceeds 6 gao et al 2017 in this study therefore the p australis mesocosms were exposed to three salinity levels 0 pa0 4 pa4 and 8 pa8 throughout the experimental period while the s alterniflora mesocosms operated at salinities of 8 sa8 15 sa15 and 30 sa30 and the salinity level remained at 8 np8 for the unplanted mesocosm the synthetic water was prepared every two days in a feeding tank which was then pumped into the mesocosms through flumes in the distribution layer the experiment began on april 1 2019 and lasted for a total of 457 days including a start up stage 91 days for the development of biofilms and plant roots in the substrate and an operational stage 366 days that ended on june 30 2020 throughout the experimental period the mesocosms received intermittent flows and were drained every 48 h using a metering pump and programmable timer to create flood and drain cycles 24 h fill 24 h drain the most effective flow regimes for nitrogen removal based on our pre tests fig s2 in the wet phase the mesocosms were filled with synthetic water for 24 h as the substrate and plant roots were exposed to the air for 24 h during the dry phase after the water was completely drained from the mesocosms leading to a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 32 m3 m2 d 2 2 sample collection and determination water samples were collected from the mesocosms weekly and were analyzed immediately at the analytical testing center at shanghai jiao tong university the ph temperature t redox potential eh and dissolved oxygen do were determined in situ with a multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi usa with influent values varying from 6 75 to 7 55 from 16 6 c to 31 7 c from 288 1 mv to 372 3 mv and from 3 71 mg l to 10 56 mg l respectively suggesting the influent parameters changed with the seasonality no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were evaluated by a uv 1800 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan and total nitrogen tn and total organic carbon toc were measured by a multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany the influent concentrations of no2 n tn and toc were 0 010 mg l 2 11 3 16 mg l and 2 55 8 41 mg l respectively while no2 n was not detected in the effluent all variables were analyzed based on standard analytical methods sun et al 2019 microbial samples from the seven mesocosms were sampled for molecular analyses at the end of the experiment by extracting the pvc pipe the gravel and rock were removed from the pipe and then thoroughly mixed to create one homogeneous sample to properly represent the whole substrate in the mesocosm the samples were stored at 80 c for subsequent dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing the power soil dna isolation kits were utilized to extract and purify the genomic dna from samples omega usa and the extracted dna was determined by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and placed at 80 c until use the primer pairs 338f 806r were used to amplify bacterial 16s rrna gene zhang et al 2018 and the pcr conditions and primer sequences utilized in this study were listed in table s1 subsequently the pcr products were sequenced by majorbio shanghai china using the illumina miseq pe300 platform and the sequencing data were analyzed by qiime software zhang et al 2020b meanwhile the ambiguous and low quality reads were removed and raw sequences were demultiplexed the frame shift errors were detected by hmm frame algorithm along with hidden markov models of various genes from the fungene database and sequences with these errors were discarded fish et al 2013 then filtered sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus according to 97 similarity with the pick otu py function using usearch method the chimeric and singletons sequences were discarded during the otu picking finally equal sequence depth was applied to rarefy every sample for downstream analyses based on the smallest sequences number among all samples 2 4 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr quantitative analysis was performed on the bacterial 16s rrna gene and target fragments of the nine functional genes bacterial ammonia monooxygenase aob amoa archaeal ammonia monooxygenase aoa amoa nitrite oxidoreductase nxra dnra functional gene nrfa membrane bound nitrate reductase narg nitrous oxide reductase nosz nitrite reductase nirs nitric oxide reductase qnorb and hydrazine synthase β subunit hzsb all primers listed in table s1 were synthesized by a company majorbio shanghai china which were diluted to a concentration of 10 µmol l the qpcr was employed on a real time pcr detection system in final 10 µl volume reaction mixtures consisting of the following components 5 µl 2 sybr green qpcr master mix 0 05 u ml taq dna polymerase 2 gotaq flexi buffer 0 4 mm dntps 4 mm mgcl2 and sybr green dye 1 µl template dna 1 10 ng 3 6 µl sterile water and 0 4 µl forward and reverse primers 0 4 µm furthermore qpcr was conducted by a three step thermal cycling program and the parameters and protocol for each target gene are listed in table s1 each qpcr amplification was employed in 40 cycles and followed by several analyses for melting curve sterile water was utilized as a negative control and the qpcr data were normalized to copies g 1 dg the plasmids containing specific total bacterial 16s rrna and nine functional genes i e nosz narg qnorb nirs aoa amoa hzsb nrfa nxra and aob amoa were manufactured by a company majorbio shanghai china the plasmids were diluted to produce a series of 10 fold levels and then utilized for qpcr standard curves meanwhile the r2 value exceeded 0 95 for each standard curve suggesting linear relationships over the concentration ranges utilized in this study and the amplification efficiencies varied from 90 to 106 98 on average 2 5 statistical analyses the effluent and influent levels of toc tn no3 n and nh4 n along with surface area a 0 4 m 0 2 m and hydraulic retention time hrt 48 h were applied to calculate nitrogen transformation rates g m3 d removal efficiencies and mass removal rates g m2 d the normality of the data was determined by k s test using spss 19 0 software package and the results show that the p values were greater than 0 05 revealing the normality of the data pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to reveal the relationships among parameters i e water quality variables microbial abundance and alpha diversity using spss 19 0 software package stepwise regression models spss 19 0 usa were constructed to evaluate the quantitative response relationships between nitrogen functional genes and nitrogen transformation rates the t test and analysis of variance anova were applied to demonstrate the differences among parameters the total bacterial 16s rrna sequences were grouped into various otus based on 97 similarity by mothur software which would be utilized to determine the alpha diversity chao1 shannon good s coverage otu numbers and simpson the r software was used to conduct heatmap venn circos and ternary analyses the canonical correlation analysis cca was carried out by canoco software and principal coordinate analysis pcoa was assessed using r software all statistical differences were considered as the significance level of p 0 05 and the figures were analyzed by origin 8 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of salinity on nitrogen removal the nitrogen removal performance of the artificial tidal wetland mesocosms was investigated under combined conditions of plant species and influent salinity levels during the operation a stable nh4 n removal efficiency of approximately 84 74 was obtained for all the mesocosms fig 1 among which no significant differences were found t test p 0 05 based on the removal rates retention time and bottom area of the mesocosm the nh4 n transformation rate was calculated to be 0 24 g m3 d fig s3 which was also higher than the values revealed by zhang et al 2021 the enhanced treatment performance in nh4 n removal might be due to the facilitated nitrification process as previous research suggested that the nitrifying bacteria would cease functioning at the do of below 0 5 mg l wang et al 2015b high do levels of 3 71 10 56 mg l and 0 73 5 61 mg l observed in influents and effluents respectively fig s4 indicates the sufficient oxygen supply for efficient biotransformation of nh4 n to either no2 n or no3 n zhi and ji 2014 nonetheless greater variation was observed in no3 n removal among the mesocosms 6 34 89 19 fig 1 at the salinity of 8 the no3 n removal efficiency in np8 6 34 9 28 was significantly lower than that of pa8 38 54 82 27 and sa8 49 94 77 60 t test p 0 01 showing the crucial role of plants in tidal flow constructed wetlands as plants could not only remove inorganic n particularly nh4 n and no3 n through active and direct uptake but also facilitate microbially mediated nitrogen cycling processes including denitrification dnra nitrification and anammox zhang et al 2021 for p australis mesocosms the no3 n removal efficiency of pa4 55 39 89 19 was slightly but significantly higher than that of pa0 37 02 61 32 and pa8 t test p 0 05 while significantly greater values were obtained for s alterniflora mesocosms sa8 and sa15 57 28 75 83 than sa30 12 77 18 84 t test p 0 01 the results suggest the mesocosms tended to remove more no3 n at lower salinities which agrees with previous studies chyan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 sun et al 2017 found that high salinity obviously had an inhibitory impact on plant uptake of n as well as the metabolic activity of microorganisms associated with nitrogen cycles meanwhile no significant difference was found in no3 n removal efficiency among seasons probably because temperatures 16 6 c to 31 7 c recorded in the greenhouse as shown in fig s4 fell in the metabolic temperature range 15 0 35 0 c reported for nitrogen transformation organisms wang et al 2015a wang et al 2016 the no3 n transformation rate varied between 0 07 0 67 g m3 d for all mesocosms fig s3 whereas no no2 n accumulation was observed possibly due to efficient nitrification and denitrification processes nitrification includes two oxidation steps oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n by ammonia oxidizing microorganisms and oxidation of no2 n to no3 n by nitrite oxidizing microbes as the former grows almost twice as slowly as the latter chyan et al 2017 as to denitrification no2 n is reduced approximately 1 6 times faster than no3 n chyan et al 2017 hence it is reasonable to find no2 n absent from our artificial tidal wetlands mesocosms for tn removal efficiencies of 22 54 87 48 were achieved for the mesocosms fig 1 resembling the variation in no3 n meanwhile tn transformation rates of 0 34 0 94 g m3 d and tn removal rates of 0 21 0 60 g m2 d were obtained for all the mesocosms fig s3 maltais landry et al 2009 achieved the tn removal rate of 0 80 g m2 d in aerated cws as 0 70 1 21 g m2 d was reported by liu et al 2013 for non aerated vertical flow constructed wetlands vf cws and 0 45 to 9 56 g m2 d found in other similar studies zhi et al 2015 compared with the previous studies mentioned above therefore our results suggest the tf cws displayed operational flexibility and promising performance for n removal both no3 n and nh4 n with lower capital costs and less required space for the same treatment level overall these results reveal that salinity played a crucial role in regulating the n cycling in artificial tidal wetlands with increasing concern about the threats of salinity intrusion related to climate change and rising sea level 3 2 nitrogen removal mechanisms 3 2 1 diversity of bacterial 16s rrna sequences a total of 299 392 bacterial 16s rrna sequences were retrieved from the seven artificial tidal wetland mesocosms pa0 43 471 pa4 40 765 pa8 31 655 sa8 41 698 sa15 45 790 sa30 46 920 and np8 49 093 which were grouped into 3696 otus table s2 the coverage estimate was 0 98 0 99 demonstrating that these results were reliable for otu numbers there were no significant differences among various treatments 1559 2715 as chao1 richness estimate varied from 1568 35 to 2731 00 simpson diversity indices were 0 0059 0 0637 with shannon diversity indices varying from 4 52 to 6 13 no significant differences were found in the values of the above mentioned indices either among different salinity levels or between two plant species previous studies illustrated that salinity had a certain impact on the microbial alpha diversity in the wetlands and differences were found between p australis and s alterniflora systems behera et al 2017 liang et al 2017 which is inconsistent with the results obtained in this study which needs to be further explored for the specific reasons the venn diagram shows that 1194 otus were common for the seven mesocosms while there were 419 otus unique for s1 pa0 and pa4 421 for s2 pa8 sa8 and np8 and 276 for s3 sa15 and sa30 fig 2 based on the salinity gradients of influent water the seven microbial samples were divided into three groups namely s1 s2 and s3 representing the name of each group however earlier studies have illustrated that unique otus played a vital role in determining the cluster variation of microbes in the ecosystem lin et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 3 2 2 community structure of bacterial 16s rrna gene to reveal the microbes associated with nitrification denitrification dnra and anammox the relative abundance was determined by high throughput sequencing analyses at phylum and genus levels of bacterial 16s rrna gene in artificial tidal wetland mesocosms proteobacteria actinobacteriota chloroflexi cyanobacteria and firmicutes accounted for over 80 of the relative abundance while proteobacteria was the dominated phylum 21 50 39 95 followed by chloroflexi 10 10 24 49 actinobacteriota 7 05 28 04 firmicutes 5 65 30 49 and cyanobacteria 1 36 30 66 fig 2 obviously the relative abundance of phylum firmicutes in np was much higher than that in pa and sa this phenomenon might be explained by the fact that a majority of microorganisms in the phylum firmicutes could produce spores to resist extreme conditions such as dehydration high salinity and nutrient deprivation fimlaid and shen 2015 fang et al 2018 compared with the other six wetlands the np8 system had no plants to supply nutrients so it might have created less favorable conditions for microbes screening out microbes with strong resistance further research is needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms besides many microorganisms in this phylum can participate in the nitrogen cycle and their metabolic type is heterotrophic such as bacillus and clostridium fimlaid and shen 2015 fang et al 2018 moreover heatmap analysis also exhibited the similar bacterial compositions and the phylum planctomycetes were discovered with the relative abundance ranging from 0 43 to 1 75 fig 2 showing the potential to perform anammox process zhang et al 2020c meanwhile the relative abundance of this phylum in np was slightly higher than that in pa and sa it is well known that a majority of microbes in the phylum are anaerobic and show an autotrophic metabolic pattern zhang et al 2021 therefore the presence of plants may have a negative impact on these microorganisms as plants could release oxygen and organic matter into the wetland system through their roots based on the circos and ternary analyses the relative abundance of the phylum actinobacteriota gradually decreased with increasing salinity while the phylum cyanobacteria displayed the opposite trend fig 3 this might be explained by the fact that actinobacteriota has lower tolerance to high salinity and cyanobacteria that usually cause red tides in the ocean have greater adaptability to salinity variation wang et al 2018 the phylum detected in this study included a series of microbes involved in n transformations and the relative abundance of the associated genera were shown in table 1 three genera were discovered for nitrification nitrosomonas nitrospina and nitrospira while nitrosomonas was associated with ammonia oxidization and the other genera were related to nitrite oxidation wang et al 2017 it is noteworthy that nitrospira bacteria were able to carry out complete nitrification directly converting ammonium and nitrite to nitrate i e comammox process daims et al 2015 as to the relative abundances of nitrifying genera the smallest value 0 16 was obtained for sa30 compared to 0 67 0 89 for the other treatments previous research suggested that nitrification could occur over a certain range of salinity 10 20 but would be inhibited at the salinity above this range wang et al 2018 although the relative abundances of nitrosomonas 0 08 0 48 and nitrospira 0 07 0 47 were higher than those of nitrospina 0 01 0 07 all these three genera were detected in different salinity treatments 0 30 which agrees with previous reports that suggested certain nitrifying bacteria could be found at various salinity levels although certain bacteria might adapt to a wider range of salinities such as nitrosomonas and nitrospira wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 according to the high throughput sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna gene a total of 21 denitrifying genera were detected in artificial tidal wetlands such as clostridium flavobacterium pseudomonas etc and there were some noticeable differences found among the seven mesocosms table 1 at 8 salinity the relative abundances in np8 3 56 were much lower than those in pa8 7 33 and sa8 10 98 suggesting the significant role played by plants in tf cws meanwhile the relative abundance of denitrifying genera decreased with increasing salinity in pa and sa mesocosms indicating that high salinity had an inhibitory effect on denitrification processes which is in agreement with previous studies giblin et al 2010 wang et al 2018 the phenomenon can be explained by the reasons as follows firstly high salinity levels may reduce microbial respiration rates in tf cws decreasing the o2 consumption and then restraining the anaerobic denitrifying pathway wang et al 2018 secondly the nitrifying genera possessed the ability to convert nh4 n to no2 n and no3 n providing reaction substrates for denitrification process however the metabolic activity of nitrifying genera reduced at high salinity levels decreasing the no3 n availability for denitrifying genera which would further inhibit the following denitrification process wang et al 2018 it was reported that dnra organisms preferred to live in high salt environments possessing a good tolerance to salinity and this process was first discovered in the marine habitat jahangir et al 2017 in this study certain denitrifying genera were discovered such as clostridium photobacterium and desulfovibrio which were reportedly able to execute dnra process zhang et al 2021 suggesting that dnra obviously might have played a role in no3 n reduction in tf cws which could not be neglected for anammox process only three genera were found candidatus scalindua candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia as the relative abundances of anammox genera were 0 10 0 51 it is clear that the relative abundances of candidatus scalindua increased with salinity in pa and sa mesocosms whereas the other two genera showed the opposite reactions with the decreased abundance at higher salinity levels this might be because candidatus scalindua mainly prospers in the marine environment while candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia mostly prevail in freshwater ecosystems zhang et al 2020a taken together our results suggest anammox process might have play a significant role in the loss of nitrogen and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions although the bacteria related to the process only accounted for a small percentage of total microorganisms in artificial tidal wetland mesocosms the pcoa analysis was used to determine the community structure of total bacteria in the mesocosms with the results showing that the bacterial assemblages were clustered along salinity gradients rather than by plant species fig 4 s1 pa0 and pa4 s2 pa8 sa8 and np8 and s3 sa15 and sa30 this phenomenon confirms that salinity would be the key factor affecting the microbial community composition in artificial tidal wetlands the pc1 and pc2 axes explained 47 80 and 22 95 of the similarity of microbial community structure in different samples respectively to further reveal the relationships between water quality parameters and microbial community cca analysis was conducted based on otu levels the cca1 and cca2 explained 30 64 and 23 59 respectively as shown in fig 4 salinity tn do no3 n nh4 n and toc appeared to be the major factors among the detected water quality parameters specifically toc could serve as a carbon source and electron donor in several microbial pathways such as denitrification and dnra which may be important for the niche separation of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes zhang et al 2021 in this study toc levels varied from 2 55 to 8 41 mg l in the influent compared to 2 19 to 5 17 mg l in the effluent fig s4 3 2 3 dynamics of nitrogen functional genes the absolute copy numbers of bacterial 16s rrna and another nine functional genes involved in nitrogen transformations were evaluated by the corresponding genes abundance via qpcr the absolute abundances of total bacterial 16s rrna gene varied from 3 21 107 to 7 82 109 copies g 1 dg showing significant potential for n removal fig 5 the nxra aob amoa and aoa amoa were applied to determine the number of nitrifiers fig 5 aob amoa abundance 9 97 104 2 35 107 copies g 1 dg was 1 2 magnitude higher than that of aoa amoa 8 98 103 8 79 105 copies g 1 dg t test p 0 01 suggesting that ammonia oxidizing bacteria were the main microbial groups converting nh4 n to no2 n in artificial tidal wetlands zhang et al 2021 the functional gene of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nxra abundance ranged from 4 22 104 to 7 99 106 copies g 1 dg and the copy numbers of anammox bacterial functional gene hzsb were 5 54 103 7 97 105 copies g 1 dg it is worth noting that the absolute abundances of aob amoa and nxra genes were at the same level and the variation trends of these two genes across salinity gradients were similar while the relative abundance of the corresponding genera nitrosomonas aob amoa and nitrospira nxra showed the semblable variation tendency the dnra pathway was quantified by nrfa and the abundance ranged between 7 90 103 and 7 23 105 copies g 1 dg it is noteworthy that the nrfa abundance increased with salinity in the pa and sa mesocosms consistent with the fact that dnra mainly occurs in saline environments zhang et al 2021 collectively these results reveal that the aerobic nh4 n oxidation have played a significant role in nh4 n removal in tf cw mesocosms owing to the higher amoa and nxra abundances than the value of hzsb gene t test p 0 01 the nirs nosz narg and qnorb were used to enumerate denitrifiers fig 5 which executed the four steps of denitrification pathway from no3 n to no2 n narg from no2 n to no nirs from no to n2o qnorb and from n2o to n2 nosz the nirs abundance varied from 7 00 105 to 7 35 107 copies g 1 dg which was much higher than that of narg gene 1 85 104 4 46 106 copies g 1 dg t test p 0 05 which explains why no2 n was not accumulated in the system the nosz gene functioned to convert n2o into n2 as the final step in the denitrification process zhi and ji 2014 the nosz abundance ranged from 8 98 103 to 8 47 105 copies g 1 dg higher than the value of qnorb gene 2 54 103 9 68 104 copies g 1 dg t test p 0 05 suggesting the fully completed denitrification without n2o emissions overall except for nrfa the abundances of the other nine genes decreased with increasing salinity in the pa and sa mesocosms t test p 0 05 as the abundances of these genes were higher in the presence of the plants than their absence t test p 0 05 which adequately reveals the quantitative molecular mechanisms of inorganic nitrogen removal in artificial tidal wetlands under the optimum salinity conditions the absolute abundance of nitrogen cycling functional genes in sa was generally higher than that in pa mainly because these two macrophytes had different strategies for inorganic nitrogen metabolism previous studies demonstrated that p australis was conservative in the utilization of nitrogen and could conserve a fraction of nitrogen in the plant for later use however s alterniflora metabolized all the nitrogen absorbed from the environment which was a consumable nitrogen utilization mode zhao et al 2010 therefore s alterniflora had advantages in growth and metabolism with the addition of nutrients nitrogen which would further promote the mitosis and proliferation of nitrogen cycling microbes in tidal flow constructed wetlands 3 3 quantitative response relationships although the underlying nitrogen functional genes behind each specific nitrogen transformation process are well studied how these functional genes from different processes work together for n removal is still descriptive hence the current study was trying to quantify the response relationships among the genes to link micro scale functional genes with macro scale nitrogen processes to achieve a quantitative understanding of key microbial genes that govern the n removal processes three equations of tn no3 n and nh4 n were established with r2 values varying from 0 989 to 0 999 table 2 the results indicate that aoa amoa aob amoa hzsb 16s rrna nxra hzsb and nrfa 16s rrna were responsible for the nh4 n transformation the first and second variables aoa amoa aob amoa hzsb 16s rrna and nxra hzsb were directly associated with nh4 n removal in the aerobic nitrification and anaerobic anammox ammonia oxidation and were therefore positively related to the nh4 n transformation rate the third variable nrfa 16s rrna was directly associated with nh4 n production in the dnra process and was therefore negatively correlated to the nh4 n transformation rate simply put the nh4 n conversion was collectively determined by nitrification anammox and dnra pathways as the genes amoa and hzsb were major roles in nh4 n oxidation making the greatest contribution in the nh4 n removal in artificial tidal wetland mesocosms zhang et al 2021 the negative quantitative relationships between nrfa 16s rrna and the nh4 n transformation rate suggest that the less studied dnra pathway may have been underestimated by previous research and obviously could increase nh4 n levels in tf cws the no3 n transformation rate was numerically determined by nirs nosz narg qnorb and nxra the level of no3 n reduction was dependent on the ratio of narg nirs qnorb nosz because these four functional genes were directly associated with the reduction of no3 n while the no3 n accumulation rate was positively correlated with the ratio of nxra narg 16s rrna for the nxra gene possessed the ability to convert no2 n to no3 n the tn transformation associated with dnra anammox denitrification and nitrification pathways was collectively determined by aob amoa hzsb aoa amoa nxra nirs nosz 16s rrna and narg nrfa qnorb nxra hzsb nirs at the molecular level the results suggest the co existence of anammox denitrification and nitrification processes could greatly enhance the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and other pollutants in artificial tidal wetlands used for the treatment of saline wastewater while dnra pathway could convert no3 n to nh4 n providing reaction substrates for nitrification and anammox organisms accelerating the conversion and removal of nitrogen in the system here the specific molecular mechanisms are illustrated in fig 6 3 4 environmental implications and significance the pearson correlation analysis was carried out to determine the relationships between the microbial diversity and abundance and the water quality parameters our results suggest that salinity nh4 n no3 n and tn were significantly correlated with bacterial diversity and functional genes abundance p 0 05 table s3 and table s4 while the inorganic nitrogen was negatively related to the absolute abundance of amoa nosz hzsb and nrfa as reaction substrates in n cycles nh4 n could be utilized by nitrification and anammox whereas no3 n should have a significant impact on denitrification and dnra cheng et al 2016 shan et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 although ph has been considered one of the significant factors affecting biological processes saeed and sun 2012 no relationship was observed between ph and microbes in the current study since nitrification would consume alkalinity a substantial drop in ph would occur with significant nitrification chyan et al 2017 nitrification is reportedly more efficient at ph 7 2 but would be depressed at ph 6 0 chyan et al 2017 saeed and sun 2012 however denitrification appears to be constrained at ph 8 0 or ph 6 0 but would be expected to be greatest in the ph range 7 0 8 0 chyan et al 2013 since the ph values varied from 7 19 to 7 96 during the operation no significant depression in biological activities was observed in artificial tidal wetland mesocosms although effluent nitrogen could be easily monitored and analyzed the data alone would not be enough to accurately predict the dynamic variations of water quality over the long run without insights into the quantitative molecular mechanisms that govern the removal pathways in this study the equations with functional gene data are crucial for an in depth understanding of these mechanisms as the insights obtained from these equations will improve engineering applications via incorporating various parameters of functional genes into the design of a more efficient treatment system for nitrogen removal as a large amount of inorganic nitrogen is still being discharged into rivers and lakes ending up in the estuary and nearby coastal waters causing eutrophication and algae blooms in saline ecosystems wang et al 2018 which makes it more important to address the environmental implications and nitrogen removal mechanisms in artificial tidal wetlands used for treating polluted saline water 4 conclusions due to the lower performance of conventional treatment systems in nitrogen removal from saline water the current study was to develop a more efficient system by testing seven artificial tidal wetland mesocosms at various salinity levels molecular biological analyses verify the co existence of dnra denitrification anammox and nitrification in the mesocosms which could collectively contribute to the development of nitrogen removal quantitative relationships also confirm that nh4 n transformation rate was jointly controlled by amoa hzsb nxra and nrfa while no3 n removal rate was collectively determined by nirs nosz narg qnorb and nxra the main pathways limiting tn transformation rate were the second step of denitrification and first step of nitrification all these results would help develop an efficient natural treatment system to protect estuarine ecosystems from water pollution a problem that is worsened by saltwater intrusion caused by overuse of groundwater and sea level rise declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments this
