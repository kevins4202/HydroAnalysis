frequency monitoring set up mobile laboratory on line monitoring is carried out using a mobile laboratory ml designed and equipped to measure various physicochemical parameters in the field this type of infrastructure has already been used for similar monitoring ivanovsky et al 2016 meyer et al 2021 it is a trailer that can be towed by a commercial vehicle and can be deployed close to the water body power supply is however necessary it is equipped with an air conditioning system allowing to keep a relative constant temperature of 15 25 c a submersible pump water flow 10 15 m3 h 1 supplies

which 24 syringes are placed and operating with a mechanical jack as the samples are not refrigerated in the sampler they are recovered as soon as possible maximum 3 days and then kept at 4 c before analyses in the laboratory within the week 2 3 sampling methodology overview the sample selection strategy developed in this work consists in collecting a sample on each state of the aquatic system that can be observed by the multi probe a state is defined as a combination of the values of the 7 parameters measured by the probe a certain margin by capturing only discrete samples the main objective of this methodology is to minimise the number of samples while preserving the variability of the data set specifically a decision making algorithm decides after each measurement made by the probe whether it should trigger a new sampling event the mathematical formalism used in this section is constructed as follows matrices are noted in bold with a capital letter e g x vectors are noted in bold with a lower case letter e g msv row and column indices are presented in lower case and italics e g i j the optimised sampling algorithm osa is triggered after each measurement made by the mobile laboratory i e every ten minutes like the ml automation the osa is written in python 3 7 6 mainly based on the pandas 1 1 4 and numpy 1 18 3 packages harris et al 2020 reback et al 2022 at each activation the osa takes as input 3 different datasets firstly the measurements made by the ml since the beginning of the campaign the corresponding data are collected in a data matrix x of dimension n m with n the number of measurements made since the system was launched and m the number of parameters monitored in this study m 7 then a second matrix xs is defined which groups together all the previous measurements that led to a sample being taken this matrix xs is of dimension k m with k the number of samples by construction xs x and k n finally the new measure for which the osa must decide is noted xnew and corresponds to a vector of 1 m dimension this algorithm works in three main steps first a pre processing resulting in the standardisation of the xs and xnew data eq 1 is carried out 1 x i j std x i j me d 1 j ms v 1 j calculation of xstd is done element wise on the ith row jth column elements of x med is a 1 x m vector containing the median of each parameter over the last 1008 rows of x corresponding to the last week of data the vector msv of dimension 1 m represents the minimum significant variation used as a standard deviation msv values are set by the user considering the quality of the sensor signal as well as the knowledge of the variability of the observations for the river the pre processing step is very important as it will impact the importance of each parameter in the decision process of sampling for some parameters such as ph the noise level will be used to set the values in msv e g the msv for ph has been chosen to be 0 2 even though a variation of 0 1 could be considered relevant for the environment for others the corresponding value of the msv can be increased so that there is no oversampling for every small variation of that parameter e g the msv for conductivity was set to 25 µs cm 1 even though the noise is about 2 µs cm 1 following these recommendations tests are performed to check if the msv vector is well balanced i e variations of one parameter are not under considered compared to the others part d in the supplementary information presents examples of msv that are correct or in need of adjustment if an unbalanced importance of a parameter is observed msv can be readjusted by the user at any time during the process currently for this study the msv vector is defined with the following values 0 4 c for temperature 0 1 uph for ph 25 µs cm for conductivity 5 fnu for turbidity 0 5 mg l for dissolved oxygen 2 ppb for cdom and 5 ppb for tryptophan once standardised the second step is to calculate the euclidean distances between the new measurement xnew and the k samples available in xs eq 2 2 d i j 1 7 xne w j x s i j 2 where d i is the distance between xnew and the ith samples in xs the main idea behind the calculation of these distances is to determine whether the new measurement represents a new state of the system compared to previous samples for this purpose all distance value d i are compared to a threshold value denoted t if one of these distances is smaller than t it is considered that the measurement xnew is already represented in the xs database conversely if all distances are greater than t this measurement is considered to represent a new state of the system in this case a sample is taken and xnew is added to the xs database for the next ml measurements thirdly the threshold value t is calculated with the eq 3 3 t d t o a b where slope a and intercept b values are chosen by the users as explained in detail in the results discussion section the coefficient dto is the distance between the origin and the new measurement xnew dto is defined as eq 4 4 d t o j 1 7 xne w j 2 it should be noted that the parameters chosen for the calculation of t are of paramount importance to extract maximum information while balancing the number of samples collected making t dependent on the dto for each measurement tested by the osa allows for a better adaptability to the variability of the system studied in contrast to the proposed procedure a fixed t value could be chosen however this would make the sampling very sensitive to extreme events indeed fixing a small value for t would allow to correctly detect fine and daily variations however during extreme events the mean value of e g turbidity can be multiplied by 50 and in this case almost all measurements would lead to the decision of withdrawing a sample estimating t using eq 4 allows overcoming this issue translating into low threshold values for regular daily variations and higher values for extreme events in this way good sensitivity is ensured in normal conditions while oversampling is avoided during extreme events the overall functioning of the osa is summarised in fig 1 2 4 performance control once the samples have been identified by the osa it is necessary to verify their relevance a high frequency dataset xrebuilt dimensions n m is reconstructed from the sampled dataset xs each non sampled point is assigned the parameter values of the closest sampled point to estimate the adequacy of the relevance of samples two approaches are taken the first is calculating the pearson correlation coefficient for each parameter measured by the multiparameter probe this evaluates the quality of the reconstruction of the complete dataset from the sampled point to a certain extent the second is based on principal component analysis pca pca is performed on both xrebuilt and x and the loadings obtained are compared calculating tucker congruence coefficient lorenzo seva and ten berge 2006 between all principal components in this way we can assess the good conservation of high frequency data variability within the sampled dataset 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of the experimental dataset acquired the first step in developing this algorithm osa was to obtain a large dataset representative of the marque river for that purpose a month s worth of data was collected using the multiparameter probe deployed in the ml a total of 3754 measurements were performed from 23 march to 20 april 2021 representing 26 monitoring days with a total loss of 2 measurement days 7 7 due to technical issues fig 2 daily cycles of temperature ph and dissolved oxygen are clearly evidenced due to the alternance of day and night times and the development of macrophytes during this period in this highly eutrophic river ivanovsky et al 2016 during this monitoring significant meteorological evolutions also took place i air daily mean temperature values evolved strongly and ranged between 2 3 c on april 7th and 17 0 c on april 1st and ii a heavy rainfall event was observed with 16 3 mm of water 10 11 april the discharge of wastewaters from storm overflows was recorded during this event leading to an important drop of dissolved oxygen and sharp peaks of dissolved organic matter the input of rainwater in the river is also very significant as the conductivity dropped by around 40 these events are very different diel vs punctual small variations vs plummeting skyrocketing parameters which makes this first dataset very relevant to optimize our algorithm 3 2 optimisation of the osa the behaviour and the associated performances of the osa have been studied from the collected dataset the first step is to define the best combinations of a and b used in the threshold value calculation the way in which this value is calculated affects both the number of samples and their distribution these choices were based on preliminary tests different samples sets are then generated by testing combinations of a and b over a certain range from 0 1 to 1 for a and from 0 to 6 for b with steps of 0 1 and 0 5 respectively for each samples set generated the performance control is performed as described previously by calculating the correlation coefficient between x and xrebuilt and by comparing the pca to assess the performance quality of the sampling carried out by the osa it is also necessary to compare these results with other sampling methods the first comparison is made against randomly selected samples rands while the second comparison is performed with a fixed step sampling method steps the average sampling rates are between 0 15 and 3 samples per day for each method this is in our case an operationally feasible sampling frequency range for monitoring over several months while maintaining sensitivity to one off and daily events the results of these different simulations are shown in fig 3 logically whatever the methods and correlations increasing the sampling frequency improves the description of the dataset in a non linear way the first observable difference between the three methods is a better stability for the osa of the correlations with the increase of the number of samples the rands and steps methods indeed show strong disparities when increasing the frequencies fig 3a shows the evolution of the average tucker congruence coefficient between principal components of x and xrebuilt calculated for the different methods this coefficient has the advantage of considering all the parameters under study osa consistently exhibits higher coefficients than the two other methods moreover it is interesting to observe that a ceiling seems to be reached for frequencies of the order of 1 sample per day the gain in this coefficient is then negligible for higher sampling frequencies fig 3b shows the mean value of the pearson correlations between parameters in x and xrebuilt the use of the average of these coefficients allows to approximate a multivariate visualisation of the system again the osa shows both better results and greater stability compared to the other methods fig 3c and d display the pearson correlations of two parameters turbidity and dissolved oxygen these two correlations show very different behaviours for the osa for turbidity the osa systematically gives a very high correlation where the other methods rarely manage to describe this signal correctly the main reason is the variability of the turbidity signal and equivalently the tryptophan for both signals see fig 2 the measurements are quite stable except for a strong increase from 10 to 11 april caused by a heavy rainfall this event has a strong impact on water quality for a very short time for classical sampling methods it is usually very difficult to take samples on this kind of short event conversely the osa makes possible in a systematic way to consider this type of phenomenon whose impacts may be important and often poorly understood the randomness of the ability of classical methods to sample these events is also reflected in the correlations with highly scattered values resulting from the presence or absence of sampling during this stormy period for the dissolved oxygen and comparably for temperature ph conductivity and cdom the behaviour of the osa is quite different for sampling frequencies between 0 5 and 2 osa exhibits good results compared to other methods with high stability for frequencies above 2 all three methods give comparable correlation values however for low frequencies 0 3 day 1 the osa indicates lower performance than the two other methods this is due to the nature of the operation of the osa and the dissolved oxygen signal indeed as seen previously the osa systematically samples the rainfall event regardless of the sampling frequency so that the few samples are mainly taken during this event as a result the dissolved oxygen values identified are not representative of the overall variability as shown in fig 2 in other words when only a few samples are taken extreme events will be prioritized over small daily variations finally from these data it is possible to choose a pair of values for the parameters a and b corresponding to the objectives and limitations of the study under consideration adjustments of the msv values can also be made to slightly adjust the sensitivity of the osa on the different parameters however these modifications must be made with an awareness of technical limitations and environmental variations 3 3 application of the osa to a monitoring campaign the osa was used for a campaign conducted from april 20th to june 28th 2021 on the marque river during this period 103 samples were taken corresponding to an average frequency of 1 6 samples per day this frequency is higher than that predicted by the previous simulation 1 4 probably due to the high variability observed during the campaign and the strong weather changes due to the transition towards the summer season the osa sampling system ensures a good representation of the environment by taking samples during events that have a strong impact on the environment regardless of their duration some examples of sampled events are shown fig 4 fig 4a shows the launch of the osa over the first 7 days represented for only one parameter with close sampling during the launch initialization discovery phase this is followed by periods without additional sampling as variability remains as low as previously fig 4b shows a one off event of high dilution of the river by the overflow of the retention basin the heron lake located just upstream the purple areas correspond to the periods during which the water from this pond is pumped into the river the time lag between the discharge and the impact on the conductivity is due to the distance between the discharge and the mobile laboratory the osa can trigger a sampling during this brief period less than two hours but also not to take a sample again when this event reappears some hours later the last example fig 4c shows the ability of the osa to multiply samples during periods of high variability here using the example of heavy rainfall leading to a large increase in turbidity these periods are often critical for environmental studies and require special attention here represented by the increase in the number of samples taken over a short period the parameters a and b identified in the test phase produced excellent results in this campaign all correlation coefficients are above 0 96 with a tucker congruence of 0 998 these excellent results despite different environmental changes than those observed during the simulation clearly validate the transposition of the osa settings over different periods hf data and the sampling points are displayed in the supplementary information as well as the performance indicator on this period 3 4 osa limitation according to these findings and our experience feedback in the field several points of vigilance must be mentioned for an optimized deployment in routine of the osa as for any data treatment bad data lead to bad analysis the osa is optimised to detect changes and will be especially sensitive to probe fouling and drift as well as recalibrations and cleaning of the instrument for example ph sensor re calibration after a long period without maintenance e g several weeks led to an over sampling of the daily cycles despite them having been characterized previously to limit this kind of bias a regular maintenance of the multiprobe have been implemented cleaning and calibration a weekly frequency has been chosen in this river based on the observation of the fouling but it could be adapted depending on the characteristics of the studied water body and weather conditions e g summer vs winter furthermore traceability of the maintenance and calibration must be ensured if possible automatically to allow an a posteriori understanding of the sampling by the osa osa is also intended to be a tool for detecting the variability occurring in a system with good optimisation it should be able to sample during both small and extreme phenomena however for lower sampling frequencies of the order of a week for example only extreme events will be sampled by the osa the baseline status of the river will systematically be dismissed by the algorithm and so the information associated with it as well fig 3d confirms that a misrepresentation can be observed at low sampling rate and that the osa can become worst that random sampling in such configuration the seven parameters measured with the probe can sometimes be much correlated e g dissolved oxygen with ph are correlated with an r 0 79 over 9 months in 2021 therefore there is a risk that using them all can give a lot of statistical importance to the group of parameters varying together however there is always the chance that a decorrelation might occur indicative of a new phenomenon happening and the osa should in this case be able to detect it that is why the choice was made to keep all parameters finally with a more operational vision the non regular distribution of samples over time can be problematic indeed it is possible to have no samples over several days and then 8 samples over one day during a storm it requires flexible human resources and alert systems to grab collected samples 4 conclusion this study was dedicated to the development optimisation and validation of a decision support algorithm for taking samples following multiparametric hf measurements it allows the overall variability of the data to be maintained while reducing the number of samples collected osa is particularly suitable for sampling short lived events with a high environmental impact to our best knowledge this is the first approach of this type of sampling based on on line multiparameter measurements this tool is a particular response to the difficulty observed in many studies of taking samples on short and difficult to predict events even if it remains a perfectible tool e g msv values could be further optimised in the future the realisation of a campaign in spring 2021 has proved its operational applicability this type of sampling will be very useful for studies where a large variety of samples are necessary to insure a statistical robustness typically it will be interesting for dissolved organic matter studies in which fluorescence excitation emission matrices are measured as the exploitation of these matrices with the deconvolution algorithm parafac requires some variability in the dataset to have a robust model in the end more generally osa could be of interest in any environmental study that could benefit

analyses in the laboratory within the week 2 3 sampling methodology overview the sample selection strategy developed in this work consists in collecting a sample on each state of the aquatic system that can be observed by the multi probe a state is defined as a combination of the values of the 7 parameters measured by the probe a certain margin by capturing only discrete samples the main objective of this methodology is to minimise the number of samples while preserving the variability of the data set specifically a decision making algorithm decides after each measurement made by the probe whether it should trigger a new sampling event the mathematical formalism used in this section is constructed as follows matrices are noted in bold with a capital letter e g x vectors are noted in bold with a lower case letter e g msv row and column indices are presented in lower case and italics e g i j the optimised sampling algorithm osa is triggered after each measurement made by the mobile laboratory i e every ten minutes like the ml automation the osa is written in python 3 7 6 mainly based on the pandas 1 1 4 and numpy 1 18 3 packages harris et al 2020 reback et al 2022 at each activation the osa takes as input 3 different datasets firstly the measurements made by the ml since the beginning of the campaign the corresponding data are collected in a data matrix x of dimension n m with n the number of measurements made since the system was launched and m the number of parameters monitored in this study m 7 then a second matrix xs is defined which groups together all the previous measurements that led to a sample being taken this matrix xs is of dimension k m with k the number of samples by construction xs x and k n finally the new measure for which the osa must decide is noted xnew and corresponds to a vector of 1 m dimension this algorithm works in three main steps first a pre processing resulting in the standardisation of the xs and xnew data eq 1 is carried out 1 x i j std x i j me d 1 j ms v 1 j calculation of xstd is done element wise on the ith row jth column elements of x med is a 1 x m vector containing the median of each parameter over the last 1008 rows of x corresponding to the last week of data the vector msv of dimension 1 m represents the minimum significant variation used as a standard deviation msv values are set by the user considering the quality of the sensor signal as well as the knowledge of the variability of the observations for the river the pre processing step is very important as it will impact the importance of each parameter in the decision process of sampling for some parameters such as ph the noise level will be used to set the values in msv e g the msv for ph has been chosen to be 0 2 even though a variation of 0 1 could be considered relevant for the environment for others the corresponding value of the msv can be increased so that there is no oversampling for every small variation of that parameter e g the msv for conductivity was set to 25 µs cm 1 even though the noise is about 2 µs cm 1 following these recommendations tests are performed to check if the msv vector is well balanced i e variations of one parameter are not under considered compared to the others part d in the supplementary information presents examples of msv that are correct or in need of adjustment if an unbalanced importance of a parameter is observed msv can be readjusted by the user at any time during the process currently for this study the msv vector is defined with the following values 0 4 c for temperature 0 1 uph for ph 25 µs cm for conductivity 5 fnu for turbidity 0 5 mg l for dissolved oxygen 2 ppb for cdom and 5 ppb for tryptophan once standardised the second step is to calculate the euclidean distances between the new measurement xnew and the k samples available in xs eq 2 2 d i j 1 7 xne w j x s i j 2 where d i is the distance between xnew and the ith samples in xs the main idea behind the calculation of these distances is to determine whether the new measurement represents a new state of the system compared to previous samples for this purpose all distance value d i are compared to a threshold value denoted t if one of these distances is smaller than t it is considered that the measurement xnew is already represented in the xs database conversely if all distances are greater than t this measurement is considered to represent a new state of the system in this case a sample is taken and xnew is added to the xs database for the next ml measurements thirdly the threshold value t is calculated with the eq 3 3 t d t o a b where slope a and intercept b values are chosen by the users as explained in detail in the results discussion section the coefficient dto is the distance between the origin and the new measurement xnew dto is defined as eq 4 4 d t o j 1 7 xne w j 2 it should be noted that the parameters chosen for the calculation of t are of paramount importance to extract maximum information while balancing the number of samples collected making t dependent on the dto for each measurement tested by the osa allows for a better adaptability to the variability of the system studied in contrast to the proposed procedure a fixed t value could be chosen however this would make the sampling very sensitive to extreme events indeed fixing a small value for t would allow to correctly detect fine and daily variations however during extreme events the mean value of e g turbidity can be multiplied by 50 and in this case almost all measurements would lead to the decision of withdrawing a sample estimating t using eq 4 allows overcoming this issue translating into low threshold values for regular daily variations and higher values for extreme events in this way good sensitivity is ensured in normal conditions while oversampling is avoided during extreme events the overall functioning of the osa is summarised in fig 1 2 4 performance control once the samples have been identified by the osa it is necessary to verify their relevance a high frequency dataset xrebuilt dimensions n m is reconstructed from the sampled dataset xs each non sampled point is assigned the parameter values of the closest sampled point to estimate the adequacy of the relevance of samples two approaches are taken the first is calculating the pearson correlation coefficient for each parameter measured by the multiparameter probe this evaluates the quality of the reconstruction of the complete dataset from the sampled point to a certain extent the second is based on principal component analysis pca pca is performed on both xrebuilt and x and the loadings obtained are compared calculating tucker congruence coefficient lorenzo seva and ten berge 2006 between all principal components in this way we can assess the good conservation of high frequency data variability within the sampled dataset 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of the experimental dataset acquired the first step in developing this algorithm osa was to obtain a large dataset representative of the marque river for that purpose a month s worth of data was collected using the multiparameter probe deployed in the ml a total of 3754 measurements were performed from 23 march to 20 april 2021 representing 26 monitoring days with a total loss of 2 measurement days 7 7 due to technical issues fig 2 daily cycles of temperature ph and dissolved oxygen are clearly evidenced due to the alternance of day and night times and the development of macrophytes during this period in this highly eutrophic river ivanovsky et al 2016 during this monitoring significant meteorological evolutions also took place i air daily mean temperature values evolved strongly and ranged between 2 3 c on april 7th and 17 0 c on april 1st and ii a heavy rainfall event was observed with 16 3 mm of water 10 11 april the discharge of wastewaters from storm overflows was recorded during this event leading to an important drop of dissolved oxygen and sharp peaks of dissolved organic matter the input of rainwater in the river is also very significant as the conductivity dropped by around 40 these events are very different diel vs punctual small variations vs plummeting skyrocketing parameters which makes this first dataset very relevant to optimize our algorithm 3 2 optimisation of the osa the behaviour and the associated performances of the osa have been studied from the collected dataset the first step is to define the best combinations of a and b used in the threshold value calculation the way in which this value is calculated affects both the number of samples and their distribution these choices were based on preliminary tests different samples sets are then generated by testing combinations of a and b over a certain range from 0 1 to 1 for a and from 0 to 6 for b with steps of 0 1 and 0 5 respectively for each samples set generated the performance control is performed as described previously by calculating the correlation coefficient between x and xrebuilt and by comparing the pca to assess the performance quality of the sampling carried out by the osa it is also necessary to compare these results with other sampling methods the first comparison is made against randomly selected samples rands while the second comparison is performed with a fixed step sampling method steps the average sampling rates are between 0 15 and 3 samples per day for each method this is in our case an operationally feasible sampling frequency range for monitoring over several months while maintaining sensitivity to one off and daily events the results of these different simulations are shown in fig 3 logically whatever the methods and correlations increasing the sampling frequency improves the description of the dataset in a non linear way the first observable difference between the three methods is a better stability for the osa of the correlations with the increase of the number of samples the rands and steps methods indeed show strong disparities when increasing the frequencies fig 3a shows the evolution of the average tucker congruence coefficient between principal components of x and xrebuilt calculated for the different methods this coefficient has the advantage of considering all the parameters under study osa consistently exhibits higher coefficients than the two other methods moreover it is interesting to observe that a ceiling seems to be reached for frequencies of the order of 1 sample per day the gain in this coefficient is then negligible for higher sampling frequencies fig 3b shows the mean value of the pearson correlations between parameters in x and xrebuilt the use of the average of these coefficients allows to approximate a multivariate visualisation of the system again the osa shows both better results and greater stability compared to the other methods fig 3c and d display the pearson correlations of two parameters turbidity and dissolved oxygen these two correlations show very different behaviours for the osa for turbidity the osa systematically gives a very high correlation where the other methods rarely manage to describe this signal correctly the main reason is the variability of the turbidity signal and equivalently the tryptophan for both signals see fig 2 the measurements are quite stable except for a strong increase from 10 to 11 april caused by a heavy rainfall this event has a strong impact on water quality for a very short time for classical sampling methods it is usually very difficult to take samples on this kind of short event conversely the osa makes possible in a systematic way to consider this type of phenomenon whose impacts may be important and often poorly understood the randomness of the ability of classical methods to sample these events is also reflected in the correlations with highly scattered values resulting from the presence or absence of sampling during this stormy period for the dissolved oxygen and comparably for temperature ph conductivity and cdom the behaviour of the osa is quite different for sampling frequencies between 0 5 and 2 osa exhibits good results compared to other methods with high stability for frequencies above 2 all three methods give comparable correlation values however for low frequencies 0 3 day 1 the osa indicates lower performance than the two other methods this is due to the nature of the operation of the osa and the dissolved oxygen signal indeed as seen previously the osa systematically samples the rainfall event regardless of the sampling frequency so that the few samples are mainly taken during this event as a result the dissolved oxygen values identified are not representative of the overall variability as shown in fig 2 in other words when only a few samples are taken extreme events will be prioritized over small daily variations finally from these data it is possible to choose a pair of values for the parameters a and b corresponding to the objectives and limitations of the study under consideration adjustments of the msv values can also be made to slightly adjust the sensitivity of the osa on the different parameters however these modifications must be made with an awareness of technical limitations and environmental variations 3 3 application of the osa to a monitoring campaign the osa was used for a campaign conducted from april 20th to june 28th 2021 on the marque river during this period 103 samples were taken corresponding to an average frequency of 1 6 samples per day this frequency is higher than that predicted by the previous simulation 1 4 probably due to the high variability observed during the campaign and the strong weather changes due to the transition towards the summer season the osa sampling system ensures a good representation of the environment by taking samples during events that have a strong impact on the environment regardless of their duration some examples of sampled events are shown fig 4 fig 4a shows the launch of the osa over the first 7 days represented for only one parameter with close sampling during the launch initialization discovery phase this is followed by periods without additional sampling as variability remains as low as previously fig 4b shows a one off event of high dilution of the river by the overflow of the retention basin the heron lake located just upstream the purple areas correspond to the periods during which the water from this pond is pumped into the river the time lag between the discharge and the impact on the conductivity is due to the distance between the discharge and the mobile laboratory the osa can trigger a sampling during this brief period less than two hours but also not to take a sample again when this event reappears some hours later the last example fig 4c shows the ability of the osa to multiply samples during periods of high variability here using the example of heavy rainfall leading to a large increase in turbidity these periods are often critical for environmental studies and require special attention here represented by the increase in the number of samples taken over a short period the parameters a and b identified in the test phase produced excellent results in this campaign all correlation coefficients are above 0 96 with a tucker congruence of 0 998 these excellent results despite different environmental changes than those observed during the simulation clearly validate the transposition of the osa settings over different periods hf data and the sampling points are displayed in the supplementary information as well as the performance indicator on this period 3 4 osa limitation according to these findings and our experience feedback in the field several points of vigilance must be mentioned for an optimized deployment in routine of the osa as for any data treatment bad data lead to bad analysis the osa is optimised to detect changes and will be especially sensitive to probe fouling and drift as well as recalibrations and cleaning of the instrument for example ph sensor re calibration after a long period without maintenance e g several weeks led to an over sampling of the daily cycles despite them having been characterized previously to limit this kind of bias a regular maintenance of the multiprobe have been implemented cleaning and calibration a weekly frequency has been chosen in this river based on the observation of the fouling but it could be adapted depending on the characteristics of the studied water body and weather conditions e g summer vs winter furthermore traceability of the maintenance and calibration must be ensured if possible automatically to allow an a posteriori understanding of the sampling by the osa osa is also intended to be a tool for detecting the variability occurring in a system with good optimisation it should be able to sample during both small and extreme phenomena however for lower sampling frequencies of the order of a week for example only extreme events will be sampled by the osa the baseline status of the river will systematically be dismissed by the algorithm and so the information associated with it as well fig 3d confirms that a misrepresentation can be observed at low sampling rate and that the osa can become worst that random sampling in such configuration the seven parameters measured with the probe can sometimes be much correlated e g dissolved oxygen with ph are correlated with an r 0 79 over 9 months in 2021 therefore there is a risk that using them all can give a lot of statistical importance to the group of parameters varying together however there is always the chance that a decorrelation might occur indicative of a new phenomenon happening and the osa should in this case be able to detect it that is why the choice was made to keep all parameters finally with a more operational vision the non regular distribution of samples over time can be problematic indeed it is possible to have no samples over several days and then 8 samples over one day during a storm it requires flexible human resources and alert systems to grab collected samples 4 conclusion this study was dedicated to the development optimisation and validation of a decision support algorithm for taking samples following multiparametric hf measurements it allows the overall variability of the data to be maintained while reducing the number of samples collected osa is particularly suitable for sampling short lived events with a high environmental impact to our best knowledge this is the first approach of this type of sampling based on on line multiparameter measurements this tool is a particular response to the difficulty observed in many studies of taking samples on short and difficult to predict events even if it remains a perfectible tool e g msv values could be further optimised in the future the realisation of a campaign in spring 2021 has proved its operational applicability this type of sampling will be very useful for studies where a large variety of samples are necessary to insure a statistical robustness typically it will be interesting for dissolved organic matter studies in which fluorescence excitation emission matrices are measured as the exploitation of these matrices with the deconvolution algorithm parafac requires some variability in the dataset to have a robust model in the end more generally osa could be of interest in any environmental study that could benefit

15741,ozonation transformation products otps are largely unknown compounds that are formed during the ozonation of micropollutants and it is uncertain to which extent these compounds can be removed by subsequent adsorption to activated carbon thus 14c labeled micropollutants were ozonated to generate 14c labeled otps for which the adsorption of the sum of all 14c labeled otps to activated carbon could be determined based on the adsorption of the labeled carbon further 14co2 traps were used to examine the mineralization of 14c labeled moieties during ozonation 14co2 formation revealed a partial mineralization of the 14c labeled moieties in all compounds except for propyl labeled bisphenol a and o methyl labeled naproxen a similar degree of mineralization was noted for different compounds labeled at the same moiety including the carboxylic carbon in diclofenac and ibuprofen 40 at 1 g o3 g doc and the aniline ring in sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine 30 at 1 g o3 g doc aromatic ring cleavage was also confirmed for bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine through the formation of 14co2 the adsorption experiments demonstrated increased adsorption of micropollutants to powdered activated carbon after ozonation which was connected to a decreased adsorption of dissolved organic matter dom conversely the otps showed a substantial and successive decline in adsorption at increased ozone doses for all compounds likely due to decreased hydrophobicity and aromaticity of the otps these findings indicate that adsorption to activated carbon alone is not a viable removal method for a wide range of ozonation transformation products graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceuticals transformation products 14c labeling wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ozonation and activated carbon adsorption are the two most frequently used technologies for the abatement of organic micropollutants in municipal wastewater both technologies can remove a wide range of organic micropollutants although their mechanisms differ fundamentally activated carbon removes micropollutants through adsorption moreno castilla 2004 whereas ozonation oxidizes micropollutants through direct reactions with ozone or secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone based and activated carbon based processes are usually operated individually but their combination in which ozonation is performed as a pretreatment to activated carbon adsorption is also being explored boehler et al 2020 guillossou et al 2020 reungoat et al 2010 schollée et al 2021 these studies have mainly focused on biological activated carbon filters where both adsorption and biodegradation can occur several benefits of sequential ozonation and activated carbon adsorption have been proposed this combination is expected to result in greater overall removal of a wide variety of organic micropollutants because some compounds are better removed by ozonation and vice versa altmann et al 2014 margot et al 2013 ozonation also decreases the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of effluent organic matter świetlik et al 2004 treguer et al 2010 which decreases the competition between organic micropollutants and effluent organic matter for adsorption sites on activated carbon resulting in lower carbon usage rates guillossou et al 2020 zietzschmann et al 2015 activated carbon adsorption can further improve the removal of ozone oxidation products such as byproducts formed from the wastewater matrix and ozonation transformation products otps formed from micropollutants although the potential for adsorbing them remains largely unknown post ozonation toxicity might be connected to the formation of organic and inorganic byproducts such as bromate soltermann et al 2016 nitrosamines hollender et al 2009 aldehydes lopachin and gavin 2014 wert et al 2007 and otps prasse et al 2012 wei et al 2021 otps often have lower specific toxicities compared with their parent compounds dodd et al 2009 huber et al 2004 lange et al 2006 but have also shown increased nonspecific toxicity in experiments with isolated organic micropollutants e g abellán et al 2008 kuang et al 2013 sui et al 2017 biological treatment of ozonated water has been recommended to reduce toxicity stalter et al 2010 although seem unable to remove many of the otps that form edefell et al 2021 knopp et al 2016 by combining biodegradation and adsorption in granular activated carbon gac filters an improved removal of otps has been observed knopp et al 2016 direct adsorption onto powdered activated carbon pac is another promising option for the removal of otps gulde et al 2021b these findings have thus prompted further examination of the adsorption of otps to activated carbon potential otps have primarily been identified using various applications of solid phase extraction spe followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry these approaches have led to the identification of a large number of otps the elucidation of transformation pathways and have enabled otps to be tracked in various treatment trains bourgin et al 2018 gulde et al 2021a hermes et al 2020 knopp et al 2016 yet an unknown number of otps remain undetected due to the lack of mass balancing hübner et al 2015 and the expected otps from many aromatic and olefinic compounds have been difficult to detect gulde et al 2021a likely due to their increased polarity and smaller size further otps can be partially mineralized during ozonation although the extent to which the mineralization of micropollutants occurs during ozonation in municipal wastewater remains largely unknown with respect to the overall tracking of otps the use of 14c labeled micropollutants could be useful because their ozonation results in the formation of 14c labeled otps the overall behavior of which comprises a large amount of otp structures that can be tracked and clearly separated from other byproducts and effluent organic matter through their 14c activities ß decay further 14c labeled micropollutants in conjunction with co2 traps can be used to study mineralization pathways for various 14c labeled moieties during such processes as ozonation amir tahmasseb et al 2002 massey and lavy 1997 biodegradation betsholtz et al 2021 and their combination tian et al 2017 however 14c labeling has not been applied to investigate the overall adsorption behavior of 14c labeled otps formed at different ozone doses this study aims to investigate formation of 14co2 from certain 14c labeled moieties in micropollutants during ozonation and to estimate the potential for adsorption of the generated 14c labeled transformation products onto powdered activated carbon pac adsorption experiments were performed along a gradient of pac doses with the formed 14c labeled transformation products from a set of 14c labeled micropollutants at different ozone doses 2 materials and methods ozonation experiments were performed with 14c labeled and the corresponding non radiolabeled micropollutants and the subsequent adsorption experiments were conducted with the same 14c labeled micropollutants and the 14c labeled otps as illustrated in fig 1 and detailed in sections 2 2 2 3 2 1 micropollutant

reactors were sealed immediately with a rubber septum and incubated under dark conditions at 20 c and 130 rpm for 40 h to allow the 14co2 that formed to reach the co2 trap control experiments fig s1 showed that the co2 trap removed 95 of the inorganic carbon from the wastewater within 24 h liquid samples from the non 14c reactors were then collected in 100 ml hdpe bottles and frozen for micropollutant analysis in reactors with 14c labeled micropollutants samples 3 ml from the liquid phases and co2 traps were transferred to eppendorf tubes for analysis of 14c activity within 24 h the

ozone still transformation of the aniline ring has also been observed via hydroxylation abellán et al 2008 and by cleavage of the aniline nitrogen resulting in quinone group formation willach et al 2017 wherein subsequent reactions with ozone could lead to the observed ring cleavage in experiments with aniline direct reactions with ozone have indicated a potential ring cleavage tekle röttering et al 2016 however no otps resulting from aromatic ring cleavage of sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine have been reported table s7 diclofenac and ibuprofen 14c carboxyl carbons diclofenac and ibuprofen were 14c labeled at their respective carboxy carbons which showed similar degrees of 14co2 formation approximately 40 at 1 g o3 g doc despite the much higher ozone reactivity for diclofenac 106 m 1 s 1 compared with ibuprofen 10 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 the ozone reactive sites in diclofenac include an aniline type moiety and an activated aromatic ring sein et al 2008 whereas ibuprofen lacks reactive groups and has only a slightly activated aromatic ring huber et al 2003 the similar degrees of 14co2 formation that we observed suggest that hydroxyl radicals could be involved in the mineralization of the carboxyl groups as previously proposed alharbi et al 2021 but needs to be further confirmed in experiments where the hydroxyl radical exposure is monitored or excluded bisphenol a 14c ring and propyl 2 groups during the ozonation of bisphenol a the 14c labeled aromatic rings underwent mineralization to co2 24 at 1 g o3 g doc whereas no mineralization of the 14c labeled propyl 2 group 1 at 1 g o3 g doc was observed bisphenol a has a high reactivity 7 105 m 1 s 1 deborde et al 2005 with ozone and has been reported to result in typical primary phenol otps such as catechol benzoquinone orthoquinone and muconic acid derivative deborde et al 2008 table s10 where the formation of the muconic acid derivative involves ring cleavage ozone reactions with the olefins in muconic acid has further been reported to result in the formation of new and smaller carboxylic acids where subsequent decarboxylation has been proposed as a co2 forming mechanism yamamoto et al 1979 carbamazepine 14c carbonyl carbon ozonation of 14c labeled carbamazepine resulted in low 3 mineralization of the labeled carbonyl group at 0 3 g o3 g doc but greater mineralization at higher doses 10 and 16 at 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc respectively ozonation of carbamazepine has been reported to primarily target the olefin group resulting in secondary ring formation where the formed otps have low further reactivities with ozone 7 m 1s 1 per mcdowell et al 2005 further transformation of these compounds may however proceed via reactions with hydroxyl radicals e g 7 109 m 1 s 1 and 5 109 m 1 s 1 for bqm and bqd mcdowell et al 2005 although proposed otp structures from various studies have the 14c labeled carbonyl carbon intact azaïs et al 2017 gulde et al 2021a hübner et al 2014 kråkström et al 2020 mcdowell et al 2005 table s11 the previously known transformation products can thus not fully explain the mechanisms responsible for the observed co2 formation that could be due to unknown side reactions trimethoprim 14c benzyl carbon ozonation of trimethoprim resulted in low 3 mineralization of the labeled benzyl group at 0 3 g o3 g doc and slightly higher mineralization 7 and 14 at 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc respectively the aromatic rings in both the diaminopyrimidine and trimethoxytololuene moieties are activated and the reactions have been proposed to occur by hydroxylation carbonylation demethylation or cleavage of the methylene group kuang et al 2013 table s12 by using model substrates diaminopyrimidine and trimethoxytoluene moieties it has further been indicated that the ozone attacks are not directly targeting the 14c labeled benzyl bridge dodd et al 2006 and the low 14co2 formation could therefore be expected to occur from previously unknown side reactions naproxen 14c o methyl carbon the ozonation of 14c labeled naproxen did not result in any 14co2 formation based on the mineralization of the labeled o methyl group at doses of up to 0 6 g o3 g doc naproxen has high reactivity 2 105 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2005 with ozone that is linked to activation of the naphthalene structure by the o methyl and alkyl moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which could lead to ring opened products however attacks on the 14c labeled o methyl carbon are expected to be limited for ozone as indicated for methoxybenzene 290 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 and protonated metoprolol 330 m 1 s 1 benner et al 2008 and relatively low with hydroxyl radicals as indicated for methyl tert butyl ether koh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2001 which supports the lack of observed 14co2 formation 3 2 adsorption experiments 3 2 1 adsorption of 14c labeled parent compounds in pre ozonated wastewater the results of the adsorption experiments with 14c labeled micropollutants and their 14c labeled otps in ozonated wastewater 0 3 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc are shown in fig 4 adsorption of the radiolabeled parent compound 14c mp increased for all micropollutants after ozonation with higher degrees of adsorption seen at higher ozone doses fig 4 these results are expected based on the lower hydrophobicity and aromaticity of effluent organic matter after ozonation treguer et al 2010 by normalizing the pac dose against the initial uva254 signals for each ozone dose the adsorption patterns for the micropollutants in ozonated effluent could also be partially aligned figs s5 s7 the decreased competition of effluent organic matter for adsorption sites on the activated carbon was further indicated by the lower adsorption of dom with higher specific ozone doses fig s2 the adsorption of the parent compound was highest for trimethoprim followed by bisphenol a carbamazepine diclofenac naproxen sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and ibuprofen the adsorption affinities for these compounds could not be predicted by hydrophobicity alone as indicated by the logd values fig 2 which has been previously observed kovalova et al 2013 as reported the molecular charge impacts the adsorption pf micropollutants to activated carbon de ridder et al 2011 gidstedt et al 2022 explaining the strong adsorption of positively charged trimethoprim despite its low hydrophobicity logd 0 9 whereas negatively charged compounds with the lowest logd values sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and ibuprofen had the lowest adsorption affinities freundlich isotherms were fitted to the experimental data to estimate the required pac dose for 80 removal of each micropollutant in the pre ozonated effluent which was spiked with micropollutants section s8 fig s3 compounds with data that did not reach this target removal ibuprofen sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine were excluded from the comparison these compounds were also poorly described by freundlich isotherms fig s3 as observed previously for poor adsorbates such as sulfamethoxazole altmann et al 2014 nam et al 2014 zietzschmann et al 2014 for the remaining compounds the concentration of pac that was required to remove 80 of the micropollutant could be decreased by 20 30 30 50 and 40 70 at pre ozonation doses of 0 3 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc respectively fig s4 and in a similar range as for diclofenac and carbamazepine in zietzschmann et al 2015 3 2 2 adsorption of 14c labeled otps in wastewater for all compounds except ibuprofen the ozonation of 14c labeled micropollutants decreased the adsorption of 14c activity at higher ozone doses fig 4 yellow circles as shown in fig 2 the 14c activity in these samples consisted primarily of various degrees of oxidized 14c otps and small 1 amounts of parent compound micropollutants except for ibuprofen thus lower adsorption of otps to activated carbon compared with parent compounds can be expected after ozonation the decline in adsorption of otps at higher ozone doses can be explained by the reduction in their aromaticity or hydrophobicity and was seen despite the beneficial effect of the decreased aromaticity as indicated by the uva254 values table s2 and adsorption as shown in fig s2 of dom the observed decrease in otp adsorption was also supported by in silico calculations of the hydrophobicity of previously identified otps indicating a general decrease in logd values during ozonation with a significant decrease in hydrophobicity after the formation of carboxylic acids tables s7 s12 comparing the adsorption of otps from various parent compounds the two highest adsorbing micropollutants trimethoprim and bisphenol a underwent the largest decreases in adsorption of their respective otps from 100 to 27 and 39 respectively at 0 3 g o3 g doc 10 mg pac l whereas that of carbamazepine otps did not fall to the same extent from 100 to 67 at 0 3 g o3 g doc 10 mg pac l for trimethoprim and bisphenol a the large decrease in otp adsorption could be explained by the high reactivity of the aromatic rings deborde et al 2008 kuang et al 2013 where ozonation is likely to result in ring cleavage this reduces both aromaticity and hydrophobicity and thus their potential for adsorption to activated carbon via π π interactions and hydrophobic interactions moreno castilla 2004 for bisphenol a the largest decrease in otp hydrophobicity was predicted after ring cleavage and muconic acid formation table s10 the adsorption of otps from bisphenol a ring u 14c and bisphenol a propyl 2 14c experienced similar decreases after ozonation suggesting that 14c labeled moieties were connected to similar otps or otps with similar affinities for adsorption however based on the expected formation of small carboxylic acids after ozone induced cleavage of the phenol ring yamamoto et al 1979 a somewhat lower adsorption could be expected for otps from ring labeled bisphenol a than for otps for propyl labeled bisphenol a for trimethoprim ring opened otps have not been reported table s12 but are likely to be formed with increasing ozone doses due to the high reactivity of the both rings at ph 7 dodd et al 2006 the aromatic rings of carbamazepine however have low reactivities toward ozone mcdowell et al 2005 suggesting that the aromaticity of its otps and thus potential for π π interactions is partially preserved during ozonation the predicted hydrophobicity of the major otps bqm bqd and baqd with preserved aromatic rings were also similar to that of carbamazepine but lower for the carboxylic product baqd mcdowell et al 2005 table s11 for sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine the adsorption trends were similar for the parent compounds and otps the decreased adsorption of the otps might have been attributed to greater polarity and decreased aromaticity that was caused by the ozonation or cleavage of the aniline ring ring cleavage could also be expected from the observed 14co2 formation during ozonation of the two sulfonamides predicted hydrophobicity of previously observed sulfamethoxazole otps that had the 14c labeled moiety intact all had comparable logd values log d 0 35 0 73 table s7 but did not include the ring cleavage observed in this study the adsorption of transformation products of ibuprofen did not decrease to the same degree as those of other compounds as discussed ibuprofen has low reactivity toward ozone and was the only parent compound that was present in substantial residual concentrations 40 after ozonation at 0 3 g o3 g doc therefore the observed adsorption pattern at 0 3 g o3 g doc is influenced by two separate effects i increased adsorption of 14c labeled ibuprofen after ozonation due to decreased competition of the dom for adsorption sites and ii decreased adsorption of 14c labeled otps after ozonation due to the low reactivity of the aromatic ring huber et al 2003 a small decrease in the adsorption of ibuprofen otps could be expected the overall adsorption of 14c otps to pac in this study was low in comparison to the adsorption of many individual otps observed recently gulde et al 2021b when applying lc hr ms ms based methods detecting the otps that are generated might be difficult for small and polar compounds such as after aromatic ring cleavage gulde et al 2021a in contrast the 14c based approach allows one to track heavily transformed compounds whenever their 14c labeled carbon remain connected thus we hypothesize that the 14c based approach to a larger extent represents higher generation transformation products with increased polarity lower aromaticity and thereby reduced adsorption to activated carbon although the partial loss of 14c moieties from the main otp is expected particularly for compounds with 14c labeling in ozone reactive moieties the consistent decreases in the adsorption of 14c otps suggests that a general decline in otp adsorption can be expected with rising ozone doses in combination with high resolution mass spectrometry 14c labeling in a specific position could assist in the elucidation and exclusion of potential transformation pathways as previously done for biological systems achermann et al 2018 falås et al 2018 by labeling one compound in different positions it may further be possible to assist in the discrimination between different transformation pathways of the same compound and to elucidate the adsorption potential of different groups of otps originating from the same compound finally our results indicate the possibility of providing structure based prediction schemes for 14co2 formation of key micropollutant moieties such as carboxylic groups and aniline rings by targeted 14c labeling 4 conclusion nine 14c labeled micropollutants were ozonated to study the mineralization of various 14c labeled moieties and examine the overall adsorption of the 14c labeled transformation products to activated carbon yielding the following conclusions several micropollutants were partially mineralized during ozonation and some 14c labeled moieties were mineralized up to 40 at 1 g o3 g doc which is considerably higher than for dom 10 as doc the degree of 14co2 formation was affected by the position of the 14c labeled moiety as confirmed by labeling of one compound at different positions similar extents of 14co2 formation could also be observed for micropollutants that were labeled at the same moiety ozonation decreased the dose of pac that was required for 80 micropollutant removal by 20 30 in pre ozonated water at 0 3 g o3 g doc and by 40 70 at 1 g o3 g doc the increase in parent compound adsorption was associated with declining adsorption of dom the adsorption of otps to activated carbon decreased with increasing ozone doses for all micropollutants most likely attributed to a successive decline in hydrophobicity and aromaticity of the otps during ozonation reducing the potential for adsorption to activated carbon via π π or hydrophobic interactions with regard to combining ozonation and activated carbon adsorption our results indicate that most otps cannot be expected to undergo substantial removal by adsorption to activated carbon this raises the question whether adsorption to activated carbon is a viable option for removing a range of ozonation transformation products however in contrast to pac processes biological activated carbon filters can remove otps via the two mechanisms adsorption and biodegradation and their combined ability to remove otps needs further investigations declaration of competing

15741,ozonation transformation products otps are largely unknown compounds that are formed during the ozonation of micropollutants and it is uncertain to which extent these compounds can be removed by subsequent adsorption to activated carbon thus 14c labeled micropollutants were ozonated to generate 14c labeled otps for which the adsorption of the sum of all 14c labeled otps to activated carbon could be determined based on the adsorption of the labeled carbon further 14co2 traps were used to examine the mineralization of 14c labeled moieties during ozonation 14co2 formation revealed a partial mineralization of the 14c labeled moieties in all compounds except for propyl labeled bisphenol a and o methyl labeled naproxen a similar degree of mineralization was noted for different compounds labeled at the same moiety including the carboxylic carbon in diclofenac and ibuprofen 40 at 1 g o3 g doc and the aniline ring in sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine 30 at 1 g o3 g doc aromatic ring cleavage was also confirmed for bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine through the formation of 14co2 the adsorption experiments demonstrated increased adsorption of micropollutants to powdered activated carbon after ozonation which was connected to a decreased adsorption of dissolved organic matter dom conversely the otps showed a substantial and successive decline in adsorption at increased ozone doses for all compounds likely due to decreased hydrophobicity and aromaticity of the otps these findings indicate that adsorption to activated carbon alone is not a viable removal method for a wide range of ozonation transformation products graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceuticals transformation products 14c labeling wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ozonation and activated carbon adsorption are the two most frequently used technologies for the abatement of organic micropollutants in municipal wastewater both technologies can remove a wide range of organic micropollutants although their mechanisms differ fundamentally activated carbon removes micropollutants through adsorption moreno castilla 2004 whereas ozonation oxidizes micropollutants through direct reactions with ozone or secondarily formed hydroxyl radicals von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone based and activated carbon based processes are usually operated individually but their combination in which ozonation is performed as a pretreatment to activated carbon adsorption is also being explored boehler et al 2020 guillossou et al 2020 reungoat et al 2010 schollée et al 2021 these studies have mainly focused on biological activated carbon filters where both adsorption and biodegradation can occur several benefits of sequential ozonation and activated carbon adsorption have been proposed this combination is expected to result in greater overall removal of a wide variety of organic micropollutants because some compounds are better removed by ozonation and vice versa altmann et al 2014 margot et al 2013 ozonation also decreases the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of effluent organic matter świetlik et al 2004 treguer et al 2010 which decreases the competition between organic micropollutants and effluent organic matter for adsorption sites on activated carbon resulting in lower carbon usage rates guillossou et al 2020 zietzschmann et al 2015 activated carbon adsorption can further improve the removal of ozone oxidation products such as byproducts formed from the wastewater matrix and ozonation transformation products otps formed from micropollutants although the potential for adsorbing them remains largely unknown post ozonation toxicity might be connected to the formation of organic and inorganic byproducts such as bromate soltermann et al 2016 nitrosamines hollender et al 2009 aldehydes lopachin and gavin 2014 wert et al 2007 and otps prasse et al 2012 wei et al 2021 otps often have lower specific toxicities compared with their parent compounds dodd et al 2009 huber et al 2004 lange et al 2006 but have also shown increased nonspecific toxicity in experiments with isolated organic micropollutants e g abellán et al 2008 kuang et al 2013 sui et al 2017 biological treatment of ozonated water has been recommended to reduce toxicity stalter et al 2010 although seem unable to remove many of the otps that form edefell et al 2021 knopp et al 2016 by combining biodegradation and adsorption in granular activated carbon gac filters an improved removal of otps has been observed knopp et al 2016 direct adsorption onto powdered activated carbon pac is another promising option for the removal of otps gulde et al 2021b these findings have thus prompted further examination of the adsorption of otps to activated carbon potential otps have primarily been identified using various applications of solid phase extraction spe followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry these approaches have led to the identification of a large number of otps the elucidation of transformation pathways and have enabled otps to be tracked in various treatment trains bourgin et al 2018 gulde et al 2021a hermes et al 2020 knopp et al 2016 yet an unknown number of otps remain undetected due to the lack of mass balancing hübner et al 2015 and the expected otps from many aromatic and olefinic compounds have been difficult to detect gulde et al 2021a likely due to their increased polarity and smaller size further otps can be partially mineralized during ozonation although the extent to which the mineralization of micropollutants occurs during ozonation in municipal wastewater remains largely unknown with respect to the overall tracking of otps the use of 14c labeled micropollutants could be useful because their ozonation results in the formation of 14c labeled otps the overall behavior of which comprises a large amount of otp structures that can be tracked and clearly separated from other byproducts and effluent organic matter through their 14c activities ß decay further 14c labeled micropollutants in conjunction with co2 traps can be used to study mineralization pathways for various 14c labeled moieties during such processes as ozonation amir tahmasseb et al 2002 massey and lavy 1997 biodegradation betsholtz et al 2021 and their combination tian et al 2017 however 14c labeling has not been applied to investigate the overall adsorption behavior of 14c labeled otps formed at different ozone doses this study aims to investigate formation of 14co2 from certain 14c labeled moieties in micropollutants during ozonation and to estimate the potential for adsorption of the generated 14c labeled transformation products onto powdered activated carbon pac adsorption experiments were performed along a gradient of pac doses with the formed 14c labeled transformation products from a set of 14c labeled micropollutants at different ozone doses 2 materials and methods ozonation experiments were performed with 14c labeled and the corresponding non radiolabeled micropollutants and the subsequent adsorption experiments were conducted with the same 14c labeled micropollutants and the 14c labeled otps as illustrated in fig 1 and detailed in sections 2 2 2 3 2 1 micropollutant

et al 2003 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 2 2 ozonation of radiolabeled and non radiolabeled micropollutants the ozonation experiments were performed in 500 ml glass reactors that contained 100 ml of filtered 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate whatman wastewater retrieved after the secondary settler at källby wwtp in lund sweden the wastewater was initially adjusted to ph 7 0 with 10 mm nah2po4 buffer

were spiked with the corresponding non radiolabeled micropollutants resulting in concentrations spiked background of 4 7 μg l table s1 additional reactors were prepared for ozonation before the addition of 14c labeled micropollutants to isolate the influence of ozonation on the subsequent adsorption of the parent compound a stock solution of ozone was prepared with an ozone generator gm1

spectrophotometrically uv vis dr6000 hach at 600 nm with potassium indigotrisulfonate per the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 the ozone stock solution was added to the reactors with a glass pipette under constant stirring to reach doses of approximately 0 0 3 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc based on triplicate measurements of ozone before and after dosing in each experiment to capture the 14co2 that formed during the ozonation of 14c labeled micropollutants a glass tube of 30 ml 1 5 cm that contained 20 ml 1 m naoh was inserted into each reactor after the addition of ozone stock solution the reactors were sealed immediately with a rubber septum and incubated under dark conditions at 20 c and 130 rpm for 40 h to allow the 14co2 that formed to reach the co2 trap control experiments fig s1 showed that the co2 trap removed 95 of the inorganic carbon from the wastewater within 24 h liquid samples from the non 14c reactors were then collected in 100 ml hdpe bottles and frozen for micropollutant analysis in reactors with 14c labeled micropollutants samples 3 ml from the liquid phases and co2 traps were transferred to eppendorf tubes for analysis of 14c activity within 24 h the remaining liquid phase approximately 100 ml was used for subsequent adsorption experiments which started immediately after the ozonation experiments 2 3 adsorption experiments after the ozonation

ozonation of 14c labeled micropollutants in wastewater was performed to evaluate 14co2 formation from specific moieties and to investigate the overall adsorption of the generated 14c labeled otps to

ozonation experiments the ozone doses approximated the targets 0 3 0 1 0 6 0 1 and 1 0 0 1 g o3 g doc and resulted in similar reductions in uva254 between experiments table s5 low mineralization of

in the upper panels of fig 3 for all compounds except naproxen o methyl 14c and bisphenol a propyl 2 14c some of the 14c labeled moieties were mineralized to 14co2 as evidenced by the increased 14c activity in the co2 traps the extent of 14co2 formation increased with higher specific ozone doses and was accompanied by decreasing 14c activity in the corresponding liquid phases the total 14c activity in the reactors liquid phase co2 trap approximated the initial activity within 5 by combining the results on the ozonation of radiolabeled and non radiolabeled mps we calculated the distribution of 14c activity between 14c mps 14c otps and 14co2 fig 3 lower panels in experiments with non radiolabeled micropollutants nearly complete transformation of all compounds was observed

tables s5 and s6 consistent with previous results lee et al 2013 and as expected from the high specific ozone reactivities of all compounds except for ibuprofen 3 1 1 co2 formation from 14c labeled moieties sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine 14c aniline rings the two sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine showed similar degrees of 14co2 formation at each ozone dose roughly 30 at 1 g o3 g doc based on the partial mineralization of the 14c labeled aniline ring the most reactive site on sulfamethoxazole is considered to be the aniline group dodd et al 2006 oxidation of the anilinic nitrogen can result in the formation of nitro sulfamethoxazole abellán et al 2008 gao et al 2014 gómez ramos et al 2011 deactivating the benzene ring hoigné and bader 1983 from further reaction with ozone still transformation of the aniline ring has also been observed via hydroxylation abellán et al 2008 and by cleavage of the aniline nitrogen resulting in quinone group formation willach et al 2017 wherein subsequent reactions with ozone could lead to the observed ring cleavage in experiments with aniline direct reactions with ozone have indicated a potential ring cleavage tekle röttering et al 2016 however no otps resulting from aromatic ring cleavage of sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine have been reported table s7 diclofenac and ibuprofen 14c carboxyl carbons diclofenac and ibuprofen were 14c labeled at their respective carboxy carbons which showed similar degrees of 14co2 formation approximately 40 at 1 g o3 g doc despite the much higher ozone reactivity for diclofenac 106 m 1 s 1 compared with ibuprofen 10 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2003 the ozone reactive sites in diclofenac include an aniline type moiety and an activated aromatic ring sein et al 2008 whereas ibuprofen lacks reactive groups and has only a slightly activated aromatic ring huber et al 2003 the similar degrees of 14co2 formation that we observed suggest that hydroxyl radicals could be involved in the mineralization of the carboxyl groups as previously proposed alharbi et al 2021 but needs to be further confirmed in experiments where the hydroxyl radical exposure is monitored or excluded bisphenol a 14c ring and propyl 2 groups during the ozonation of bisphenol a the 14c labeled aromatic rings underwent mineralization to co2 24 at 1 g o3 g doc whereas no mineralization of the 14c labeled propyl 2 group 1 at 1 g o3 g doc was observed bisphenol a has a high reactivity 7 105 m 1 s 1 deborde et al 2005 with ozone and has been reported to result in typical primary phenol otps such as catechol benzoquinone orthoquinone and muconic acid derivative deborde et al 2008 table s10 where the formation of the muconic acid derivative involves ring cleavage ozone reactions with the olefins in muconic acid has further been reported to result in the formation of new and smaller carboxylic acids where subsequent decarboxylation has been proposed as a co2 forming mechanism yamamoto et al 1979 carbamazepine 14c carbonyl carbon ozonation of 14c labeled carbamazepine resulted in low 3 mineralization of the labeled carbonyl group at 0 3 g o3 g doc but greater mineralization at higher doses 10 and 16 at 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc respectively ozonation of carbamazepine has been reported to primarily target the olefin group resulting in secondary ring formation where the formed otps have low further reactivities with ozone 7 m 1s 1 per mcdowell et al 2005 further transformation of these compounds may however proceed via reactions with hydroxyl radicals e g 7 109 m 1 s 1 and 5 109 m 1 s 1 for bqm and bqd mcdowell et al 2005 although proposed otp structures from various studies have the 14c labeled carbonyl carbon intact azaïs et al 2017 gulde et al 2021a hübner et al 2014 kråkström et al 2020 mcdowell et al 2005 table s11 the previously known transformation products can thus not fully explain the mechanisms responsible for the observed co2 formation that could be due to unknown side reactions trimethoprim 14c benzyl carbon ozonation of trimethoprim resulted in low 3 mineralization of the labeled benzyl group at 0 3 g o3 g doc and slightly higher mineralization 7 and 14 at 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc respectively the aromatic rings in both the diaminopyrimidine and trimethoxytololuene moieties are activated and the reactions have been proposed to occur by hydroxylation carbonylation demethylation or cleavage of the methylene group kuang et al 2013 table s12 by using model substrates diaminopyrimidine and trimethoxytoluene moieties it has further been indicated that the ozone attacks are not directly targeting the 14c labeled benzyl bridge dodd et al 2006 and the low 14co2 formation could therefore be expected to occur from previously unknown side reactions naproxen 14c o methyl carbon the ozonation of 14c labeled naproxen did not result in any 14co2 formation based on the mineralization of the labeled o methyl group at doses of up to 0 6 g o3 g doc naproxen has high reactivity 2 105 m 1 s 1 huber et al 2005 with ozone that is linked to activation of the naphthalene structure by the o methyl and alkyl moieties von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which could lead to ring opened products however attacks on the 14c labeled o methyl carbon are expected to be limited for ozone as indicated for methoxybenzene 290 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 and protonated metoprolol 330 m 1 s 1 benner et al 2008 and relatively low with hydroxyl radicals as indicated for methyl tert butyl ether koh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2001 which supports the lack of observed 14co2 formation 3 2 adsorption experiments 3 2 1 adsorption of 14c labeled parent compounds in pre ozonated wastewater the results of the adsorption experiments with 14c labeled micropollutants and their 14c labeled otps in ozonated wastewater 0 3 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc are shown in fig 4 adsorption of the radiolabeled parent compound 14c mp increased for all micropollutants after ozonation with higher degrees of adsorption seen at higher ozone doses fig 4 these results are expected based on the lower hydrophobicity and aromaticity of effluent organic matter after ozonation treguer et al 2010 by normalizing the pac dose against the initial uva254 signals for each ozone dose the adsorption patterns for the micropollutants in ozonated effluent could also be partially aligned figs s5 s7 the decreased competition of effluent organic matter for adsorption sites on the activated carbon was further indicated by the lower adsorption of dom with higher specific ozone doses fig s2 the adsorption of the parent compound was highest for trimethoprim followed by bisphenol a carbamazepine diclofenac naproxen sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and ibuprofen the adsorption affinities for these compounds could not be predicted by hydrophobicity alone as indicated by the logd values fig 2 which has been previously observed kovalova et al 2013 as reported the molecular charge impacts the adsorption pf micropollutants to activated carbon de ridder et al 2011 gidstedt et al 2022 explaining the strong adsorption of positively charged trimethoprim despite its low hydrophobicity logd 0 9 whereas negatively charged compounds with the lowest logd values sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine and ibuprofen had the lowest adsorption affinities freundlich isotherms were fitted to the experimental data to estimate the required pac dose for 80 removal of each micropollutant in the pre ozonated effluent which was spiked with micropollutants section s8 fig s3 compounds with data that did not reach this target removal ibuprofen sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine were excluded from the comparison these compounds were also poorly described by freundlich isotherms fig s3 as observed previously for poor adsorbates such as sulfamethoxazole altmann et al 2014 nam et al 2014 zietzschmann et al 2014 for the remaining compounds the concentration of pac that was required to remove 80 of the micropollutant could be decreased by 20 30 30 50 and 40 70 at pre ozonation doses of 0 3 0 6 and 1 g o3 g doc respectively fig s4 and in a similar range as for diclofenac and carbamazepine in zietzschmann et al 2015 3 2 2 adsorption of 14c labeled otps in wastewater for all compounds except ibuprofen the ozonation of 14c labeled micropollutants decreased the adsorption of 14c activity at higher ozone doses fig 4 yellow circles as shown in fig 2 the 14c activity in these samples consisted primarily of various degrees of oxidized 14c otps and small 1 amounts of parent compound micropollutants except for ibuprofen thus lower adsorption of otps to activated carbon compared with parent compounds can be expected after ozonation the decline in adsorption of otps at higher ozone doses can be explained by the reduction in their aromaticity or hydrophobicity and was seen despite the beneficial effect of the decreased aromaticity as indicated by the uva254 values table s2 and adsorption as shown in fig s2 of dom the observed decrease in otp adsorption was also supported by in silico calculations of the hydrophobicity of previously identified otps indicating a general decrease in logd values during ozonation with a significant decrease in hydrophobicity after the formation of carboxylic acids tables s7 s12 comparing the adsorption of otps from various parent compounds the two highest adsorbing micropollutants trimethoprim and bisphenol a underwent the largest decreases in adsorption of their respective otps from 100 to 27 and 39 respectively at 0 3 g o3 g doc 10 mg pac l whereas that of carbamazepine otps did not fall to the same extent from 100 to 67 at 0 3 g o3 g doc 10 mg pac l for trimethoprim and bisphenol a the large decrease in otp adsorption could be explained by the high reactivity of the aromatic rings deborde et al 2008 kuang et al 2013 where ozonation is likely to result in ring cleavage this reduces both aromaticity and hydrophobicity and thus their potential for adsorption to activated carbon via π π interactions and hydrophobic interactions moreno castilla 2004 for bisphenol a the largest decrease in otp hydrophobicity was predicted after ring cleavage and muconic acid formation table s10 the adsorption of otps from bisphenol a ring u 14c and bisphenol a propyl 2 14c experienced similar decreases after ozonation suggesting that 14c labeled moieties were connected to similar otps or otps with similar affinities for adsorption however based on the expected formation of small carboxylic acids after ozone induced cleavage of the phenol ring yamamoto et al 1979 a somewhat lower adsorption could be expected for otps from ring labeled bisphenol a than for otps for propyl labeled bisphenol a for trimethoprim ring opened otps have not been reported table s12 but are likely to be formed with increasing ozone doses due to the high reactivity of the both rings at ph 7 dodd et al 2006 the aromatic rings of carbamazepine however have low reactivities toward ozone mcdowell et al 2005 suggesting that the aromaticity of its otps and thus potential for π π interactions is partially preserved during ozonation the predicted hydrophobicity of the major otps bqm bqd and baqd with preserved aromatic rings were also similar to that of carbamazepine but lower for the carboxylic product baqd mcdowell et al 2005 table s11 for sulfamethoxazole and sulfadiazine the adsorption trends were similar for the parent compounds and otps the decreased adsorption of the otps might have been attributed to greater polarity and decreased aromaticity that was caused by the ozonation or cleavage of the aniline ring ring cleavage could also be expected from the observed 14co2 formation during ozonation of the two sulfonamides predicted hydrophobicity of previously observed sulfamethoxazole otps that had the 14c labeled moiety intact all had comparable logd values log d 0 35 0 73 table s7 but did not include the ring cleavage observed in this study the adsorption of transformation products of ibuprofen did not decrease to the same degree as those of other compounds as discussed ibuprofen has low reactivity toward ozone and was the only parent compound that was present in substantial residual concentrations 40 after ozonation at 0 3 g o3 g doc therefore the observed adsorption pattern at 0 3 g o3 g doc is influenced by two separate effects i increased adsorption of 14c labeled ibuprofen after ozonation due to decreased competition of the dom for adsorption sites and ii decreased adsorption of 14c labeled otps after ozonation due to the low reactivity of the aromatic ring huber et al 2003 a small decrease in the adsorption of ibuprofen otps could be expected the overall adsorption of 14c otps to pac in this study was low in comparison to the adsorption of many individual otps observed recently gulde et al 2021b when applying lc hr ms ms based methods detecting the otps that are generated might be difficult for small and polar compounds such as after aromatic ring cleavage gulde et al 2021a in contrast the 14c based approach allows one to track heavily transformed compounds whenever their 14c labeled carbon remain connected thus we hypothesize that the 14c based approach to a larger extent represents higher generation transformation products with increased polarity lower aromaticity and thereby reduced adsorption to activated carbon although the partial loss of 14c moieties from the main otp is expected particularly for compounds with 14c labeling in ozone reactive moieties the consistent decreases in the adsorption of 14c otps suggests that a general decline in otp adsorption can be expected with rising ozone doses in combination with high resolution mass spectrometry 14c labeling in a specific position could assist in the elucidation and exclusion of potential transformation pathways as previously done for biological systems achermann et al 2018 falås et al 2018 by labeling one compound in different positions it may further be possible to assist in the discrimination between different transformation pathways of the same compound and to elucidate the adsorption potential of different groups of otps originating from the same compound finally our results indicate the possibility of providing structure based prediction schemes for 14co2 formation of key micropollutant moieties such as carboxylic groups and aniline rings by targeted 14c labeling 4 conclusion nine 14c labeled micropollutants were ozonated to study the mineralization of various 14c labeled moieties and examine the overall adsorption of the 14c labeled transformation products to activated carbon yielding the following conclusions several micropollutants were partially mineralized during ozonation and some 14c labeled moieties were mineralized up to 40 at 1 g o3 g doc which is considerably higher than for dom 10 as doc the degree of 14co2 formation was affected by the position of the 14c labeled moiety as confirmed by labeling of one compound at different positions similar extents of 14co2 formation could also be observed for micropollutants that were labeled at the same moiety ozonation decreased the dose of pac that was required for 80 micropollutant removal by 20 30 in pre ozonated water at 0 3 g o3 g doc and by 40 70 at 1 g o3 g doc the increase in parent compound adsorption was associated with declining adsorption of dom the adsorption of otps to activated carbon decreased with increasing ozone doses for all micropollutants most likely attributed to a successive decline in hydrophobicity and aromaticity of the otps during ozonation reducing the potential for adsorption to activated carbon via π π or hydrophobic interactions with regard to combining ozonation and activated carbon adsorption our results indicate that most otps cannot be expected to undergo substantial removal by adsorption to activated carbon this raises the question whether adsorption to activated carbon is a viable option for removing a range of ozonation transformation products however in contrast to pac processes biological activated carbon filters can remove otps via the two mechanisms adsorption and biodegradation and their combined ability to remove otps needs further investigations declaration of competing

focus on construction of a synthetic protein for simultaneously binding plant roots and functional bacteria two artificial proteins i e the control protein gc and the useful protein lcgc were then designed and expressed in a yeast cell factory as revealed by confocal microscopy of the gfp fluorescence both kind of the synthetic proteins were highly expressed in the engineered yeast cells scgc and sclcgc cultured in the induction medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source moreover the two proteins were distributed in the whole cells rather than accumulated in the vacuoles indicated by fm4 64 fig 2 a suggesting cytosol residence of the two proteins and their successful escape from vacuolar degradation both gc and lcgc were then extracted from the engineered yeast cells and grafted onto msns for further glucan lps ta binding assays as revealed by quantification of fluorescence intensity both msn gc and msn lcgc containing 200 mg l of the proteins adsorbed 95 of fitc glucan at the glucan concentration of 10 mg l and 60 even at 200 mg l fig 2b while gc and lcgc adsorbed comparably high level glucan they had different capacity to adsorb the bacterial cell wall components i e the gram negative cell wall component lps and the gram positive component ta fig 2c 2d for example during co incubation of the grafted msns with lps or ta at the initial concentration of 200 mg l msn lcgc adsorbed 68 of lps or 55 ta while msn gc only adsorbed 4 lps or 3 5 ta fig 2c d therefore the presence of the lccl domain endowed lcgc the strong lps ta binding capacity together these results revealed that lcgc had high capacity to bind both glucan and the bacterial cell wall components 3 2 recruitment of functional bacterial cells by lcgc since lcgc could strongly bind the bacterial cell wall components we further investigated its capacity to bind functional bacteria glass slides were firstly pre coated by gc or lcgc followed by addition of the functional bacterium cupriavidus taiwanensis nkb2 ct as revealed by confocal microscopy and cfu assays the gc coated slides only adsorbed few ct cells with the percent of adhered ct cells at a quite low level 4 5 fig 3 a b in contrast the lcgc coated slides adsorbed a high level of ct cells 86 fig 3a b moreover while gc remained to adhere on the slide surface during the slide bacterial cell co incubation lcgc remarkably escaped from the slide surface and bound the bacterial cells indicating the strong interaction between lcgc and the bacterial cells fig 3a similar results were observed during the co incubation of the slides with the other functional bacterium pseudomonas putida nkb21 pp with the percent of adhered cells by lcgc coated slides much higher than that by gc coated slides 95 versus 3 fig 3c d these results revealed that lcgc had much stronger capacity to bind and recruit natural bacterial cells 3 3 lcgc enhanced colonization of single functional bacterium on plant roots owing to the strong bacterium binding capacity of lcgc we hypothesized that it may enhance root recruitment of functional bacteria for further colonization to verify this the model plant lemna minor which is widely applied in phytoremediation of wastewater was used to test the bacterial colonization ability after 7 days of co incubation of the lemna minor plants and the ct cells in the simulated wastewater the plant roots were sampled for sem observation as shown in fig 4 the roots of the control and gc treated groups had bare surfaces with few microbial cells sparsely distributed on the surfaces in contrast the roots of the lcgc were coated by dense microbial biofilms with abundant bacterial cells accumulated on the root surfaces indicated by white arrows fig 4 this result indicated that lcgc strongly enhanced colonization of bacterial cells on the lemna minor roots to further investigate whether the added functional ct cells existed on the roots rhizosphere microbiome assays were performed after 7 days of co incubation the ct lcgc group had significantly lower simpson index than the control and ct gc groups 0 9215 versus 0 9464 0 9651 fig 5 a together with lower shannon index 5 0279 versus 5 2749 5 8344 fig 5b the lower simpson and shannon indexes of the ct lcgc group indicated lower microbial diversity of this group than the other two groups furthermore as revealed by relative abundance assays the ct lcgc group had much higher abundance of the genus cupriavidus in the rhizosphere microbiome than the control and ct gc groups 0 04 versus 0 00007 0 002 fig 5c but had lower abundance of several predominant genera such as brevundimonas caulobacter delftia methyophilus and the members of burkholderiaceae fig 5d fig s1 these results revealed that lcgc enhanced colonization of the functional bacterium ct on the lemna minor roots the above results claimed that lcgc functioned as a bridge between the plant roots and the bacterial cells in the wastewater this bridge could effectively increase root recruitment of functional bacterium ct so that ct gain advantage over the original ecological niche in the rhizosphere microbiome of lemna minor which resulted in a slight decrease in the biodiversity of rhizosphere microbes correspondingly the decrease in the abundance of the predominant microbes facilitated colonization of the functional ct cells on the roots which may further enhance phytoremediation of plants 3 4 lcgc improved plant growth and stress tolerance with single functional bacteria colonization of functional bacteria on the roots may facilitate stress tolerance and growth of the plants rostami and azhdarpoor 2019 jan et al 2021 the influence of lcgc and ct on the growth rate of lemna minor was then evaluated in the cadmium containing simulated wastewater the combination of ct and gc has no obvious impact on plant growth rate on day 4 and only slightly increased the relative growth rate on day 7 fig 6 a in contrast the combination of ct and lcgc led to remarkable increase in the relative growth rate from 0 25 to 0 39 on day 4 and from 0 20 to 0 56 on day 7 fig 6a chlorophyll quantification further showed that the plants of the ct lcgc group had higher levels of both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b than the control and ct gc groups 80 mg g fw versus 62 mg g fw for chlorophyll a and 50 mg g fw versus 42 mg g fw for chlorophyll b fig 6b c therefore the combination of ct and lcgc strongly promoted plant growth and chlorophyll synthesis one important toxicity mechanism of cadmium and other heavy metals to plants is to induce oxidative stress that leads to lipid peroxidation and mda accumulation haider et al 2021 rizwan et al 2018 as revealed by mda assays the whole plants of the control and the ct gc groups exhibited high mda levels at 8 8 nmol g fw on day 4 and at 8 0 nmol g fw on day 7 fig 6d in contrast the plants of the ct lcgc group had remarkable lower mda levels 6 9 nmol g fw on day 4 and 5 3 nmol g fw on day 7 fig 6d meanwhile as compared to the control and ct gc groups the ct lcgc group exhibited higher enzyme activity in the whole plants including cat sod and pod fig s2 these results implied that the combination of ct and lcgc greatly improved the antioxidant activity to attenuate cadmium induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation which may protect the plant from cadmium toxicity and promote plant growth 3 5 lcgc enhanced cadmium removal by plants with single functional bacterium the increase in growth biomass of the plants may promote phytoremediation capacity rostami and azhdarpoor 2019 jan et al 2021 to evaluate the effect of lcgc on cadmium removal by lemna minor plants with ct both the whole plants and the treated wastewater were used for cadmium quantification in the control group cadmium contents of the whole plants gradually increased from 7 1 μg g fw to 10 3 μg g fw with the culturing time increasing from day 2 to day 7 fig 7 a while the ct gc group had only slightly increased plant cadmium contents than the control group the ct lcgc group exhibited remarkably higher plant cadmium contents at each time point with the contents increasing from 12 6 μg g fw to 18 6 μg g fw fig 7a cadmium quantification of the treated wastewater further revealed that the water cadmium levels of the ct lcgc group were significantly lower than the other two groups 210 μg l versus 264 286 μg l on day 4 and 87 μg l versus 175 240 μg l on day 7 fig 7b therefore lcgc strongly enhanced the cadmium removing capacity of the plants in the presence of single functional ct cells 3 6 lcgc enhanced root colonization of multiple functional bacteria and cadmium removal multiple functional bacteria commonly lead to better outcome than single functional bacteria in complex microbial systems e g the rhizosphere microbiome ke et al 2021 arif et al 2020 to investigate whether lcgc was also useful for colonization of multiple functional bacteria two functional bacterial strains with high cadmium capturing capacity i e the cupriavidus taiwanensis nkb2 ct and the p putida nkb21 pp were simultaneously added into the wastewater in the presence of gc ct pp gc or lcgc ct pp lcgc followed by lemna minor culturing as revealed by rhizosphere microbiome assays the ct pp gc group had the genus cupriavidus not existing in the control group with low relative abundance together with the genus pseudomonas with the relative abundance similar to the control group indicating that gc only slightly promoted colonization of ct cells and failed to promote colonization of pp cells fig 8 a in contrast the ct pp lcgc group had both functional genera at much higher relative abundance values than the ct pp gc group 0 12 versus 0 07 for cupriavidus 0 16 versus 0 04 for pseudomonas fig 8a meanwhile similar to the ct lcgc group the ct pp lcgc group had remarkably lower abundance of the predominant genera such as acidovorax hydrogenophaga methylophilus mtheylotenera peredibacter and chloroplast than the ct pp gc group fig 8b these results indicated that lcgc also strongly promoted simultaneous colonization of the two functional bacteria ct and pp on the plant roots the growth rate of the plants was further evaluated similarly the addition of ct pp gc into the wastewater only slightly increased the growth rate of the plants from 0 24 to 0 31 on day 4 and from 0 22 to 0 34 on day 7 however the addition of ct pp lcgc strongly promoted the growth rate to 0 43 on day 4 and to 0 61 on day 7 fig s3a biochemical analysis further showed that ct pp lcgc led to higher chlorophyll a contents 89 mg g fw versus 76 mg g fw on day 4 84 mg g fw versus 76 mg g fw on day 7 fig s3b higher chlorophyll b contents 53 mg g fw versus 44 mg g fw on day 4 63 mg g fw versus 41 mg g fw on day 7 fig s3c and lower mda levels than ct pp gc 5 8 nmol g fw versus 8 4 nmol g fw on day 4 4 1 mg g fw versus 7 5 mg g fw on day 7 fig s3d consistently the ct pp lcgc group had higher levels of sod cat and pod levels than the other two groups fig s4 in addition as compared to the ct lcgc group the ct pp lcgc group exhibited higher growth rate of the plants fig s5 but had comparable contents of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b mda and activity of antioxidant enzymes fig s6 these results revealed that the multiple functional bacteria with the aid of lcgc had stronger capacity to promote plant growth and also facilitated stress resistance of the plants comparable to the single functional bacteria with lcgc lastly the cadmium removing capacity of the groups was investigated the use of the multiple functional bacteria with gc or lcgc obviously enhanced plant cadmium accumulation fig 8c as compared to ct pp gc ct pp lcgc led to the increase in plant cadmium contents to higher levels 19 3 μg g fw versus 14 7 μg g fw on day 4 22 9 μg g versus 16 5 μg g fw fig 8c correspondingly the ct pp lcgc group displayed lower water cadmium levels than the control and ct pp gc groups e g 41 μg l versus 87 μg l for control and 226 μg l for ct pp gc on day 7 fig 8d similarly ct pp lcgc led to stronger plant cadmium accumulation and lower water cadmium levels than ct lcgc fig s7a s7b confirming the higher capacity of multiple functional bacteria with lcgc than that of single functional bacterium with lcgc in addition the groups had similar water cadmium levels on day 7 and on day 14 fig s8 indicating that the cadmium removal capacity of the plants tended to be stable after 7 days besides the heavy metal pollutant total organic matter total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the treated wastewater were also measured to evaluate the capacity of the plants together with the functional bacteria to remove other pollutants similarly the lcgc groups i e ct lcgc and ct pp lcgc had much lower levels of the other tested pollutants than the control and gc containing groups after 7 days of treatment fig s9 for example while ct gc and ct pp gc only slightly reduced total nitrogen to 0 44 0 47 mg l ct lcgc and ct pp lcgc strongly reduced total nitrogen to 0 32 mg l fig s9b therefore lcgc also promoted removal of other water pollutants by the plants with the aid of the functional bacteria 4 discussion in this study the relative growth rate of the lemna minor growth together with the levels of leaf chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in the ct lcgc group were significantly higher than those in the control and gc group this indicated that the lcgc group had a better growth situation on the other hand as compared to the control and ct gc groups the ct lcgc group had lower mda levels and higher antioxidant enzyme activity in the whole plants at different culture time figs 6d s2 similar results were observed in the ct pp lcgc group as compared to the control and ct pp gc groups fig s3 s4 although the lcgc containing groups exhibited higher levels of plant cadmium levels than the other groups figs 7a 8c they had decreased mda levels which may be attributed to the increase in antioxidant enzyme activity by lcgc facilitated colonization of functional bacteria the strong antioxidant activity may efficiently alleviate oxidative stress induced by high level cadmium facilitating plant growth in the lcgc containing groups during the cadmium removing experiment with the single functional bacterium ct we found that the cadmium levels of the plants gradually increased leading to a decrease in water cadmium levels in the control and ct lcgc groups this may be attributed continuous cadmium uptake by the living plants and the rhizosphere functional bacteria since the ct lcgc group had the highest levels of functional ct cells together with the strongest cadmium removing capacity from the wastewater the high dense ct cells on the root surfaces may function in efficient cadmium adsorption and rapid transport of the heavy metal to the plant bodies with the aid of the lcgc linker an interesting observation is that the water cadmium levels of the ct gc group was lowest among the three groups on day 2 but were highest on day 7 with the levels increasing from 133 μg l to 240 μg l fig 7b the increase in cadmium levels of this group may be explained by a failure of ct colonization on the plant roots initially the functional ct cells strongly adsorbed cadmium in the wastewater leading to a rapid decrease in water cadmium levels in the initial 2 days however most of the functional ct cells failed to bind the plant roots owing to the absence of root bacterium linkers and therefore cadmium adsorbed by the ct cells could not be transported to the plants along with the death of ct cells cadmium in ct cells was slowly released back to the wastewater leading to the increase in water cadmium levels application of multiple bacteria is an important strategy to improve the function of complex microbial systems in this study we further tried to use multiple functional bacteria with lemna minor plants to increase the cadmium removing capacity the plants treated by ct and pp with the aid of gc or lcgc were cultured in simulated wastewater for further rhizosphere microbiome remodeling and cadmium removal as compared to the ct lcgc group the ct pp lcgc group had higher abundance of both cupriavidus and pseudomonas indicating that ct and pp interacted with each other with the aid of lcgc to enhance their colonization further experiments revealed that the ct pp lcgc group exhibited stronger cadmium removing capacity than the ct lcgc group confirming the improvement of phytoremediation by multiple functional bacteria therefore the two kinds of functional bacteria had a certain synergy in cadmium removal meanwhile consistent with the results of single ct although the ct pp gc group showed stronger plant cadmium accumulation than the control group its cadmium removing capacity was even lower than that of the ct pp lcgc group on day 7 indicating that the two functional bacteria also released their adsorbed cadmium back to the wastewater with the increase in culturing time if they did not colonize on the plant roots these results implied that lcgc strongly assisted the multiple functional bacteria to stably colonize on the plant roots and to prevent cadmium back to the wastewater moreover since the functional bacteria isolated from the nature with no pathogenicity and the engineered protein could strongly bind the plant roots and thus be removed from water by collection of the plants the application of the functional bacteria and the engineered protein could not cause new pollution for the river ecosystem it is notable that phytoremediation of heavy metal pollution assisted by the functional bacteria showed a certain degree of rebound trend which could not be offset by the combination of multiple functional bacteria this rebound effect may be due to the fact that the functional bacteria themselves did not actually destroy cadmium but only trap and store them temporarily abbas et al 2018 these bacteria with cadmium bioremediation just store the heavy metal in the cell wall or intracellular cytoplasm making heavy metals temporarily less diffusible and harmful however when the functional bacteria die the stored cadmium may be released back into the water causing a reverse increase in water cadmium levels wang et al 2020b strikingly this unfavorable trend could be significantly reduced by the synthetic protein lcgc the positive effect of lcgc on cadmium removal could be attributed to three reasons firstly lcgc may allow the functional bacteria to participate in re construction of the rhizosphere microbiome and to live around the roots in a symbiotic status for a longer living period owing to nutrient supply by the plant roots secondly lcgc binds functional bacteria by physical attachment which is mainly dependent on the bacterial cell wall and related structures in this way dead bacterial cells together with their adsorbed and fixed cadmium can still be adsorbed on the plant root surface rather than freely released into the water environment thirdly from the perspective of plants lcgc significantly increases plant growth rate enhances stress resistance and further improves the efficiency of phytoremediation phytoremediation is generally achieved by trapping and transporting cadmium to the upper layers of plants without the risk of releasing them back into the water which also reduces the rebound phenomenon overall the synthetic protein lcgc significantly reduce the rebound effect implying that lcgc in heavy metal pollution treatment may effectively solve the problems of ineffective and recurrent traditional biological treatment and may throw light on long term biological treatment of heavy metals lemna minor is a common kind of phytoplankton frequently used for aquatic phytoremediation towards heavy metals axtell et al 2003 neagu et al 2014 török et al 2015 herein we used this plant for phytoremediation of cadmium from water with the aid of functional bacteria and engineered proteins since it exhibits high growth rate and could be easily removed by collection devices from water ceschin et al 2020 during application the functional bacteria and the engineered protein lcgc could be added into polluted rivers or lakes with plants to form the plant lcgc functional bacterium system and then this system may be removed from water by mechanized devices after several days of treatment moreover the engineered protein lcgc rendered functional bacteria efficiently accumulating on the plant roots avoiding formation of bacterial sediments during short term e g 7 days phytoremediation in the future other emergent aquatic plants such as phragmites australis and cattail could also be used for testing the effect of lcgc on root recruitment of functional bacteria and removal of heavy metals in water by these plants 5 conclusion this study constructed the synthetic protein lcgc to assist root recruitment and colonization of functional bacteria for efficient phytoremediation this protein was composed of the bacterium binding domain lccl the gfp reporter and the carbohydrate binding domain cbd endowing it high capacity to bind both functional bacteria and plant roots when assisted by lcgc the lemna minor roots efficiently recruited the cadmium capturing bacteria to promote their colonization on the roots and thus exhibited high growth rate and cadmium removing capacity this study provided a physical contact based strategy to enhance the interaction

15742,functional bacteria promote the efficiency of phytoremediation by enhancing plant growth and participating in decontamination however their activity is frequently compromised by the weakness of their interaction with plant roots in this study we designed the artificial protein lcgc composed of a bacterium binding domain a gfp fluorescence reporter and a carbohydrate binding domain to function as a physical contact between functional bacteria and plant roots this protein was then expressed in an engineered yeast cell factory and extracted to assess its effect on rhizosphere

cupriavidus taiwanensis and pseudomonas putida lcgc efficiently bound bacterial cell wall components and glucan endowing it high efficiency to bind both functional bacteria and plant roots scanning microscopy and microbiome analysis revealed that lcgc enhanced root recruitment and colonization of functional bacteria on the root surfaces furthermore lcgc with the aid of single c taiwanensis or of c taiwanensis and p putida in combination promoted plant growth enhanced tolerance to cadmium induced oxidative stress and consequently improved cadmium removing capacity of the plants with the percent of cadmium removal reaching up to 91 for lcgc plus c taiwanensis and to 96 for lcgc plus c taiwanensis and p putida on day 7 this study provided a physical contact based strategy to enhance

phytoremediation these plants may decontaminate the pollutants by transporting them into the plant bodies catalyzing degradation of organic pollutants and providing habitats for pollutant removing

kabra et al 2013 although bioaugmentation i e addition of functional microbes into plant culturing systems has been proven to be useful it remains a great challenge to build stable and long term

hazardous products threatening human health and disturbance of ecosystem homeostasis liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020a for avoiding the negative ecological impact of engineered organisms an alternative way is to use metabolic products especially engineered proteins of these organisms for capturing pollutants and catalyzing pollutant degradation rather than to directly release these organisms into

focus on construction of a synthetic protein for simultaneously binding plant roots and functional bacteria two artificial proteins i e the control protein gc and the useful protein lcgc were then designed and expressed in a yeast cell factory as revealed by confocal microscopy of the gfp fluorescence both kind of the synthetic proteins were highly expressed in the engineered yeast cells scgc and sclcgc cultured in the induction medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source moreover the two proteins were distributed in the whole cells rather than accumulated in the vacuoles indicated by fm4 64 fig 2 a suggesting cytosol residence of the two proteins and their successful escape from vacuolar degradation both gc and lcgc were then extracted from the engineered yeast cells and grafted onto msns for further glucan lps ta binding assays as revealed by quantification of fluorescence intensity both msn gc and msn lcgc containing 200 mg l of the proteins adsorbed 95 of fitc glucan at the glucan concentration of 10 mg l and 60 even at 200 mg l fig 2b while gc and lcgc adsorbed comparably high level glucan they had different capacity to adsorb the bacterial cell wall components i e the gram negative cell wall component lps and the gram positive component ta fig 2c 2d for example during co incubation of the grafted msns with lps or ta at the initial concentration of 200 mg l msn lcgc adsorbed 68 of lps or 55 ta while msn gc only adsorbed 4 lps or 3 5 ta fig 2c d therefore the presence of the lccl domain endowed lcgc the strong lps ta binding capacity together these results revealed that lcgc had high capacity to bind both glucan and the bacterial cell wall components 3 2 recruitment of functional bacterial cells by lcgc since lcgc could strongly bind the bacterial cell wall components we further investigated its capacity to bind functional bacteria glass slides were firstly pre coated by gc or lcgc followed by addition of the functional bacterium cupriavidus taiwanensis nkb2 ct as revealed by confocal microscopy and cfu assays the gc coated slides only adsorbed few ct cells with the percent of adhered ct cells at a quite low level 4 5 fig 3 a b in contrast the lcgc coated slides adsorbed a high level of ct cells 86 fig 3a b moreover while gc remained to adhere on the slide surface during the slide bacterial cell co incubation lcgc remarkably escaped from the slide surface and bound the bacterial cells indicating the strong interaction between lcgc and the bacterial cells fig 3a similar results were observed during the co incubation of the slides with the other functional bacterium pseudomonas putida nkb21 pp with the percent of adhered cells by lcgc coated slides much higher than that by gc coated slides 95 versus 3 fig 3c d these results revealed that lcgc had much stronger capacity to bind and recruit natural bacterial cells 3 3 lcgc enhanced colonization of single functional bacterium on plant roots owing to the strong bacterium binding capacity of lcgc we hypothesized that it may enhance root recruitment of functional bacteria for further colonization to verify this the model plant lemna minor which is widely applied in phytoremediation of wastewater was used to test the bacterial colonization ability after 7 days of co incubation of the lemna minor plants and the ct cells in the simulated wastewater the plant roots were sampled for sem observation as shown in fig 4 the roots of the control and gc treated groups had bare surfaces with few microbial cells sparsely distributed on the surfaces in contrast the roots of the lcgc were coated by dense microbial biofilms with abundant bacterial cells accumulated on the root surfaces indicated by white arrows fig 4 this result indicated that lcgc strongly enhanced colonization of bacterial cells on the lemna minor roots to further investigate whether the added functional ct cells existed on the roots rhizosphere microbiome assays were performed after 7 days of co incubation the ct lcgc group had significantly lower simpson index than the control and ct gc groups 0 9215 versus 0 9464 0 9651 fig 5 a together with lower shannon index 5 0279 versus 5 2749 5 8344 fig 5b the lower simpson and shannon indexes of the ct lcgc group indicated lower microbial diversity of this group than the other two groups furthermore as revealed by relative abundance assays the ct lcgc group had much higher abundance of the genus cupriavidus in the rhizosphere microbiome than the control and ct gc groups 0 04 versus 0 00007 0 002 fig 5c but had lower abundance of several predominant genera such as brevundimonas caulobacter delftia methyophilus and the members of burkholderiaceae fig 5d fig s1 these results revealed that lcgc enhanced colonization of the functional bacterium ct on the lemna minor roots the above results claimed that lcgc functioned as a bridge between the plant roots and the bacterial cells in the wastewater this bridge could effectively increase root recruitment of functional bacterium ct so that ct gain advantage over the original ecological niche in the rhizosphere microbiome of lemna minor which resulted in a slight decrease in the biodiversity of rhizosphere microbes correspondingly the decrease in the abundance of the predominant microbes facilitated colonization of the functional ct cells on the roots which may further enhance phytoremediation of plants 3 4 lcgc improved plant growth and stress tolerance with single functional bacteria colonization of functional bacteria on the roots may facilitate stress tolerance and growth of the plants rostami and azhdarpoor 2019 jan et al 2021 the influence of lcgc and ct on the growth rate of lemna minor was then evaluated in the cadmium containing simulated wastewater the combination of ct and gc has no obvious impact on plant growth rate on day 4 and only slightly increased the relative growth rate on day 7 fig 6 a in contrast the combination of ct and lcgc led to remarkable increase in the relative growth rate from 0 25 to 0 39 on day 4 and from 0 20 to 0 56 on day 7 fig 6a chlorophyll quantification further showed that the plants of the ct lcgc group had higher levels of both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b than the control and ct gc groups 80 mg g fw versus 62 mg g fw for chlorophyll a and 50 mg g fw versus 42 mg g fw for chlorophyll b fig 6b c therefore the combination of ct and lcgc strongly promoted plant growth and chlorophyll synthesis one important toxicity mechanism of cadmium and other heavy metals to plants is to induce oxidative stress that leads to lipid peroxidation and mda accumulation haider et al 2021 rizwan et al 2018 as revealed by mda assays the whole plants of the control and the ct gc groups exhibited high mda levels at 8 8 nmol g fw on day 4 and at 8 0 nmol g fw on day 7 fig 6d in contrast the plants of the ct lcgc group had remarkable lower mda levels 6 9 nmol g fw on day 4 and 5 3 nmol g fw on day 7 fig 6d meanwhile as compared to the control and ct gc groups the ct lcgc group exhibited higher enzyme activity in the whole plants including cat sod and pod fig s2 these results implied that the combination of ct and lcgc greatly improved the antioxidant activity to attenuate cadmium induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation which may protect the plant from cadmium toxicity and promote plant growth 3 5 lcgc enhanced cadmium removal by plants with single functional bacterium the increase in growth biomass of the plants may promote phytoremediation capacity rostami and azhdarpoor 2019 jan et al 2021 to evaluate the effect of lcgc on cadmium removal by lemna minor plants with ct both the whole plants and the treated wastewater were used for cadmium quantification in the control group cadmium contents of the whole plants gradually increased from 7 1 μg g fw to 10 3 μg g fw with the culturing time increasing from day 2 to day 7 fig 7 a while the ct gc group had only slightly increased plant cadmium contents than the control group the ct lcgc group exhibited remarkably higher plant cadmium contents at each time point with the contents increasing from 12 6 μg g fw to 18 6 μg g fw fig 7a cadmium quantification of the treated wastewater further revealed that the water cadmium levels of the ct lcgc group were significantly lower than the other two groups 210 μg l versus 264 286 μg l on day 4 and 87 μg l versus 175 240 μg l on day 7 fig 7b therefore lcgc strongly enhanced the cadmium removing capacity of the plants in the presence of single functional ct cells 3 6 lcgc enhanced root colonization of multiple functional bacteria and cadmium removal multiple functional bacteria commonly lead to better outcome than single functional bacteria in complex microbial systems e g the rhizosphere microbiome ke et al 2021 arif et al 2020 to investigate whether lcgc was also useful for colonization of multiple functional bacteria two functional bacterial strains with high cadmium capturing capacity i e the cupriavidus taiwanensis nkb2 ct and the p putida nkb21 pp were simultaneously added into the wastewater in the presence of gc ct pp gc or lcgc ct pp lcgc followed by lemna minor culturing as revealed by rhizosphere microbiome assays the ct pp gc group had the genus cupriavidus not existing in the control group with low relative abundance together with the genus pseudomonas with the relative abundance similar to the control group indicating that gc only slightly promoted colonization of ct cells and failed to promote colonization of pp cells fig 8 a in contrast the ct pp lcgc group had both functional genera at much higher relative abundance values than the ct pp gc group 0 12 versus 0 07 for cupriavidus 0 16 versus 0 04 for pseudomonas fig 8a meanwhile similar to the ct lcgc group the ct pp lcgc group had remarkably lower abundance of the predominant genera such as acidovorax hydrogenophaga methylophilus mtheylotenera peredibacter and chloroplast than the ct pp gc group fig 8b these results indicated that lcgc also strongly promoted simultaneous colonization of the two functional bacteria ct and pp on the plant roots the growth rate of the plants was further evaluated similarly the addition of ct pp gc into the wastewater only slightly increased the growth rate of the plants from 0 24 to 0 31 on day 4 and from 0 22 to 0 34 on day 7 however the addition of ct pp lcgc strongly promoted the growth rate to 0 43 on day 4 and to 0 61 on day 7 fig s3a biochemical analysis further showed that ct pp lcgc led to higher chlorophyll a contents 89 mg g fw versus 76 mg g fw on day 4 84 mg g fw versus 76 mg g fw on day 7 fig s3b higher chlorophyll b contents 53 mg g fw versus 44 mg g fw on day 4 63 mg g fw versus 41 mg g fw on day 7 fig s3c and lower mda levels than ct pp gc 5 8 nmol g fw versus 8 4 nmol g fw on day 4 4 1 mg g fw versus 7 5 mg g fw on day 7 fig s3d consistently the ct pp lcgc group had higher levels of sod cat and pod levels than the other two groups fig s4 in addition as compared to the ct lcgc group the ct pp lcgc group exhibited higher growth rate of the plants fig s5 but had comparable contents of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b mda and activity of antioxidant enzymes fig s6 these results revealed that the multiple functional bacteria with the aid of lcgc had stronger capacity to promote plant growth and also facilitated stress resistance of the plants comparable to the single functional bacteria with lcgc lastly the cadmium removing capacity of the groups was investigated the use of the multiple functional bacteria with gc or lcgc obviously enhanced plant cadmium accumulation fig 8c as compared to ct pp gc ct pp lcgc led to the increase in plant cadmium contents to higher levels 19 3 μg g fw versus 14 7 μg g fw on day 4 22 9 μg g versus 16 5 μg g fw fig 8c correspondingly the ct pp lcgc group displayed lower water cadmium levels than the control and ct pp gc groups e g 41 μg l versus 87 μg l for control and 226 μg l for ct pp gc on day 7 fig 8d similarly ct pp lcgc led to stronger plant cadmium accumulation and lower water cadmium levels than ct lcgc fig s7a s7b confirming the higher capacity of multiple functional bacteria with lcgc than that of single functional bacterium with lcgc in addition the groups had similar water cadmium levels on day 7 and on day 14 fig s8 indicating that the cadmium removal capacity of the plants tended to be stable after 7 days besides the heavy metal pollutant total organic matter total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the treated wastewater were also measured to evaluate the capacity of the plants together with the functional bacteria to remove other pollutants similarly the lcgc groups i e ct lcgc and ct pp lcgc had much lower levels of the other tested pollutants than the control and gc containing groups after 7 days of treatment fig s9 for example while ct gc and ct pp gc only slightly reduced total nitrogen to 0 44 0 47 mg l ct lcgc and ct pp lcgc strongly reduced total nitrogen to 0 32 mg l fig s9b therefore lcgc also promoted removal of other water pollutants by the plants with the aid of the functional bacteria 4 discussion in this study the relative growth rate of the lemna minor growth together with the levels of leaf chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in the ct lcgc group were significantly higher than those in the control and gc group this indicated that the lcgc group had a better growth situation on the other hand as compared to the control and ct gc groups the ct lcgc group had lower mda levels and higher antioxidant enzyme activity in the whole plants at different culture time figs 6d s2 similar results were observed in the ct pp lcgc group as compared to the control and ct pp gc groups fig s3 s4 although the lcgc containing groups exhibited higher levels of plant cadmium levels than the other groups figs 7a 8c they had decreased mda levels which may be attributed to the increase in antioxidant enzyme activity by lcgc facilitated colonization of functional bacteria the strong antioxidant activity may efficiently alleviate oxidative stress induced by high level cadmium facilitating plant growth in the lcgc containing groups during the cadmium removing experiment with the single functional bacterium ct we found that the cadmium levels of the plants gradually increased leading to a decrease in water cadmium levels in the control and ct lcgc groups this may be attributed continuous cadmium uptake by the living plants and the rhizosphere functional bacteria since the ct lcgc group had the highest levels of functional ct cells together with the strongest cadmium removing capacity from the wastewater the high dense ct cells on the root surfaces may function in efficient cadmium adsorption and rapid transport of the heavy metal to the plant bodies with the aid of the lcgc linker an interesting observation is that the water cadmium levels of the ct gc group was lowest among the three groups on day 2 but were highest on day 7 with the levels increasing from 133 μg l to 240 μg l fig 7b the increase in cadmium levels of this group may be explained by a failure of ct colonization on the plant roots initially the functional ct cells strongly adsorbed cadmium in the wastewater leading to a rapid decrease in water cadmium levels in the initial 2 days however most of the functional ct cells failed to bind the plant roots owing to the absence of root bacterium linkers and therefore cadmium adsorbed by the ct cells could not be transported to the plants along with the death of ct cells cadmium in ct cells was slowly released back to the wastewater leading to the increase in water cadmium levels application of multiple bacteria is an important strategy to improve the function of complex microbial systems in this study we further tried to use multiple functional bacteria with lemna minor plants to increase the cadmium removing capacity the plants treated by ct and pp with the aid of gc or lcgc were cultured in simulated wastewater for further rhizosphere microbiome remodeling and cadmium removal as compared to the ct lcgc group the ct pp lcgc group had higher abundance of both cupriavidus and pseudomonas indicating that ct and pp interacted with each other with the aid of lcgc to enhance their colonization further experiments revealed that the ct pp lcgc group exhibited stronger cadmium removing capacity than the ct lcgc group confirming the improvement of phytoremediation by multiple functional bacteria therefore the two kinds of functional bacteria had a certain synergy in cadmium removal meanwhile consistent with the results of single ct although the ct pp gc group showed stronger plant cadmium accumulation than the control group its cadmium removing capacity was even lower than that of the ct pp lcgc group on day 7 indicating that the two functional bacteria also released their adsorbed cadmium back to the wastewater with the increase in culturing time if they did not colonize on the plant roots these results implied that lcgc strongly assisted the multiple functional bacteria to stably colonize on the plant roots and to prevent cadmium back to the wastewater moreover since the functional bacteria isolated from the nature with no pathogenicity and the engineered protein could strongly bind the plant roots and thus be removed from water by collection of the plants the application of the functional bacteria and the engineered protein could not cause new pollution for the river ecosystem it is notable that phytoremediation of heavy metal pollution assisted by the functional bacteria showed a certain degree of rebound trend which could not be offset by the combination of multiple functional bacteria this rebound effect may be due to the fact that the functional bacteria themselves did not actually destroy cadmium but only trap and store them temporarily abbas et al 2018 these bacteria with cadmium bioremediation just store the heavy metal in the cell wall or intracellular cytoplasm making heavy metals temporarily less diffusible and harmful however when the functional bacteria die the stored cadmium may be released back into the water causing a reverse increase in water cadmium levels wang et al 2020b strikingly this unfavorable trend could be significantly reduced by the synthetic protein lcgc the positive effect of lcgc on cadmium removal could be attributed to three reasons firstly lcgc may allow the functional bacteria to participate in re construction of the rhizosphere microbiome and to live around the roots in a symbiotic status for a longer living period owing to nutrient supply by the plant roots secondly lcgc binds functional bacteria by physical attachment which is mainly dependent on the bacterial cell wall and related structures in this way dead bacterial cells together with their adsorbed and fixed cadmium can still be adsorbed on the plant root surface rather than freely released into the water environment thirdly from the perspective of plants lcgc significantly increases plant growth rate enhances stress resistance and further improves the efficiency of phytoremediation phytoremediation is generally achieved by trapping and transporting cadmium to the upper layers of plants without the risk of releasing them back into the water which also reduces the rebound phenomenon overall the synthetic protein lcgc significantly reduce the rebound effect implying that lcgc in heavy metal pollution treatment may effectively solve the problems of ineffective and recurrent traditional biological treatment and may throw light on long term biological treatment of heavy metals lemna minor is a common kind of phytoplankton frequently used for aquatic phytoremediation towards heavy metals axtell et al 2003 neagu et al 2014 török et al 2015 herein we used this plant for phytoremediation of cadmium from water with the aid of functional bacteria and engineered proteins since it exhibits high growth rate and could be easily removed by collection devices from water ceschin et al 2020 during application the functional bacteria and the engineered protein lcgc could be added into polluted rivers or lakes with plants to form the plant lcgc functional bacterium system and then this system may be removed from water by mechanized devices after several days of treatment moreover the engineered protein lcgc rendered functional bacteria efficiently accumulating on the plant roots avoiding formation of bacterial sediments during short term e g 7 days phytoremediation in the future other emergent aquatic plants such as phragmites australis and cattail could also be used for testing the effect of lcgc on root recruitment of functional bacteria and removal of heavy metals in water by these plants 5 conclusion this study constructed the synthetic protein lcgc to assist root recruitment and colonization of functional bacteria for efficient phytoremediation this protein was composed of the bacterium binding domain lccl the gfp reporter and the carbohydrate binding domain cbd endowing it high capacity to bind both functional bacteria and plant roots when assisted by lcgc the lemna minor roots efficiently recruited the cadmium capturing bacteria to promote their colonization on the roots and thus exhibited high growth rate and cadmium removing capacity this study provided a physical contact based strategy to enhance the interaction between functional microbes and hosts and shed a light on application of synthetic biology in efficient phytoremediation of wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15743,seasonal temperature changes significantly affect microbial community diversity composition and performance in wastewater treatment plants however the community assembly mechanisms under seasonal temperature variations remain unclear here we carried out temperature cycling experiments 30 c 35 c 37 c 40 c 42 c 45 c 40 c and 30 c to investigate how temperature impacts microbial performance and co occurrence network and how assembly processes determine the structure and function of microbial communities during treating aniline wastewater during the 195 day operation the system achieved an efficient and stable aniline removal of 99 interestingly α diversity and network complexity were negatively correlated with temperature but could be recovered when the temperature was returned to 30 c the results showed that functional redundancy was probably responsible for the excellent microbial performance during the whole process null model analyses presented that deterministic process dominated the community when the temperature was 30 c and stochasticity dominated the assembly process when the temperature was over 30 c overall the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes in the treatment of aniline wastewater mediated the reoccurrence of microbial community and co occurrence network at different temperatures this study provides new insights into microbial community reoccurrence under seasonal temperature changes and a theoretical basis for regulating microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aniline wastewater seasonal temperature changes community assembly reoccurrence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aniline wastewater derived from dye medicine and rubber additives is hazardous to human health and ecosystem safety cui et al 2012 sun et al 2015 vikrant et al 2018 physicochemical technologies could effectively remove aniline and reduce its risk but these technologies might lead to secondary contamination chen et al 2021 cheng et al 2021 microbial technology has received increasing attention owing to its sustainable and eco friendly characteristics zhang et al 2020b currently most of the applicable temperatures for aniline degrading microorganisms are between 30 35 c making it difficult to cope with temperature changes throughout the year cao et al 2018 cui et al 2017 mohammed et al 2020 maintaining the stable function of microbial communities over a broad temperature range has become an urgent issue zhao et al 2017 understanding microbial community assembly mechanisms under seasonal temperature changes is expected to determine what controls community diversity composition and functioning which would help develop regulation strategies in wastewater treatment plants however the effects of seasonal temperature changes on microbial community assembly and functioning are still considered a black box since the community assembly mechanisms have not been well explored zhang et al 2020a mechanisms of microbial community assembly including deterministic and stochastic processes and their relationships to community functioning have become central issues in ecology sun et al 2022 previous studies suggested that deterministic processes were responsible for the community assembly in the sediment of three gorges reservoir li et al 2019 membrane bioreactors xu et al 2019 and activated sludge bioreactors griffin and wells 2017 however other studies indicated that the communities were driven mainly by stochastic processes wu et al 2019 zhou et al 2013 it is generally believed that the stochastic and deterministic processes simultaneously control microbial communities after years of controversy xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2017 also a hot debate concerns the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes in governing community diversity and functioning in natural and engineered ecosystems mo et al 2018 wan et al 2021 fortunately numerous approaches have been developed to distinguish the importance of deterministic and stochastic processes ning et al 2019 stegen et al 2013 stegen et al 2015 these approaches provided powerful tools to distinguish their relative importance in determining microbial community assembly therefore it is essential to resolve controversies concerning the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic community assembly providing a basis for targeted manipulation in wastewater treatment plants nevertheless the mechanisms of how communities assemble in response to seasonal temperature changes in aniline wastewater treatment remain unknown additionally clarifying the effects of microbial associations on ecosystem function and community stability can also help us understand the microbial performance in wastewater treatment plants jiao et al 2016 recently numerous studies have used co occurrence network analyses to illustrate the links between microorganisms and relationships between topological properties and environmental factors forster et al 2021 jiao et al 2020 but most previous studies were only concerned with the effects of abiotic factors on microbial diversity composition and functioning and rarely on potential relationships between microbial co occurrence and function and stability shi et al 2016 xun et al 2021 to better understand how microbial communities respond to environmental stress it is also significant to reveal the associations between microbial community taxa and to discover the keystone species in different networks hence disentangling these complex relationships and identifying keystones in a network is essential to better understand the functions of microbial communities which would help further develop regulation strategies in wastewater treatment plants this work aims to elucidate how seasonal temperature changes affect community structure function and assembly mechanisms during treating aniline wastewater here we selected aniline as the only organic carbon and nitrogen source for enriching aniline degrading microorganisms and compared the aniline removal performance at progressively increasing temperatures from 30 c to 45 c and then gradually decreasing to 30 c specifically we focused on three questions i how did the microbial diversity and functioning respond to simulated seasonal temperature changes during treating aniline wastewater ii which assembly process dominated the microbial community construction at different temperatures iii could the co occurrence network and keystone reoccur when the temperature was returned to 30 c 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture medium and bioreactor operation the culture medium and bioreactor operation was consistent with our previous study chen et al 2021 the average influent of aniline cod toc and tn concentrations were 221 25 14 70 432 88 16 59 200 4 17 33 94 3 50 respectively in this work the bioreactor ran continuously for 195 days to investigate the microbial performance under simulated seasonal temperature changes the activated sludge was domesticated at 30 c for 30 days to obtain a microbial community with stable performance since day 31 the temperature was changed to 35 c gradually increasing to 45 c to simulate seasonal temperature changes and better understand the response of microorganisms to temperature stress the temperature was returned to 40 c and 30 c 2 2 analytical methods water samples of the influent and effluent were taken every day and determined the supernatant after centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the concentrations of aniline chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrous nitrogen no2

platform pe300 ca usa raw data were processed using a sequencing analysis pipeline built on the galaxy platform http mem rcees ac cn 8080 2 4 data analysis the correlation tests between α diversities and environment factors were determined using pearson correlation significance was conducted by one way analysis of variance anova the principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the unweighted unifrac distance was employed to detect microbial community variation the multiresponse permutation procedure mrpp analysis of similarities anosim and permutational multivariate analysis of variance of the adonis function permanova based on both bray curtis and jaccard distance were performed to evaluate the dissimilarity of the microbial community composition between different temperatures canonical correspondence analysis cca dimensionality reduction was used to investigate the relationships between microbial communities and environmental factors variation partition analysis vpa was then conducted to determine the relative contribution of the environmental factors to the microbial community an aggregated boosted tree abt analysis was performed to quantify the effects of enviromental factors on the microbial community to explore the mechanisms of microbial community assembly we adopted a null model based statistical framework to compare the relative contributions of different ecological processes stegen et al 2013 here the relative contributions of variable selection homogeneous selection dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and drift were calculated in short differences in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity were calculated according to the value of bray curtis based raup crick rcbray and β nearest taxon index βnti stegen et al 2013 the neutral model was also employed for examining the potential contribution of stochastic processes to the microbial community assembly sloan et al 2010 the parameter r2 and m represents the overall fit to the model and immigration rate respectively microbial co occurrence networks were performed by the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens through the pmens analysis pipeline mena http ieg2 ou

seasonal temperature changes the community performance of the bioreactor was investigated for 195 days under simulated seasonal temperature changes 30 c 35 c 37 c 40 c 42 c 45 c 40 c and 30 c the residual aniline in the effluent was almost undetectable at each stable phase fig 1 however the aniline removal efficiency declined rapidly from 99 9 to 85 9 when the temperature was first adjusted from 42 c to 45 c then reached almost 100 in the stabilization period at 45 c additionally the system had excellent removal performance of cod nearly 90 during the stable stage notably the cod removal decreased slightly when the temperature was just returned to 30 c but kept high removal efficiency at the stable stage around 87 this phenomenon was probably due to the microbial community requiring an adaptation period when confronted with temperature stress jiang et al 2019b the trends of toc tc and ic were similar to those of cod fig 1b the degradation of aniline was accompanied by the release of nh4 n under aerobic conditions then nh4 n was further converted to no2 n and no3 n by nitrifying microorganisms jiang et al 2019b the concentration of nh4 n had a slight decrease during the seasonal temperature changes fig 1c the nh4 n concentration at the original temperature of 30 c 22 13 mg l was higher than the nh4 n concentration at the returned temperature of 30 c 15 95 mg l however the concentrations of no2 n and no3 n increased from 0 45 mg l to 3 32 mg l and from 2 23 mg l to 11 64 mg l when the temperature was returned to 30 c respectively also the tn concentration was slightly increased from 29 44 mg l to 31 46 mg l 3 2 dynamics of microbial diversity and community composition after quality control 3 948 202 high quality sequences were obtained these sequences were clustered into different operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 similarity rarefaction curves fig s1a indicated that the depth of sequencing was sufficient as shown in fig 2 the alpha diversity richness chao1 ace and phylogenetic diversity was the highest and lowest at 30 c t30 and 45 c t45 respectively these results indicated the α diversity decreased with temperature increased from 30 c to 45 c pearson correlation analysis also presented that the temperature was negatively correlated with the α diversity of microbial communities p 0 01 table s1 intriguingly these indices recovered to their original levels when the temperature was returned to 30 c the diversity indices of simpson pielou and shannon also showed similar patterns fig s1b pcoa showed that there were significant differences in microbial community structure among different temperatures fig 3 a microbial communities in the same temperature group were closely linked but isolated from other temperature groups along with the arrow direction from group t30 to tr30 less distance was observed between t30 to tr30 indicating a recovery trend of the microbial community from the temperature stress further dissimilarity tests mrpp anosim and permanova based on both bray curtis and jaccard distance implied that the communities had substantial variations among different temperatures table s2 further the community compositions significantly changed at different temperatures proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were major phyla in the bioreactor when the temperature increased from 30 c to 42 c fig 3b however the percentage of deinococcus thermus increased rapidly from 8 1 to 54 1 with the temperature increased from 42 c to 45 c surprisingly when the temperature was returned to 30 c the proportion of deinococcus thermus gradually decreased to a very low level as well as that proteobacteria regained competitive advantages this phenomenon was more obvious in fig s2 the relative abundance of deinococcus thermus decreased with a longer time when the temperature was back to 30 c as for the genus level fig s3a compared with the original 30 c the relative abundance of dokdonella reduced from 4 8 to 0 1 when the temperature was returned to 30 c however the relative abundance of comamonas increased from 0 2 to 8 6 when the temperature was back to 30 c on the contrary the relative abundance of meiothermus increased significantly from 0 4 to 54 1 when the temperature increased from 30 c to 45 c but reduced dramatically from 54 1 to 1 7 when the temperature was back to 30 c the decreasing trend of meiothermus was particularly evident in the last sample of tr30 fig s3b 3 3 effects of environmental factors on microbial community as shown in table 1 these environmental factors ph do cod toc tc ic tn nitrate nitrite orp and temperature had significant effects on the microbial communities canonical correspondence analysis cca and variation partitioning analysis vpa was adopted to determine the relative contribution of environmental variables to the microbial community the first two cca axes explained 79 18 of the observed variations in community structures implying the environmental factors had a significant impact on microbial community variation p 0 01 fig 4 a the vpa result showed the temperature and other factors including ph do aniline cod toc tc ic tn ammonia nitrate nitrite and orp explained 3 3 and 49 5 variation in the microbial community respectively their combination explained 9 9 of the total variation leaving 37 3 of the variation unexplained fig 4b aggregated boosted tree abt analysis showed that the relative contribution of temperature ranked highest 17 4 of all measured environmental factors fig s4 these results indicated that temperature played an important role in driving microbial structure variations 3 4 contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes the null model analysis was conducted to quantify the relative contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes on the community assembly at different temperatures as the temperature increased from 35 c to 45 c most of the βnti values were between 2 and 2 indicating the community assembly was dominated by stochastic processes fig s5 intriguingly most of the βnti values of t30 and tr30 were less than 2 or more than 2 suggesting that deterministic processes governed the microbial community assembly further drift was found to be the most important stochastic process when the temperature was over 30 c fig 5 homogeneous selection 60 and variable selection 40 of deterministic processes determined community assembly when the temperature was returned to 30 c besides the neutral model explained the large fraction r2 0 66 of the microbial community variations when the temperature was between 35 c to 45 c demonstrating that neutral processes had a significant role in the microbial community assembly table s3 remarkably the value of m increased when the temperature was over 30 c indicating that the influence of stochastic processes was stronger for the microbial community assembly when the temperature was back to 30 c the value of r2 and m were 0 5533 and 0 5577 close to the original value of t30 r2 0 5859 m 0 3902 this was consistent with the result of null model analyses which indicated that the process of community assembly changed from stochasticity to determinism when the temperature dropped from 40 c to 30 c overall the community assembly was dominated by the deterministic process when the temperature was 30 c and the community assembly of over 30 c was governed by stochastic processes 3 5 features of network topology at different temperatures network analysis was used to investigate changes in co occurrence patterns under simulated seasonal temperature variations we constructed eight networks at different temperatures fig 6 and the corresponding topological parameters are presented in table 2 the results showed that network connection distribution curves fit the power law model well r2 values from 0 641 to 0 861 indicating a scale free network additionally the average path lengths gd were from 3 04 to 5 158 suggesting that the networks in these microbial communities had the typical property of the small world each network modularity for the community was greater than 0 4 significantly higher than the modularity values of their corresponding randomized networks demonstrating that each network had a modular structure the number of nodes and edges continued to decrease with temperature increasing from 30 c to 45 c which indicated that the network became simpler and more decentralized conversely the modularity increased from 0 497 to 0 758 with temperature suggesting that a more organized structure among microorganisms was obtained at high temperatures however the number of nodes 215 and edges 780 increased obviously when the temperature was returned to 30 c correspondingly the degree of modularity was reduced to 0 525 overall networks became more complex when the temperature was decreased to 30 c additionally the negative correlation green lines occupied a more significant proportion than the positive correlation red lines in all temperatures implying taxa tended to co exclude rather than co occur nodes were classified into four categories based on within module zi and among module connectivity pi peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs shi et al 2016 keystones are the remaining three types of nodes except peripherals the module hubs were identified in all temperature groups fig s6 and supplementary information 2 only a network hub otu0594 was observed in the network of t30 and no network hub was detected in other networks the number of keystones decreased from 100 to 2 when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 45 c however the number of hubs and connectors increased from 2 to 20 when the temperature was dropped from 40 c to 30 c proteobacteria were the most prevalent keystone in the microbial networks accounting for 44 67 of all hubs and connectors surprisingly otu0356 played the role of connectors in both networks of t30 and tr30 the relative abundances of modular hubs from 0 0055 to 2 1209 and connectors from 0 0029 to 2 3804 ranged widely and most of the keystones were low relative abundances 4 discussion 4 1 functional redundancy ensured the microbial community stability seasonal temperature changes might affect the structure of microbial communities and microbial performance louca et al 2018 previous studies have presented that the optimum temperature for degrading aniline by microorganisms was 30 c and the degrading efficiency fell sharply when the temperature was higher than 40 c cui et al 2017 huang et al 2018 however in our study the aniline removal efficiency was always nearly 100 with the temperature increasing from 30 c to 45 c the efficient removal at high temperatures might be closely related to the increase of meiothermus this result was consistent with the characteristics of meiothermus which had thick cell walls and could tolerate high temperatures and remove organic pollutants che et al 2020 besides changes in nitrogen were closely related to the variations of zoogloea and dokdonella a previous study indicated that zoogloea and dokdonella were core denitrifying bacteria and played essential roles in wastewater treatment plants wu et al 2019 the results demonstrated that we obtained a robust microbial community that was stable over a broad temperature range surprisingly the alpha diversity decreased with temperature but recovered when the temperature was returned to 30 c these results were consistent with a study that the alpha diversity decreased at high temperatures during treating terephthalate wastewater while richness and evenness could be recovered when the temperature dropped again ma et al 2020 usually reducing microbial biodiversity might lead to a decrease in microbial functions vanwonterghem et al 2014 vanwonterghem et al 2016 however the removal efficiency of aniline and cod had no noticeable change in our study although the alpha diversity decreased as temperature increased fig 1 fig 2 and fig 3 the beta diversity results also indicated that significant changes in community structure did not affect aniline and cod removal these results could be explained by functional redundancy different microorganisms might have similar functions but perform optimally under diverse conditions substituting for each other in such a way as to maintain ecosystem stability delgado baquerizo et al 2016 for example the relative abundance of comamonas and zoogloea decreased when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 45 c but soon regained their prevalence when the temperature was returned to 30 c fig s3a in contrast the relative abundance of meiothermus increased significantly with increasing temperature but sharply decreased when the temperature dropped to 30 c fig s7 also presented that the comamonas and zoogloea were negatively correlated with temperature while the meiothermus was positively correlated with temperature the genus of comamonas and zoogloea belonged to proteobacteria which were the dominant group in various organic pollutant treatment systems and had the capabilities to degrade aniline hou et al 2018 jiang et al 2019a a previous study also indicated that the meiothermus could accelerate the degradation of dissolved organic matter che et al 2020 hence the ebb and flow of functional microorganisms comamonas meiothermus and zoogloea maintain the ecosystem stability under different temperatures louca et al 2018 as such the results suggested that the consortium obtained in this study had great potential for treating aniline wastewater at different temperatures 4 2 different assembly processes mediated the reoccurrence of microbial community deterministic and stochastic processes played crucial roles in shaping microbial communities composition diversity and structure ning et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 the deterministic processes involve selection imposed by environmental factors affecting microbial fitness and shaping the microbial community structure kang et al 2022 it has been reported that temperature affected the composition and structure of the microbial community he et al 2021 lin et al 2017 our results also indicated that the succession of the microbial community was significantly related to temperature table 1 and fig 4 in addition the community assembly process at 30 c was dominated by deterministic processes and stochasticity dominated the community when the temperature was over 30 c fig 5 the r2 value was 0 5533 of t30 and 0 5859 of tr30 in table s3 also indicating that the community assembly was dominated by the deterministic processes when the temperature was 30 c sun et al 2021 however the variations in community structure could not be explained by all the deterministic factors such unexplained proportions might be attributed to stochastic processes the neutral model implied that stochasticity had an impact on shaping ecological communities when the temperature was increased from 35 c to 45 c this finding was consistent with an earlier study that temperature could affect neutral processes of community assembly by controlling population dynamics saito et al 2021 the metabolic rate of microorganisms increases predictably with increasing temperature increased metabolism at higher temperatures controls many natural processes including the number of individuals in a community and the rate of biomass production in an ecosystem brown et al 2004 metabolism affects fundamental biological processes so we concluded that temperature influenced the neutral process of community assembly by regulating the metabolism of microorganisms the gradient increase in temperature decreased the biodiversity fig 2 and biomass fig s8 and enhanced the relative importance of stochasticity increasing temperature can exclude the species that are vulnerable to temperature and then alter the microbial composition and diversity garcía et al 2018 additionally the deterministic assembly processes were dominant in high α diversity communities when the temperature was 30 c this result was reasonable because high diversity might exacerbate competitive pressures among microorganisms resulting in communities being more susceptible to deterministic factors butler and o dwyer 2018 an earlier study also found that the deterministic process dominated community assembly at high diversity and conversely the stochastic process dominated the community assembly at low diversity zhang et al 2019 hence the reoccurrence of microbial community structure under simulated seasonal temperature variations was mediated by the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes 4 3 network revealed the ecological mechanisms under simulated seasonal temperature changes typically the presence of modularity and negative correlations in the network increases the stability of the network under environmental stresses coyte et al 2015 de et al 2018 the microbial community exhibited high modularity even though the temperature was increased to 45 c suggesting we obtained a stable microbial community this result was also supported by the observation of efficient removal of aniline consistent with the literature this research found that higher modularity helped increase the stability of network and community function xun et al 2021 on the other hand the community has undergone a long term adaptation and acclimation process after the temperature changes it is no doubt that long term domestication was beneficial to form a stable microbial community more negative links between the communities might be another reason for the stable and efficient aniline removal at high temperatures because negative correlations helped maintain the network s stability under environmental stress coyte et al 2015 in addition fewer nodes and edges at higher temperatures also contributed to stable removal performance as proven by previous literature that weaker microbial correlations may lead to more stable and robust communities under environmental stress butler and o dwyer 2018 multiple mechanisms may influence the size and complexity of microbial networks shi et al 2016 shannon s diversity and pd were positively correlated with both network size and connectivity fig s9 in accordance with these results previous studies also have demonstrated that network complexity increased with microbial diversity fan et al 2018 wagg et al 2019 additionally environmental factors also might be responsible for the variation in network size and connectivity since pearson s correlation analysis showed that network modularity was positively correlated with temperature fig s10 in particular the larger and more complex networks were generated at low temperature 30 c than at high temperature 45 c as reflected by the negative relationships between temperature and the number of nodes edges and average degree consistent with previous studies chaffron et al 2021 li et al 2019 shi et al 2021 network connectivity was negatively associated with temperature and strongly affected community networks some keystones might play important roles in maintaining ecosystem stability as the loss of these putative key taxa could lead to the disintegration of modules and networks deng et al 2016 lu et al 2013 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the central keystones in the microbial networks in our study these two phyla have often been reported to have the ability to degrade organic pollutants as well as to effectively resist environmental stress hou et al 2018 wan et al 2021 one interesting finding was that otu0356 regained its role as a connector when the temperature was returned to 30 c this result also indicated the importance of proteobacteria because otu0356 belonged to the phylum of proteobacteria further we compared the representative sequence of otu0356 in the ncbi library and found it to be an uncultured xanthobacteraceae bacterium this result suggested that these uncultured and unclassified microorganisms played important roles in wastewater treatment plants also the connectors were highly connected with other modules suggesting that the reoccurrence of otu0356 might be critical for network stability and system function this result accorded with an earlier observation which showed that some specific otus recurred in the same season liu et al 2022 accordingly we hypothesized that some species that become keystones have a relationship with specific environmental conditions regardless of the environmental changes furthermore temperature variations clearly altered the keystone taxa in specific environments and no intersectional specie acted as a keystone across multiple networks of different temperatures these results were explained by context dependence theory keystone species play a significant role under specific environmental conditions berry and widder 2014 shi et al 2016 similar observations also implied that the putative keystone taxa vary with external conditions heino et al 2012 sun et al 2021 ya et al 2021 besides functional redundancy could be responsible for the changes of keystones at different temperatures delgado baquerizo et al 2016 contrary to expectations keystones were observed in networks with very low abundances fig s5 and supplementary information 2 for example the average abundance of otu0356 was low at different temperatures from 0 0028 to 0 0342 otu0594 0 0125 acted as network hubs at the original temperature of 30 c otu0184 0 0060 otu0791 0 0031 and otu0424 0 0050 were identified as connectors when the temperature was returned to 30 c these results indicated that some low abundant taxa played essential roles in maintaining stability of microbial networks xu et al 2019 also indicating the importance of proteobacteria because all of these otus belonged to proteobacteria overall these negative links observed functional connectors or hubs together with a more organized structure and the rare species acted as the keystone maintained the modularity and stabilized the network structure of the microbial community under simulated seasonal temperature changes 5 conclusion a robust microbial community for degrading aniline was obtained through domestication by simulating seasonal temperature changes comamonas zoogloea and meiothermus played vital roles in coping with high temperature stress and removing aniline functional redundancy could be another reason for the community dynamics ecosystem function and stability the α diversities and network complexity could be recovered when the temperature was returned to 30 c however the most critical ecological process in shaping microbial diversity changed from determinism to stochasticity when the temperature was over 30 c this work provides new ideas for further understanding the relationships between community assembly and the reoccurrence of

15743,seasonal temperature changes significantly affect microbial community diversity composition and performance in wastewater treatment plants however the community assembly mechanisms under seasonal temperature variations remain unclear here we carried out temperature cycling experiments 30 c 35 c 37 c 40 c 42 c 45 c 40 c and 30 c to investigate how temperature impacts microbial performance and co occurrence network and how assembly processes determine the structure and function of microbial communities during treating aniline wastewater during the 195 day operation the system achieved an efficient and stable aniline removal of 99 interestingly α diversity and network complexity were negatively correlated with temperature but could be recovered when the temperature was returned to 30 c the results showed that functional redundancy was probably responsible for the excellent microbial performance during the whole process null model analyses presented that deterministic process dominated the community when the temperature was 30 c and stochasticity dominated the assembly process when the temperature was over 30 c overall the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes in the treatment of aniline wastewater mediated the reoccurrence of microbial community and co occurrence network at different temperatures this study provides new insights into microbial community reoccurrence under seasonal temperature changes and a theoretical basis for regulating microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aniline wastewater seasonal temperature changes community assembly reoccurrence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aniline wastewater derived from dye medicine and rubber additives is hazardous to human health and ecosystem safety cui et al 2012 sun et al 2015 vikrant et al 2018 physicochemical technologies could effectively remove aniline and reduce its risk but these technologies might lead to secondary contamination chen et al 2021 cheng et al 2021 microbial technology has received increasing attention owing to its sustainable and eco friendly characteristics zhang et al 2020b currently most of the applicable temperatures for aniline degrading microorganisms are between 30 35 c making it difficult to cope with temperature changes throughout the year cao et al 2018 cui et al 2017 mohammed et al 2020 maintaining the stable function of microbial communities over a broad temperature range has become an urgent issue zhao et al 2017 understanding microbial community assembly mechanisms under seasonal temperature changes is expected to determine what controls community diversity composition and functioning which would help develop regulation strategies in wastewater treatment plants however the effects of seasonal temperature changes on microbial community assembly and functioning are still considered a black box since the community assembly mechanisms have not been well explored zhang et al 2020a mechanisms of microbial community assembly including deterministic and stochastic processes and their relationships to community functioning have become central issues in ecology sun et al 2022 previous studies suggested that deterministic processes were responsible for the community assembly in the sediment of three gorges reservoir li et al 2019 membrane bioreactors xu et al 2019 and activated sludge bioreactors griffin and wells 2017 however other studies indicated that the communities were driven mainly by stochastic processes wu et al 2019 zhou et al 2013 it is generally believed that the stochastic and deterministic processes simultaneously control microbial communities after years of controversy xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a zhou et al 2017 also a hot debate concerns the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes in governing community diversity and functioning in natural and engineered ecosystems mo et al 2018 wan et al 2021 fortunately numerous approaches have been developed to distinguish the importance of deterministic and stochastic processes ning et al 2019 stegen et al 2013 stegen et al 2015 these approaches provided powerful tools to distinguish their relative importance in determining microbial community assembly therefore it is essential to resolve controversies concerning the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic community assembly providing a basis for targeted manipulation in wastewater treatment plants nevertheless the mechanisms of how communities assemble in response to seasonal temperature changes in aniline wastewater treatment remain unknown additionally clarifying the effects of microbial associations on ecosystem function and community stability can also help us understand the microbial performance in wastewater treatment plants jiao et al 2016 recently numerous studies have used co occurrence network analyses to illustrate the links between microorganisms and relationships between topological properties and environmental factors forster et al 2021 jiao et al 2020 but most previous studies were only concerned with the effects of abiotic factors on microbial diversity composition and functioning and rarely on potential relationships between microbial co occurrence and function and stability shi et al 2016 xun et al 2021 to better understand how microbial communities respond to environmental stress it is also significant to reveal the associations between microbial community taxa and to discover the keystone species in different networks hence disentangling these complex relationships and identifying keystones in a network is essential to better understand the functions of microbial communities which would help further develop regulation strategies in wastewater treatment plants this work aims to elucidate how seasonal temperature changes affect community structure function and assembly mechanisms during treating aniline wastewater here we selected aniline as the only organic carbon and nitrogen source for enriching aniline degrading microorganisms and compared the aniline removal performance at progressively increasing temperatures from 30 c to 45 c and then gradually decreasing to 30 c specifically we focused on three questions i how did the microbial diversity and functioning respond to simulated seasonal temperature changes during treating aniline wastewater ii which assembly process dominated the microbial community construction at different temperatures iii could the co occurrence network and keystone reoccur when the temperature was returned to 30 c 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture medium and bioreactor operation the culture medium and bioreactor operation was consistent with our previous study chen et al 2021 the average influent of aniline cod toc and tn concentrations were 221 25 14 70 432 88 16 59 200 4 17 33 94 3 50 respectively in this work the bioreactor ran continuously for 195 days to investigate the microbial performance under simulated seasonal temperature changes the activated sludge was domesticated at 30 c for 30 days to obtain a microbial community with stable performance since day 31 the temperature was changed to 35 c gradually increasing to 45 c to simulate seasonal temperature changes and better understand the response of microorganisms to temperature stress the temperature was returned to 40 c and 30 c 2 2 analytical methods water samples of the influent and effluent were taken every day and determined the supernatant after centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the concentrations of aniline chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrous nitrogen no2 n were measured according to the standard protocols cui et al 2012 total organic carbon toc total carbon tc inorganic carbon ic and total nitrogen tn were detected using a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the values of ph oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen do were determined by a multiparameter which used different electrodes seven excellence mettler toledo biomass was detected by the direct microscopic counting method we measured each parameter three times and averaged them 2 3 dna extraction high throughput sequencing and data processing five copies of sludge samples were collected during the stabilization phase at each temperature 30 c 35 c 37 c 40 c 42 c 45 c 40 c and 30 c grouped as t30 t35 t37 t40 t42 t45 tr40 and tr30 and then stored at 80 c until dna was extracted power soil dna isolation kit was used to extract whole dna mobio carlsbad ca the concentration and quality of extracted dna were evaluated by nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop 1000 thermo fisher scientific ma america the 515f and 806r universal primer pairs were used to amplify the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene followed by high throughput sequencing using the illumina miseq platform pe300 ca usa raw data were processed using a sequencing analysis pipeline built on the galaxy platform http mem rcees ac cn 8080 2 4 data analysis the correlation tests between α diversities and environment factors were determined using pearson correlation significance was conducted by one way analysis of variance anova the principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the unweighted unifrac distance was employed to detect microbial community variation the multiresponse permutation procedure mrpp analysis of similarities anosim and permutational multivariate analysis of variance of the adonis function permanova based on both bray curtis and jaccard distance were performed to evaluate the dissimilarity of the microbial community composition between different temperatures canonical correspondence analysis cca dimensionality reduction was used to investigate the relationships between microbial communities and environmental factors variation partition analysis vpa was then conducted to determine the relative contribution of the environmental factors to the microbial community an aggregated boosted tree abt analysis was performed to quantify the effects of enviromental factors on the microbial community to explore the mechanisms of microbial community assembly we adopted a null model based statistical framework to compare the relative contributions of different ecological processes stegen et al 2013 here the relative contributions of variable selection homogeneous selection dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and drift were calculated in short differences in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity were calculated according to the value of bray curtis based raup crick rcbray and β nearest taxon index βnti stegen et al 2013 the neutral model was also employed for examining the potential contribution of stochastic processes to the microbial community assembly sloan et al 2010 the parameter r2 and m represents the overall fit to the model and immigration rate respectively microbial co occurrence networks were performed by the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens through the pmens analysis pipeline mena http ieg2 ou

nodes and connectivity was constructed by gephi version 0 9 2 all statistical analyses were conducted in r http www r project org 3 results 3 1 performance of the microorganisms under simulated seasonal temperature changes the community performance of the bioreactor was investigated for 195 days under simulated seasonal temperature changes 30 c 35 c 37 c 40 c 42 c 45 c 40 c and 30 c the residual aniline in the effluent was almost undetectable at each stable phase fig 1 however the aniline removal efficiency declined rapidly from 99 9 to 85 9 when the temperature was first adjusted from 42 c to 45 c then reached almost 100 in the stabilization period at 45 c additionally the system had excellent removal performance of cod nearly 90 during the stable stage notably the cod removal decreased slightly when the temperature was just returned to 30 c but kept high removal efficiency at the stable stage around 87 this phenomenon was probably due to the microbial community requiring an adaptation period when confronted with temperature stress jiang et al 2019b the trends of toc tc and ic were similar to those of cod fig 1b the degradation of aniline was accompanied by the release of nh4 n under aerobic conditions then nh4 n was further converted to no2 n and no3 n by nitrifying microorganisms jiang et al 2019b the concentration of nh4 n had a slight decrease during the seasonal temperature changes fig 1c the nh4 n concentration at the original temperature of 30 c 22 13 mg l was higher than the nh4 n concentration at the returned temperature of 30 c 15 95 mg l however the concentrations of no2 n and no3 n increased from 0 45 mg l to 3 32 mg l and from 2 23 mg l to 11 64 mg l when the temperature was returned to 30 c respectively also the tn concentration was slightly increased from 29 44 mg l to 31 46 mg l 3 2 dynamics of microbial diversity and community composition after quality control 3 948 202 high quality sequences were obtained these sequences were clustered into different operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 similarity rarefaction curves fig s1a indicated that the depth of sequencing was sufficient as shown in fig 2 the alpha diversity richness chao1 ace and phylogenetic diversity was the highest and lowest at 30 c t30 and 45 c t45 respectively these results indicated the α diversity decreased with temperature increased from 30 c to 45 c pearson correlation analysis also presented that the temperature was negatively correlated with the α diversity of microbial communities p 0 01 table s1 intriguingly these indices recovered to their original levels when the temperature was returned to 30 c the diversity indices of simpson pielou and shannon also showed similar patterns fig s1b pcoa showed that there were significant differences in microbial community structure among different temperatures fig 3 a microbial communities in the same temperature group were closely linked but isolated from other temperature groups along with the arrow direction from group t30 to tr30 less distance was observed between t30 to tr30 indicating a recovery trend of the microbial community from the temperature stress further dissimilarity tests mrpp anosim and permanova based on both bray curtis and jaccard distance implied that the communities had substantial variations among different temperatures table s2 further the community compositions significantly changed at different temperatures proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were major phyla in the bioreactor when the temperature increased from 30 c to 42 c fig 3b however the percentage of deinococcus thermus increased rapidly from 8 1 to 54 1 with the temperature increased from 42 c to 45 c surprisingly when the temperature was returned to 30 c the proportion of deinococcus thermus gradually decreased to a very low level as well as that proteobacteria regained competitive advantages this phenomenon was more obvious in fig s2 the relative abundance of deinococcus thermus decreased with a longer time when the temperature was back to 30 c as for the genus level fig s3a compared with the original 30 c the relative abundance of dokdonella reduced from 4 8 to 0 1 when the temperature was returned to 30 c however the relative abundance of comamonas increased from 0 2 to 8 6 when the temperature was back to 30 c on the contrary the relative abundance of meiothermus increased significantly from 0 4 to 54 1 when the temperature increased from 30 c to 45 c but reduced dramatically from 54 1 to 1 7 when the temperature was back to 30 c the decreasing trend of meiothermus was particularly evident in the last sample of tr30 fig s3b 3 3 effects of environmental factors on microbial community as shown in table 1 these environmental factors ph do cod toc tc ic tn nitrate nitrite orp and temperature had significant effects on the microbial communities canonical correspondence analysis cca and variation partitioning analysis vpa was adopted to determine the relative contribution of environmental variables to the microbial community the first two cca axes explained 79 18 of the observed variations in community structures implying the environmental factors had a significant impact on microbial community variation p 0 01 fig 4 a the vpa result showed the temperature and other factors including ph do aniline cod toc tc ic tn ammonia nitrate nitrite and orp explained 3 3 and 49 5 variation in the microbial community respectively their combination explained 9 9 of the total variation leaving 37 3 of the variation unexplained fig 4b aggregated boosted tree abt analysis showed that the relative contribution of temperature ranked highest 17 4 of all measured environmental factors fig s4 these results indicated that temperature played an important role in driving microbial structure variations 3 4 contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes the null model analysis was conducted to quantify the relative contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes on the community assembly at different temperatures as the temperature increased from 35 c to 45 c most of the βnti values were between 2 and 2 indicating the community assembly was dominated by stochastic processes fig s5 intriguingly most of the βnti values of t30 and tr30 were less than 2 or more than 2 suggesting that deterministic processes governed the microbial community assembly further drift was found to be the most important stochastic process when the temperature was over 30 c fig 5 homogeneous selection 60 and variable selection 40 of deterministic processes determined community assembly when the temperature was returned to 30 c besides the neutral model explained the large fraction r2 0 66 of the microbial community variations when the temperature was between 35 c to 45 c demonstrating that neutral processes had a significant role in the microbial community assembly table s3 remarkably the value of m increased when the temperature was over 30 c indicating that the influence of stochastic processes was stronger for the microbial community assembly when the temperature was back to 30 c the value of r2 and m were 0 5533 and 0 5577 close to the original value of t30 r2 0 5859 m 0 3902 this was consistent with the result of null model analyses which indicated that the process of community assembly changed from stochasticity to determinism when the temperature dropped from 40 c to 30 c overall the community assembly was dominated by the deterministic process when the temperature was 30 c and the community assembly of over 30 c was governed by stochastic processes 3 5 features of network topology at different temperatures network analysis was used to investigate changes in co occurrence patterns under simulated seasonal temperature variations we constructed eight networks at different temperatures fig 6 and the corresponding topological parameters are presented in table 2 the results showed that network connection distribution curves fit the power law model well r2 values from 0 641 to 0 861 indicating a scale free network additionally the average path lengths gd were from 3 04 to 5 158 suggesting that the networks in these microbial communities had the typical property of the small world each network modularity for the community was greater than 0 4 significantly higher than the modularity values of their corresponding randomized networks demonstrating that each network had a modular structure the number of nodes and edges continued to decrease with temperature increasing from 30 c to 45 c which indicated that the network became simpler and more decentralized conversely the modularity increased from 0 497 to 0 758 with temperature suggesting that a more organized structure among microorganisms was obtained at high temperatures however the number of nodes 215 and edges 780 increased obviously when the temperature was returned to 30 c correspondingly the degree of modularity was reduced to 0 525 overall networks became more complex when the temperature was decreased to 30 c additionally the negative correlation green lines occupied a more significant proportion than the positive correlation red lines in all temperatures implying taxa tended to co exclude rather than co occur nodes were classified into four categories based on within module zi and among module connectivity pi peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs shi et al 2016 keystones are the remaining three types of nodes except peripherals the module hubs were identified in all temperature groups fig s6 and supplementary information 2 only a network hub otu0594 was observed in the network of t30 and no network hub was detected in other networks the number of keystones decreased from 100 to 2 when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 45 c however the number of hubs and connectors increased from 2 to 20 when the temperature was dropped from 40 c to 30 c proteobacteria were the most prevalent keystone in the microbial networks accounting for 44 67 of all hubs and connectors surprisingly otu0356 played the role of connectors in both networks of t30 and tr30 the relative abundances of modular hubs from 0 0055 to 2 1209 and connectors from 0 0029 to 2 3804 ranged widely and most of the keystones were low relative abundances 4 discussion 4 1 functional redundancy ensured the microbial community stability seasonal temperature changes might affect the structure of microbial communities and microbial performance louca et al 2018 previous studies have presented that the optimum temperature for degrading aniline by microorganisms was 30 c and the degrading efficiency fell sharply when the temperature was higher than 40 c cui et al 2017 huang et al 2018 however in our study the aniline removal efficiency was always nearly 100 with the temperature increasing from 30 c to 45 c the efficient removal at high temperatures might be closely related to the increase of meiothermus this result was consistent with the characteristics of meiothermus which had thick cell walls and could tolerate high temperatures and remove organic pollutants che et al 2020 besides changes in nitrogen were closely related to the variations of zoogloea and dokdonella a previous study indicated that zoogloea and dokdonella were core denitrifying bacteria and played essential roles in wastewater treatment plants wu et al 2019 the results demonstrated that we obtained a robust microbial community that was stable over a broad temperature range surprisingly the alpha diversity decreased with temperature but recovered when the temperature was returned to 30 c these results were consistent with a study that the alpha diversity decreased at high temperatures during treating terephthalate wastewater while richness and evenness could be recovered when the temperature dropped again ma et al 2020 usually reducing microbial biodiversity might lead to a decrease in microbial functions vanwonterghem et al 2014 vanwonterghem et al 2016 however the removal efficiency of aniline and cod had no noticeable change in our study although the alpha diversity decreased as temperature increased fig 1 fig 2 and fig 3 the beta diversity results also indicated that significant changes in community structure did not affect aniline and cod removal these results could be explained by functional redundancy different microorganisms might have similar functions but perform optimally under diverse conditions substituting for each other in such a way as to maintain ecosystem stability delgado baquerizo et al 2016 for example the relative abundance of comamonas and zoogloea decreased when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 45 c but soon regained their prevalence when the temperature was returned to 30 c fig s3a in contrast the relative abundance of meiothermus increased significantly with increasing temperature but sharply decreased when the temperature dropped to 30 c fig s7 also presented that the comamonas and zoogloea were negatively correlated with temperature while the meiothermus was positively correlated with temperature the genus of comamonas and zoogloea belonged to proteobacteria which were the dominant group in various organic pollutant treatment systems and had the capabilities to degrade aniline hou et al 2018 jiang et al 2019a a previous study also indicated that the meiothermus could accelerate the degradation of dissolved organic matter che et al 2020 hence the ebb and flow of functional microorganisms comamonas meiothermus and zoogloea maintain the ecosystem stability under different temperatures louca et al 2018 as such the results suggested that the consortium obtained in this study had great potential for treating aniline wastewater at different temperatures 4 2 different assembly processes mediated the reoccurrence of microbial community deterministic and stochastic processes played crucial roles in shaping microbial communities composition diversity and structure ning et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 the deterministic processes involve selection imposed by environmental factors affecting microbial fitness and shaping the microbial community structure kang et al 2022 it has been reported that temperature affected the composition and structure of the microbial community he et al 2021 lin et al 2017 our results also indicated that the succession of the microbial community was significantly related to temperature table 1 and fig 4 in addition the community assembly process at 30 c was dominated by deterministic processes and stochasticity dominated the community when the temperature was over 30 c fig 5 the r2 value was 0 5533 of t30 and 0 5859 of tr30 in table s3 also indicating that the community assembly was dominated by the deterministic processes when the temperature was 30 c sun et al 2021 however the variations in community structure could not be explained by all the deterministic factors such unexplained proportions might be attributed to stochastic processes the neutral model implied that stochasticity had an impact on shaping ecological communities when the temperature was increased from 35 c to 45 c this finding was consistent with an earlier study that temperature could affect neutral processes of community assembly by controlling population dynamics saito et al 2021 the metabolic rate of microorganisms increases predictably with increasing temperature increased metabolism at higher temperatures controls many natural processes including the number of individuals in a community and the rate of biomass production in an ecosystem brown et al 2004 metabolism affects fundamental biological processes so we concluded that temperature influenced the neutral process of community assembly by regulating the metabolism of microorganisms the gradient increase in temperature decreased the biodiversity fig 2 and biomass fig s8 and enhanced the relative importance of stochasticity increasing temperature can exclude the species that are vulnerable to temperature and then alter the microbial composition and diversity garcía et al 2018 additionally the deterministic assembly processes were dominant in high α diversity communities when the temperature was 30 c this result was reasonable because high diversity might exacerbate competitive pressures among microorganisms resulting in communities being more susceptible to deterministic factors butler and o dwyer 2018 an earlier study also found that the deterministic process dominated community assembly at high diversity and conversely the stochastic process dominated the community assembly at low diversity zhang et al 2019 hence the reoccurrence of microbial community structure under simulated seasonal temperature variations was mediated by the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes 4 3 network revealed the ecological mechanisms under simulated seasonal temperature changes typically the presence of modularity and negative correlations in the network increases the stability of the network under environmental stresses coyte et al 2015 de et al 2018 the microbial community exhibited high modularity even though the temperature was increased to 45 c suggesting we obtained a stable microbial community this result was also supported by the observation of efficient removal of aniline consistent with the literature this research found that higher modularity helped increase the stability of network and community function xun et al 2021 on the other hand the community has undergone a long term adaptation and acclimation process after the temperature changes it is no doubt that long term domestication was beneficial to form a stable microbial community more negative links between the communities might be another reason for the stable and efficient aniline removal at high temperatures because negative correlations helped maintain the network s stability under environmental stress coyte et al 2015 in addition fewer nodes and edges at higher temperatures also contributed to stable removal performance as proven by previous literature that weaker microbial correlations may lead to more stable and robust communities under environmental stress butler and o dwyer 2018 multiple mechanisms may influence the size and complexity of microbial networks shi et al 2016 shannon s diversity and pd were positively correlated with both network size and connectivity fig s9 in accordance with these results previous studies also have demonstrated that network complexity increased with microbial diversity fan et al 2018 wagg et al 2019 additionally environmental factors also might be responsible for the variation in network size and connectivity since pearson s correlation analysis showed that network modularity was positively correlated with temperature fig s10 in particular the larger and more complex networks were generated at low temperature 30 c than at high temperature 45 c as reflected by the negative relationships between temperature and the number of nodes edges and average degree consistent with previous studies chaffron et al 2021 li et al 2019 shi et al 2021 network connectivity was negatively associated with temperature and strongly affected community networks some keystones might play important roles in maintaining ecosystem stability as the loss of these putative key taxa could lead to the disintegration of modules and networks deng et al 2016 lu et al 2013 proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the central keystones in the microbial networks in our study these two phyla have often been reported to have the ability to degrade organic pollutants as well as to effectively resist environmental stress hou et al 2018 wan et al 2021 one interesting finding was that otu0356 regained its role as a connector when the temperature was returned to 30 c this result also indicated the importance of proteobacteria because otu0356 belonged to the phylum of proteobacteria further we compared the representative sequence of otu0356 in the ncbi library and found it to be an uncultured xanthobacteraceae bacterium this result suggested that these uncultured and unclassified microorganisms played important roles in wastewater treatment plants also the connectors were highly connected with other modules suggesting that the reoccurrence of otu0356 might be critical for network stability and system function this result accorded with an earlier observation which showed that some specific otus recurred in the same season liu et al 2022 accordingly we hypothesized that some species that become keystones have a relationship with specific environmental conditions regardless of the environmental changes furthermore temperature variations clearly altered the keystone taxa in specific environments and no intersectional specie acted as a keystone across multiple networks of different temperatures these results were explained by context dependence theory keystone species play a significant role under specific environmental conditions berry and widder 2014 shi et al 2016 similar observations also implied that the putative keystone taxa vary with external conditions heino et al 2012 sun et al 2021 ya et al 2021 besides functional redundancy could be responsible for the changes of keystones at different temperatures delgado baquerizo et al 2016 contrary to expectations keystones were observed in networks with very low abundances fig s5 and supplementary information 2 for example the average abundance of otu0356 was low at different temperatures from 0 0028 to 0 0342 otu0594 0 0125 acted as network hubs at the original temperature of 30 c otu0184 0 0060 otu0791 0 0031 and otu0424 0 0050 were identified as connectors when the temperature was returned to 30 c these results indicated that some low abundant taxa played essential roles in maintaining stability of microbial networks xu et al 2019 also indicating the importance of proteobacteria because all of these otus belonged to proteobacteria overall these negative links observed functional connectors or hubs together with a more organized structure and the rare species acted as the keystone maintained the modularity and stabilized the network structure of the microbial community under simulated seasonal temperature changes 5 conclusion a robust microbial community for degrading aniline was obtained through domestication by simulating seasonal temperature changes comamonas zoogloea and meiothermus played vital roles in coping with high temperature stress and removing aniline functional redundancy could be another reason for the community dynamics ecosystem function and stability the α diversities and network complexity could be recovered when the temperature was returned to 30 c however the most critical ecological process in shaping microbial diversity changed from determinism to stochasticity when the temperature was over 30 c this work provides new ideas for further understanding the relationships between community assembly and the reoccurrence of

introduction with the ever increasing industrial and human activities the worldwide freshwater resources are under unprecedented threat along with the rising cost for wastewater disposal and more stringent environmental regulations water reclamation from high salinity feed streams hypersaline brines e g containing dissolved solutes 70 000 mg l 1 has appeared as a practical strategy to minimize

compression mvc multistage flash distillation msf and multiple effect distillation med are commonly used for high salinity water desalination tong and elimelech 2016 albeit the technical maturity they still face the challenges of considerable energy usage and high operation costs mcginnis et al 2013 the evaporation process in a single stage requires energy 630 kwh m 3 without heat recovery due to large amount of latent heat required for phase changes the relatively energy efficient low temperature med still requires 67 125 kwh m 3 thermal energy pinnu and bigham 2021 recently high pressure reverse osmosis hpro operating at a hydraulic pressure of more than 100 bar has shown a great potential in concentrating seawater reverse osmosis swro brine at a lower energy consumption electrical energy 7 3 12 kwh m 3 for concentration of a 70 000 mg l 1 swro brine davenport et al 2018 subramani and jacangelo 2015 however the high operating pressure and high salinity streams demand a large capital investment and rational design of high strength membranes muhammad and lee 2019 alternatively forward osmosis fo utilizing the osmotic pressure difference across a semi permeable membrane can concentrate a high salinity stream by employing a more concentrated draw solution ds li et al 2020 despite the advantages of high salinity limit low fouling propensity and low electrical energy consumption owned by fo chia et al 2021 tong and elimelech 2016 xie et al 2016 an ideal ds with features of high osmotic pressure easy regeneration less expensive and high retention by fo membranes is hardly found lutchmiah et al 2014 electrolyte based ds e g sodium chloride has been commonly used or studied due to its high osmotic pressure easy availability and large diffusion coefficient less concentration polarization issue but it is not suitable for high salinity feed due to energy intensive regeneration methods needed giagnorio et al 2019 wang et al 2018 in contrast thermo responsive ds is a more promising candidate due to its unique response to temperature and easy regeneration by using low grade waste heat or renewable energy sources hartanto et al 2019 li and wang 2013 their regeneration usually consumes less energy than med or other thermal driven desalination processes as most of them do not undergo phase change prior studies have reported many thermo responsive draw agents such as nh3 co2 mcginnis et al 2013 hydrogels hartanto et al 2015 li et al 2013 polyelectrolytes ou et al 2013 wang et al 2016a ionic liquids kamio et al 2019 zhong et al 2016 morpholine

limited osmotic pressure ou et al 2013 low regeneration efficiency wei et al 2016 zhong et al 2016 and or poor stability alejo et al 2017 more recently nonionic amphiphilic block copolymers have demonstrated a great potential for fo application as thermo responsive draw agents ahmed et al 2019b inada et al 2019b in the forms of diblock triblock or branched types these copolymers are constituted with both hydrophilic monomers i e ethylene oxide eo groups and hydrophobic monomers i e propylene oxide po butylene oxide bo groups in a certain sequence with increasing temperature the solubility of the copolymer was reduced due to the breakdown of polymer water hydrogen bonds realizing the regeneration of concentrated copolymer ds instantly at the lowest phase separation temperature i e lowest critical solution temperature pérez sánchez et al 2019 prior studies reported that very high osmotic pressure could be achieved by certain large sized block copolymers e g 230 bar by a copolymer of mn 6 500 da at 81 wt gu and alexandridis 2004 but the high molecular weight high viscosity rendered them unsuitable for fo application block copolymers with smaller molecular weights mn 2 500 da such as ge7b3 74 bar at 68 wt could be synthesized by varying the number and sequence of the hydrophilic hydrophobic groups and was able to be used for seawater desalination inada et al 2019b a commercially available eo po based copolymer tl 1150 1 supplied by trevi systems inc was reported to have properties of high osmotic pressure easy regeneration reusability low reverse diffusion non corrosive non toxic and less expensive ahmed et al 2019b its performance had been demonstrated in a pilot study where the seawater was concentrated by 4 fold and the ds was continuously regenerated by heating at 85 c ahmed et al 2019a 2019b despite these promising results a comprehensive understanding about the block copolymer ds is still lacking for example it is unclear about the correlation between physicochemical properties of amphiphilic copolymer and its performance as draw solute the understanding on the relationship between ds characteristics such as osmotic pressure viscosity and regeneration ability and the copolymer structures such as molecular weight length of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments and the hydrophilic hydrophobic segment ratio would be beneficial for the design and selection of the appropriate copolymers for fo application moreover the chemical molecular structure and physical draw ability stabilities of the copolymers after multiple use and regeneration have not been explored in addition prior studies have not investigated how the amphiphilic copolymer interact with fo membranes it is of great interest to understand whether the membrane properties would change during fo runs and to know the feasibility of long term operation in this work we aimed to provide a useful guidance for selecting and developing a suitable thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic copolymer used as ds and to demonstrate the feasibility of applying this type of copolymer in fo process to handle high salinity feed streams a series of commercially available poly ethylene oxide block poly propylene oxide block poly ethylene oxide peo ppo peo copolymers were systematically investigated for their draw capacity and thermo responsive properties for fo application after that the most favourable copolymer was selected to study the fo performance using various feed streams including real seawater and brine from a seawater desalination plant the ds after multiple cycles of regeneration was carefully evaluated in terms of fo performance and structural properties and the membrane fouling accompanied by the use of ds was also assessed 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals in this study four types of peo ppo peo triblock copolymers named pluronic l31 l35 l61 and l64 sigma aldrich were investigated as the thermo

copolymer aqueous solutions with a concentration of 30 80 wt was measured by using a rheometer anton paar mcr102 compact rheometer austria each sample was measured at least three times at a shear rate of 500 2 000 s 1 at 25 c the osmotic pressure of copolymer solutions at different concentrations 30 75 wt was measured with fo experiments in brief the copolymer solution was placed on one side of a semi permeable membrane while a nacl solution of a known concentration was placed on the other side the osmotic pressure of the applied nacl solution was taken as that of the copolymer solution when the fo water flux was zero the osmotic pressure of nacl solution was calculated using oli analyzer 9 3 software oli systems inc morris plains nj wang et al 2016b the thermo responsive characteristics

heater julabo sw22 germany and chiller xtemp xt5618b china a sealed bottle containing homogeneous copolymer aqueous solution was placed in water bath the cloud point was identified by increasing the temperature from 0 c at a rate of 1 c per 10 min until the solution was turned into cloudy appearance after equilibrating overnight at the cloud point a clear bi phase i e dilute phase on top and dense phase at bottom could be visually observed for the copolymer solution indicating a complete phase separation the phase diagram was plotted with the lowest phase separation temperature to

regeneration the schematic of a lab scale crossflow fo setup can be found in fig b1 the fo membrane module was operated in the active layer facing draw solution al ds mode with the ds flowing through the hf lumen without recirculation and the feed solution fs flowing on the shell side with recirculation the fo water flux jv l m 2 h 1 was calculated based on the differences between the ds flowrates at inlet and outlet of the module the solute flux js g m 2 h 1 was determined from the conductivity ultrameter ii myron or the toc variations in the feed a series of fo experiments were carried out for characterizing fo membrane intrinsic properties determining the effective draw power of copolymer ds and evaluating the stability of the copolymer ds for fo application the detailed experimental conditions and calculations are presented in appendix b the relatively longer and more complicated experiments are briefly described as below fo run with multi cycle ds regeneration for evaluating the stability of copolymer ds 500 ml fresh l35 copolymer at 65 wt was used as ds in the 1st cycle of fo run for 1 h the ds was not recirculated to ensure constant ds concentration during the run the diluted ds was regenerated by heating up at 98 c overnight in an oil bath after the 1st fo run and the concentration was adjusted to 65 wt prior to the 2nd cycle run the recovered water i e the dilute phase from regeneration was collected for ph measurement seven2go mettler toledo the fo run for 1 h followed by ds regeneration for overnight was repeated after 13 cycles were completed ultrapure water was used as feed for all the 13 runs regarding the membrane a new tfc fo membrane tfc i was applied from the 1st cycle and reused till the 10th cycle another new and identical membrane tfc ii was applied in the 11th cycle and reused till the 13th cycle of run it should be noted that after each fo run the membrane cleaning was conducted with ultrapure water flushing for 0 5 h continuous fo run with simultaneous ds regeneration for demonstration of a practical operation the fo process was integrated with a ds regeneration unit as depicted in fig b2 a new tfc fo membrane was applied l35 previously regenerated and ultrapure water were used as ds and fs respectively which were recirculated during the run meanwhile ds regeneration was performed by pumping out the diluted ds and heating with a 98 c oil bath with the dense phase cooled down to room temperature and pumped back to the ds tank at a controlled rate to maintain ds concentration at 65 wt 2 4 fo membrane characterization the pure water permeability a l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the solute permeability b l m 2 h 1 of the virgin and the used fo membranes were determined using a lab scale crossflow ro setup pure water flux jw l m 2

10 adjusted with naoh or hcl was used the detailed experimental procedures can be found in our previous work xu et al 2019a 3 results and discussion 3 1 key characteristics of block copolymer solutions for fo application 3 1 1 physical properties of block copolymers viscosity and osmotic pressure are the two main properties for a ds the viscosity data of the four pluronic copolymer l31 l35 l61 and l64 aqueous solutions at concentration of 30 80 wt are presented in fig 1 a l35 and l64 with 22 and 26 hydrophilic eo units respectively demonstrated relatively high viscosity over the entire concentration range in particular l64 with the longest eo chains showed a surprisingly high viscosity of 643 mpa s at 50 wt concentration in contrast to 100 mpa s for the other three copolymers on the contrary the l31 and l61 with short eo chains only 4 units had a much lower viscosity the results revealed that the longer eo chains contribute to a copolymer aqueous solution with a higher viscosity as these hydrophilic units can facilitate their interactions with water and thus increase the viscosity ghaouar et al 2011 in addition a larger molecular size would also result in a higher viscosity pasquino et al 2019 the combined effects of large molecular size mn 2900 da largest among the four and the long eo chain may explain why l64 had so high viscosity on the contrary the length of hydrophobic po chains plays a less significant role in altering the viscosity evidenced from the l31 and l61 solutions which have similar viscosity same length of eo chains but different length of po chains on the other hand increasing copolymer concentration significantly increases the solution viscosity l64 could hardly be dissolved or stirred at concentration above 50 wt rendering it not suitable for fo application a ds of low viscosity is preferred for fo in order to mitigate the concentration polarization phenomenon and maximize the effective driving force across the membrane selective layer the osmotic pressures of aqueous solutions l31 l35 and l61 are shown in fig 1 b at concentration of 30 75 wt despite the same number of po units l35 presented an osmotic pressure ranging from 27 to 135 bar while l31 only showed a gentle increase in osmotic pressure from 18 to 35 bar the higher osmotic pressure of l35 can be ascribed to the larger number of the hydrophilic eo units that promoted more interactions with water gu and alexandridis 2004 on the other hand l61 owning to the same number of eo units as l31 showed an even lower osmotic pressure of 10 bar at 65wt this could be explained by the large molecular weight of l61 due to the larger number of po units molecular weight resulting in a significantly lower molar concentration at the same weight concentration zarrintaj et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 hence a draw solute with longer hydrophilic eo chains but a smaller molecular weight is favourable for gaining a higher osmotic pressure this characteristics can be also correlated to the hlb value or the peo ppo ratio as a larger hlb is generally corresponded to a higher osmotic pressure pérez sánchez et al 2019 due to the limited number of eo units possessed both l31 and l61 do not have sufficiently high osmotic pressure required by a good ds 3 1 2 thermo responsive properties of block copolymers the lowest phase separation temperatures of l31 l35 and l61 aqueous solutions at 5 80 wt are shown in fig 2 a among the three copolymers l35 exhibited the highest separation temperature followed by l31 and l61 l35 required a high temperature above 80 c for phase separation at low concentrations 20 wt and 98 c for concentration 60 wt the separation temperature trend was consistent with their hlb values l35 l31 l61 a higher hlb value generally refers to higher hydrophilicity and stronger hydration interactions with water thus l35 with a higher hlb value requires more energy for dehydration and phase separation inada et al 2019b pérez sánchez et al 2019 although a relatively lower separation temperature is preferred to reduce the thermal energy input for ds recovery an excessively low temperature was unpractical for operation such as l61 whose separation temperature was below 28 c when the concentration was lower than 60 wt the separation effectiveness was evaluated with 20 wt copolymer solutions at 25 98 c and the results are presented as the residual copolymer concentration in the dilute phase after phase separation fig 2 b the concentration in the dilute phase decreased with the increasing temperature for all the three copolymers interestingly although the observed phase separation could easily occur for l31 and l61 at a relatively low temperature 50 c a higher temperature was still required to maximize the recovery of the copolymer draw solute and to reduce the amount left in the dilute phase at 90 c and above all three copolymer solutions achieved a satisfying separation effectiveness with a relatively low copolymer concentration of 10 000 mg l 1 in the dilute phase this residue concentration is lower than that of other reported thermo responsive draw agents table 2 suggesting that the nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer is a favourable type of draw solutes in terms of regeneration in addition we evaluated separation efficiency by heating 20 wt l35 at 98 c for 2 18 h as shown in fig 2 c the residual l35 in the dilute phase reached 5 700 mg l 1 at 2 h and further decreased to 4700 mg l 1 at 18 h although a longer separation time could slightly enhance separation effectiveness a shorter duration such as 2 h is enough to achieve a satisfying outcome it should be noted that phase separation takes place almost instantly once reaching 98 c the duration of which is much shorter than 2 h the ds regeneration in industrial scale can be more efficient as it runs in a continuous process with preheating and cooling through a heat exchanger fig b3 3 1 3 fo performance of l35 copolymer ds considering the strong osmotic power appropriate viscosity and good regeneration capability l35 at 65 wt was selected as the ds for further evaluation in fo process 10 nacl solution with equivalent osmotic pressure 100 bar was also used as ds for comparison the fo process was conducted in the al ds configuration feed waters of different salinity ultrapure water 1 nacl 3 5 nacl swro brine and 10 nacl were tested as shown in fig 3 l35 ds led to a fo water flux of 10 7 l m 2 h 1 and a low specific solute flux js jv 1 of 0 035 g l 1 when ultrapure water feed was used the water flux was 4 times higher for 10 nacl ds but a much higher js jv 1 at 0 086 g l 1 was observed it is common to observe a lower water flux for polymer based ds as compared to electrolyte based ds due to the much smaller mass transfer coefficient of polymer based ds as a result of its high molecular weight and high viscosity that results in a severe dilutive concentration polarization phenomenon at the membrane active surface in al ds orientation shaffer et al 2015 zou et al 2019 nevertheless the water flux difference between the cases of l35 and nacl ds became smaller with increased osmotic pressure of the feed when swro brine osmotic pressure 40 bar was used as feed the water flux was 1 22 and 4 26 l m 2 h 1 for the l35 and nacl ds respectively the high salinity feed could result in a severe internal concentration polarization in this al ds orientation rendering an extremely low overall effective driving force across the membrane hence the use of polymer based ds in fo can still be competitive for high salinity feeds especially when their easy regeneration and low reverse flux features show additional advantages the state of the art thermo responsive draw agents are summarized in table 2 compared with other types of draw agents the l35 ds 65 wt in this work presented a relatively high osmotic power together with the use of our in house made tfc fo membrane large a value of 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and large a b of 13 8 bar 1 a relatively high water flux and low solute leakage could be achieved nevertheless a high performance fo membrane may not be necessary for high salinity feed application which will be demonstrated in section 3 2 1 moreover l35 showed an excellent regeneration performance with only a small amount of residue presented in the dilute phase after phase separation the copolymer residue in dilute phase can be further recovered through a simple post treatment using nanofiltration nf or low pressure ro see fig b3 it should be noted that the current challenges for l35 ds are their relatively high viscosity and regeneration temperature stemming from its high eo content however the high eo content also gave rise to its high osmotic pressure by understanding such important trade off effect novel copolymers with optimized osmotic pressure and high processability can be synthesized in the future by rationally tailoring the sequence and or number of eo and po segments the comparatively high regeneration temperature may not be a concern if a low grade waste heat can be utilized such as exhaust gases from boilers and furnaces and steam condensate from internal combustion engines etc jouhara et al 2018 3 2 long term stability of l35 ds with regeneration 3 2 1 fo performance with regenerated l35 ds the fo performance using 65 wt l35 ds with multi cycle ds regeneration was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 4 a in the 1st cycle with fresh l35 the initial water flux of tfc i was 10 8 l m 2 h 1 and mild flux drop to 10 4 l m 2 h 1 can be observed during the run after the 1st cleaning the flux initial flux in the 2nd cycle increased slightly to 10 6 l m 2 h 1 but was still not fully recovered more significant flux drop was observed in the 2nd to the 3rd cycle and the subsequent cleaning did not show much effect in recovering the flux interestingly the flux profiles from the 4th to the 10th cycle was almost identical i e from 7 1 l m 2 h 1 to 6 2 l m 2 h 1 within the 1 h operation suggesting that the flux can be stabled at this level as it was reversable by hydraulic flushing the observed water flux drop could be due to the membrane fouling as the amphiphilic copolymers can be easily adsorbed on the membrane surface to confirm if membrane fouling occurred a new membrane tfc ii was used from the 11th cycle the water flux jumped back to 10 7 l m 2 h 1 similar to the membrane tfc i s initial flux in the 1st cycle the flux declined by 35 at the end of the 13th cycle which was similar to the flux drop of tfc i membrane at the end of the 3rd run this confirmed that the original draw capacity of l35 was well maintained after multiple cycles of regeneration while the flux drop was mainly caused by membrane fouling in the multi cycle operation the js jv 1 of the membrane was sustained at the initial value of 0 04 g l 1 fig 4 a indicating that the membrane fouling may not significantly affect the water copolymer selectivity we also conducted an 8 h continuous fo run with simultaneous ds regeneration to further understand the membrane fouling phenomenon and demonstrate a more practical operation different from the multi cycle run the ds was regenerated concurrently during the fo test and recirculated to fo tank to maintain constant concentration of 65 the water flux performance is shown in fig 4 b the fo membrane showed a similar initial water flux of 10 7 l m 2 h 1 as compared to tfc i and tfc ii and presented a similar trend of flux drop severe flux decline occurred in the first 3 h and the flux became almost stable after 4 h run the results in fig 4 a and b may suggest that the membrane fouling due to the use of copolymer ds has a general trend 1 the initial flux decline was severe and the flux can be hardly reversable by hydraulic cleaning 2 the flux became almost stable after it reached a certain flux level and 3 after reaching the stable flux state the flux recovered from hydraulic cleaning was minimum and the cleaned membrane tended to return to the stable flux in a short time it is expected that operating at or below this stable flux level may maintain a sustainable water flux and further study can be conducted to validate the long term membrane behaviour in addition it is of great interest to investigate the effect of chemical cleaning on this type of membrane fouling by amphiphilic copolymer which can be systematically addressed in the next study to understand the membrane changes due to fouling the used tfc i after 10 cycle run and tfc ii after 3 cycle run were tested in the ro mode using ultrapure water and 500 ppm nacl as feed solution as shown in fig 5 a the water permeability a of the fouled membranes decreased by 58 compared to that of a virgin membrane while the nacl rejection rate increased resulting in an increased a b this could be related to the increased surface charge see fig 6 b in addition to the increased membrane resistance from the adsorbed thin layer of copolymer on the other hand the s value of the membranes increased significantly to 1 57 mm after 3 cycles of run tfc ii and to 2 72 mm after 10 cycles of run tfc i from the original 0 61 mm the increase in s value might be attributed to the adsorption of the low molecular weight copolymers in the support layer when they back diffused to the feed side during fo process in al ds orientation table d1 shows the fo water flux jv and specific solute flux js of the virgin and used membranes using 0 5 m nacl ds and ultrapure water as feed in al ds mode for s value calculation however the changes in membrane intrinsic properties interestingly had insignificant effect on fo performance for high salinity feed streams the used tfc i membrane after 10 cycle run was tested using 3 5 nacl and swro brine feeds fig 5 b and almost no water flux difference could be observed by comparing to the virgin membranes the high osmotic pressure of the feeds greatly reduced the effective driving force across the membrane making the membrane properties less critical therefore it is expected that a relatively stable fo water flux could be maintained when using l35 ds to concentrate hypersaline streams such as swro brine despite inevitable membrane fouling frequent membrane cleaning or replacement may not be a concern for such applications low operating water flux nevertheless a long term continuous operation is needed to evaluate the membrane stability and develop an appropriate cleaning strategy in the future study on the other hand fo membranes with enhanced antifouling properties can be developed to ensure the long term sustainability the used tfc i membrane was further characterized to examine the physico chemical properties fesem images fig e1 could hardly show the difference between the virgin and used membranes for both lumen and shell surfaces suggesting that l35 might only form a thin layer on the membrane surface that could not be resolved at 10 000 times magnification on the other hand xps results of the membrane s active surfaces fig 6 a show that c o peak increased significantly for the used membrane which could be attributed to the eo and po groups of the l35 the zeta potential results in fig 6 b also revealed the change in surface charge after running with the l35 ds the isoelectric point of the virgin membrane was at ph 3 8 in well accordance with the reported fully aromatic polyamide membranes with amine and carboxylic groups on the surface wang et al 2016b while the used tfc i membrane presented a slightly negatively charged surface 5 to 10 mv over the entire tested ph range which can be ascribed to the nonionic property of l35 the absorption of l35 on the membrane surface prevents amine s protonation at low ph or carboxylic acid s deprotonation at high ph shi et al 2021 smith mcwilliams et al 2019 the increased negative charge at ph 5 7 of the used tfc membrane may be partially responsible to the increased nacl rejection due to the increased charge repulsion see fig 5 a jun et al 2020 the change of membrane surface properties is consistent with the increased s value of the used membranes 3 2 2 chemical structure stability of copolymers the l35 showed well maintained high osmotic pressure after multiple cycles of regeneration its structure stability was further confirmed from the size distribution and functional groups fresh and regenerated l35 after the 5th and the 10th cycles were compared in fig 7 a the gpc results show that the retention time of l35 was similar for fresh and regenerated ones suggesting that the molecular weight distribution of l35 was almost unchanged however by taking a closer look the copolymer after the 5th and 10th cycle run showed a slightly longer retention time at tail indicating that a small amount of low molecular weight compounds may have been produced the atr ftir results fig 7 b show that stronger o h stretching band at 3 700 3 200 cm 1 and c o stretching at 1 720 cm 1 were observed for regenerated l35 this result suggests the increase in carboxyl groups which could be caused by copolymer thermal degradation during the regeneration process han et al 1995 the increased amount of carboxylic species was further confirmed by the ph change in the dilute phase in fig 7 c the dilute phase of l35 showed an initial ph of 4 4 from the 1st generation which decreased to ph 3 7 after the 2nd time regeneration and was eventually stable at ph 3 6 after the 4th cycle despite the minor changes observed for this type of thermo responsive copolymer the overall properties especially the fo draw capacity were well maintained after many cycles of run our results demonstrated the potential of thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer for practical application in fo process for the concentration of challenging high salinity water 4 conclusions this study systematically investigated the key properties of thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic copolymer as fo draw agent and the feasibility for fo concentration of high salinity feed streams total dissolved solutes 70 000 mg l 1 the results showed that the viscosity osmotic pressure and the lowest phase separation temperature of the copolymer solution were strongly dependent on the hydrophilic peo segments among the four commercial triblock copolymers studied pluronic l35 was the most favourable draw agent for fo due to its high osmotic pressure 100 bar at 65 wt acceptable viscosity and good regeneration property 5 000 mg l 1 residue in the dilute phase with 65 wt l35 ds water can be successfully reclaimed from high salinity swro brine at a fo water flux of 1 22 l m 2 h 1 in the al ds orientation in addition l35 ds showed excellent stability in terms of fo water flux and structural properties after the 13 cycles of ds regeneration on the other hand it is found that the adsorption of the copolymer on fo membranes was inevitable which also changed membrane intrinsic properties however fo performance was less dependent on membrane properties when high salinity feed water such as swro brine was applied these findings revealed that the thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic copolymer based fo process is highly promising for high salinity water desalination and zero liquid discharge appendixs d e credit authorship

15744,recently thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic copolymers have shown a great potential as forward osmosis fo draw solutes for high salinity water desalination and zero liquid discharge zld however the relationship between the copolymer structural properties and key characteristics as draw solutes as well as copolymer s chemical stability after regeneration have not been much studied in this work we systematically investigated poly ethylene oxide block poly propylene oxide block poly ethylene oxide peo ppo peo copolymers as draw solute the results showed that the peo segments significantly influenced the viscosity osmotic pressure and lowest phase separation temperature of the copolymer aqueous solutions among four commercial copolymers studied pluronic l35 with moderate molecular weight mn 1 900 da 50 peo and relatively high hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb showed the best draw solution ds performance it also showed great stability in physiochemical properties and draw capacity after more than ten cycles of regeneration on the other hand despite the fact that membrane fouling was observed due to the use of copolymer ds the fo flux 1 2 l m 2 h 1 as similar with the virgin membrane was not affected when high salinity feedwater such as seawater ro brine was applied overall our study has provided a more comprehensive understanding on the characteristics of nonionic amphiphilic copolymer ds and showcased the promise of copolymer driven fo process in high salinity water desalination and zld graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward osmosis fo thermo responsive draw solute nonionic amphiphilic copolymer high salinity water desalination zero liquid discharge zld data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the ever increasing industrial and human activities the worldwide freshwater resources are under unprecedented threat along with the rising cost for wastewater disposal and more stringent environmental regulations water reclamation from high salinity feed streams hypersaline brines e g containing dissolved solutes 70 000 mg l 1 has appeared as a practical strategy to minimize discharge volume or to achieve zero liquid discharge zld and to augment water supply and recover valuable resources wang et al 2020 thermo driven desalination processes such as mechanical vapor compression mvc multistage flash distillation msf and multiple effect distillation med are commonly used for high salinity water desalination tong and elimelech 2016 albeit the technical maturity they still face the challenges of considerable energy usage and high operation costs mcginnis et al 2013 the evaporation process in a single stage requires energy 630 kwh m 3 without heat recovery due to large amount of latent heat required for phase changes the relatively energy efficient low temperature med still requires 67 125 kwh m 3 thermal energy pinnu and bigham 2021 recently high pressure reverse osmosis hpro operating at a hydraulic pressure of more than 100 bar has shown a great potential in concentrating seawater reverse osmosis swro brine at a lower energy consumption electrical energy 7 3 12 kwh m 3 for concentration of a 70 000 mg l 1 swro brine davenport et al 2018 subramani and jacangelo 2015 however the high operating pressure and high salinity streams demand a large capital investment and rational design of high strength membranes muhammad and lee 2019 alternatively forward osmosis fo utilizing the osmotic pressure difference across a semi permeable membrane can concentrate a high salinity stream by employing a more concentrated draw solution ds li et al 2020 despite the advantages of high salinity limit low fouling propensity and low electrical energy consumption owned by fo chia et al 2021 tong and elimelech 2016 xie et al 2016 an ideal ds with features of high osmotic pressure easy regeneration less expensive and high retention by fo membranes is hardly found lutchmiah et al 2014 electrolyte based ds e g sodium chloride has been commonly used or studied due to its high osmotic pressure easy availability and large diffusion coefficient less concentration polarization issue but it is not suitable for high salinity feed due to energy intensive regeneration methods needed giagnorio et al 2019 wang et al 2018 in contrast thermo responsive ds is a more promising candidate due to its unique response to temperature and easy regeneration by using low grade waste heat or renewable energy sources hartanto et al 2019 li and wang 2013 their regeneration usually consumes less energy than med or other thermal driven desalination processes as most of them do not undergo phase change prior studies have reported many thermo responsive draw agents such as nh3 co2 mcginnis et al 2013 hydrogels hartanto et al 2015 li et al 2013 polyelectrolytes ou et al 2013 wang et al 2016a ionic liquids kamio et al 2019 zhong et al 2016 morpholine derivatives inada et al 2019a and ionic copolymers zhao et al 2014 but they still face challenges of draw solute residue in product water severe solute leakage to the feed stream zhao et al 2014 limited osmotic pressure ou et al 2013 low regeneration efficiency wei et al 2016 zhong et al 2016 and or poor stability alejo et al 2017 more recently nonionic amphiphilic block copolymers have demonstrated a great potential for fo application as thermo responsive draw agents ahmed et al 2019b inada et al 2019b in the forms of diblock triblock or branched types these copolymers are constituted with both hydrophilic monomers i e ethylene oxide eo groups and hydrophobic monomers i e propylene oxide po butylene oxide bo groups in a certain sequence with increasing temperature the solubility of the copolymer was reduced due to the breakdown of polymer water hydrogen bonds realizing the regeneration of concentrated copolymer ds instantly at the lowest phase separation temperature i e lowest critical solution temperature pérez sánchez et al 2019 prior studies reported that very high osmotic pressure could be achieved by certain large sized block copolymers e g 230 bar by a copolymer of mn 6 500 da at 81 wt gu and alexandridis 2004 but the high molecular weight high viscosity rendered them unsuitable for fo application block copolymers with smaller molecular weights mn 2 500 da such as ge7b3 74 bar at 68 wt could be synthesized by varying the number and sequence of the hydrophilic hydrophobic groups and was able to be used for seawater desalination inada et al 2019b a commercially available eo po based copolymer tl 1150 1 supplied by trevi systems inc was reported to have properties of high osmotic pressure easy regeneration reusability low reverse diffusion non corrosive non toxic and less expensive ahmed et al 2019b its performance had been demonstrated in a pilot study where the seawater was concentrated by 4 fold and the ds was continuously regenerated by heating at 85 c ahmed et al 2019a 2019b despite these promising results a comprehensive understanding about the block copolymer ds is still lacking for example it is unclear about the correlation between physicochemical properties of amphiphilic copolymer and its performance as draw solute the understanding on the relationship between ds characteristics such as osmotic pressure viscosity and regeneration ability and the copolymer structures such as molecular weight length of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments and the hydrophilic hydrophobic segment ratio would be beneficial for the design and selection of the appropriate copolymers for fo application moreover the chemical molecular structure and physical draw ability stabilities of the copolymers after multiple use and regeneration have not been explored in addition prior studies have not investigated how the amphiphilic copolymer interact with fo membranes it is of great interest to understand whether the membrane properties would change during fo runs and to know the feasibility of long term operation in this work we aimed to provide a useful guidance for selecting and developing a suitable thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic copolymer used as ds and to demonstrate the feasibility of applying this type of copolymer in fo process to handle high salinity feed streams a series of commercially available poly ethylene oxide block poly propylene oxide block poly ethylene oxide peo ppo peo copolymers were systematically investigated for their draw capacity and thermo responsive properties for fo application after that the most favourable copolymer was selected to study the fo performance using various feed streams including real seawater and brine from a seawater desalination plant the ds after multiple cycles of regeneration was carefully evaluated in terms of fo performance and structural properties and the membrane fouling accompanied by the use of ds was also assessed 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals in this study four types of peo ppo peo triblock copolymers named pluronic l31 l35 l61 and l64 sigma aldrich were investigated as the thermo

copolymer aqueous solutions with a concentration of 30 80 wt was measured by using a rheometer anton paar mcr102 compact rheometer austria each sample was measured at least three times at a shear rate of 500 2 000 s 1 at 25 c the osmotic pressure of copolymer solutions at different concentrations 30 75 wt was measured with fo experiments in brief the copolymer solution was placed on one side of a semi permeable membrane while a nacl solution of a known concentration was placed on the other side the osmotic pressure of the applied nacl solution was taken as that of the copolymer solution when the fo water flux was zero the osmotic pressure of nacl solution was calculated using oli analyzer 9 3 software oli systems inc morris plains nj wang et al 2016b the thermo responsive characteristics i e phase separation property of the l31 l35 and l61 copolymer solutions at various concentrations 5 80 wt were studied by heating or cooling the solution using a temperature controlled water bath heater julabo sw22 germany and chiller xtemp xt5618b china a sealed bottle containing homogeneous copolymer aqueous solution was placed in water bath the cloud point was identified by increasing the temperature from 0 c at a rate of 1 c per 10 min until the solution was turned into cloudy appearance after equilibrating overnight at the cloud point a clear bi phase i e dilute phase on top and dense phase at bottom could be visually observed for the copolymer solution indicating a complete phase separation the phase diagram was plotted with the lowest phase separation temperature to understand the separation effectiveness the phase separation tests were conducted using 20 wt copolymer aqueous solutions at temperatures ranging from 25 to 98 c at different equilibrating times 2 18

regeneration the schematic of a lab scale crossflow fo setup can be found in fig b1 the fo membrane module was operated in the active layer facing draw solution al ds mode with the ds flowing through the hf lumen without recirculation and the feed solution fs flowing on the shell side with recirculation the fo water flux jv l m 2 h 1 was calculated based on the differences between the ds flowrates at inlet and outlet of the module the solute flux js g m 2 h 1 was determined from the conductivity ultrameter ii myron or the toc variations in the feed a series of fo experiments were carried out for characterizing fo membrane intrinsic properties determining the effective draw power of copolymer ds and evaluating the stability of the copolymer ds for fo application the detailed experimental conditions and calculations are presented in appendix b the relatively longer and more complicated experiments are briefly described as below fo run with multi cycle ds regeneration for evaluating the stability of copolymer ds 500 ml fresh l35 copolymer at 65 wt was used as ds in the 1st cycle of fo run for 1 h the ds was not recirculated to ensure constant ds concentration during the run the diluted ds was regenerated by heating up at 98 c overnight in an oil bath after the 1st fo run and the concentration was adjusted to 65 wt prior to the 2nd cycle run the recovered water i e the dilute phase from regeneration was collected for ph measurement seven2go mettler toledo the fo run for 1 h followed by ds regeneration for overnight was repeated after 13 cycles were completed ultrapure water was used as feed for all the 13 runs regarding the membrane a new tfc fo membrane tfc i was applied from the 1st cycle and reused till the 10th cycle another new and identical membrane tfc ii was applied in the 11th cycle and reused till the 13th cycle of run it should be noted that after each fo run the membrane cleaning was conducted with ultrapure water flushing for 0 5 h continuous fo run with simultaneous ds regeneration for demonstration of a practical operation the fo process was integrated with a ds regeneration unit as depicted in fig b2 a new tfc fo membrane was applied l35 previously regenerated and ultrapure water were used as ds and fs respectively which were recirculated during the run meanwhile ds regeneration was performed by pumping out the diluted ds and heating with a 98 c oil bath with the dense phase cooled down to room temperature and pumped back to the ds tank at a controlled rate to maintain ds concentration at 65 wt 2 4 fo membrane characterization the pure water permeability a l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the solute permeability b l m 2 h 1 of the virgin and the used fo membranes were determined using a lab scale crossflow ro setup pure water flux jw l m 2 h 1 was measured at an applied pressure δp of 2 bar with ultrapure water feed the feed was changed to 500 ppm nacl solution for measuring the nacl rejection r based on the conductivities of the feed and permeate solutions the structural parameter s mm an intrinsic parameter for membrane support layer was determined using a b values and fo water flux results obtained in fo experiments see table b1 the detailed calculations for a b and s values are described in appendix c the morphologies of the virgin and used fo membranes were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope

solutions for fo application 3 1 1 physical properties of block copolymers viscosity and osmotic pressure are the two main properties for a ds the viscosity data of the four pluronic copolymer l31 l35 l61 and l64 aqueous solutions at concentration of 30 80 wt are presented in fig 1 a l35 and l64 with 22 and 26 hydrophilic eo units respectively demonstrated relatively high viscosity over the entire concentration range in particular l64 with the longest eo chains showed a surprisingly high viscosity of 643 mpa s at 50 wt concentration in contrast to 100 mpa s for the other three copolymers on the contrary the l31 and l61 with short eo chains only 4 units had a much lower viscosity the results revealed that the longer eo chains contribute to a copolymer aqueous solution with a higher viscosity as these hydrophilic units can facilitate their interactions with water and thus increase the viscosity ghaouar et al 2011 in addition a larger molecular size would also result in a higher viscosity pasquino et al 2019 the combined effects of large molecular size mn 2900 da largest among the four and the long eo chain may explain why l64 had so high viscosity on the contrary the length of hydrophobic po chains plays a less significant role in altering the viscosity evidenced from the l31 and l61 solutions which have similar viscosity same length of eo chains but different length of po chains on the other hand increasing copolymer concentration significantly increases the solution viscosity l64 could hardly be dissolved or stirred at concentration above 50 wt rendering it not suitable for fo application a ds of low viscosity is preferred for fo in order to mitigate the concentration polarization phenomenon and maximize the effective driving force across the membrane selective layer the osmotic pressures of aqueous solutions l31 l35 and l61 are shown in fig 1 b at concentration of 30 75 wt despite the same number of po units l35 presented an osmotic pressure ranging from 27 to 135 bar while l31 only showed a gentle increase in osmotic pressure from 18 to 35 bar the higher osmotic pressure of l35 can be ascribed to the larger number of the hydrophilic eo units that promoted more interactions with water gu and alexandridis 2004 on the other hand l61 owning to the same number of eo units as l31 showed an even lower osmotic pressure of 10 bar at 65wt this could be explained by the large molecular weight of l61 due to the larger number of po units molecular weight resulting in a significantly lower molar concentration at the same weight concentration zarrintaj et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 hence a draw solute with longer hydrophilic eo chains but a smaller molecular weight is favourable for gaining a higher osmotic pressure this characteristics can be also correlated to the hlb value or the peo ppo ratio as a larger hlb is generally corresponded to a higher osmotic pressure pérez sánchez et al 2019 due to the limited number of eo units possessed both l31 and l61 do not have sufficiently high osmotic pressure required by a good ds 3 1 2 thermo responsive properties of block copolymers the lowest phase separation temperatures of l31 l35 and l61 aqueous solutions at 5 80 wt are shown in fig 2 a among the three copolymers l35 exhibited the highest separation temperature followed by l31 and l61 l35 required a high temperature above 80 c for phase separation at low concentrations 20 wt and 98 c for concentration 60 wt the separation temperature trend was consistent with their hlb values l35 l31 l61 a higher hlb value generally refers to higher hydrophilicity and stronger hydration interactions with water thus l35 with a higher hlb value requires more energy for dehydration and phase separation inada et al 2019b pérez sánchez et al 2019 although a relatively lower separation temperature is preferred to reduce the thermal energy input for ds recovery an excessively low temperature was unpractical for operation such as l61 whose separation temperature was below 28 c when the concentration was lower than 60 wt the separation effectiveness was evaluated with 20 wt copolymer solutions at 25 98 c and the results are presented as the residual copolymer concentration in the dilute phase after phase separation fig 2 b the concentration in the dilute phase decreased with the increasing temperature for all the three copolymers interestingly although the observed phase separation could easily occur for l31 and l61 at a relatively low temperature 50 c a higher temperature was still required to maximize the recovery of the copolymer draw solute and to reduce the amount left in the dilute phase at 90 c and above all three copolymer solutions achieved a satisfying separation effectiveness with a relatively low copolymer concentration of 10 000 mg l 1 in the dilute phase this residue concentration is lower than that of other reported thermo responsive draw agents table 2 suggesting that the nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer is a favourable type of draw solutes in terms of regeneration in addition we evaluated separation efficiency by heating 20 wt l35 at 98 c for 2 18 h as shown in fig 2 c the residual l35 in the dilute phase reached 5 700 mg l 1 at 2 h and further decreased to 4700 mg l 1 at 18 h although a longer separation time could slightly enhance separation effectiveness a shorter duration such as 2 h is enough to achieve a satisfying outcome it should be noted that phase separation takes place almost instantly once reaching 98 c the duration of which is much shorter than 2 h the ds regeneration in industrial scale can be more efficient as it runs in a continuous process with preheating and cooling through a heat exchanger fig b3 3 1 3 fo performance of l35 copolymer ds considering the strong osmotic power appropriate viscosity and good regeneration capability l35 at 65 wt was selected as the ds for further evaluation in fo process 10 nacl solution with equivalent osmotic pressure 100 bar was also used as ds for comparison the fo process was conducted in the al ds configuration feed waters of different salinity ultrapure water 1 nacl 3 5 nacl swro brine and 10 nacl were tested as shown in fig 3 l35 ds led to a fo water flux of 10 7 l m 2 h 1 and a low specific solute flux js jv 1 of 0 035 g l 1 when ultrapure water feed was used the water flux was 4 times higher for 10 nacl ds but a much higher js jv 1 at 0 086 g l 1 was observed it is common to observe a lower water flux for polymer based ds as compared to electrolyte based ds due to the much smaller mass transfer coefficient of polymer based ds as a result of its high molecular weight and high viscosity that results in a severe dilutive concentration polarization phenomenon at the membrane active surface in al ds orientation shaffer et al 2015 zou et al 2019 nevertheless the water flux difference between the cases of l35 and nacl ds became smaller with increased osmotic pressure of the feed when swro brine osmotic pressure 40 bar was used as feed the water flux was 1 22 and 4 26 l m 2 h 1 for the l35 and nacl ds respectively the high salinity feed could result in a severe internal concentration polarization in this al ds orientation rendering an extremely low overall effective driving force across the membrane hence the use of polymer based ds in fo can still be competitive for high salinity feeds especially when their easy regeneration and low reverse flux features show additional advantages the state of the art thermo responsive draw agents are summarized in table 2 compared with other types of draw agents the l35 ds 65 wt in this work presented a relatively high osmotic power together with the use of our in house made tfc fo membrane large a value of 4 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and large a b of 13 8 bar 1 a relatively high water flux and low solute leakage could be achieved nevertheless a high performance fo membrane may not be necessary for high salinity feed application which will be demonstrated in section 3 2 1 moreover l35 showed an excellent regeneration performance with only a small amount of residue presented in the dilute phase after phase separation the copolymer residue in dilute phase can be further recovered through a simple post treatment using nanofiltration nf or low pressure ro see fig b3 it should be noted that the current challenges for l35 ds are their relatively high viscosity and regeneration temperature stemming from its high eo content however the high eo content also gave rise to its high osmotic pressure by understanding such important trade off effect novel copolymers with optimized osmotic pressure and high processability can be synthesized in the future by rationally tailoring the sequence and or number of eo and po segments the comparatively high regeneration temperature may not be a concern if a low grade waste heat can be utilized such as exhaust gases from boilers and furnaces and steam condensate from internal combustion engines etc jouhara et al 2018 3 2 long term stability of l35 ds with regeneration 3 2 1 fo performance with regenerated l35 ds the fo performance using 65 wt l35 ds with multi cycle ds regeneration was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 4 a in the 1st cycle with fresh l35 the initial water flux of tfc i was 10 8 l m 2 h 1 and mild flux drop to 10 4 l m 2 h 1 can be observed during the run after the 1st cleaning the flux initial flux in the 2nd cycle increased slightly to 10 6 l m 2 h 1 but was still not fully recovered more significant flux drop was observed in the 2nd to the 3rd cycle and the subsequent cleaning did not show much effect in recovering the flux interestingly the flux profiles from the 4th to the 10th cycle was almost identical i e from 7 1 l m 2 h 1 to 6 2 l m 2 h 1 within the 1 h operation suggesting that the flux can be stabled at this level as it was reversable by hydraulic flushing the observed water flux drop could be due to the membrane fouling as the amphiphilic copolymers can be easily adsorbed on the membrane surface to confirm if membrane fouling occurred a new membrane tfc ii was used from the 11th cycle the water flux jumped back to 10 7 l m 2 h 1 similar to the membrane tfc i s initial flux in the 1st cycle the flux declined by 35 at the end of the 13th cycle which was similar to the flux drop of tfc i membrane at the end of the 3rd run this confirmed that the original draw capacity of l35 was well maintained after multiple cycles of regeneration while the flux drop was mainly caused by membrane fouling in the multi cycle operation the js jv 1 of the membrane was sustained at the initial value of 0 04 g l 1 fig 4 a indicating that the membrane fouling may not significantly affect the water copolymer selectivity we also conducted an 8 h continuous fo run with simultaneous ds regeneration to further understand the membrane fouling phenomenon and demonstrate a more practical operation different from the multi cycle run the ds was regenerated concurrently during the fo test and recirculated to fo tank to maintain constant concentration of 65 the water flux performance is shown in fig 4 b the fo membrane showed a similar initial water flux of 10 7 l m 2 h 1 as compared to tfc i and tfc ii and presented a similar trend of flux drop severe flux decline occurred in the first 3 h and the flux became almost stable after 4 h run the results in fig 4 a and b may suggest that the membrane fouling due to the use of copolymer ds has a general trend 1 the initial flux decline was severe and the flux can be hardly reversable by hydraulic cleaning 2 the flux became almost stable after it reached a certain flux level and 3 after reaching the stable flux state the flux recovered from hydraulic cleaning was minimum and the cleaned membrane tended to return to the stable flux in a short time it is expected that operating at or below this stable flux level may maintain a sustainable water flux and further study can be conducted to validate the long term membrane behaviour in addition it is of great interest to investigate the effect of chemical cleaning on this type of membrane fouling by amphiphilic copolymer which can be systematically addressed in the next study to understand the membrane changes due to fouling the used tfc i after 10 cycle run and tfc ii after 3 cycle run were tested in the ro mode using ultrapure water and 500 ppm nacl as feed solution as shown in fig 5 a the water permeability a of the fouled membranes decreased by 58 compared to that of a virgin membrane while the nacl rejection rate increased resulting in an increased a b this could be related to the increased surface charge see fig 6 b in addition to the increased membrane resistance from the adsorbed thin layer of copolymer on the other hand the s value of the membranes increased significantly to 1 57 mm after 3 cycles of run tfc ii and to 2 72 mm after 10 cycles of run tfc i from the original 0 61 mm the increase in s value might be attributed to the adsorption of the low molecular weight copolymers in the support layer when they back diffused to the feed side during fo process in al ds orientation table d1 shows the fo water flux jv and specific solute flux js of the virgin and used membranes using 0 5 m nacl ds and ultrapure water as feed in al ds mode for s value calculation however the changes in membrane intrinsic properties interestingly had insignificant effect on fo performance for high salinity feed streams the used tfc i membrane after 10 cycle run was tested using 3 5 nacl and swro brine feeds fig 5 b and almost no water flux difference could be observed by comparing to the virgin membranes the high osmotic pressure of the feeds greatly reduced the effective driving force across the membrane making the membrane properties less critical therefore it is expected that a relatively stable fo water flux could be maintained when using l35 ds to concentrate hypersaline streams such as swro brine despite inevitable membrane fouling frequent membrane cleaning or replacement may not be a concern for such applications low operating water flux nevertheless a long term continuous operation is needed to evaluate the membrane stability and develop an appropriate cleaning strategy in the future study on the other hand fo membranes with enhanced antifouling properties can be developed to ensure the long term sustainability the used tfc i membrane was further characterized to examine the physico chemical properties fesem images fig e1 could hardly show the difference between the virgin and used membranes for both lumen and shell surfaces suggesting that l35 might only form a thin layer on the membrane surface that could not be resolved at 10 000 times magnification on the other hand xps results of the membrane s active surfaces fig 6 a show that c o peak increased significantly for the used membrane which could be attributed to the eo and po groups of the l35 the zeta potential results in fig 6 b also revealed the change in surface charge after running with the l35 ds the isoelectric point of the virgin membrane was at ph 3 8 in well accordance with the reported fully aromatic polyamide membranes with amine and carboxylic groups on the surface wang et al 2016b while the used tfc i membrane presented a slightly negatively charged surface 5 to 10 mv over the entire tested ph range which can be ascribed to the nonionic property of l35 the absorption of l35 on the membrane surface prevents amine s protonation at low ph or carboxylic acid s deprotonation at high ph shi et al 2021 smith mcwilliams et al 2019 the increased negative charge at ph 5 7 of the used tfc membrane may be partially responsible to the increased nacl rejection due to the increased charge repulsion see fig 5 a jun et al 2020 the change of membrane surface properties is consistent with the increased s value of the used membranes 3 2 2 chemical structure stability of copolymers the l35 showed well maintained high osmotic pressure after multiple cycles of regeneration its structure stability was further confirmed from the size distribution and functional groups fresh and regenerated l35 after the 5th and the 10th cycles were compared in fig 7 a the gpc results show that the retention time of l35 was similar for fresh and regenerated ones suggesting that the molecular weight distribution of l35 was almost unchanged however by taking a closer look the copolymer after the 5th and 10th cycle run showed a slightly longer retention time at tail indicating that a small amount of low molecular weight compounds may have been produced the atr ftir results fig 7 b show that stronger o h stretching band at 3 700 3 200 cm 1 and c o stretching at 1 720 cm 1 were observed for regenerated l35 this result suggests the increase in carboxyl groups which could be caused by copolymer thermal degradation during the regeneration process han et al 1995 the increased amount of carboxylic species was further confirmed by the ph change in the dilute phase in fig 7 c the dilute phase of l35 showed an initial ph of 4 4 from the 1st generation which decreased to ph 3 7 after the 2nd time regeneration and was eventually stable at ph 3 6 after the 4th cycle despite the minor changes observed for this type of thermo responsive copolymer the overall properties especially the fo draw capacity were well maintained after many cycles of run our results demonstrated the potential of thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer for practical application in fo process for the concentration of challenging high salinity water 4 conclusions this study systematically investigated the key properties of thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic copolymer as fo draw agent and the feasibility for fo concentration of high salinity feed streams total dissolved solutes 70 000 mg l 1 the results showed that the viscosity osmotic pressure and the lowest phase separation temperature of the copolymer solution were strongly dependent on the hydrophilic peo segments among the four commercial triblock copolymers studied pluronic l35 was the most favourable draw agent for fo due to its high osmotic pressure 100 bar at 65 wt acceptable viscosity and good regeneration property 5 000 mg l 1 residue in the dilute phase with 65 wt l35 ds water can be successfully reclaimed from high salinity swro brine at a fo water flux of 1 22 l m 2 h 1 in the al ds orientation in addition l35 ds showed excellent stability in terms of fo water flux and structural properties after the 13 cycles of ds regeneration on the other hand it is found that the adsorption of the copolymer on fo membranes was inevitable which also changed membrane intrinsic properties however fo performance was less dependent on membrane properties when high salinity feed water such as swro brine was applied these findings revealed that the thermo responsive nonionic amphiphilic copolymer based fo process is highly promising for high salinity water desalination and zero liquid discharge appendixs d e credit authorship
