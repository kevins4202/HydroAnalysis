18755,this study investigates the efficiency of anaerobically digested sludge ads conditioning using peroxymonosulfate pms activated by edta chelated fe2 process pms edta fe2 and the roles and mechanism of edta are explored by investigating the capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf bound water content bwc extracellular polymeric substances eps iron species transformation sludge morphology and active radicals formation pms edta fe2 process exhibits better performance in sludge dewatering than pms fe2 process upon the introduction of edta at optimum molar ratio of edta to fe2 r edta fe 2 of 1 3 cst srf and bwc are decreased by 60 0 70 6 and 1 5 and the cell viability is decreased from 75 4 to as low as 24 7 edta introduction significantly enhances the yield of active radicals i e so 4 and o h by nearly 50 as compared to pms fe2 process this effect contributes to stronger cells lysis as indicated by sem and clsm and the contents of polysaccharide and protein in total eps fractions are increased by 19 2 and 37 4 accordingly additionally edta increases the iron mobility by forming feii iii edta complexes and potentially inhibits ads coagulation at high doses the total dissolved iron fetot dis concentration increases from 203 4 mg l to 601 4 mg l due to the introduction of edta at 0 4 mmol g vss and the dominant iron species in supernatant transformed from fe2 to fe3 accordingly the optimization of edta doses is significant to balance oxidation and coagulation effects and to achieve better dewatering performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobically digested sludge dewaterability peroxymonosulfate activation edta chelated fe2 extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction the plentiful production and disposal of municipal sludge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps has received great concern in the past decades in china 6 25 million tons dry solid was generated in 2013 with the high average annual growth of 13 yang et al 2015 and the production of municipal sludge was expected to exceed 60 million tons in 2020 dai 2012 at present china mainly uses sanitary landfill incineration composting and resource utilization e g cement and brick etc for sludge disposal jin et al 2014 the anaerobic digestion ad has been suggested by the government as the preferred process for sludge disposal although approximately 60 wwtps use ad process among 3900 wwtps currently ministry of housing and urban rural development of p r china 2015 zhang 2006 the high moisture content i e above 90 in general mahmoud et al 2011 increases the difficulty and cost for sludge transportation treatment and ultimate disposal the promising sludge conditioning and dewatering is of great significance for sludge disposal and reclamation cao et al 2018 nowadays ad has been widely applied in many large scale wwtps worldwide to enable sludge stabilization and energy recovery however anaerobically digested sludge ads dewatering is difficult due to its smaller particle size higher alkalinity and greater viscosity pei et al 2007 waclawek et al 2016 wang et al 2018 and some conditioning methods for the conventional activated sludge could hardly achieve good performance shao et al 2012 wang et al 2014 2017b the widely used reagents for sludge conditioning include flocculants skeleton builders and oxidants chen et al 2010 luo et al 2018 qi et al 2011a flocculants such as iron salts aluminum salts and polyacrylamide pam benefit sludge particles aggregation large flocs formation and mechanical dewatering involving in the mechanisms of double layer electric field compressing cation bridging and sweeping effect qi et al 2011a skeleton builders as coal fly ash chen et al 2010 and filter acid qi et al 2011b are sometimes utilized to form permeable grid structure in sludge cakes and this promotes the outflow of free water during mechanical dehydration wu et al 2017b these two strategies mainly enhance the release of free water within sludge and show limited efficiency towards bound water zhang et al 2016 the extra dosing of oxidants such as kmno4 naclo and h2o2 luo et al 2018 is assumedly to destruct the cells walls and to improve the release of intracellular water as well as molecular bound water this performance may potentially benefit sludge conditioning and benefit the recovery of carbon sources and nutrients thereafter the concentrations of soluble dichromate oxygen demand codcr total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in sludge filtrate were reported to increase notably with fenton oxidation coupled with ultrasound upon sludge conditioning gong et al 2015 the filtrate could be potentially recovered as denitrification carbon sources and the raw material of struvite abel denee et al 2018 kim et al 2009 waclawek et al 2016 besides pre oxidation treatment of sludge was demonstrated to enhance short chain fatty acids production in the process of anaerobic fermentation yang et al 2019 the positive effects of advanced oxidation processes aops e g fenton oxidation and persulfate ps oxidation on sludge dewaterability have been reported dewil et al 2005 neyens et al 2003 persulfate oxidation activated by ferrous ion ps fe2 was observed to improve activated sludge dewatering zhen et al 2012c and the synergetic effect was achieved upon the introduction of phosphogypsum as skeleton builder shi et al 2015 more recent studies have indicated that activated persulfate peroxymonosulfate enhanced sludge dewaterability when combined with other processes e g thermal treatment and electrolysis electrocoagulation li et al 2016 2018 the generation of hydroxyl radicals o h and sulfate radicals so 4 by fe2 catalyzed decomposition of h2o2 and ps plays an important role to improve dewaterability dewil et al 2005 liu et al 2012 zhen et al 2012a additionally the newly formed iron hydroxide behaves as coagulants and skeleton builders to promote dewatering performance neyens and baeyens 2003 however the utilization of active radicals is generally limited due to the excessive radicals consumption by fe2 and the cost is increased greatly han et al 2015 besides the optimum low ph range i e ph 4 0 and the ph adjustment operation complicate the maintenance and lower the feasibility of fenton reagents in engineering point of view badawy and ali 2006 the introduction of chelating agents e g ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta and citric acid ca into fenton and ps systems was reported to achieve radicals generation at elevated ph and to improve pollutants degradation in solution de luca et al 2014 tan et al 2012 the chelating agents of edta and ethylene diamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid sodium edtmps also showed positive effects on sludge conditioning in fenton system he et al 2017b however the application of fenton reagents is restricted by the low h2o2 content 30 in products the difficulty in transportation and the safety problems solid ps overcomes these disadvantages and the adaptation in wide ph range enables its practical priority as compared to fenton reagents the introduction of chelating agents may also improve sludge conditioning by fe2 activated peroxymonosulfate pms fe2 however rare studies have focused on it before the widely used hexadentate ligand of edta exhibits strong chelating efficacy and low toxicity and can form stable complexes with different metal ions such as fe2 and fe3 this study uses edta as a typical chelating agent and aims to 1 investigate the effects of edta on activating

was obtained with a laser diffraction based particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge dewaterability fig 1 compares the dewaterability as expressed by cst and srf between the raw sludge and those being conditioned by different processes and pms edta fe2 exhibited best performance among these processes pms oxidation slightly decreased cst from 599 9 s to 527 2 s and decreased srf from 3 0 1010 s2 g to 2 5 1010 s2 g fe2 coagulation also showed positive effect and cst and srf were decreased by 38 1 and 42 6 respectively at 1 2 mmol fe2 g vss the combined use of pms and fe2 further decreased cst and srf to 304 1 s and 1 4 1010 s2 g respectively and the introduction of edta into pms fe2 contributed to significant cst and srf decrease by 60 0 and 70 6 respectively sludge dewaterability was affected by the charge properties of particle surface and the higher ζ potential showed beneficial effects as shown in fig s2 the ζ potential of ads was as low as 21 8 mv and then increased to 20 2 mv 18 2 mv and 15 2 mv after being conditioned by pms pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 respectively the higher ζ potential were the combined effects of the lower ph and the charge neutralization of ads by fe3 and fe2 hu et al 2018 the decreased absolute values of ζ potential indicated the lower electrostatic repulsion between sludge particles and this effect favored sludge flocs aggregation and dewatering thereafter zhen et al 2012b fig 2 a illustrates the effects of edta at different doses on cst values by pms edta fe2 conditioning edta shows positive effects on ads filtering and its optimum dose was observed to be 0 4 mmol g vss at which cst was decreased to as low as 240 2 s at edta doses of below 0 4 mmol g vss the cst values decreased continuously with higher edta doses in the absence of pms edta in edta fe2 process showed inhibitive effects on sludge filtering and the cst continuously increased with higher edta doses in wide range of 0 0 6 mmol g vss fig 2b the formation of fe2 edta complexes was quantitatively analyzed by minteq software modeling fig s3 in the absence of edta fe2 was the main fe ii species in ph 6 8 with the introduction of edta at 0 0 01 and 0 015 mmol l the feedta2 concentrations were calculated to be 0 0 094 and 0 014 mmol l whereas the fe2 concentrations decreased from 0 017 to 0 012 and 0 009 mmol l at ph 7 8 in fe3 solution the hydrolysis product of fe oh 2 was the predominate species at ph 6 8 and the ratios of which were observed to be above 90 accordingly upon edta introduction at 0 015 mmol l the fe oh 2 concentration deceased to 0 015 mmol l whereas that of feedta increased to 0 006 mmol l at ph 7 the edta chelating effect reduced the amount of fe2 and fe3 available for destabilization and charge neutralization of ads and the inhibitive effects were observed accordingly the observed positive effect of edta on ads conditioning was attributed to the enhanced activation of pms by fe2 upon being chelated by edta niu et al 2012 edta at elevated dose of 0 6 mmol g vss increased cst to as high as 338 2 s which was even higher than that without edta introduction i e pms fe2 process the adverse effect was probably caused by diminished coagulation effect accompanied by excessive edta introduction 3 2 bound water and cell viability fig 3 a compares the bwc and cell viability of ads after being conditioned by different processes pms oxidation at khso5 concentration of 1 0 mmol g vss decreased the bwc from 89 1 to 88 8 and fe2 activated pms contributed to lower bwc of 88 5 pms activated by edta fe2 further decreased bwc which was observed to be 88 2 87 7 and 87 5 at edta doses of 0 1 0 4 and 0 6 mmol g vss the lowered bwc indicated the conversion of bound water to free water liu et al 2016 the enhanced pms oxidation towards cells and eps benefits bound water release upon exposure to oxidants the bound water trapped in slime eps lb eps and tb eps and the intracellular water tended to release and transform to free water thereafter wu et al 2018 fig 3b illustrates the cell viability upon ads conditioning and the typical clsm images were presented in fig s4 these results may further support the bound water content variation in different processes pms at khso5 dose of 1 0 mmol g vss decreased cell viability from 75 4 to 61 9 and the lower value of 42 7 was obtained by pms fe2 pms edta fe2 at redta fe 2 of 1 3 further depressed cell viability to 24 7 the reduced cell viability was indicative of the wreck of cell integrity and this effect benefited the release of cellular moisture the variation of cell viability and bwc was in accordance with the cst results in fig 1 as for pms edta fe2 at 0 6 mmol g vss edta bwc deceased to 87 5 whereas cst increased to 338 2 s fig 2a and this indicated the two different roles of edta involved in edta introduction improved pms oxidation efficiency and showed positive effect on the other hand edta adversely affected iron coagulation fig 2b and inhibit sludge dewatering accordingly the results of particle size distribution in fig s5 demonstrated that as compared to pms fe2 process pms edta fe2 conditioning at edta concentration of 0 6 mmol g vss decreased median particle diameter d50 of ads from 84 7 μm to 30 0 μm 3 3 eps composition eps primarily consists of polysaccharide and protein and is the vital component of sludge flocs zhen et al 2012a and its components distribution was reported to significantly affect dewatering performance kim et al 2016 luo et al 2018 kalogo and monteith 2008 yu et al 2019 fig 4 compares the species distribution of polysaccharide and protein for three eps fractions i e slime eps lb eps and tb eps after being conditioned by different processes pms oxidation contributed to apparent eps increase by 44 5 for polysaccharide and by 56 2 for protein among these three eps fractions slime eps exhibited the most significant increase upon pms oxidation interestingly pms fe2 process with stronger oxidation decreased rather than increased the content of polysaccharide by 24 2 and that of protein by 57 4 as compared to pms oxidation this could be attributed to the combined effects of iron coagulation and eps decomposition by pms fe2 oxidation zhen et al 2012a fe2 ion activates pms and the in situ formed fe3 showed coagulation towards sludge to investigate the individual effect of pms oxidation on eps composition as a metal with much weaker coagulation capacity than iron co2 at 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 mmol g vss were introduced to activate pms and the variation of eps content was illustrated in fig s6a results indicated that toc content of eps increased from 805 1 mg l to 986 0 mg l with elevated co2 concentrations from 0 to 0 2 mmol g vss at higher co2 concentration i e 1 2 mmol g vss toc content in eps decreased to as low as 496 6 mg l thereafter the released eps can be further degraded by pms oxidation fig s6b and pms at 10 mm khso5 contributed to partial mineralization of the pre extracted eps from sludge and toc decreased from 101 8 mg l to 93 5 mg l accordingly on the other hand fe2 and fe3 improved eps attachment to sludge by coagulation effect and the lowered content of polysaccharide and protein were observed fig s7 compared to pms fe2 process pms fe2 edta increased the content of polysaccharide by 3 4 19 2 and 22 4 and that of protein by 22 8 37 4 and 88 7 at edta doses of 0 1 0 4 and 0 6 mmol g vss respectively this could be first attributed to the enhanced release of eps and intracellular organic matter iom additionally the chelating of edta with fe2 and fe3 potentially weakened their coagulation efficiency and in the absence of pms the content of polysaccharide and protein was observed to increase upon edta introduction fig s7 upon the exposure to pms fe2 edta process the release and degradation of eps and the coagulation by fe2 fe3 occurred and these effects were reported to favor sludge dewatering accordingly he et al 2017a wang et al 2017a zhen et al 2018 3d eems spectra with high sensitivity and good selectivity are widely used to characterize organic matters fig 5 illustrates the eems spectra of tb eps and lb eps fractions for ads and those being conditioned by different processes it was noted that slime eps fractions were not analyzed by eems spectra because the high dilution ratios were required to avoid inner filtering effect four fluorescent peaks located at an ex em of 220 225 nm 355 365 nm peak a 278 280 nm 360 370 nm peak b 265 275 nm 410 425 nm peak c and 220 225 nm 390 400 nm peak d can be observed and they were respectively identified as aromatic protein like substances soluble microbial by product like substances humic acid like substances and fulvic acid like substances chen et al 2003 the fluorescence intensity fi of these four peaks were observed to gradually decrease with enhanced oxidation for both tb eps and lb eps fractions table 2 the fi of peak a in tb eps was determined to be 1959 for raw ads which decreased to 1932 1435 and 887 after conditioning with pms pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 processes the corresponsive fi of peak a in lb eps decreased from 1800 to 1606 907 and 679 accordingly and similar phenomena were observed for the peak b of both tb eps and lb eps the decreased fi was relative to the weakened fluorescence of aromatic protein like substances and soluble microbial by product like substances however the protein content as determined by chemical analysis was observed to increase rather than decrease with enhanced pms fe2 by edta fig 4b and this may be attributed to occurrence state and molecular structure changes of proteins after being exposed to strong oxidants the secondary structure represented by the α helix was demonstrated to be destructed after aops wu et al 2017a and fluorescence characteristics of proteins were closely affected by molecular structure for instance tryptophan exhibited weaker fi with occurrence of unfolding of proteins wu 2003 wang et al 2001 yan et al 1997 although proteins could be detected by chemical analysis for maintaining primary structure their fluorescence characteristics varied with secondary structure transformation like unfolding and despiralization caused by aops and the inconsistence was observed accordingly similar phenemona was reported in recent research with respect to ads conditioning by indigenous persulfate activation maqbool et al 2019 3 4 species distribution of different metals fig 6 illustrates the distribution of iron after being conditioned by different processes as compared to pms fe2 process the total dissolved iron fetot dis concentrations in centrifugation supernatants increased whereas those of ferrous decreased upon edta introduction fig 6a the fetot dis in raw sludge supernatant was as low as 12 1 mg l and there showed little variation after pms oxidation in pms fe2 process fetot dis increased significantly to as high as 203 4 mg l due to fe2 addition in pms edta fe2 process edta at 0 1 0 4 0 6 mmol g vss further increased fetot dis by 65 0 195 7 and 291 9 and this indicated the stronger mobility of iron the formation of soluble complexes with edta improved metals mobility in soil and sludge has been reported before zhang et al 2010 in pms fe2 process ferrous fe ii concentration was determined to be 187 7 mg l and fe ii account for 92 3 of the fetot dis content in supernatant the excessive fe2 consumed so 4 and o h radicals formed in fe2 activated pms han et al 2015 and potentially inhibited sludge conditioning edta at elevated doses decreased fe ii concentrations in supernatant to 13 8 mg l 35 7 mg l and 72 7 mg l the extremely higher fe3 concentrations i e fetot dis fe ii were attributed to the soluble edta chelated fe3 complexes fig 6b illustrates the variation of total particulate iron content fetot partic after being conditioned by these processes fetot partic was determined to be 21 3 and 19 6 mg g tss for raw ads and that with pms oxidation fetot partic remarkably increased to 34 1 mg g tss in pms fe2 process which decreased to 33 4 31 9 and 29 8 mg g tss with the addition of edta at 0 1 0 4 and 0 6 mmol g vss the particulate iron i e iron hydrolysis products tends to deposit in sludge and the dissolved iron is more likely to exist in the supernatant the dominant iron species transformed from iron hydrolysis products to soluble feedta fig s3 and the lowered fetot partic was observed thereafter fig 6 implied the positive effect of edta on sludge flocculation and pms oxidation and this effect was in good accordance with the variation of cst and eps fractions sludge conditioning by chemicals may affect the species transformation mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals therein in this study bcr extraction method was employed to compare the species distribution variation of heavy metals i e zn cu pb and ni after being conditioned by these processes fig 7 the recoveries of these metals were in the range from 80 to 110 table s2 and the validity and reliability of bcr method is confirmed the total metal content followed the sequence of zn cu pb ni table s1 sludge conditioning processes have significant effects on the migration and transformation of heavy metals as for raw ads the reducible f2 and oxidizable fraction f3 were the main zn species with the ratios of 57 7 and 26 2 respectively after being conditioned by pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 r edta fe 2 1 3 the ratios of weak acid soluble fraction f1 increased from 9 0 to 49 4 and 43 6 as the dominant species whereas the ratios of oxidizable fraction decreased from 26 2 to 10 5 and 11 6 accordingly the oxidizable fraction was the main cu species with the ratio of 91 0 which slightly decreased to 89 4 83 4 and 81 8 after being conditioned by pms pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 meanwhile the ratios of reducible fraction f2 increased from 1 8 to 3 1 5 0 and 6 4 accordingly in raw ads pb dominantly existed as the residual fraction f4 with the ratio of 76 4 pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 slightly changed the ratios of f4 to 76 6 and 72 7 whereas the ratios of the oxidizable fraction f3 increased from 13 6 to 16 4 and 17 8 with regard to ni in raw ads the oxidizable f3 and residual fraction f4 were the dominant species with the ratios of 35 2 and 33 1 respectively after being conditioned by pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 the ratios of oxidizable fraction f3 decreased to 22 8 and 23 4 whereas those of residual fraction f4 increased to 39 5 and 39 7 generally the ratios of oxidable fraction f3 decreased after being exposed to pms and pms fe2 processes for these heavy metals except for pb this may be attributed to the destruction of the metals and organics upon pms oxidation however edta introduction increased the ratio of oxidizable fraction f3 owing to the strong chelation between metals and edta 3 5 sem images sem images of the sludge were illustrated in fig 8 and the observed results were consistent with the variation of bwc and cell viability fig 3 raw ads showed many cell clusters with intact shape fig 8a and the grape like cells fig 8b and porous spherical cells fig 8c with structural integrity could be clearly found therein the plentiful sticky organic substances i e eps surrounded these cells pms oxidation caused structure destruction within cell clusters for minority cells fig 8d and the corroded shell like structure were observed nevertheless the structure integrity of most cells remained due to limited oxidative capacity of pms in pms fe2 process the cellular structure of much more cells destroyed fig 8e as indicated from the numerous irregular holes on cell surfaces fig 8f and the cells with complete cellular structure could also be observed pms edta fe2 process strongly destroyed membrane structure of cells and the irregular cell holes and cellular residues were observed without any intact cells fig 8g additionally pms edta fe2 process contributed to more porous eps morphology as compared to pms fe2 process fig s8 and this effect potentially benefited water exclusion involved in filter pressing 3 6 proposed pathways and mechanisms involved in ads conditioning to further illustrate the mechanisms of pms edta fe2 process involved in ads conditioning epr spectrometer was applied to detect the formation of active radicals involved in the epr signal fig 9 confirmed the formation of o h radicals probably due to the conversion of so 4 to o h in the presence of h2o hayon et al 1972 liang et al 2009 the signal intensity of o h was rather weak in pms process and this supported its low oxidative efficacy in fig 1 in pms fe2 system fe2 activated pms to generate sulfate radical i e so 4 wang and chu 2011 and the o h signal intensity was enhanced accordingly the excessive fe2 potentially act as the scavenger of so 4 and o h and the consumption of them inhibited oxidation efficiency the signal intensity of active radicals in pms edta fe2 process was nearly one and a half times stronger than that in pms fe2 process fig 9 edta tended to chelate free fe2 and decreased its concentration and this effect minimized the consumption of active radicals and improved the utilization efficiency liang et al 2004 niu et al 2012 the possible reactions involved in were proposed in

mechanisms involved in the conditioning of ads by activated pms sludge flocs consist of cell clusters with eps surrounding part of water molecular was trapped within eps and some of them existed inside the cells and was called as intracellular water active radicals of so 4 and o h attacked eps and this effect liberated the eps trapped water therein additionally active radicals damaged sludge flocs and destructed the cells structure in the cluster and the release of intracellular water and organics occurred to benefit ads dewatering radicals quenching tests employing ethanol etoh as the radical scavenger were carried out in fig s9 with addition of etoh at 1 ml 100 ml ads cst cst0 and srf srf0 values increased from 0 40 to 0 29 to 0 62 and 0 50 respectively this confirmed the contribution of so 4 and o h in improving dewatering performance of ads as for eps and the released intracellular organics the degradation by active radicals and coagulation by feii iii and their hydrolysis products occurred during pms edta fe2 process pms oxidation was significantly enhanced whereas the coagulation efficacy was potentially inhibited due to the formation of feii iii edta complexes the stronger pms activation by edta played an important role to achieve good dewatering performance and to harvest valuable resources from ads however the overdosed edta potentially inhibited dewatering by the formation of feii iii edta complexes and the edta doses should be carefully optimized to balance its effects on oxidation and coagulation 4 conclusions this study investigates the dewatering performance and mechanism of ads by pms edta fe2 process the oxidation of ads by activated pms benefits dewatering owing to the lower cell integrity and the release of eps trapped and the intracellular water molecular as compared to pms fe2 process pms edta fe2 at optimal molar ratio of edta to fe2 of 1 3 exhibits stronger oxidation and the better dewatering performance accordingly at elevated edta doses the overdosed edta potentially forms complexes with iron salts and reduced their coagulation efficacy towards ads and this effect deteriorates dewatering greatly the dewatering performance of pms edta fe2 is the combined effects of oxidation and coagulation and should be carefully balanced to achieve the optimum performance as much as possible additionally the eps may include functional groups to chelate with fe2 and this study indicate their potentially positive effect on ads conditioning by fe2 activated pms although further studies are required to clarify it advanced research to replace edta with more biodegradable chelating agents should be carried out considering the potential disruption of edta to the performance of the mainstream wastewater treatment

18755,this study investigates the efficiency of anaerobically digested sludge ads conditioning using peroxymonosulfate pms activated by edta chelated fe2 process pms edta fe2 and the roles and mechanism of edta are explored by investigating the capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf bound water content bwc extracellular polymeric substances eps iron species transformation sludge morphology and active radicals formation pms edta fe2 process exhibits better performance in sludge dewatering than pms fe2 process upon the introduction of edta at optimum molar ratio of edta to fe2 r edta fe 2 of 1 3 cst srf and bwc are decreased by 60 0 70 6 and 1 5 and the cell viability is decreased from 75 4 to as low as 24 7 edta introduction significantly enhances the yield of active radicals i e so 4 and o h by nearly 50 as compared to pms fe2 process this effect contributes to stronger cells lysis as indicated by sem and clsm and the contents of polysaccharide and protein in total eps fractions are increased by 19 2 and 37 4 accordingly additionally edta increases the iron mobility by forming feii iii edta complexes and potentially inhibits ads coagulation at high doses the total dissolved iron fetot dis concentration increases from 203 4 mg l to 601 4 mg l due to the introduction of edta at 0 4 mmol g vss and the dominant iron species in supernatant transformed from fe2 to fe3 accordingly the optimization of edta doses is significant to balance oxidation and coagulation effects and to achieve better dewatering performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobically digested sludge dewaterability peroxymonosulfate activation edta chelated fe2 extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction the plentiful production and disposal of municipal sludge in wastewater treatment plants wwtps has received great concern in the past decades in china 6 25 million tons dry solid was generated in 2013 with the high average annual growth of 13 yang et al 2015 and the production of municipal sludge was expected to exceed 60 million tons in 2020 dai 2012 at present china mainly uses sanitary landfill incineration composting and resource utilization e g cement and brick etc for sludge disposal jin et al 2014 the anaerobic digestion ad has been suggested by the government as the preferred process for sludge disposal although approximately 60 wwtps use ad process among 3900 wwtps currently ministry of housing and urban rural development of p r china 2015 zhang 2006 the high moisture content i e above 90 in general mahmoud et al 2011 increases the difficulty and cost for sludge transportation treatment and ultimate disposal the promising sludge conditioning and dewatering is of great significance for sludge disposal and reclamation cao et al 2018 nowadays ad has been widely applied in many large scale wwtps worldwide to enable sludge stabilization and energy recovery however anaerobically digested sludge ads dewatering is difficult due to its smaller particle size higher alkalinity and greater viscosity pei et al 2007 waclawek et al 2016 wang et al 2018 and some conditioning methods for the conventional activated sludge could hardly achieve good performance shao et al 2012 wang et al 2014 2017b the widely used reagents for sludge conditioning include flocculants skeleton builders and oxidants chen et al 2010 luo et al 2018 qi et al 2011a flocculants such as iron salts aluminum salts and polyacrylamide pam benefit sludge particles aggregation large flocs formation and mechanical dewatering involving in the mechanisms of double layer electric field compressing cation bridging and sweeping effect qi et al 2011a skeleton builders as coal fly ash chen et al 2010 and filter acid qi et al 2011b are sometimes utilized to form permeable grid structure in sludge cakes and this promotes the outflow of free water during mechanical dehydration wu et al 2017b these two strategies mainly enhance the release of free water within sludge and show limited efficiency towards bound water zhang et al 2016 the extra dosing of oxidants such as kmno4 naclo and h2o2 luo et al 2018 is assumedly to destruct the cells walls and to improve the release of intracellular water as well as molecular bound water this performance may potentially benefit sludge conditioning and benefit the recovery of carbon sources and nutrients thereafter the concentrations of soluble dichromate oxygen demand codcr total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp in sludge filtrate were reported to increase notably with fenton oxidation coupled with ultrasound upon sludge conditioning gong et al 2015 the filtrate could be potentially recovered as denitrification carbon sources and the raw material of struvite abel denee et al 2018 kim et al 2009 waclawek et al 2016 besides pre oxidation treatment of sludge was demonstrated to enhance short chain fatty acids production in the process of anaerobic fermentation

2003 persulfate oxidation activated by ferrous ion ps fe2 was observed to improve activated sludge dewatering zhen et al 2012c and the synergetic effect was achieved upon the introduction of phosphogypsum as skeleton builder shi et al 2015 more recent studies have indicated that activated persulfate peroxymonosulfate enhanced sludge dewaterability when combined with other processes e g thermal treatment and electrolysis electrocoagulation li et al 2016 2018 the generation of hydroxyl radicals o h and sulfate radicals so 4 by fe2 catalyzed decomposition of h2o2 and ps plays an important role to improve dewaterability dewil et al 2005 liu et al 2012 zhen et al 2012a additionally the newly formed iron hydroxide behaves as coagulants and skeleton builders to promote dewatering performance neyens and baeyens 2003 however the utilization of active radicals is generally limited due to the excessive radicals consumption by fe2 and the cost is increased greatly han et al 2015 besides the optimum low ph range i e ph 4 0 and the ph adjustment operation complicate the maintenance and lower the feasibility of fenton reagents in engineering point of view badawy and ali 2006 the introduction of chelating agents e g ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta and citric acid ca into fenton and ps systems was reported to achieve radicals generation at elevated ph and to improve pollutants degradation in solution de luca et al 2014 tan et al 2012 the chelating agents of edta and ethylene diamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid sodium edtmps also showed positive effects on sludge conditioning in fenton system he et al 2017b however the application of fenton reagents is restricted by the low h2o2 content 30 in products the difficulty in transportation and the safety problems solid ps overcomes these disadvantages and the adaptation in wide ph range enables its practical priority as compared to fenton reagents the introduction of chelating agents may also improve sludge conditioning by fe2 activated peroxymonosulfate pms fe2 however rare studies have focused on it before the widely used hexadentate ligand of edta exhibits strong chelating efficacy and low toxicity and can form stable complexes with different metal ions such as fe2 and fe3 this study uses edta as a typical chelating agent and aims to 1 investigate the effects of edta on activating

and srf between the raw sludge and those being conditioned by different processes and pms edta fe2 exhibited best performance among these processes pms oxidation slightly decreased cst from 599 9 s to 527 2 s and decreased srf from 3 0 1010 s2 g to 2 5 1010 s2 g fe2 coagulation also showed positive effect and cst and srf were decreased by 38 1 and 42 6 respectively at 1 2 mmol fe2 g vss the combined use of pms and fe2 further decreased cst and srf to 304 1 s and 1 4 1010 s2 g respectively and the introduction of edta into pms fe2 contributed to significant cst and srf decrease by 60 0 and 70 6 respectively sludge dewaterability was affected by the charge properties of particle surface and the higher ζ potential showed beneficial effects as shown in fig s2 the ζ potential of ads was as low as 21 8 mv and then increased to 20 2 mv 18 2 mv and 15 2 mv after being conditioned by pms pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 respectively the higher ζ potential were the combined effects of the lower ph and the charge neutralization of ads by fe3 and fe2 hu et al 2018 the decreased absolute values of ζ potential indicated the lower electrostatic repulsion between sludge particles and this effect favored sludge flocs aggregation and dewatering thereafter zhen et al 2012b fig 2 a illustrates the effects of edta at different doses on cst values by pms edta fe2 conditioning edta shows positive effects on ads filtering and its optimum dose was observed to be 0 4 mmol g vss at which cst was decreased to as low as 240 2 s at edta doses of below 0 4 mmol g vss the cst values decreased continuously with higher edta doses in the absence of pms edta in edta fe2 process showed inhibitive effects on sludge filtering and the cst continuously increased with higher edta doses in wide range of 0 0 6 mmol g vss fig 2b the formation of fe2 edta complexes was quantitatively analyzed by minteq software modeling fig s3 in the absence of edta fe2 was the main fe ii species in ph 6 8 with the introduction of edta at 0 0 01 and 0 015 mmol l the feedta2 concentrations were calculated to be 0 0 094 and 0 014 mmol l whereas the fe2 concentrations decreased from 0 017 to 0 012 and 0 009 mmol l at ph 7 8 in fe3 solution the hydrolysis product of fe oh 2 was the predominate species at ph 6 8 and the ratios of which were observed to be above 90 accordingly upon edta introduction at 0 015 mmol l the fe oh 2 concentration deceased to 0 015 mmol l whereas that of feedta increased to 0 006 mmol l at ph 7 the edta chelating effect reduced the amount of fe2 and fe3 available for destabilization and charge neutralization of ads and the inhibitive effects were observed accordingly the observed positive effect of edta on ads conditioning was attributed to the enhanced activation of pms by fe2 upon being chelated by edta niu et al 2012 edta at elevated dose of 0 6 mmol g vss increased cst to as high as 338 2 s which was even higher than that without edta introduction i e pms fe2 process the adverse effect was probably caused by diminished coagulation effect accompanied by excessive edta introduction 3 2 bound water and cell viability fig 3 a compares the bwc and cell viability of ads after being conditioned by different processes pms oxidation at khso5 concentration of 1 0 mmol g vss decreased the bwc from 89 1 to 88 8 and fe2 activated pms contributed to lower bwc of 88 5 pms activated by edta fe2 further decreased bwc which was observed to be 88 2 87 7 and 87 5 at edta doses of 0 1 0 4 and 0 6 mmol g vss the lowered bwc indicated the conversion of bound water to free water liu et al 2016 the enhanced pms oxidation towards cells and eps benefits bound water release upon exposure to oxidants the bound water trapped in slime eps lb eps and tb eps and the intracellular water tended to release and transform to free water thereafter wu et al 2018 fig 3b illustrates the cell viability upon ads conditioning and the typical clsm images were presented in fig s4 these results may further support the bound water content variation in different processes pms at khso5 dose of 1 0 mmol g vss decreased cell viability from 75 4 to 61 9 and the lower value of 42 7 was obtained by pms fe2 pms edta fe2 at redta fe 2 of 1 3 further depressed cell viability to 24 7 the reduced cell viability was indicative of the wreck of cell integrity and this effect benefited the release of cellular moisture the variation of cell viability and bwc was in accordance with the cst results in fig 1 as for pms edta fe2 at 0 6 mmol g vss edta bwc deceased to 87 5 whereas cst increased to 338 2 s fig 2a and this indicated the two different roles of edta involved in edta introduction improved pms oxidation efficiency and showed positive effect on the other hand edta adversely affected iron coagulation fig 2b and inhibit sludge dewatering accordingly the results of particle size distribution in fig s5 demonstrated that as compared to pms fe2 process pms edta fe2 conditioning at edta concentration of 0 6 mmol g vss decreased median particle diameter d50 of ads from 84 7 μm to 30 0 μm 3 3 eps composition eps primarily consists of polysaccharide and protein and is the vital component of sludge flocs zhen et al 2012a and its components distribution was reported to significantly affect dewatering performance kim et al 2016 luo et al 2018 kalogo and monteith 2008 yu et al 2019 fig 4 compares the species distribution of polysaccharide and protein for three eps fractions i e slime eps lb eps and tb eps after being conditioned by different processes pms oxidation contributed to apparent eps increase by 44 5 for polysaccharide and by 56 2 for protein among these three eps fractions slime eps exhibited the most significant increase upon pms oxidation interestingly pms fe2 process with stronger oxidation decreased rather than increased the content of polysaccharide by 24 2 and that of protein by 57 4 as compared to pms oxidation this could be attributed to the combined effects of iron coagulation and eps decomposition by pms fe2 oxidation zhen et al 2012a fe2 ion activates pms and the in situ formed fe3 showed coagulation towards sludge to investigate the individual effect of pms oxidation on eps composition as a metal with much weaker coagulation capacity than iron co2 at 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 mmol g vss were introduced to activate pms and the variation of eps content was illustrated in fig s6a results indicated that toc content of eps increased from 805 1 mg l to 986 0 mg l with elevated co2 concentrations from 0 to 0 2 mmol g vss at higher co2 concentration i e 1 2 mmol g vss toc content in eps decreased to as low as 496 6 mg l thereafter the released eps can be further degraded by pms oxidation fig s6b and pms at 10 mm khso5 contributed to partial mineralization of the pre extracted eps from sludge and toc decreased from 101 8 mg l to 93 5 mg l accordingly on the other hand fe2 and fe3 improved eps attachment to sludge by coagulation effect and the lowered content of polysaccharide and protein were observed fig s7 compared to pms fe2 process pms fe2 edta increased the content of polysaccharide by 3 4 19 2 and 22 4 and that of protein by 22 8 37 4 and 88 7 at edta doses of 0 1 0 4 and 0 6 mmol g vss respectively this could be first attributed to the enhanced release of eps and intracellular organic matter iom additionally the chelating of edta with fe2 and fe3 potentially weakened their coagulation efficiency and in the absence of pms the content of polysaccharide and protein was observed to increase upon edta introduction fig s7 upon the exposure to pms fe2 edta process the release and degradation of eps and the coagulation by fe2 fe3 occurred and these effects were reported to favor sludge dewatering accordingly he et al 2017a wang et al 2017a zhen et al 2018 3d eems spectra with high sensitivity and good selectivity are widely used to characterize organic matters fig 5 illustrates the eems spectra of tb eps and lb eps fractions for ads and those being conditioned by different processes it was noted that slime eps fractions were not analyzed by eems spectra because the high dilution ratios were required to avoid inner filtering effect four fluorescent peaks located at an ex em of 220 225 nm 355 365 nm peak a 278 280 nm 360 370 nm peak b 265 275 nm 410 425 nm peak c and 220 225 nm 390 400 nm peak d can be observed and they were respectively identified as aromatic protein like substances soluble microbial by product like substances humic acid like substances and fulvic acid like substances chen et al 2003 the fluorescence intensity fi of these four peaks were observed to gradually decrease with enhanced oxidation for both tb eps and lb eps fractions table 2 the fi of peak a in tb eps was determined to be 1959 for raw ads which decreased to 1932 1435 and 887 after conditioning with pms pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 processes the corresponsive fi of peak a in lb eps decreased from 1800 to 1606 907 and 679 accordingly and similar phenomena were observed for the peak b of both tb eps and lb eps the decreased fi was relative to the weakened fluorescence of aromatic protein like substances and soluble microbial by product like substances however the protein content as determined by chemical analysis was observed to increase rather than decrease with enhanced pms fe2 by edta fig 4b and this may be attributed to occurrence state and molecular structure changes of proteins after being exposed to strong oxidants the secondary structure represented by the α helix was demonstrated to be destructed after aops wu et al 2017a and fluorescence characteristics of proteins were closely affected by molecular structure for instance tryptophan exhibited weaker fi with occurrence of unfolding of proteins wu 2003 wang et al 2001 yan et al 1997 although proteins could be detected by chemical analysis for maintaining primary structure their fluorescence characteristics varied with secondary structure transformation like unfolding and despiralization caused by aops and the inconsistence was observed accordingly similar phenemona was reported in recent research with respect to ads conditioning by indigenous persulfate activation maqbool et al 2019 3 4 species distribution of different metals fig 6 illustrates the distribution of iron after being conditioned by different processes as compared to pms fe2 process the total dissolved iron fetot dis concentrations in centrifugation supernatants increased whereas those of ferrous decreased upon edta introduction fig 6a the fetot dis in raw sludge supernatant was as low as 12 1 mg l and there showed little variation after pms oxidation in pms fe2 process fetot dis increased significantly to as high as 203 4 mg l due to fe2 addition in pms edta fe2 process edta at 0 1 0 4 0 6 mmol g vss further increased fetot dis by 65 0 195 7 and 291 9 and this indicated the stronger mobility of iron the formation of soluble complexes with edta improved metals mobility in soil and sludge has been reported before zhang et al 2010 in pms fe2 process ferrous fe ii concentration was determined to be 187 7 mg l and fe ii account for 92 3 of the fetot dis content in supernatant the excessive fe2 consumed so 4 and o h radicals formed in fe2 activated pms han et al 2015 and potentially inhibited sludge conditioning edta at elevated doses decreased fe ii concentrations in supernatant to 13 8 mg l 35 7 mg l and 72 7 mg l the extremely higher fe3 concentrations i e fetot dis fe ii were attributed to the soluble edta chelated fe3 complexes fig 6b illustrates the variation of total particulate iron content fetot partic after being conditioned by these processes fetot partic was determined to be 21 3 and 19 6 mg g tss for raw ads and that with pms oxidation fetot partic remarkably increased to 34 1 mg g tss in pms fe2 process which decreased to 33 4 31 9 and 29 8 mg g tss with the addition of edta at 0 1 0 4 and 0 6 mmol g vss the particulate iron i e iron hydrolysis products tends to deposit in sludge and the dissolved iron is more likely to exist in the supernatant the dominant iron species transformed from iron hydrolysis products to soluble feedta fig s3 and the lowered fetot partic was observed thereafter fig 6 implied the positive effect of edta on sludge flocculation and pms oxidation and this effect was in good accordance with the variation of cst and eps fractions sludge conditioning by chemicals may affect the species transformation mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals therein in this study bcr extraction method was employed to compare the species distribution variation of heavy metals i e zn cu pb and ni after being conditioned by these processes fig 7 the recoveries of these metals were in the range from 80 to 110 table s2 and the validity and reliability of bcr method is confirmed the total metal content followed the sequence of zn cu pb ni table s1 sludge conditioning processes have significant effects on the migration and transformation of heavy metals as for raw ads the reducible f2 and oxidizable fraction f3 were the main zn species with the ratios of 57 7 and 26 2 respectively after being conditioned by pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 r edta fe 2 1 3 the ratios of weak acid soluble fraction f1 increased from 9 0 to 49 4 and 43 6 as the dominant species whereas the ratios of oxidizable fraction decreased from 26 2 to 10 5 and 11 6 accordingly the oxidizable fraction was the main cu species with the ratio of 91 0 which slightly decreased to 89 4 83 4 and 81 8 after being conditioned by pms pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 meanwhile the ratios of reducible fraction f2 increased from 1 8 to 3 1 5 0 and 6 4 accordingly in raw ads pb dominantly existed as the residual fraction f4 with the ratio of 76 4 pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 slightly changed the ratios of f4 to 76 6 and 72 7 whereas the ratios of the oxidizable fraction f3 increased from 13 6 to 16 4 and 17 8 with regard to ni in raw ads the oxidizable f3 and residual fraction f4 were the dominant species with the ratios of 35 2 and 33 1 respectively after being conditioned by pms fe2 and pms edta fe2 the ratios of oxidizable fraction f3 decreased to 22 8 and 23 4 whereas those of residual fraction f4 increased to 39 5 and 39 7 generally the ratios of oxidable fraction f3 decreased after being exposed to pms and pms fe2 processes for these heavy metals except for pb this may be attributed to the destruction of the metals and organics upon pms oxidation however edta introduction increased the ratio of oxidizable fraction f3 owing to the strong chelation between metals and edta 3 5 sem images sem images of the sludge were illustrated in fig 8 and the observed results were consistent with the variation of bwc and cell viability fig 3 raw ads showed many cell clusters with intact shape fig 8a and the grape like cells fig 8b and porous spherical cells fig 8c with structural integrity could be clearly found therein the plentiful sticky organic substances i e eps surrounded these cells pms oxidation caused structure destruction within cell clusters for minority cells fig 8d and the corroded shell like structure were observed nevertheless the structure integrity of most cells remained due to limited oxidative capacity of pms in pms fe2 process the cellular structure of much more cells destroyed fig 8e as indicated from the numerous irregular holes on cell surfaces fig 8f and the cells with complete cellular structure could also be observed pms edta fe2 process strongly destroyed membrane structure of cells and the irregular cell holes and cellular residues were observed without any intact cells fig 8g additionally pms edta fe2 process contributed to more porous eps morphology as compared to pms fe2 process fig s8 and this effect potentially benefited water exclusion involved in filter pressing 3 6 proposed pathways and mechanisms involved in ads conditioning to further illustrate the mechanisms of pms edta fe2 process involved in ads conditioning epr spectrometer was applied to detect the formation of active radicals involved in the epr signal fig 9 confirmed the formation of o h radicals probably due to the conversion of so 4 to o h in the presence of h2o hayon et al 1972 liang et al 2009 the signal intensity of o h was rather weak in pms process and this supported its low oxidative efficacy in fig 1 in pms fe2 system fe2 activated pms to generate sulfate radical i e so 4 wang and chu 2011 and the o h signal intensity was enhanced accordingly the excessive fe2 potentially act as the scavenger of so 4 and o h and the consumption of them inhibited oxidation efficiency the signal intensity of active radicals in pms edta fe2 process was nearly one and a half times stronger than that in pms fe2 process fig 9 edta tended to chelate free fe2 and decreased its concentration and this effect minimized the consumption of active radicals and improved the utilization efficiency liang et al 2004 niu et al 2012 the possible reactions involved in were proposed in equation 2 to equation 9 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 tan et al 2012 wang and chu 2011 2 fe 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 4 oh 3 edta fe 2 hso 5 edta fe 3 so 4 oh 4 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 h o h 5 fe 2 so 4 fe 3 so 4 2

mechanisms involved in the conditioning of ads by activated pms sludge flocs consist of cell clusters with eps surrounding part of water molecular was trapped within eps and some of them existed inside the cells and was called as intracellular water active radicals of so 4 and o h attacked eps and this effect liberated the eps trapped water therein additionally active radicals damaged sludge flocs and destructed the cells structure in the cluster and the release of intracellular water and organics occurred to benefit ads dewatering radicals quenching tests employing ethanol etoh as the radical scavenger were carried out in fig s9 with addition of etoh at 1 ml 100 ml ads cst cst0 and srf srf0 values increased from 0 40 to 0 29 to 0 62 and 0 50 respectively this confirmed the contribution of so 4 and o h in improving dewatering performance of ads as for eps and the released intracellular organics the degradation by active radicals and coagulation by feii iii and their hydrolysis products occurred during pms edta fe2 process pms oxidation was significantly enhanced whereas the coagulation efficacy was potentially inhibited due to the formation of feii iii edta complexes the stronger pms activation by edta played an important role to achieve good dewatering performance and to harvest valuable resources from ads however the overdosed edta potentially inhibited dewatering by the formation of feii iii edta complexes and the edta doses should be carefully optimized to balance its effects on oxidation and coagulation 4 conclusions this study investigates the dewatering performance and mechanism of ads by pms edta fe2 process the oxidation of ads by activated pms benefits dewatering owing to the lower cell integrity and the release of eps trapped and the intracellular water molecular as compared to pms fe2 process pms edta fe2 at optimal molar ratio of edta to fe2 of 1 3 exhibits stronger oxidation and the better dewatering performance accordingly at elevated edta doses the overdosed edta potentially forms complexes with iron salts and reduced their coagulation efficacy towards ads and this effect deteriorates dewatering greatly the dewatering performance of pms edta fe2 is the combined effects of oxidation and coagulation and should be carefully balanced to achieve the optimum performance as much as possible additionally the eps may include functional groups to chelate with fe2 and this study indicate their potentially positive effect on ads conditioning by fe2 activated pms although further studies are required to clarify it advanced research to replace edta with more biodegradable chelating agents should be carried out considering the potential disruption of edta to the performance of the mainstream wastewater treatment

18756,water is one of the possible transmission routes for water and foodborne parasites to humans echinococcus multilocularis is a parasite which causes alveolar echinococcosis ae nevertheless no environmental studies have been performed as yet to confirm the occurrence of e multilocularis in water supplies accordingly 105 water samples of 50 l volume were collected from surface waters lakes rivers canals and wells in the warmia masuria province echinococcus endemic area and pomerania province echinococcus non endemic area poland the water was filtered and subsequently analysed with nested pcr and real time pcr e multilocularis dna was found in two 1 9 samples which originated from two lakes localised in the warmia masuria province sequencing of the positive samples confirmed that the pcr products were fragments of the e multilocularis mitochondrial 12s rrna gene this is the first investigation describing e multilocularis detection in environmental water samples using molecular diagnostic tools the results indicate that water could be considered as a potential source of e multilocularis infections in humans and animals in endemic areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords echinococcus multilocularis environment water nested pcr real time pcr poland 1 introduction echinococcus multilocularis is a parasite widely distributed in the northern hemisphere including central europe northern and central eurasia and parts of north america craig 2003 eckert and deplazes 2004 eckert et al 2001 pp 120 133 which causes alveolar echinococcosis ae the causative agent of this dangerous zoonosis is the metacestode stage of the tapeworm characterised by numerous tumour like vesicles that invade and penetrate the surrounding tissue eckert and deplazes 2004 the larvae mainly develop in the liver and the incubation time of the disease lasts several years deplazes et al 2017 eckert and deplazes 2004 ae has been characterised with a high mortality rate of 90 and above it may therefore lead to death without proper treatment ammann and eckert 1995 wilson et al 1992 the number of ae cases is increasing worldwide and the world health organisation who included ae among neglected tropical diseases who 2010 pp 107 112 the estimated global human burden of ae is 666 434 disability adjusted life years dalys per year 18 235 new cases per annum with the vast majority 91 of cases being recorded in china torgerson et al 2010 in eastern europe excluding russia the rate is approximately 58 cases of ae per annum torgerson et al 2010 transmission of e multilocularis occurs during the sylvatic or synanthropic cycle with wild carnivores or domestic dogs serving as definitive hosts while many species of small rodents serve as intermediate hosts and humans are incidental intermediate hosts for the tapeworm dyachenko et al 2008b eckert and deplazes 2004 machnicka rowińska et al 2002 moro and schantz 2009 romig 2003 thiess et al 2001 infection in humans is initiated by the ingestion of e multilocularis eggs that are excreted with the faeces of definitive hosts in europe foxes are the main species that play this role romig 2003 schweiger et al 2007 exposure to tapeworm eggs occurs via contact with infected animals or a contaminated environment through consumption of raw fruit or vegetables or by contact with contaminated soil bastien et al 2018 however the significance of the various potential routes of transmission still remains unclear eckert and deplazes 2004 kern et al 2004 the number of environmental studies focused on the detection of the tapeworm in different environmental matrices is increasing the data on the distribution of e multilocularis eggs in the environment however is still limited and fragmentary studies concerning the contamination of soil fresh plants and mushrooms with e multilocularis have been performed in japan matsudo et al 2003 poland lass et al 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 switzerland federer et al 2016 and france umhang et al 2017 recently water has also been considered as an important risk factor han et al 2015 wang et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2001 water was suspected to be the route of transmission during the outbreak of infections in the vicinity of nanfeng town minle county gansu province this was a newly discovered focus of ae in china han et al 2015 additionally a systematic review and meta analysis based on 1 009 publications focusing on the potential risk factors for human ae confirmed that the chance of ae transmission through the ingestion of food and water contaminated with e multilocularis eggs exists conraths et al 2017 moreover the who oie manual concerning echinococcosis contains suggestions that the contamination of water supplies by eggs of e multilocularis could be possible source of infection in humans gemmell et al 2001 for instance in the siberian taiga in yakutia sakha republic far eastern federal district russia the human ae infection rate was higher in the populations that were supplied with water from particular lakes than rivers martynenko et al 1983 the suggestions were not supported however by adequate documentation at that time gemmell et al 2001 water has been also estimated as the possible source of infections with other tapeworms belonging to the taeniidae family including e granulosus from echinococcus genus causing cystic echinococcosis carmona et

necessary although highly endemic e multilocularis areas had been identified especially in europe karamon et al 2014 torgerson et al 2010 data regarding water contamination is still missing ae is an emerging disease in poland it has been characterised by increasing morbidity and mortality rates since the year 1990 nahorski et al 2013 various studies performed in different parts of the country have demonstrated a distinct and dynamic increase in numbers as well as an increase in the percentage of infected foxes in the period 1995 2015 karamon et al 2014 malczewski et al 1995 a similar situation has also been observed in other endemic regions of europe karamon et al 2014 in poland the highest level of e multilocularis prevalence in foxes 50 karamon et al 2014 as well as the highest number of human ae cases over 50 of the total of ae cases recorded in whole country was noted specifically in the warmia masuria province there have been at least 65 documented cases between 1990 and 2011 nahorski et al 2013 and 26 new cases between 2012 and 2019 unpublished clinical data department of tropical and parasitic diseases at the medical university of gdańsk recent studies performed in this area confirmed the contamination of soil and plants with e multilocularis lass et al 2017b 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 especially in a few highly endemic foci lass et al 2016 these findings raise suspicions for possible contamination of the water sources in this endemic region the current research was undertaken in the warmia masuria province endemic area and in the pomerania province non endemic area in poland and the aim was to determine the occurrence of e multilocularis in different types of water sources including surface water bodies and wells moreover studies were performed with the use of two detection methods real time pcr and nested pcr in order to compare their usefulness in the screening of e multilocularis in the water environment this paper provides new data on the putative sources of contamination involving e multilocularis eggs in recreational waters and also presents an analysis protocol useful for the investigation of e multilocularis in water 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 sampling sites and study area in total 105 environmental water samples were collected between 2012 and 2014 from the area of two neighbouring provinces in poland pomerania n 68 in the north and warmia masuria n 37 in the north east table 3 a total of 73 water samples were taken from 38 surface water sources along with 32 groundwater samples taken from 16 wells with an average depth of 5 7 m fig 1 table 2 the surface water samples originated from 26 lakes 10 rivers and two canals fig 1 table 2 most of the lakes that were selected for investigation are often used as recreational sites by tourists and local inhabitants for lakeside activities with guesthouses and campgrounds in the vicinity the surface area and water quality of the lakes varies the rivers and lakes are situated in areas covered by marvellous forests protected landscape areas and are popular places for tourism fishing and recreation the examined wells are located in homesteads gardens and yards situated in small villages in pomerania n 7 and warmia masuria n 9 provinces according to the owners water from the wells is not used for drinking it may be used however for irrigating kitchen gardens infected foxes the definitive hosts of e multilocularis are present in both provinces investigated karamon et al 2014 moreover contamination of surrounding environment including soil fruit vegetables and mushrooms with e multilocularis has been confirmed in investigated area lass et al 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 the majority of sites were sampled twice once between april and june and once between august and september two lakes pluszne wielkie and barlewickie located in the warmia masuria province were only sampled once during the august october period and one lake leśny rów also in the warmia masuria province was sampled once during the april june period 2 1 2 sampling system 50 l samples of surface water and groundwater were collected and filtered on site with the use of a portable filtration set consisting of clean 10 l polythene vessels used for taking water from the source a peristaltic pump head masterflex l s easy load ii attached to the handle of a cordless drill driver dewalt dc980 type 10 an envirochek capsule membrane filter pall gelman laboratory usa a flow meter ptfe aalborg usa a manometer and elastic pipes water from lakes ponds canals and rivers was sampled 1 3 m from ashore when necessary surface water was first filtered with a sieve pore size 1 mm in order to remove larger particles e g leaves filtration was performed at a flow rate of 0 7 l min until about 500 ml of water was left in the vessel then 200 ml of pet buffer 0 01 tween 80 0 02 ppi 0 03 edta was added to wash the vessel walls and filtration was continued following filtration the capsule filter was filled with 100 ml of pet buffer transported to the laboratory and kept at 4 c to avoid any contamination and false positive results the pipe section between the water sample and the filter was replaced with a new one after the filtration of each water sample this procedure has been previously used in our laboratory to detect protozoan parasites in water lass et al 2017a and is based on a modification of the epa 815 r 05 002 method for cryptosporidium and giardia in surface waters usepa 2005 in this study we demonstrate its usefulness in screening water samples for echinococcus eggs 2 2 recovery experiments to evaluate the waterborne detection system in initial experiments prior to the investigation of the occurrence of e multilocularis in environmental samples tests were performed to estimate the limit of the detection of the egg s dna by using molecular methods with the suspension of e multilocularis eggs in sterile water for the recovery tests e multilocularis eggs were separated from adult tapeworms that were obtained from the national veterinary institute in puławy poland the eggs were washed with sterile water three times and then counted using light microscopy proper suspensions of eggs in 1 ml of sterile water were then prepared by seeding with prepared eggs to respectively obtain 1 103 1 102 and 1 101 eggs in the sample three series of 10 l water samples were then prepared and experimentally contaminated with a known number of e multilocularis eggs 1 103 1 102 and 1 101 the sensitivity and detection limit of the procedure for the specific detection of e multilocularis was performed as described below 2 3 removal and concentration of echinococcus multilocularis eggs from filters following the completion of the filtration procedure the filter was left for 30 min in vertical position it was inverted and left for another 30 min in the inverted position the first fraction of washings was then placed in a 225 ml conical tube the filter was refilled with 100 ml of pet buffer and shaken horizontally for a total of 15 min using an automatic shaker cat s50 germany the filter was inverted and shaken again for 15 min the second fraction of washings was then added to the conical tube containing the first fraction mixed and centrifuged for 30 min at 1250 g and 4 c without braking using a hermle z383k centrifuge labortechnik germany the supernatant was removed and the obtained pellet 0 25 ml was then suspended in 2 ml of pbs buffer 1 bsa 0 05 tween 20 and stored for further analysis larger pellets were suspended in 4 ml of pbs buffer 2 4 molecular detection of echinococcus multilocularis 2 4 1 positive control used in molecular studies dna was isolated from separated e multilocularis eggs from adult tapeworms obtained from the national veterinary research institute in puławy poland and was used as a positive control in the experiments performed 2 4 2 dna extraction prior to dna extraction the material that was obtained from the filters was frozen at 70 c three times and then thawed in a water bath at 30 c for safety reasons as well as to destroy the egg envelopes and to improve the efficiency of the extraction of dna in the sample dna extraction was performed using a sherlock ax kit a a biotechnology gdynia poland according to the manufacturer s instructions all of the pcr templates were treated with an antiinhibitor kit a a biotechnology gdynia poland which removes polyphenolic pcr inhibitors using specific absorption particles thereby removing factors that could interfere with the pcr the pcr templates were then stored at 20 c 2 4 3 dna amplification nested pcr and real time pcr developed by dinkel et al 1998 and knapp et al 2014

orientation cycle sequencing was performed using the amplification primers the sequences obtained were then analysed using genestudio professional genestudio inc usa and chromasdna sequencing software 2 6 statistical analysis in order to investigate the statistical independence between e multilocularis presence in different water sources statistical analysis was performed using the pearson chi square test χ2 and results were evaluated at the p 0 05 significance level as is traditionally used calculations were performed using matlab 2015a results from previous studies regarding the detection of the parasite in soil and vegetables were included in this way the sampling design and parasite detection were evaluated in comparison with expected results 3 results 3 1 results of the detection limit experiments three series of 10 l water samples experimentally contaminated with specific numbers of e multilocularis eggs 1 103 1 102 and 1 101 were investigated with the use of filtration procedure and molecular detection methods real time pcr and nested pcr according to the protocols described below these recovery tests showed that e multilocularis dna was detectable using both real time pcr and nested pcr methods when the water sample was seeded with at least 1 101 eggs 10 l with reproducibility of 2 3 total reproducibility was recorded at level of contamination 1 102 eggs 10 l fig 2 table 1 3 2 results of molecular study of environmental water samples in total 105 water samples were collected from different surface waters and wells in the provinces of pomerania and warmia masuria poland they were then examined with nested pcr and real time pcr assays based on the mitochondrial rrna gene and mitochondrial rrnl gene of e multilocularis respectively presence of e multilocularis dna was confirmed with both molecular detection methods in two 1 9 of the water samples that originated from surface waters in the warmia masuria province including pozorty lake iława district and rydzówka lake węgorzewo district figs 1 and 3 in these two water samples sequencing displayed that the nested pcr products were fragments of the e multilocularis 12s rrna gene table 5 derived sequences are deposited in genbank under accession numbers mk116544 mk116545 amplification of e multilocularis dna was also detected in a groundwater sample collected from a well in the village of zielenica bartoszyce district warmia masuria province fig 1 but only in one out of the three attempts a positive result was obtained using nested pcr moreover dna of the parasite was not detected with real time pcr and sequencing of the nested pcr product of this water sample was not successful thus this water sample was classified as negative unconfirmed table 5 regarding particular investigated areas in the pomerania province all water samples collected from different water sources were negative for e multilocularis and in the warmia masuria province two 5 4 out of the 34 water samples investigated were positive table 3 among all 26 lakes investigated in this study dna of e multilocularis was detected in two 7 7 lakes both of them are located in the warmia masuria province and constitute 22 2 of the nine lakes investigated in this province in contrast there was no dna of the parasite detected in the 17 lakes originating from the pomerania province table 3 with regards to the groundwater samples collected from the wells apart from the sample in the village of zielenica all remaining were negative for e multilocularis the presence of the tapeworm was also not confirmed in the water samples collected from the rivers and canals table 3 comparison of two detection methods used real time pcr and nested pcr for screening environmental water samples for e multilocularis dna presence showed that both of them can be successfully used to identify e multilocularis in environmental water samples with a high degree of sensitivity and reproducibility fig 3 table 1 3 3 results of statistical analysis the independence of the frequency of the parasite detection was examined in four different cases table 4 results from the pearson chi square test vary between marginally accepted independence of parasite presence in water bodies between the two provinces when all the water samples are accounted for χ2 3 75 p 0 053 v 0 19 and moderate association when presence in lakes is accounted χ2 4 09 p 0 043 0 05 v 0 40 also presence in water samples in the warmia masuria province was compared with presence in soil samples szostakowska et al 2014 from the same area showing no statistical dependence between the two mediums χ2 0 97 p 0 324 0 05 v 0 10 statistical analysis suggest that there is statistical dependence between the province and the detection of the parasite in water bodies table 4 denoting the warmia masuria province as an endemic area regarding water sources the low number of positive samples is diluting this result e g when the total number of water samples is accounted for independence is marginally established p 0 053 however when the total water samples from the lakes or number of lakes is investigated statistical

epidemiology the lack of counselling on the prevention of the infection is definitely a gap in the one health education efforts regarding echinococcosis medical professionals are supposed to provide advice to patients on the preventative measures that should be taken to avoid infection this is however a current challenge to the public health system an important part of this challenge is the development of an efficient protocol for the investigation of water samples a holistic approach to integrated water resource management like the one health concept needs to take echinococcosis in endemic and non endemic areas into account in this paper we report the prevalence of e multilocularis dna in water samples collected from the warmia masuria province poland to our knowledge this is the first investigation describing the detection of e multilocularis in environmental water samples using sensitive molecular tools the results of our study confirm that surface water in this endemic area is contaminated with e multilocularis and consequently may pose a potential risk for humans and animals there is still no established protocol for the analysis and detection of e multilocularis eggs in water in this study for the collection of the water samples we used a specific set for filtration with capsule envirocheck filters which enabled the filtration of large volumes of water on site this eliminated the need for large containers to be filled with water and transported to the laboratory ameliorating logistical problems and increasing the number of samples that can be taken during a single survey we can presume that tapeworm eggs when present are dispersed in low numbers in water to be detected by currently available techniques thus for specific and sensitive detection of e multilocularis molecular methods were chosen over microscopy because this detection procedure was regarded ineffective and time consuming eggs of e multilocularis are morphologically the same compared to eggs of other tapeworms belonging to echinococcus and taenia genus making differentiation impossible also the procedure of freezing thowing the sample before the isolation of dna causes damage in egg envelopes and significantly influences microscopic investigation furthermore it was taken into consideration that eggs if any are probably highly dispersed in water thus the division of the sample final pellet into two parts for microscopic and molecular investigations could finally result in decreasing the chance to confirm the presence of the parasite by lowering the number of eggs in each part of the pellet below a detectable level to fulfil the basic purpose of our study which was a to develop water analysis for the detection of e multilocularis contamination and b to check the possibility of e multilocularis presence in environmental water samples pcr was selected for its sensitivity and specificity the estimated detection limit in this study procedures was 10 eggs using this specific methodology it must be highlighted however that laboratory experiments are performed under conditions that are not identical to field conditions environmental water samples amongst others are characterised by a range of turbidity and organic content that may influence the detection procedure therefore the exact detection limit may vary between samples e multilocularis dna was detected and confirmed by real time pcr nested pcr and sequencing in two water samples that were collected from the pozorty and rydzówka lakes located in the warmia masuria province fig 1 pozorty is a small lake situated in the northern part of the iława district fig 1 with five well documented cases of human ae e multilocularis dna has also been found in this area in fox faeces in the soil vegetable forest fruit and mushroom samples lass et al 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 second lake rydzówka is located in the borders of węgorzewo and kętrzyn districts fig 1 in relatively close proximity to communities regarded as highly endemic like srokowo where ae detection rate is 5 3 per 100 000 inhabitants as compared with the national average 0 014 nahorski et al 2013 e multilocularis dna has been detected in soil and plant samples taken from this area as well lass et al 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 furthermore chi square test showed no statistical dependence between soil and water samples in the warmia masuria province table 4 validating the assumption that presence of the parasite in water samples in this endemic area corresponds to the previously determined presence in the soil accordingly the logical source of the contamination of the water in both lakes with e multilocularis eggs would be runoff carrying material from the surrounding environment forests and fields after rainfall surface runoff could transport contaminants such as e multilocularis eggs excreted by definitive hosts to local water pathways rivers canals and reservoirs lakes ponds within the endemic region of the warmia masuria province there are most probably foci characterised by intensive transmission and certain favourable factors the formation of foci and spatial distribution of infected foxes in particular has been described in cases in germany tackmann et al 1998 and in switzerland stieger et al 2002 apart from the lakes e multilocularis dna was also detected by nested pcr in one groundwater sample in a well situated in the small village in bartoszyce district in a yard belonging to a patient that was diagnosed with ae fig 1 positive soil samples have also been reported in this area szostakowska et al 2014 water from wells has been indicated as a significant risk factor in a case control study performed in hokkaido japan yamamoto et al 2001 moreover it has been identified as the most probable source of infection in an endemic area of e multilocularis in the western part of gansu province p r china han et al 2015 the authors suggested that faeces from the e multilocularis definitive hosts such as foxes could be washed into existing wells making them a source of e multilocularis infections in this newly discovered endemic ae region han et al 2015 in the case of the particular well investigated during this study surface runoff could have entered the well after a heavy rainfall event the positive result of nested pcr one per three performed reactions was not confirmed by real time pcr or sequencing and should therefore be treated as unconfirmed additional studies including more samples from different geographic areas should be undertaken in the future to ensure that well water pose a real threat to humans or animals in this endemic area in endemic regions there is a question about presence of e multilocularis eggs in drinking water but apart from a few studies suggesting well water as a possible sources of this tapeworm such data are still missing on the other hand some environmental studies have already demonstrated presence other taeniid eggs including e granulosus in drinking water sources dalu et al 2011 khairy et al 1982 stevenson and macpherson 1983 yousefi et al 2009 therefore in terms of the public health precaution measures recommendation of filtering drinking water for residents of endemic areas using individual water sources including wells would be prudent taking into consideration relatively large size of the tapeworm eggs 25 35 μm in diameter and the fact that commercially available filters for kitchen tap water are designed to remove objects up to around 1 μm in diameter such solution should be effective for complete removal of e multilocularis and other taeniid ova this however requires further studying on the assessment of e multilocularis risk in drinking water supplies nevertheless further study is required to accurately estimate the risk of humans and animals contracting the disease by contact with contaminated water including amongst other long lasting monitoring to establish the trends of e multilocularis presence the dependence on environmental conditions and the interaction with the zoonotic infection cycle it is highly likely that the number of eggs present in the environment is depended on precipitation trends and rain intensity in particular moreover dna detection of the parasite is evidence for its presence in the environment and therefore indicates a potential risk for humans but cannot determine the level of this risk all these aspects require further consideration a long lasting study focused on hyperendemic areas with continuous monitoring of sampling sites and definitive hosts is required for the assessment of the frequency and severity of e multilocularis threat to humans 5 conclusions e multilocularis tapeworm egg dna has been detected in surface water samples that were collected from lakes in the warmia masuria province poland the positive samples were found in the highly endemic hot spots echinococcosis areas of the province the results could be the starting point to improve the techniques for the detection of e multilocularis in water samples and for further studies to evaluate the real waterborne risk for humans and animals the route of waterborne transmission for e multilocularis to humans and animals via the dissemination of eggs through environmental water and its epidemiological impact would require further in depth studies future investigations and more extensive analysis of epidemiological data will be needed to indicate if this mode of transmission is more significant than what we previously thought funding

18756,water is one of the possible transmission routes for water and foodborne parasites to humans echinococcus multilocularis is a parasite which causes alveolar echinococcosis ae nevertheless no environmental studies have been performed as yet to confirm the occurrence of e multilocularis in water supplies accordingly 105 water samples of 50 l volume were collected from surface waters lakes rivers canals and wells in the warmia masuria province echinococcus endemic area and pomerania province echinococcus non endemic area poland the water was filtered and subsequently analysed with nested pcr and real time pcr e multilocularis dna was found in two 1 9 samples which originated from two lakes localised in the warmia masuria province sequencing of the positive samples confirmed that the pcr products were fragments of the e multilocularis mitochondrial 12s rrna gene this is the first investigation describing e multilocularis detection in environmental water samples using molecular diagnostic tools the results indicate that water could be considered as a potential source of e multilocularis infections in humans and animals in endemic areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords echinococcus multilocularis environment water nested pcr real time pcr poland 1 introduction echinococcus multilocularis is a parasite widely distributed in the northern hemisphere including central europe northern and central eurasia and parts of north america craig 2003 eckert and deplazes 2004 eckert et al 2001 pp 120 133 which causes alveolar echinococcosis ae the causative agent of this dangerous zoonosis is the metacestode stage of the tapeworm characterised by numerous tumour like vesicles that invade and penetrate the surrounding tissue eckert and deplazes 2004 the larvae mainly develop in the liver and the incubation time of the disease lasts several years deplazes et al 2017 eckert and deplazes 2004 ae has been characterised with a high mortality rate of 90 and above it may therefore lead to death without proper treatment ammann and eckert 1995 wilson et al 1992 the number of ae cases is increasing worldwide and the world health organisation who included ae among neglected tropical diseases who 2010 pp 107 112 the estimated global human burden of ae is 666 434 disability adjusted life years dalys per year 18 235 new cases per annum with the vast majority 91 of cases being recorded in china torgerson et al 2010 in eastern europe excluding russia the rate is approximately 58 cases of ae per annum torgerson et al 2010 transmission of e multilocularis occurs during the sylvatic or synanthropic cycle with wild carnivores or domestic dogs serving as definitive hosts while many species of small rodents serve as intermediate hosts and humans are incidental intermediate hosts for the tapeworm dyachenko et al 2008b eckert and deplazes 2004 machnicka rowińska et al 2002 moro and schantz 2009 romig 2003 thiess et al 2001 infection in humans is initiated by the ingestion of e multilocularis eggs that are excreted with the faeces of definitive hosts in europe foxes are the main species that play this role romig 2003 schweiger et al 2007 exposure to tapeworm eggs occurs via contact with infected animals or a contaminated environment through consumption of raw fruit or vegetables or by contact with contaminated soil bastien et al 2018 however the significance of the various potential routes of transmission still remains unclear eckert and deplazes 2004 kern et al 2004 the number of environmental studies focused on the detection of the tapeworm

et al 2017 recently water has also been considered as an important risk factor han et al 2015 wang et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2001 water was suspected to be the route of transmission during the outbreak of infections in the vicinity of nanfeng town minle county gansu province this was a newly discovered focus of ae in china han et al 2015 additionally a systematic review and meta analysis based on 1 009 publications focusing on the potential risk factors for human ae confirmed that the chance of ae transmission through the ingestion of food and water contaminated with e multilocularis eggs exists conraths et al 2017 moreover the who oie manual concerning echinococcosis contains suggestions that the contamination of water supplies by eggs of e multilocularis could be possible source of infection in humans gemmell et al 2001 for instance in the siberian taiga in yakutia sakha republic far eastern federal district russia the human ae infection rate was higher in the populations that were supplied with water from particular lakes than rivers martynenko et al 1983 the suggestions were not supported however by adequate documentation at that time gemmell et al 2001 water has been also estimated as the possible source of infections with other tapeworms belonging to the taeniidae family including e granulosus from echinococcus genus causing cystic echinococcosis carmona et

this area confirmed the contamination of soil and plants with e multilocularis lass et al 2017b 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 especially in a few highly endemic foci lass et al 2016 these findings raise suspicions for possible contamination of the water sources in this endemic region the current research was undertaken in the warmia masuria province endemic area and in the pomerania province non endemic area in poland and the aim was to determine the occurrence of e multilocularis in different types of water sources including surface water bodies and wells moreover studies were performed with the use of two detection methods real time pcr and nested pcr in order to compare their usefulness in the screening of e multilocularis in the water environment this paper provides new data on the putative sources of contamination involving e multilocularis eggs in recreational waters and also presents an analysis protocol useful for the investigation of e multilocularis in water 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling 2 1 1 sampling sites and study area in total 105 environmental water samples were collected between 2012 and 2014 from the area of two neighbouring provinces in poland pomerania n 68 in the north and warmia masuria n 37 in the north east table 3 a total of 73 water samples were taken from 38 surface water sources along with 32 groundwater samples taken from 16 wells with an average depth of 5 7 m fig 1 table 2 the surface water samples originated from 26 lakes 10 rivers and two canals fig 1 table 2 most of the lakes that were selected for investigation are often used as recreational sites by tourists and local inhabitants for lakeside activities with guesthouses and campgrounds in the vicinity the surface area and water quality of the lakes varies the rivers and lakes are situated in areas covered by marvellous forests protected landscape areas and are popular places for tourism fishing and recreation the examined wells are located in homesteads gardens and yards situated in small villages in pomerania n 7 and warmia masuria n 9 provinces according to the owners water from the wells is not used for drinking it may be used however for irrigating kitchen gardens infected foxes the definitive hosts of e multilocularis are present in both provinces investigated karamon et al 2014 moreover contamination of surrounding environment including soil fruit vegetables and mushrooms with e multilocularis has been confirmed in investigated area lass et al 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 the majority of sites were sampled twice once between april and june and once between august and september two lakes pluszne wielkie and barlewickie located in the warmia masuria province were only sampled once during the august october period and one lake leśny rów also in the warmia masuria province was sampled once during the april june period 2 1 2 sampling system 50 l samples of surface water and groundwater were collected and filtered on site with the use of a portable filtration set consisting of clean 10 l polythene vessels used for taking water from the source a peristaltic pump head masterflex l s easy load ii attached to the handle of a cordless drill driver dewalt dc980 type 10 an envirochek capsule membrane filter pall gelman laboratory usa a flow meter ptfe aalborg usa a manometer and elastic pipes water from lakes ponds canals and rivers was sampled 1 3 m from ashore when necessary surface water was first filtered with a sieve pore size 1 mm in order to remove larger particles e g leaves filtration was performed at a flow rate of 0 7 l min until about 500 ml of water was left in the vessel then 200 ml of pet buffer 0 01 tween 80 0 02 ppi 0 03 edta was added to wash the vessel walls and filtration was continued following filtration the capsule filter was filled with 100 ml of pet buffer transported to the laboratory and kept at 4 c to avoid any contamination and false positive results the pipe section between the water sample and the filter was replaced with a new one after the filtration of each water sample this procedure has been previously used in our laboratory to detect protozoan parasites in water lass et al 2017a and is based on a modification of the epa 815 r 05 002 method for cryptosporidium and giardia in surface waters usepa 2005 in this study we demonstrate its usefulness in screening water samples for echinococcus eggs 2 2 recovery experiments to evaluate the waterborne detection system in initial experiments prior to the investigation of the occurrence of e multilocularis in environmental samples tests were performed to estimate the limit of the detection of the egg s dna by using molecular methods with the suspension of e multilocularis eggs in sterile water for the recovery tests e multilocularis eggs were separated from adult tapeworms that were obtained from the national veterinary institute in puławy poland the eggs were washed with sterile water three times and then counted using light microscopy proper suspensions of eggs in 1 ml of sterile water were then prepared by seeding with prepared eggs to respectively obtain 1 103 1 102 and 1 101 eggs in the sample three series of 10 l water samples were then prepared and experimentally contaminated with a known number of e multilocularis eggs 1 103 1 102 and 1 101 the sensitivity and

following the completion of the filtration procedure the filter was left for 30 min in vertical position it was inverted and left for another 30 min in the inverted position the first fraction of washings was then placed in a 225 ml conical tube the filter was refilled with 100 ml of pet buffer and shaken horizontally for a total of 15 min using an automatic shaker cat s50 germany the filter was inverted and shaken again for 15 min the second fraction of washings was then added to the conical tube containing the first fraction mixed and centrifuged for 30 min at 1250 g and 4 c without braking using a hermle z383k centrifuge labortechnik germany the supernatant was removed and the obtained pellet 0 25 ml was then suspended in 2 ml of pbs buffer 1 bsa 0 05 tween 20 and stored for further analysis larger pellets were suspended in 4 ml of pbs buffer 2 4 molecular detection of echinococcus multilocularis 2 4 1 positive control used in molecular studies dna was isolated from

extraction prior to dna extraction the material that was obtained from the filters was frozen at 70 c three times and then thawed in a water bath at 30 c for safety reasons as well as to destroy the egg envelopes and to improve the efficiency of the extraction of dna in the sample dna extraction was performed using a sherlock ax kit a a biotechnology gdynia poland according to the manufacturer s instructions all of the pcr templates were treated with an antiinhibitor kit a a biotechnology gdynia poland which removes polyphenolic pcr inhibitors using specific absorption particles thereby removing factors that could interfere with the pcr the pcr templates were then stored at 20 c 2 4 3 dna amplification nested pcr and real time pcr developed by dinkel et al 1998 and knapp et al 2014

fig 2 table 1 3 2 results of molecular study of environmental water samples in total 105 water samples were collected from different surface waters and wells in the provinces of pomerania and warmia masuria poland they were then examined with nested pcr and real time pcr assays based on the mitochondrial rrna gene and mitochondrial rrnl gene of e multilocularis respectively presence of e multilocularis dna was confirmed with both molecular detection methods in two 1 9 of the water samples that originated from surface waters in the warmia masuria province including pozorty lake iława district and rydzówka lake węgorzewo district figs 1 and 3 in these two water samples sequencing displayed that the nested pcr products were fragments of the e multilocularis 12s rrna gene table 5 derived sequences are deposited in genbank under accession numbers mk116544 mk116545 amplification of e multilocularis dna was also detected in a groundwater sample collected from a well in the village of zielenica bartoszyce district warmia masuria province fig 1 but only in one out of the three attempts a positive result was obtained using nested pcr moreover dna of the parasite was not detected with real time pcr and sequencing of the nested pcr product of this water sample was not successful thus this water sample was classified as negative unconfirmed table 5 regarding particular investigated areas in the pomerania province all water samples collected from different water sources were negative for e multilocularis and in the warmia masuria province two 5 4 out of the 34 water samples investigated were positive table 3 among all 26 lakes investigated in this study dna of e multilocularis was detected in two 7 7 lakes both of them are located in the warmia masuria province and constitute 22 2 of the nine lakes investigated in this province in contrast there was no dna of the parasite detected in the 17 lakes originating from the pomerania province table 3 with regards to the groundwater samples collected from the wells apart from the sample in the village of zielenica all remaining were negative for e multilocularis the presence of the tapeworm was also not confirmed in the water samples collected from the rivers and canals table 3 comparison of two detection methods used real time pcr and nested pcr for screening environmental water samples for e multilocularis dna presence showed that both of them can be successfully used to identify e multilocularis in environmental water samples with a high degree of sensitivity and reproducibility fig 3 table 1 3 3 results of statistical analysis the independence of the frequency of the parasite detection was examined in four different cases table 4 results from the pearson chi square test vary

of e multilocularis molecular methods were chosen over microscopy because this detection procedure was regarded ineffective and time consuming eggs of e multilocularis are morphologically the same compared to eggs of other tapeworms belonging to echinococcus and taenia genus making differentiation impossible also the procedure of freezing thowing the sample before the isolation of dna causes damage in egg envelopes and significantly influences microscopic investigation furthermore it was taken into consideration that eggs if any are probably highly dispersed in water thus the division of the sample final pellet into two parts for microscopic and molecular investigations could finally result in decreasing the chance to confirm the presence of the parasite by lowering the number of eggs in each part of the pellet below a detectable level to fulfil the basic purpose of our study which was a to develop water analysis for the detection of e multilocularis contamination and b to check the possibility of e multilocularis presence in environmental water samples pcr was selected for its sensitivity and specificity the estimated detection limit in this study procedures was 10 eggs using this specific methodology it must be highlighted however that laboratory experiments are performed under conditions that are not identical to field conditions environmental water samples amongst others are characterised by a range of turbidity and organic content that may influence the detection procedure therefore the exact detection limit may vary between samples e multilocularis dna was detected and confirmed by real time pcr nested pcr and sequencing in two water samples that were collected from the pozorty and rydzówka lakes located in the warmia masuria province fig 1 pozorty is a small lake situated in the northern part of the iława district fig 1 with five well documented cases of human ae e multilocularis dna has also been found in this area in fox faeces in the soil vegetable forest fruit and mushroom samples lass et al 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 second lake rydzówka is located in the borders of węgorzewo and kętrzyn districts fig 1 in relatively close proximity to communities regarded as highly endemic like srokowo where ae detection rate is 5 3 per 100 000 inhabitants as compared with the national average 0 014 nahorski et al 2013 e multilocularis dna has been detected in soil and plant samples taken from this area as well lass et al 2015 szostakowska et al 2014 furthermore chi square test showed no statistical dependence between soil and water samples in the warmia masuria province table 4 validating the assumption that presence of the parasite in water samples in this endemic area corresponds to the previously determined presence in the soil accordingly the logical source of the contamination of the water in both lakes with e multilocularis eggs would be runoff carrying material from the surrounding environment forests and fields after rainfall surface runoff could transport contaminants such as e multilocularis eggs excreted by definitive hosts to local water pathways rivers canals and reservoirs lakes ponds within the endemic region of the warmia masuria province there are most probably foci characterised by intensive transmission and certain favourable factors the formation of foci and spatial distribution of infected foxes in particular has been described in cases in germany tackmann et al 1998 and in switzerland stieger et al 2002 apart from the lakes e multilocularis dna was also detected by nested pcr in one groundwater sample in a well situated in the small village in bartoszyce district in a yard belonging to a patient that was diagnosed with ae fig 1 positive soil samples have also been reported in this area szostakowska et al 2014 water from wells has been indicated as a significant risk factor in a case control study performed in hokkaido japan yamamoto et al 2001 moreover it has been identified as the most probable source of infection in an endemic area of e multilocularis in the western part of gansu province p r china han et al 2015 the authors suggested that faeces from the e multilocularis definitive hosts such as foxes could be washed into existing wells making them a source of e multilocularis infections in this newly discovered endemic ae region han et al 2015 in the case of the particular well investigated during this study surface runoff could have entered the well after a heavy rainfall event the positive result of nested pcr one per three performed reactions was not confirmed by real time pcr or sequencing and should therefore be treated as unconfirmed additional studies including more samples from different geographic areas should be undertaken in the future to ensure that well water pose a real threat to humans or animals in this endemic area in endemic regions there is a question about presence of e multilocularis eggs in drinking water but apart from a few studies suggesting well water as a possible sources of this tapeworm such data are still missing on the other hand some environmental studies have already demonstrated presence other taeniid eggs including e granulosus in drinking water sources dalu et al 2011 khairy et al 1982 stevenson and macpherson 1983 yousefi et al 2009 therefore in terms of the public health precaution measures recommendation of filtering drinking water for residents of endemic areas using individual water sources including wells would be prudent taking into consideration relatively large size of the tapeworm eggs 25 35 μm in diameter and the fact that commercially available filters for kitchen tap water are designed to remove objects up to around 1 μm in diameter such solution should be effective for complete removal of e multilocularis and other taeniid ova this however requires further studying on the assessment of e multilocularis risk in drinking water supplies nevertheless further study is required to accurately estimate the risk of humans and animals contracting the disease by contact with contaminated water including amongst other long lasting monitoring to establish the trends of e multilocularis presence the dependence on environmental conditions and the interaction with the zoonotic infection cycle it is highly likely that the number of eggs present in the environment is depended on precipitation trends and rain intensity in particular moreover dna detection of the parasite is evidence for its presence in the environment and therefore indicates a potential risk for humans but cannot determine the level of this risk all these aspects require further consideration a long lasting study focused on hyperendemic areas with continuous monitoring of sampling sites and definitive hosts is required for the assessment of the frequency and severity of e multilocularis threat to humans 5 conclusions e multilocularis tapeworm egg dna has been detected in surface water samples that were collected from lakes in the warmia masuria province poland the positive samples were found in the highly endemic hot spots echinococcosis areas of the province the results could be the starting point to improve the techniques for the detection of e multilocularis in water samples and for further studies to evaluate the real waterborne risk for humans and animals the route of waterborne transmission for e multilocularis to humans and animals via the dissemination of eggs through environmental water and its epidemiological impact would require further in depth studies future investigations and more extensive analysis of epidemiological data will be needed to indicate if this mode of transmission is more significant than what we previously thought funding

monthly analysis of metal mass in biosolids i e digested sewage sludge at the flint wastewater treatment plant represents a composite sample tracking the mass of metal release from plumbing to the flint water distribution system metals including lead in municipal wastewater are often dominated by release from potable water plumbing alam and sadiq 1989 boulay and edwards 2000 comber and gunn

and a majority of pb 87 8 in wastewater is typically removed during treatment and concentrated in the biosolids goldstone et al 1990 goldstone and lester 1991 this general idea was recently exploited in attempts to estimate water lead levels in drinking water of ancient rome delile et al 2014 2017 biosolids in wastewater began to be monitored in the u s starting in early 1980s and therefore this dataset is available for many municipal systems starting before the lead and copper rule monitoring began in 1991 usepa 1991 wef 2011 in flint less than 5 of the wastewater is derived from industry which has largely eliminated its lead sources case 2018 further increasing the likelihood that the lead captured in flint biosolids is mostly derived from domestic plumbing release to potable water if the hypothesis is valid that lead release from potable water plumbing is a substantial source of lead in flint biosolids it would also be expected that a metal mass released from plumbing and captured in biosolids would be higher during the fwc especially in warmer months when orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor was absent but lower and independent of temperature during time periods when orthophosphate was present boulay and edwards 2000 del toral et al 2013 deshommes et al 2013 masters et al 2016b lytle and schock 1996 b lead in biosolids will correlate with other common metals

gonzalez et al 2013 lytle and schock 1996 pieper et al 2017 c lead mass in biosolids would correlate with available datasets collected for citywide lead in water and possibly the incidence of ebl5 in flint children during the anomalous time when lead in water was a dominant source of childhood lead exposure table s1 2 experimental methods water temperature data ebl5 cases for children under six

2014 pre fwc may 2014 october 2015 during fwc and november 2015 november 2017 post fwc the term post fwc for lead reflects the fact that bottled water and filters were provided to all residents for health protection after november 2015 reducing the likelihood of consumer exposure even as water lead remained elevated this also coincided with a switchback to lake huron water and boosted

composite metal sample values using the weighting 1 3 x mean first draw 1 3 x mean second draw 1 3 mean third draw were calculated in the five virginia tech and the five usepa sampling rounds to test co occurrence of zinc lead and copper similar calculations could not be made for nickel and cadmium in the virginia tech data because the mean release was below the detection limit a representative weighted average 90th percentile wll wll90 was calculated using a weighted average of 1 3 x 90th percentile first draw lead 1 3 x 90th percentile second draw lead and 1 3 x 90th percentile third draw lead to reflect importance of lead release from all three types of water in human exposure sandvig et al 2008 for each virginia tech sampling round the 90th percentile has been the standardized reporting measure of wll in the united states since the federal lead and copper rule was adopted in 1991 for a comparison between the wlls in washington d c 1997 2006 and the fwc a modified composite 90th percentile wll mwll90 was calculated based on reported first draw lead levels from our previous studies because no third draw data and only one set of extensive second draw wlls exists for washington d c edwards et al 2009 edwards 2013 specifically to characterize human exposure risk to water lead we used a 50 50 weighting of measured 90th percentile first draw and measured 90th percentile second draw for the fwc using a viable lcr sampling pool comprised of 50 homes with lsls 17 homes with lsls and 17 homes with lead solder galvanized iron back calculated as described in pieper et al 2018 for washington d c we estimated the corresponding weighted 90th percentile water lead level 50 50 first and second draw weighting using our previously published 90th percentile first draw lead calculations and an assumption that the 90th percentile second draw lead was equal to 1 375 90th percentile first draw lead per calculations of 6 162 first and second draw samples collected

conducted for lead in biosolids kg for 18 months of the fwc nist sematech 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal trends of plumbing related metals in biosolids levels of premise plumbing related metals cadmium copper lead nickel and zinc in flint s monthly biosolids were correlated before during and post fwc figs 1 and s1 all five metals spiked markedly in the summer of 2014 when there was no corrosion control during the fwc and it is hypothetically possible this was due to general sloughing of pre existing scale from all plumbing surfaces masten et al 2016 olson et al 2017 pieper et al 2017 2018 the mass of all five plumbing related metals in biosolids were strongly correlated p 0 05 with each other in all three time periods table s3 at the home of flint resident zero there was a similar correlation between all five of these plumbing related metals during intensive water sampling in april 2015 pieper et al 2017 when this home pipe scale was clearly sloughing at high levels hence the system wide correlation is a logical extension of what occurred in this one home considering the five virginia tech citywide potable water sampling rounds strong correlations were observed between the mean composite measures of lead and copper r2 0 89 p 0 05 and copper and zinc r2 0 83 p 0 05 table s4 similar trends were observed for all five rounds of usepa data with lead and copper r2 0 93 p 0 05 and copper and zinc r2 0 78 p 0 05 interestingly there was no significant co occurrence observed for these metals for a given draw in both datasets i e first second or third draw but only for the weighted composite result this is expected given that the first draw water is often derived from a pure copper pipe whereas the second draw sample is often from a service line with pure lead or galvanized iron pipe i e first draw has highest copper and relatively low lead second draw has highest lead and almost no copper the monthly lead in biosolids was not correlated with monthly average water temperature pre and post fwc p 0 05 as expected for systems dosed with orthophosphate for corrosion control masters et al 2016b but they were moderately correlated during the fwc when orthophosphate was not dosed r2 0 30 p 0 05 table s1 the water temperature of the shallow flint river water source versus lake huron fluctuated much more in both summer and winter months during fwc compared to pre or post fwc fig 1 producing a greater possible effect of temperature on metal release from plumbing deshommes et al 2013 masters et al 2016b the tripling of orthophosphate dose to lake huron water 3 mg l total po4 starting december 9 2015 per usepa recommendations decreased overall lead release from the distribution system to historic lows post fwc 2016 17 average lead in biosolids 6 9 kg month versus pre fwc 2012 13 average 9 3 kg month suggesting that the higher phosphate dosages caused lower lead release from the plumbing even after the interrupted corrosion control during the fwc two tailed paired t test p 0 05 this trend of declining potable lead levels was confirmed by third party independent sampling which revealed a 90th percentile first draw wll of 4 μg l in late january 2019 masten and doudrick 2019 3 2 biosolids lead correlates strongly with citywide water lead measurements the wll90 calculated from each round of citywide citizen science sampling and the monthly lead in biosolids of the corresponding month were strongly correlated r2 0 86 p 0 05 n 5 fig 2 supporting the hypothesis that biosolids lead reflects citywide release of lead to water from plumbing the modeled relationship biosolids pb kg 0 483 x wll90 μg l 1 79 has an intercept of 1 79 kg which might represent a portion of lead loading to the sewage plant per month independent of that released from plumbing such as lead in wastewater from all non plumbing sources and 5 wastewater flow from industry case 2018 recent research made a rough estimate that 18 g lead leached on average from each flint lsl olson et al 2017 considering a recent rough estimate of 12 000 homes with lsls in the city of flint city of flint 2019 a total extra lead release of 216 kg from lsls to water would be predicted during the fwc if the typical 87 of this lead release to water was captured in biosolids goldstone et al 1990 goldstone and lester 1991 the resulting prediction of 188 kg lead is of similar magnitude to the 184 kg cumulative lead measured in biosolids during the fwc in this research in terms of possible confounding factors the stormwater in flint is not discharged to sewers reducing the likelihood that surface water runoff or hydrant flushing of water would influence the results busch 2014 emery 2014 fonger 2014 roy and edwards 2015 case 2018 moreover hydrant flushing uses water from mains that has not contacted the building plumbing that contains the zn cu pb cd and ni metals so any variation in flushing water from hydrants does not affect the release of these metals to drinking water or their mass in biosolids following the switch the total mass of biosolids dry weight basis produced in may to july 2014 average 317 metric tons was more than twice as high as the biosolids produced the prior year may 2013 apr 2014 average 140 metric tons before eventually stabilizing to pre crisis levels after switching back to lake huron source water fig s2 as long as the unidentified source of these higher biosolids did not contain a significant mass of lead the correlation between lead mass in biosolids and the lead release to potable water would still be valid as appears to be the case for data presented herein 3 3 lead in biosolids and elevated blood lead lead in water exposure is not typically considered to be a dominant correlate to lead in blood triantafyllidou and edwards 2012 especially for the age group whose blood lead is routinely monitored when corrosion control is effective or the population is protected against elevated lead in water this expectation was verified by a lack of correlation between biosolids lead reflecting water lead exposure and ebl5 post crisis p 0 05 table s1 during the 18 months pre and during the fwc there were only very weak correlations between ebl5 and biosolids lead during fwc r2 0 22 pre fwc r2 0 12 p 0 05 overall it appears that monthly lead mass in biosolids does seem to track lead release from plumbing to potable water but biosolids lead is only slightly predictive of overall childhood exposure for the age group of children whose blood lead is tested and considered least sensitive to water exposure several decades ago it was predicted that the typical 2 year old child obtained only 20 of their lead exposure from water on average with the remainder from food dust and other sources usepa 1988 the fact that there are only slightly significant correlations between biosolids lead and ebl5 for this age group both pre fwc and during the fwc suggests that lead in water is not normally a dominant source of exposure for this age group even though other sources of lead exposure have been increasingly controlled since 1990 when the 20 blood lead from water estimate was made triantafyllidou and edwards 2012 usepa 1988 the overall downward trends of lead in biosolids and childhood lead exposure are generally consistent with those observed nationally gómez et al 2018 hargreaves et al 2018 toffey 2016 usepa 2009 lead in biosolids was in a clear downtrend during the pre fwc time period from 12 kg month may 2011 october 2012 to 9 kg month november 2012 april 2014 this downtrend is also reflected in decreasing mean ebl5 from 4 71 to 2 76 in flint over the same time period similar to trends nationwide cdc 2018 gómez et al 2018 there are only two major exceptions to the overall ebl5 and biosolids lead downtrend the first was pre fwc in 2011 where an unexplained peak in monthly biosolids lead correlated to a peak in ebl5 specifically the average lead in biosolids for may october 2011 of 18 7 kg month corresponded to a very high mean ebl5 of 5 91 over that time period gomez and colleagues 2018 attributed the 2011 spike in ebl5 to a random variation but the biosolids data indicate that lead in wastewater was also anomalously high in this april may 2011 time period well before the fwc began in 2014 looking more closely at the 2011 biosolids lead spike we note that the lead levels were 115 185 above the ni trendline and 30 70 above the cd trendline and during this time period lead was not correlated with other metals originating from premise plumbing corrosion fig s3a we speculate that this anomaly may have somehow been linked to treatment upsets or other events during record detroit rainfall which was national news in that exact time period bienkowski 2013 regardless a key point is that both biosolids lead and ebl5 spiked higher in 2011 than at any other point reported in this research including during the fwc the second exception occurred shortly after the source water was switched to flint river in april 2014 the total biosolids lead mass during 18 month intervals before during fwc and after the fwc were 161 5 kg 184 kg and 129 kg respectively of the total 23 kg or 14 overall increased mass extra biosolids lead mass during versus pre fwc 76 came in july september of 2014 versus july september 2013 fig 3 a runs test for randomness analysis confirms that this biosolids lead mass spike in 2014 was not random p 0 05 the corresponding ebl5 roughly doubled from 3 45 to 6 61 in those three months of 2014 versus 2013 p 0 05 and this was also the only time period in which ebl5 was statistically higher during the fwc than pre or post fwc fig 3 this 2014 biosolids lead spike was also directly on the trendline for other biosolids metals derived from plumbing materials e g ni and cu fig s3b reinforcing the belief that this spike in biosolids lead and associated spike in ebl5 was due to scale sloughing from plumbing in the 18 months post fwc the total lead in biosolids dropped 30 55 kg and mean ebl5 was 3 00 fig 3 after virginia tech s drinking water advisory in august 2015 and then hurley medical center s september 2015 press conference showed increased blood lead in flint children the water source was switched back to lake huron water with corrosion control and decisive public health interventions were implemented to protect the public from high wlls hanna attisha et al 2016 state of michigan 2016 pieper et al 2018 the lead in biosolids decreased to 7 5 kg month and mean ebl5 decreased to 3 12 over the following year november 2015 october 2016 with recovery of corrosion control in the distribution system and implementation of enhanced corrosion inhibitor dosing 3 mg l as po4 starting december 9 2015 the lead in biosolids and mean ebl5 was further decreased to historical lows of 6 7 kg month and 2 58 november 2016 october 2017 respectively clearly the public health interventions of bottled water and lead filters reduced ebl5 incidence back to historical lows and ebl5 and biosolids lead were decoupled even as wlls remained above federal standards through june 2016 as indicated by both the state of michigan official data on residential sentinel sampling and virginia tech s citizen science water lead monitoring mdeq 2018 pieper et al 2018 3 4 contrast and comparison to other data if it is assumed that the net biosolids lead minus the baseline 1 79 kg of non plumbing lead figs 2 and s4 reflects the true trend in water lead release and exposure a perspective is provided on the fwc that is remarkably consistent with most existing published research on wll or using the ebl5 proxies after the switchback in october 2015 the official lead in water data started meeting federal standards in late 2016 and the corresponding lead in biosolids also declined back to levels considered normal at the start of this decade fig s5 blood lead levels and water lead levels have also recently dropped to historic lows in flint gómez et al 2018 mdeq 2018 pieper et al 2018 gómez et al 2019 masten and doudrick 2019 lytle et al 2019 these results also help address some speculation regarding changes in childhood lead exposure in flint specifically the 2014 blood lead spike in flint children did not likely originate from children having more contact with contaminated soil in summer months as was recently speculated laidlaw et al 2016 because the high lead in biosolids co occurred with release of lead from premise plumbing thus our data supports recent analyses by centers of disease control and prevention cdc and others that also indicated soil was not a major contributor to this 2014 blood lead spike based on independent reasoning kennedy 2016 sadler et al 2017 moreover speculation that a drop in blood lead observed in the months of apr sep 2014 to sep 2014 sep 2015 is due to boil water advisories that caused consumers to switch to bottled water zahran et al 2017 is not necessary because the drop in ebl5 is shown herein to reflect a drop in wlls in that time period finally this analysis provides evidence that the public health interventions of lead filters and bottled water were highly effective severing any link between ebl5 to lead in water and biosolids p 0 05 table s1 3 5 historical perspectives on the flint water crisis this analysis fills major knowledge gaps regarding the trajectory of the fwc in relation to lead in water and human exposure in particular the monthly lead in biosolids reached a peak of 24 5 kg during the warmer months may october of the crisis in 2014 but lead release steadily declined thereafter to less than half of that value 11 5 kg for the same time period in 2015 moreover the average and maximum biosolids lead measurements during the fwc in 2015 were comparable to those pre fwc in summer 2012 and summer 2013 suggesting that wlls throughout the city might have declined from the start of the fwc in summer 2014 as lead was depleted and sloughed from scale olson et al 2017 this analysis strongly suggests that the worst lead exposure during the fwc was restricted to june august 2014 captured in biosolids lead mass during july september 2014 as is further confirmed by the significant elevation in ebl5 associated with those months the overall biosolids lead data directly contradicts prior speculation by ourselves and others that water lead levels and associated exposures progressively increased during the 18 months of the fwc our analysis can also help put the potential exposures occurring during the fwc into context versus routine usepa 90th percentile first draw lead levels that are reported in other cities and also in comparison to the other major water lead contamination event of this century in washington d c 2001 2004 roy and edwards 2019a virginia tech s citywide sampling event in august 2015 did detect a very significant lead contamination problem with an estimated 90th percentile of 27 μg l first draw for a back calculated legitimate usepa lcr monitoring event with 50 lead pipes pieper et al 2018 if it is assumed that the 2 8x higher lead in biosolids in june 2014 vis à vis august 2015 is directly proportional to overall 90th percentile lead in water at that time as supported by the strong correlation in other time periods biosolids pb 0 37 x mwll90 1 41 r2 0 66 p 0 05 one sided t test for pearson r it would suggest a 90th percentile lead first draw in the range of 76 8 98 5 μg l in the worst outlier month of the fwc june 2014 versus the epa action level of 15 μg l but first draw lead is only one part of the human exposure picture the 2001 2004 dc lead crisis was noteworthy because second draw was often much higher than first draw edwards and dudi 2004 edwards et al 2009 edwards 2013 whereas in flint the opposite was true pieper et al 2018 if a simple composite exposure is considered based on 50 first draw and 50 second draw weighting mwll90 the 62 4 μg l in the outlier month of june 2014 of the fwc would be in the range of the water lead observed in the 2001 2004 dc lead crisis fig 4 but the dc exposures were much worse at all other times and the exposure was of much longer duration edwards et al 2009 edwards 2013 roy and edwards 2019a specifically the mwll90 for the fwc without considering the outlier month of june 2014 ranged from 10 2 μg l to 43 1 μg l whereas that for washington d c 2001 04 were between 61 9 μg l and 108 6 μg l this is expected since the d c lead crisis elevated a significant percentage of children s blood lead above the 10 μg dl cdc level of concern in force at that time whereas the fwc was manifested at the ebl5 level and not at 10 μg dl edwards et al 2009 edwards 2013 hanna attisha et al 2016 gómez et al 2018 future studies examining possible public health harm from lead and other metals released from the plumbing during the fwc should also carefully consider results indicating june august 2014 was the time period of maximum water lead exposure 3 6 innovative use of biosolids monitoring data as a cumulative measure of wlls urban sewage is being increasingly monitored to identify and map general public health trends from antibiotic resistance genes args pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and population level traits like obesity and the human gut microbiome cai et al 2014 newton et al 2015 olofsson et al 2012 su et al 2017 wang and wang 2016 this study suggests that biosolids monitoring can provide important insights about overall trends in lead release to water from plumbing which is important given rising worldwide concern about exposure to lead in drinking water and the logistical and statistical problems of monitoring lead at consumer taps roy and edwards 2019a targeted sampling random sampling 3 d profiles and proportional sampling of drinking water in consumer homes all have acknowledged strengths and weaknesses proponents and detractors clark et al 2014 del toral et al 2013 masters et al 2016a pieper et al 2017 schock 1990 jarvis et al 2018 lytle et al 2019 riblet et al 2019 and in some cases a hundred household samples are required by regulation to calculate 90th percentile lead and monitor effectiveness of corrosion control for just one month each year if a single sample of sludge could be used to track aggregate lead release and corrosion control effectiveness every month as seems to have been the case in this research it could improve understanding of seasonal trends and problems with semi random particulate lead release plaguing at the tap analysis of lcr monitoring data specifically biosolids lead monitoring may provide highly complementary if not some superior insights to traditional approaches that rely on direct monitoring of lead in drinking water at consumer taps this is an exciting prospect deserving of future study that even seems obvious in retrospect given prior understanding it is especially important considering the cost logistical problems of accessing sampling taps in home and buildings for compliance sample collection and the hundreds or even thousands of samples that would be required to obtain statistically valid estimates of water lead regulatory goals i e 90th percentile lead in the u s as indicated by prior research masters et al 2016a 4 conclusions our novel approach shedding light on wlls during the fwc based on routine biosolids analysis revealed that plumbing related metals including lead were strongly correlated with one another in monthly sewage biosolids monitoring data during 2011 17 especially during the fwc months of apr 2014 oct 2015 the plumbing related metals cu zn and pb were also correlated with one another in calculated weighted averages of first second and third draw in five rounds of virginia tech and usepa drinking water monitoring data biosolids lead strongly correlated with citywide wlls in virginia tech s sampling from august 2015 to august 2017 during the fwc the increased biosolids lead mass 23 kg was just 14 higher than the comparable 18 month time period pre fwc but most 76 of that increased mass was in the months of july september 2014 during those three months ebl5 was nearly doubled p 0 05 during fwc versus pre fwc but was not significantly higher in the other months of the fwc biosolids lead was very weakly correlated with ebl5 pre fwc and during the fwc and not at other time periods consistent with the expectation that water lead exposure is not strongly correlated to blood lead lead filters and bottled water severed the link between biosolids lead and ebl5 consistent with public health protections of flint consumers during the federal emergency exposure to elevated water lead during the fwc was predominantly associated with a large lead release that occurred during summer 2014 as evidenced by high lead in biosolids and ebl5 in children this is consistent with prior research based only on ebl5 summer spikes of wll occurred when orthophosphate was not added to water in 2014 and 2015 but not in pre fwc or post fwc summer months when orthophosphate was being dosed higher orthophosphate dosages resulted in lower wlls and biosolids lead levels demonstrating the effectiveness of increased phosphate dosing biosolids lead monitoring may provide unique insights to effectiveness of lead corrosion control and citywide exposure risks biosolids lead and predicted human water lead exposures during the 2014 2015 fwc were in the range of what occurred in 2011 declaration of interests the authors

and timing of lead release throughout the rest of the city between april 2014 and august 2015 the official water lead data that was collected is considered nearly useless due to the fact compliance samples did not meet criteria under the national primary drinking water regulations and the federal lead and copper rule lcr for example the requirement that at least 50 of compliance samples must be collected from homes with lsls was not met pieper et al 2018 the official sampling results were also biased low by pre flushing homes the evening before the six hour stagnation time and use of small

water sampling revealed greatest lead in water risk gómez et al 2018 hanna attisha et al 2016 however there is nonetheless ongoing dismay about not knowing trends in water lead exposure that occurred during the 18 months of the fwc banner 2018 gómez et al 2018 gómez et al 2019 graham 2016 kruger et al 2017 oleske et al 2016 to address these concerns we explored the novel hypothesis that routine monthly analysis of metal mass in biosolids i e digested sewage sludge at the flint wastewater treatment plant represents a composite sample tracking the mass of metal release from plumbing to the flint water distribution system metals including lead in municipal wastewater are often dominated by release from potable water plumbing alam and sadiq 1989 boulay and edwards 2000 comber and gunn 1996 isaac and boothroyd 1996 hargreaves et al 2018 karvelas et al 2003 murphy and pierides 2004 nycdep n d santos echeandía 2009 sörme and lagerkvist 2002 toffey 2016 goodman 1984 isaac et al 1997 and a majority of pb 87 8 in wastewater is typically removed during treatment and concentrated in the biosolids goldstone et al 1990 goldstone and lester 1991 this general idea was recently exploited in attempts to estimate water lead levels in drinking water of ancient rome delile et al 2014 2017 biosolids in wastewater began to be monitored in the u s starting in early 1980s and therefore this dataset is available for many municipal systems starting before the lead and copper rule monitoring began in 1991 usepa 1991 wef 2011 in flint less than 5 of the wastewater is derived from industry which has largely eliminated its lead sources case 2018 further increasing the likelihood that the lead captured in flint biosolids is mostly derived from domestic plumbing release to potable water if the hypothesis is valid that lead release from potable water plumbing is a substantial source of lead in flint biosolids it would also be expected that a metal mass released from plumbing and captured in biosolids would be higher during the fwc especially in warmer months when orthophosphate corrosion inhibitor was absent but lower and independent of temperature during time periods when orthophosphate was present boulay and edwards 2000 del toral et al 2013 deshommes et al 2013 masters et al 2016b lytle and schock 1996 b lead in biosolids will correlate with other common metals

gonzalez et al 2013 lytle and schock 1996 pieper et al 2017 c lead mass in biosolids would correlate with available datasets collected for citywide lead in water and possibly the incidence of ebl5 in

2014 pre fwc may 2014 october 2015 during fwc and november 2015 november 2017 post fwc the term post fwc for lead reflects the fact that bottled water and filters were provided to all residents for health protection after november 2015 reducing the likelihood of consumer exposure even as water lead remained elevated this also coincided with a switchback to lake huron water and boosted

composite metal sample values using the weighting 1 3 x mean first draw 1 3 x mean second draw 1 3 mean third draw were calculated in the five virginia tech and the five usepa sampling rounds to test co occurrence of zinc lead and copper similar calculations could not be made for nickel and cadmium in the virginia tech data because the mean release was below the detection limit a representative weighted average 90th percentile wll wll90 was calculated using a weighted average of 1 3 x 90th percentile first draw lead 1 3 x 90th percentile second draw lead and 1 3 x 90th percentile third draw lead to reflect importance of lead release from all three types of water in human exposure sandvig et al 2008 for each virginia tech sampling round the 90th percentile has been the standardized reporting measure of wll in the united states since the federal lead and copper rule was adopted in 1991 for a comparison between the wlls in washington d c 1997 2006 and the fwc a modified composite 90th percentile wll mwll90 was calculated based on reported first draw lead levels from our previous studies because no third draw data and only one set of extensive second draw wlls exists for washington d c edwards et al 2009 edwards 2013 specifically to characterize human exposure risk to water lead we used a 50 50 weighting of measured 90th percentile first draw and measured 90th percentile second draw for the fwc using a viable lcr sampling pool comprised of 50 homes with lsls 17 homes with lsls and 17 homes with lead solder galvanized iron back calculated as described in pieper et al 2018 for washington d c we estimated the corresponding weighted 90th percentile water lead level 50 50 first and second draw weighting using our previously published 90th percentile first draw lead calculations and an assumption that the 90th percentile second draw lead was equal to 1 375 90th percentile first draw lead per calculations of 6 162 first and second draw samples collected during summer 2003 2 5 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted in rstudio version 3 3 2 and or microsoft excel version 2016 a p value of 0 05 with an alpha value α of 0 05 was

conducted for lead in biosolids kg for 18 months of the fwc nist sematech 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal trends of plumbing related metals in biosolids levels of premise plumbing related metals cadmium copper lead nickel and zinc in flint s monthly biosolids were correlated before during and post fwc figs 1 and s1 all five metals spiked markedly in the summer of 2014 when there was no corrosion control during the fwc and it is hypothetically possible this was due to general sloughing of pre existing scale from all plumbing surfaces masten et al 2016 olson et al 2017 pieper et al 2017 2018 the mass of all five plumbing related metals in biosolids were strongly correlated p 0 05 with each other in all three time periods table s3 at the home of flint resident zero there was a similar correlation between all five of these plumbing related metals during intensive water sampling in april 2015 pieper et al 2017 when this home pipe scale was clearly sloughing at high levels hence the system wide correlation is a logical extension of what occurred in this one home considering the five virginia tech citywide potable water sampling rounds strong correlations were observed between the mean composite measures of lead and copper r2 0 89 p 0 05 and copper and zinc r2 0 83 p 0 05 table s4 similar trends were observed for all five rounds of usepa data with lead and copper r2 0 93 p 0 05 and copper and zinc r2 0 78 p 0 05 interestingly there was no significant co occurrence observed for these metals for a given draw in both datasets i e first second or third draw but only for the weighted composite result this is expected given that the first draw water is often derived from a pure copper pipe whereas the second draw sample is often from a service line with pure lead or galvanized iron pipe i e first draw has highest copper and relatively low lead second draw has highest lead and almost no copper the monthly lead in biosolids was not correlated with monthly average water temperature pre and post fwc p 0 05 as expected for systems dosed with orthophosphate for corrosion control masters et al 2016b but they were moderately correlated during the fwc when orthophosphate was not dosed r2 0 30 p 0 05 table s1 the water temperature of the shallow flint river water source versus lake huron fluctuated much more in both summer and winter months during fwc compared to pre or post fwc fig 1 producing a greater possible effect of temperature on metal release from plumbing deshommes et al 2013 masters et al 2016b the tripling of orthophosphate dose to lake huron water 3 mg l total po4 starting december 9 2015 per usepa recommendations decreased overall lead release from the distribution system to historic lows post fwc 2016 17 average lead in biosolids 6 9 kg month versus pre fwc 2012 13 average 9 3 kg month suggesting that the higher phosphate dosages caused lower lead release from the plumbing even after the interrupted corrosion control during the fwc two tailed paired t test p 0 05 this trend of declining potable lead levels was confirmed by third party independent sampling which revealed a 90th percentile first draw wll of 4 μg l in late january 2019 masten and doudrick 2019 3 2 biosolids lead correlates strongly with citywide water lead measurements the wll90 calculated from each round of citywide citizen science sampling and the monthly lead in biosolids of the corresponding month were strongly correlated r2 0 86 p 0 05 n 5 fig 2 supporting the hypothesis that biosolids lead reflects citywide release of lead to water from plumbing the modeled relationship biosolids pb kg 0 483 x wll90 μg l 1 79 has an intercept of 1 79 kg which might represent a portion of lead loading to the sewage plant per month independent of that released from plumbing such as lead in wastewater from all non plumbing sources and 5 wastewater flow from industry case 2018 recent research made a rough estimate that 18 g lead leached on average from each flint lsl olson et al 2017 considering a recent rough estimate of 12 000 homes with lsls in the city of flint city of flint 2019 a total extra lead release of 216 kg from lsls to water would be predicted during the fwc if the typical 87 of this lead release to water was captured in biosolids goldstone et al 1990 goldstone and lester 1991 the resulting prediction of 188 kg lead is of similar magnitude to the 184 kg cumulative lead measured in biosolids during the fwc in this research in terms of possible confounding factors the stormwater in flint is not discharged to sewers reducing the likelihood that surface water runoff or hydrant flushing of water would influence the results busch 2014 emery 2014 fonger 2014 roy and edwards 2015 case 2018 moreover hydrant flushing uses water from mains that has not contacted the building plumbing that contains the zn cu pb cd and ni metals so any variation in flushing water from hydrants does not affect the release of these metals to drinking water or their mass in biosolids following the switch the total mass of biosolids dry weight basis produced in may to july 2014 average 317 metric tons was more than twice as high as the biosolids produced the prior year may 2013 apr 2014 average 140 metric tons before eventually stabilizing to pre crisis levels after switching back to lake huron source water fig s2 as long as the unidentified source of these higher biosolids did not contain a significant mass of lead the correlation between lead mass in biosolids and the lead release to potable water would still be valid as appears to be the case for data presented herein 3 3 lead in biosolids and elevated blood lead lead in water exposure is not typically considered to be a dominant correlate to lead in blood triantafyllidou and edwards 2012 especially for the age group whose blood lead is routinely monitored when corrosion control is effective or the population is protected against elevated lead in water this expectation was verified by a lack of correlation between biosolids lead reflecting water lead exposure and ebl5 post crisis p 0 05 table s1 during the 18 months pre and during the fwc there were only very weak correlations between ebl5 and biosolids lead during fwc r2 0 22 pre fwc r2 0 12 p 0 05 overall it appears that monthly lead mass in biosolids does seem to track lead release from plumbing to potable water but biosolids lead is only slightly predictive of overall childhood exposure for the age group of children whose blood lead is tested and considered least sensitive to water exposure several decades ago it was predicted that the typical 2 year old child obtained only 20 of their lead exposure from water on average with the remainder from food dust and other sources usepa 1988 the fact that there are only slightly significant correlations between biosolids lead and ebl5 for this age group both pre fwc and during the fwc suggests that lead in water is not normally a dominant source of exposure for this age group even though other sources of lead exposure have been increasingly controlled since 1990 when the 20 blood lead from water estimate was made triantafyllidou and edwards 2012 usepa 1988 the overall downward trends of lead in biosolids and childhood lead exposure are generally consistent with those observed nationally gómez et al 2018 hargreaves et al 2018 toffey 2016 usepa 2009 lead in biosolids was in a clear downtrend during the pre fwc time period from 12 kg month may 2011 october 2012 to 9 kg month november 2012 april 2014 this downtrend is also reflected in decreasing mean ebl5 from 4 71 to 2 76 in flint over the same time period similar to trends nationwide cdc 2018 gómez et al 2018 there are only two major exceptions to the overall ebl5 and biosolids lead downtrend the first was pre fwc in 2011 where an unexplained peak in monthly biosolids lead correlated to a peak in ebl5 specifically the average lead in biosolids for may october 2011 of 18 7 kg month corresponded to a very high mean ebl5 of 5 91 over that time period gomez and colleagues 2018 attributed the 2011 spike in ebl5 to a random variation but the biosolids data indicate that lead in wastewater was also anomalously high in this april may 2011 time period well before the fwc began in 2014 looking more closely at the 2011 biosolids lead spike we note that the lead levels were 115 185 above the ni trendline and 30 70 above the cd trendline and during this time period lead was not correlated with other metals originating from premise plumbing corrosion fig s3a we speculate that this anomaly may have somehow been linked to treatment upsets or other events during record detroit rainfall which was national news in that exact time period bienkowski 2013 regardless a key point is that both biosolids lead and ebl5 spiked higher in 2011 than at any other point reported in this research including during the fwc the second exception occurred shortly after the source water was switched to flint river in april 2014 the total biosolids lead mass during 18 month intervals before during fwc and after the fwc were 161 5 kg 184 kg and 129 kg respectively of the total 23 kg or 14 overall increased mass extra biosolids lead mass during versus pre fwc 76 came in july september of 2014 versus july september 2013 fig 3 a runs test for randomness analysis confirms that this biosolids lead mass spike in 2014 was not random p 0 05 the corresponding ebl5 roughly doubled from 3 45 to 6 61 in those three months of 2014 versus 2013 p 0 05 and this was also the only time period in which ebl5 was statistically higher during the fwc than pre or post fwc fig 3 this 2014 biosolids lead spike was also directly on the trendline for other biosolids metals derived from plumbing materials e g ni and cu fig s3b reinforcing the belief that this spike in biosolids lead and associated spike in ebl5 was due to scale sloughing from plumbing in the 18 months post fwc the total lead in biosolids dropped 30 55 kg and mean ebl5 was 3 00 fig 3 after virginia tech s drinking water advisory in august 2015 and then hurley medical center s september 2015 press conference showed increased blood lead in flint children the water source was switched back to lake huron water with corrosion control and decisive public health interventions were implemented to protect the public from high wlls hanna attisha et al 2016 state of michigan 2016 pieper et al 2018 the lead in biosolids decreased to 7 5 kg month and mean ebl5 decreased to 3 12 over the following year november 2015 october 2016 with recovery of corrosion control in the distribution system and implementation of enhanced corrosion inhibitor dosing 3 mg l as po4 starting december 9 2015 the lead in biosolids and mean ebl5 was further decreased to historical lows of 6 7 kg month and 2 58 november 2016 october 2017 respectively clearly the public health interventions of bottled water and lead filters reduced ebl5 incidence back to historical lows and ebl5 and biosolids lead were decoupled even as wlls remained above federal standards through june 2016 as indicated by both the state of michigan official data on residential sentinel sampling and virginia tech s citizen science water lead monitoring mdeq 2018 pieper et al 2018 3 4 contrast and comparison to other data if it is assumed that the net biosolids lead minus the baseline 1 79 kg of non plumbing lead figs 2 and s4 reflects the true trend in water lead release and exposure a perspective is provided on the fwc that is remarkably consistent with most existing published research on wll or using the ebl5 proxies after the switchback in october 2015 the official lead in water data started meeting federal standards in late 2016 and the corresponding lead in biosolids also declined back to levels considered normal at the start of this decade fig s5 blood lead levels and water lead levels have also recently dropped to historic lows in flint gómez et al 2018 mdeq 2018 pieper et al 2018 gómez et al 2019 masten and doudrick 2019 lytle et al 2019 these results also help address some speculation regarding changes in childhood lead exposure in flint specifically the 2014 blood lead spike in flint children did not likely originate from children having more contact with contaminated soil in summer months as was recently speculated laidlaw et al 2016 because the high lead in biosolids co occurred with release of lead from premise plumbing thus our data supports recent analyses by centers of disease control and prevention cdc and others that also indicated soil was not a major contributor to this 2014 blood lead spike based on independent reasoning kennedy 2016 sadler et al 2017 moreover speculation that a drop in blood lead observed in the months of apr sep 2014 to sep 2014 sep 2015 is due to boil water advisories that caused consumers to switch to bottled water zahran et al 2017 is not necessary because the drop in ebl5 is shown herein to reflect a drop in wlls in that time period finally this analysis provides evidence that the public health interventions of lead filters and bottled water were highly effective severing any link between ebl5 to lead in water and biosolids p 0 05 table s1 3 5 historical perspectives on the flint water crisis this analysis fills major knowledge gaps regarding the trajectory of the fwc in relation to lead in water and human exposure in particular the monthly lead in biosolids reached a peak of 24 5 kg during the warmer months may october of the crisis in 2014 but lead release steadily declined thereafter to less than half of that value 11 5 kg for the same time period in 2015 moreover the average and maximum biosolids lead measurements during the fwc in 2015 were comparable to those pre fwc in summer 2012 and summer 2013 suggesting that wlls throughout the city might have declined from the start of the fwc in summer 2014 as lead was depleted and sloughed from scale olson et al 2017 this analysis strongly suggests that the worst lead exposure during the fwc was restricted to june august 2014 captured in biosolids lead mass during july september 2014 as is further confirmed by the significant elevation in ebl5 associated with those months the overall biosolids lead data directly contradicts prior speculation by ourselves and others that water lead levels and associated exposures progressively increased during the 18 months of the fwc our analysis can also help put the potential exposures occurring during the fwc into context versus routine usepa 90th percentile first draw lead levels that are reported in other cities and also in comparison to the other major water lead contamination event of this century in washington d c 2001 2004 roy and edwards 2019a virginia tech s citywide sampling event in august 2015 did detect a very significant lead contamination problem with an estimated 90th percentile of 27 μg l first draw for a back calculated legitimate usepa lcr monitoring event with 50 lead pipes pieper et al 2018 if it is assumed that the 2 8x higher lead in biosolids in june 2014 vis à vis august 2015 is directly proportional to overall 90th percentile lead in water at that time as supported by the strong correlation in other time periods biosolids pb 0 37 x mwll90 1 41 r2 0 66 p 0 05 one sided t test for pearson r it would suggest a 90th percentile lead first draw in the range of 76 8 98 5 μg l in the worst outlier month of the fwc june 2014 versus the epa action level of 15 μg l but first draw lead is only one part of the human exposure picture the 2001 2004 dc lead crisis was noteworthy because second draw was often much higher than first draw edwards and dudi 2004 edwards et al 2009 edwards 2013 whereas in flint the opposite was true pieper et al 2018 if a simple composite exposure is considered based on 50 first draw and 50 second draw weighting mwll90 the 62 4 μg l in the outlier month of june 2014 of the fwc would be in the range of the water lead observed in the 2001 2004 dc lead crisis fig 4 but the dc exposures were much worse at all other times and the exposure was of much longer duration edwards et al 2009 edwards 2013 roy and edwards 2019a specifically the mwll90 for the fwc without considering the outlier month of june 2014 ranged from 10 2 μg l to 43 1 μg l whereas that for washington d c 2001 04 were between 61 9 μg l and 108 6 μg l this is expected since the d c lead crisis elevated a significant percentage of children s blood lead above the 10 μg dl cdc level of concern in force at that time whereas the fwc was manifested at the ebl5 level and not at 10 μg dl edwards et al 2009 edwards 2013 hanna attisha et al 2016 gómez et al 2018 future studies examining possible public health harm from lead and other metals released from the plumbing during the fwc should also carefully consider results indicating june august 2014 was the time period of maximum water lead exposure 3 6 innovative use of biosolids monitoring data as a cumulative measure of wlls urban sewage is being increasingly monitored to identify and map general public health trends from antibiotic resistance genes args pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and population level traits like obesity and the human gut microbiome cai et al 2014 newton et al 2015 olofsson et al 2012 su et al 2017 wang and wang 2016 this study suggests that biosolids monitoring can provide important insights about overall trends in lead release to water from plumbing which is important given rising worldwide concern about exposure to lead in drinking water and the logistical and statistical problems of monitoring lead at consumer taps roy and edwards 2019a targeted sampling random sampling 3 d profiles and proportional sampling of drinking water in consumer homes all have acknowledged strengths and weaknesses proponents and detractors clark et al 2014 del toral et al 2013 masters et al 2016a pieper et al 2017 schock 1990 jarvis et al 2018 lytle et al 2019 riblet et al 2019 and in some cases a hundred household samples are required by regulation to calculate 90th percentile lead and monitor effectiveness of corrosion control for just one month each year if a single sample of sludge could be used to track aggregate lead release and corrosion control effectiveness every month as seems to have been the case in this research it could improve understanding of seasonal trends and problems with semi random particulate lead release plaguing at the tap analysis of lcr monitoring data specifically biosolids lead monitoring may provide highly complementary if not some superior insights to traditional approaches that rely on direct monitoring of lead in drinking water at consumer taps this is an exciting prospect deserving of future study that even seems obvious in retrospect given prior understanding it is especially important considering the cost logistical problems of accessing sampling taps in home and buildings for compliance sample collection and the hundreds or even thousands of samples that would be required to obtain statistically valid estimates of water lead regulatory goals i e 90th percentile lead in the u s as indicated by prior research masters et al 2016a 4 conclusions our novel approach shedding light on wlls during the fwc based on routine biosolids analysis revealed that plumbing related metals including lead were strongly correlated with one another in monthly sewage biosolids monitoring data during 2011 17 especially during the fwc months of apr 2014 oct 2015 the plumbing related metals cu zn and pb were also correlated with one another in calculated weighted averages of first second and third draw in five rounds of virginia tech and usepa drinking water monitoring data biosolids lead strongly correlated with citywide wlls in virginia tech s sampling from august 2015 to august 2017 during the fwc the increased biosolids lead mass 23 kg was just 14 higher than the comparable 18 month time period pre fwc but most 76 of that increased mass was in the months of july september 2014 during those three months ebl5 was nearly doubled p 0 05 during fwc versus pre fwc but was not significantly higher in the other months of the fwc biosolids lead was very weakly correlated with ebl5 pre fwc and during the fwc and not at other time periods consistent with the expectation that water lead exposure is not strongly correlated to blood lead lead filters and bottled water severed the link between biosolids lead and ebl5 consistent with public health protections of flint consumers during the federal emergency exposure to elevated water lead during the fwc was predominantly associated with a large lead release that occurred during summer 2014 as evidenced by high lead in biosolids and ebl5 in children this is consistent with prior research based only on ebl5 summer spikes of wll occurred when orthophosphate was not added to water in 2014 and 2015 but not in pre fwc or post fwc summer months when orthophosphate was being dosed higher orthophosphate dosages resulted in lower wlls and biosolids lead levels demonstrating the effectiveness of increased phosphate dosing biosolids lead monitoring may provide unique insights to effectiveness of lead corrosion control and citywide exposure risks biosolids lead and predicted human water lead exposures during the 2014 2015 fwc were in the range of what occurred in 2011 declaration of interests the authors

18758,temperature increase caused by thermal discharge from power plants promotes phytoplankton growth and frequent bloom in eutrophic subtropical waters particularly in cold seasons suspension filter feeding bivalves show size selective grazing on phytoplankton thus we hypothesized that algal bloom under thermal stimulation could be controlled and that phytoplankton community was structured by oyster farming here ten cruises were conducted in two oyster farms ofs and control areas cas adjacent to the ninghai power plant in the upper section of xiangshan bay during 2009 2015 we found that thermal discharge induced severe winter algal blooms phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a chla were significantly lower 46 3 and 28 3 respectively in of than in ca indicating a high filtration efficiency by oysters and the associated biofouling assemblages in addition oyster farming significantly increased species richness by 26 3 shannon wiener diversity by 38 3 and pielou s evenness indices by 28 8 and reduced suspended solids by 12 2 total organic carbon by 18 4 dissolved inorganic nitrogen by 1 5 and phosphorus by 3 7 furthermore oyster farming considerably reduced increased micro chla contribution pheophytin chla by 34 8 71 1 suggesting a strong size selective grazing on phytoplankton analysis of similarity revealed a significant difference in phytoplankton community composition between of and ca however after the removal of culture rafts all the abundance chla species diversity dominant species size structure and community composition of phytoplankton showed no significant difference our study demonstrated that oyster farming effectively alleviated eutrophication and algal bloom and enhanced phytoplankton diversity which provides guidance for aquaculture and ecological restoration in subtropical coastal eutrophic waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords oyster farming phytoplankton size selective grazing species diversity thermal discharge xiangshan bay 1 introduction eutrophication is a key driver of increased harmful algal blooms in coastal waters heisler et al 2008 jiang et al 2014 additionally the magnitude frequency and duration of harmful algal blooms have been frequently linked to warming moore et al 2008 paerl and scott 2010 for example temperature increase caused by thermal discharge from power plants promotes phytoplankton growth and frequent bloom in eutrophic subtropical waters yu et al 2007 jiang et al 2019a 2019b how to control eutrophication and algal blooms under accelerated warming has been the focus of research in area of environmental problems in coastal ecosystems worldwide oysters and the associated biofouling assemblages obas including ascidians bryozoans sponges polychaete and macroalgae remove nutrients directly or indirectly by filtering phytoplankton and other microbial particles cloern 1982 dame 1996 newell 2004 froján et al 2014 grizzle et al 2018 and enhance the fluxes of organic matter and nutrients toward sediments newell 2004 kellogg et al 2014 additionally the harvest represents a net removal of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from the ecosystem therefore the aquaculture and restoration of the oyster population have been proposed as an ecological restore tool for top down control of phytoplankton blooms and reversal of eutrophication in coastal waters newell 2004 huang et al 2008 wheat and ruesink 2013 rose et al 2014 bricker et al 2018 however its ecosystem service function remains controversial pomeroy et al 2006 kellogg et al 2014 as a critical restoration technique oyster culture and reefs have been widely adopted such as in long island sound bricker et al 2018 yangtze river estuary quan et al 2009 and chesapeake bay ray et al 2015 in shallow eutrophic waters consumption of phytoplankton by obas directly reduces a large amount of particulate organic matter available to be remineralized by pelagic consumers and bacterioplankton cloern 1982 newell 2004 kellogg et al 2014 however the excretion and regeneration of organic inorganic nutrients promotes algal growth and production cloern 1982 newell 2004 nizzoli et al 2005 broekhoven et al 2014 froján et al 2014 porter et al 2018 therefore the observed biomass and community composition of phytoplankton are not only the result of nutrient release bottom up effect but also are affected by changes in grazer organisms that exert top down control souchu et al 2001 newell 2004 ray et al 2015 knowledge regarding the top down and bottom up effects on phytoplankton is useful to evaluate the ecological function and restoration outcomes of bivalve farming bivalves usually engage in size selective grazing on seston the sum of phytoplankton heterotrophic protists and other particulates and effectively reduce the

affects both phytoplankton biomass and community composition in shallow suisun bay lucas et al 2016 only a few field studies have focused on the responses of the phytoplankton community structure to oyster farming jiang et al 2012 2016 china is the biggest oyster culture country in the world however the effects of oyster farming on the phytoplankton community and water column biogeochemistry in coastal waters of china remains poorly understood xiangshan bay xsb is a long 60 km narrow 3 8 km eutrophic semi enclosed subtropical bay located at the northern east china sea with long water residence time 80 days for 90 water exchanges in the upper section ning and hu 2002 oyster farming in this bay has been expanded since the 1980s reflecting china s tremendously increased cultural scale shellfish production during 2005 2006 was estimated to be 45 000 t year 1 of which 93 was oyster produced either on ropes or in intertidal areas nobre et al 2010 the ninghai power plant npp located in the upper bay began to operate since december 17 2005 and produced a large amount of thermal discharge 82 5 m3 s 1 which caused a strong increase in the temperature of receiving waters adjacent to the npp including oyster farms ofs in the upper xsb this temperature increase stimulated phytoplankton growth and frequent bloom in the upper bay particularly in cold seasons jiang et al 2012 2019a 2019b in this context we hypothesize that oyster farming results in top down control of algal bloom under thermal stimulation and that the phytoplankton community structure is altered by size selective grazing and the bottom up effect to test our hypothesis ten cruises were conducted in the chinese pleated oyster crassostrea plicatula ofs and control areas cas adjacent to the npp in xsb during 2009 2015 we examined how oyster farming affects the phytoplankton community chlorophyll a chla abundance diversity dominant species and size structure and physicochemical variables temperature transparency suspended solids oxygen nutrients and organic carbon our objectives were 1 to quantify the removal of phytoplankton biomass by obas under thermal stimulation 2 to investigate the effects of oyster farming on the phytoplankton community structure and physicochemical variables and 3 to evaluate the mitigation potential of algal bloom and eutrophication by using oyster farming our study can help understand the effect of oyster farming on the coastal ecosystem and guide future policy formulating of mariculture and ecological restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1

regional differences between the new of and ca respectively table s1 the dsi concentration varied slightly between of and ca fig 2h and fig s1i toc was considerably lower in of than in ca in all cases fig 2i and fig s1j however after the removal of the old farm no significant regional difference was found for nutrients and toc table 1 shows that oyster farming reduced the concentration of din dip

fig 2 although no significant differences within the water layer were usually found table s1 3 2 phytoplankton abundance and chla the phytoplankton abundance fig 3a and fig s2a and chla concentration fig 4a and fig s3 were significantly p 0 05 lower in of than in ca during the oyster culture period tables s2 and s3 however no significant difference between of and ca was found after the removal of cultured rafts table 1 shows that oyster farming reduced the phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration by 46 3 and 18 4 on average respectively thermal discharge from the npp likely promoted phytoplankton growth and even bloom with chla 6 μg l on the surface in ca during winter of 2009 2010 and 2015 fig s3 however oyster farming effectively controlled winter algal bloom with 30 reduction in the phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration oyster farming profoundly influenced phytoplankton size structure that effectively reduced micro chla contribution by 34 8 but increased nano by 8

fig 4 pico chla concentrations were higher in of 0 31 0 74 and 0 36 μg l than in ca 0 16 0 51 and 0 26 μg l in spring autumn and summer fig 4b and table s3 show that the pheo chla was significantly p 0 05 higher in of than in ca on average oyster farming increased the pheo chla by 71 1 table 2 suggesting a high grazing rate on phytoplankton 3 3 phytoplankton species diversity phytoplankton diversity indices s h and j on both the surface and bottom were considerably higher in of than in ca during the oyster culture period fig 3 and fig s2 s h and j varied significantly p 0 05 between of and ca in most cases table s2 table 1 shows that oyster farming increased s h and j by 26 3 38 3 and 28 8 on average respectively however after the removal of cultured rafts diversity indices did not significantly differ between of and ca table s2 3 4 dominant phytoplankton species dominant phytoplankton species included diatoms e g chaetoceros skeletonema thalassiosira and coscinodiscus dinoflagellates e g prorocentrum minimum scripposciella trochoidea and karlodinium veneficum cryptophytes teleaulax euglenophyte eutreptia lanowii and eutreptiella gymnastica cyanobacteria trichodesmium erythraeum and chlorophyte unidentified species with cell size of 5 μm the dominance of large celled e g coscinodiscus ditylum brightwelli and guinardia delicatula or chain formed e g chaetoceros and skeletonema diatoms was lower in of than in ca during the oyster culture period fig s4 micro and nano sized species e g p minimum and teleaulax also frequently showed lower dominance in of by contrast the dominance of small sized unidentified chlorophytes was higher in of than in ca however no discernible difference in the contribution of dominant species between of and ca was found after the removal of culture rafts figs s4e j these findings indicated selective grazing on phytoplankton species by the oysters 3 5 phytoplankton community composition the results of two way anosim showed a significant p 0 05 difference in the phytoplankton community composition between of and ca during the oyster culture period despite the water layer difference table 3 however no significant spatial difference in the phytoplankton community was found after the removal of culture rafts this finding indicated that oyster farming significantly influences phytoplankton composition 3 6 relationship between algal biomass deficit and environmental variables spearman s rank correlation showed that the decreased percentage of phytoplankton biomass was positively and significantly p 0 05 correlated with surrounding phytoplankton abundance and chla and were negatively correlated with transparency dip and dsi table 4 however there was no significant correlation between the reduction of algal biomass and environmental parameters except for dsi 4 discussion 4 1 top down control on algal bloom by oyster farming under thermal stimulation severe algal blooms with a surface chla concentration of 6 μg l in ca were found in the winter of 2009 2010 and 2015 fig s3 our simultaneous observations revealed that the temperature increase caused by thermal discharge from the npp promoted phytoplankton growth and even bloom in the upper xsb characterized by abundant nutrients and relatively high transparency and water column stability particularly in cold seasons jiang et al 2012 2019a 2019b similar result was observed in eutrophic daya bay northern south china sea because of thermal discharge from a nuclear power station yu et al 2007 additionally it seems that algal bloom seasonality has shifted forward from spring and early summer to winter since the power plant operation in 2006 jiang et al 2019a 2019b our previous studies demonstrated that phytoplankton abundance jiang et al 2019b and chla concentration jiang et al 2019a were significantly higher in upper than in middle and lower xsb in all seasons moreover thermal discharge accelerated the warming trend in xsb because of long water residence time jiang et al 2019a which significantly influence phytoplankton community composition e g increase in dominance of dinoflagellates under increasing eutrophication jiang et al 2019a 2019b these findings warrant consideration in mitigating algal bloom and eutrophication in xsb through oyster farming phytoplankton are the main food source for sustaining intensive cultivation of filter feeding bivalves cloern 1982 souchu et al 2001 trottet et al 2007 jacobs et al 2015 our study showed that the phytoplankton abundance fig 3a and fig s2a and chla concentration fig 4 and fig s3 were significantly p 0 05 lower in of than in ca during the oyster culture period table s2 however after the removal of culture rafts no significant differences in phytoplankton biomass between of and ca were found table 1 shows that the average deficits of phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration were 46 3 and 28 3 respectively this finding indicated strong filtration efficiency by obas in xsb similarly huang et al 2008 found that phytoplankton abundance chla and primary production increased significantly after the removal of culture racks in of in a eutrophic lagoon taiwan suggesting an effective top down control on algal biomass and production phytoplankton biomass chla or carbon depletion has been widely reported souchu et al 2001 wheat and ruesink 2013 zúñiga et al 2013 ray et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 including a noticeable reduction in phytoplankton biomass in entire systems of south san francisco cloern 1982 and tapong bays huang et al 2008 however algal biomass deficit is not universal la rosa et al 2002 trottet et al 2008 the algal biomass increase has been mainly attributed to the local phytoplankton composition dominance of small cells food source mainly heterotrophic plankton and low culture density trottet et al 2007 2008 higher deficits of phytoplankton abundance and chla in winter 30 than in warm seasons were observed table 1 table 4 shows that the reduction of chla was negatively correlated with temperature although algal abundance was not correlated with temperature this finding might be attributed to the reproductive and culture period of the oysters in xsb for example the clearance rate of another cultivated portuguese oyster crassostrea angulata in dapeng cove northern south china sea increased with increasing temperature until at 25 c and then declined outside of the reproductive period but decreased to the minimum during the reproductive period august yu et al 2017 gu and li 1998 found that spawning of c plicatula in xsb usually occurred monthly from may to october furthermore the cultivated oyster in xsb begins seeding in warm seasons and grows into adults in winter of the following year nobre et al 2010 adult oysters filter more algal biomass than juvenile oysters these studies indicate that the filtration rate of oyster might be suppressed in summer with temperatures close to 30 c in winter however the temperature increase caused by thermal discharge enhances oyster filtration rate resulting in a strong top down control on phytoplankton thus oyster farming effectively mitigates winter algal bloom under thermal stimulation in the upper xsb in addition to temperature depletion of phytoplankton biomass in of was positively and significantly p 0 05 correlated with surrounding phytoplankton abundance and chla but not with transparency suspended solids din and dip table 4 fournier et al 2012 found that the quantity and origin of carbon filtered by pearl oysters were highly related to the concentration and composition of plankton in ahe atoll lagoon french polynesia however in ría de vigo galicia the organic ingestion rate and absorption efficiency of mussels mytilus galloprovincialis were more strongly correlated with the plankton carbon contents than with particulate organic carbon and chla suggesting the importance of heterotrophic plankton as a food source zúñiga et al 2013 trottet et al 2007 also emphasized that heterotrophic plankton mostly naked ciliates and tintinnids could be an essential food source for cultured mussels in grande entrée lagoon we speculated that the top down control of phytoplankton biomass is highly dependent on culture density growth and cultivation period of oyster and on phytoplankton abundance and composition additional studies should investigate the role of heterotrophic microbial plankton during oyster farming 4 2 effects of oyster farming on the phytoplankton community composition our study found that oyster farming considerably reduced increased micro chla pico chla contribution by 34 8 95 0 on average table 2 fig 4 and table s3 show that micro chla pico chla contribution was significantly p 0 05 lower higher in of than in ca in all seasons except summer probably due to the lower filtration at high temperature as mentioned earlier gu and li 1998 yu et al 2017 however pheo chla was significantly p 0 05 higher in of than in ca fig 4b on average oyster farming increased pheo chla by 71 1 table 2 suggesting a high grazing pressure on phytoplankton these results indicated that obas tended to filter relatively large celled phytoplankton consistent with previous reports souchu et al 2001 la rosa et al 2002 trottet et al 2008 fournier et al 2012 froján et al 2014 jacobs et al 215 lu et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 a higher pico chla concentration in of than in ca was observed in all seasons except winter jiang et al 2016 also found higher picoeukaryote mostly prasinophyte abundance in of than that at a reference site in daya bay we speculated that oyster farming favored picophytoplankton under size selective filtration and a decrease in predators e g flagellates and ciliates grazed by the obas our previous study found that pico chla contribution increased significantly with increasing nutrient amounts from the lower to the upper xsb jiang et al 2019a this result is not consistent with the principle of phytoplankton cell size tradeoffs that small cells thrive in warm oligotrophic waters whereas large cells are dominant in eutrophic waters irwin et al 2006 we inferred that thermal discharge and oyster farming were partially responsible for the relatively high pico chla contribution in the upper bay apart from water column stability oyster farming exerts a top down control on size structure by consuming micro and nanophytoplankton but stimulating picophytoplankton growth which profoundly influences local pelagic food web and biogeochemical processes under trophic interaction legendre and rassoulzadegan 1996 dupuy et al 2000 lu et al 2015 size fractionated chla data in ca indicated that the sum of micro and nano fraction accounted for 85 in all seasons fig 4 thus our present phytoplankton abundance through microscope counting with the size limit at 5 μm represented the almost total algal biomass because of size selective filtration the dominance of large sized dominant phytoplankton species decreased particularly micro sized or chain formed diatoms and nano sized flagellates fig s4 additionally we found that many epiphytic epizoic diatom species e g diploneis gyrosigma and pleurosigma with low abundance were divorced from the rafts ropes and obas during the oyster culture period jiang et al 2012 which increased phytoplankton diversity consequently phytoplankton species diversity indices s h and j were significantly p 0 05 higher in of than in ca in most cases fig s2 and table s2 on average oyster farming increased s h and j by 26 3 38 3 and 28 8 respectively table 1 an anosim test showed a significant p 0 05 difference in the phytoplankton community composition between of and ca during the oyster culture period table 3 however after the removal of cultured rafts diversity indices and community composition of phytoplankton in of were consistent with those in ca these findings confirmed our hypothesis that oyster farming exhibits strong top down control on the phytoplankton community suspension feeding bivalves usually show selective filtration on phytoplankton not only based on size but also on cell properties and nutrition shumway et al 1985 loret et al 2000 ward and shumway 2004 our study demonstrated a frequent reduction of p minimum and teleaulax in of in addition to large celled diatoms fig s4 this finding is consistent with those of other studies on ostrea edulis shumway et al 1985 and mytilus edulis bougrier et al 1997 in the laboratory additionally loret et al 2000 indicated that nanoflagellates particularly cryptophytes were preferentially ingested by the pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera in the natural phytoplankton community in takapoto atoll lagoon based on the findings of optical microscopy and hplc pigment analysis we speculated that dominant micro sized diatoms and nanoflagellates particularly cryptophytes and dinoflagellates are potential nutrition sources of obas in xsb resulting in niche occupation by picoplankton fig 4 in this condition oyster farming significantly altered the phytoplankton community composition through grazing and trophic interaction similarly dupuy et al 2000 revealed that oyster grazing triggered dramatic changes in the protist community composition including the abundance and contribution of bacterioplankton 5 μm and 5 μm flagellates ciliates diatoms and dinoflagellates moreover they hypothesized that oysters may access the strong bacterioplanktonic production through hetero mixotrophic protists which would thus allow carbon transfer from the microbial loop to oysters by contrast trottet et al 2008 found no significant influence of mussel farming on the planktonic community because of the relatively low culture mussel production 4 3 effects of oyster farming on water quality cultivated bivalves exhibit a natural cleansing process and remove phytoplankton and other organic and inorganic particles from the water column dupuy et al 2000 trottet et al 2007 jacobs et al 2015 moreover oysters have a well developed ability to preferentially ingest various types of organic material and to reject other particles as pseudofaeces newell and jordan 1983 our study showed considerable depletion of suspended solids and toc by 12 2 and 18 4 respectively and increased transparency by 29 1 during oyster culture period table 1 although these parameters did not vary significantly between of and ca in all cases table s1 previous studies have also reported that suspended solids in of were retained by oysters potentially increasing light availability to the bottom and thereby providing enhanced growth and production of benthic microphytobenthos seagrasses and marcoalgae newell 2004 grizzle et al 2018 additionally do was consumed by the obas and organic degradation resulting in a slight depletion 2 1 of do table 1 consistent with early reports souchu et al 2001 bricker et al 2018 nizzoli et al 2005 demonstrated that the mussel m galloprovincialis rope community was an enormous sink for oxygen and particulate organic matter in sacca di goro lagoon using in situ incubation in addition to the top down control on phytoplankton suspension feeding bivalves also stimulate algal growth bottom up effect by excretion and regeneration of nutrients newell 2004 nizzoli et al 2005 kellogg et al 2014 froján et al 2014 our study found a slight depletion by 1 5 and 3 7 respectively of din and dip during the oyster culture period suggesting an absorption and utilization of nutrients bricker et al 2018 estimated that 1 31 and 2 68 of the total annual n input in long island sound could be removed by current and expanded oyster production respectively using system scale modeling these findings were not consistent with previous studies which reported that bivalve farming increased nutrient level souchu et al 2001 la rosa et al 2002 lu et al 2015 ray et al 2015 kellogg et al 2014 suggested that n removal by oysters varied by orders of magnitude among sites seasons and growing conditions in the eutrophic upper xsb food source phytoplankton and organic particles was abundant enough for filtering by oysters fig s3 shows high surrounding chla concentrations 2 μg l in all cases with the highest chla concentration 21 6 μg l on the surface in the winter of 2015 such abundant phytoplankton can consume a large amount of excreted and regenerated organic inorganic nutrients thereby accelerating phytoplankton production and turnover under oyster grazing fig 5 souchu et al 2001 nizzoli et al 2005 broekhoven et al 2014 and thermal addition jiang et al 2012 2019a 2019b through filtration some of the n and p that was originally incorporated in phytoplankton but was not digested by obas can transform into their organic composition and buried in the accumulating sediments including undigested remains mucus bound faces and pseudofeces fig 5 otherwise large numbers of epibiotic macroalgae on rafts and ropes assimilate partial n and p moreover turbidity reduction favored the growth of phytoplankton in the water column and microphytobenthos on the sediment thereby increasing absorption and utilization of nutrients consequently oyster farming removed some n and p and reduced nutrient level in the upper xsb organic particulate n and p however might increase due to oyster excretion and biodeposit resuspension fig 5 newell 2004 kellogg et al 2014 porter et al 2018 further studies are warranted on the response of organic particulate n and p associated with phytoplankton to oyster farming 5 conclusions this study confirms our hypothesis that oyster farming in the upper xsb significantly reduced phytoplankton biomass and exerted a strong top down control on winter algal bloom under thermal stimulation under size selective grazing and bottom up effect of obas oyster farming reduced microphytoplankton contribution but promoted picophytoplankton growth thereby sharply increasing picophytoplankton contribution such a shift in phytoplankton cell size may profoundly influence local food web dynamics and biogeochemical processes which warrants further study interestingly obas tended to filter dinoflagellates e g p minimum and cryptophytes teleaulax in addition to large celled diatoms suggesting that this selective filtration is based not only on size but also on cell properties or nutrition furthermore oyster farming significantly enhanced phytoplankton diversity we concluded that the phytoplankton community structure was largely shaped by oyster farming through both top down and bottom up controls oyster farming considerably reduced suspended solids and toc and increased transparency which might enhance primary production in the water column and on the sediment thereby reducing n and p levels overall oyster farming slightly reduced din and dip concentrations based on these findings we proposed oyster farming as a vital restoration

18758,temperature increase caused by thermal discharge from power plants promotes phytoplankton growth and frequent bloom in eutrophic subtropical waters particularly in cold seasons suspension filter feeding bivalves show size selective grazing on phytoplankton thus we hypothesized that algal bloom under thermal stimulation could be controlled and that phytoplankton community was structured by oyster farming here ten cruises were conducted in two oyster farms ofs and control areas cas adjacent to the ninghai power plant in the upper section of xiangshan bay during 2009 2015 we found that thermal discharge induced severe winter algal blooms phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a chla were significantly lower 46 3 and 28 3 respectively in of than in ca indicating a high filtration efficiency by oysters and the associated biofouling assemblages in addition oyster farming significantly increased species richness by 26 3 shannon wiener diversity by 38 3 and pielou s evenness indices by 28 8 and reduced suspended solids by 12 2 total organic carbon by 18 4 dissolved inorganic nitrogen by 1 5 and phosphorus by 3 7 furthermore oyster farming considerably reduced increased micro chla contribution pheophytin chla by 34 8 71 1 suggesting a strong size selective grazing on phytoplankton analysis of similarity revealed a significant difference in phytoplankton community composition between of and ca however after the removal of culture rafts all the abundance chla species diversity dominant species size structure and community composition of phytoplankton showed no significant difference our study demonstrated that oyster farming effectively alleviated eutrophication and algal bloom and enhanced phytoplankton diversity which provides guidance for aquaculture and ecological restoration in subtropical coastal eutrophic waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords oyster farming phytoplankton size selective grazing species diversity thermal discharge xiangshan bay 1 introduction eutrophication is a key driver of increased harmful algal blooms in coastal waters heisler et al 2008 jiang et al 2014 additionally the magnitude frequency and duration of harmful algal blooms have been frequently linked to warming moore et al 2008 paerl and scott 2010 for example temperature increase caused by thermal discharge from power plants promotes phytoplankton growth and frequent bloom in eutrophic subtropical waters yu et al 2007 jiang et al 2019a 2019b how to control eutrophication and algal blooms under accelerated warming has been the focus of research in area of environmental problems in coastal ecosystems worldwide oysters and the associated biofouling assemblages obas including ascidians bryozoans sponges polychaete and macroalgae remove nutrients directly

toward sediments newell 2004 kellogg et al 2014 additionally the harvest represents a net removal of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from the ecosystem therefore the aquaculture and restoration of the oyster population have been proposed as an ecological restore tool for top down control of phytoplankton blooms and reversal of eutrophication in coastal waters newell 2004 huang et al 2008 wheat and

phytoplankton by obas directly reduces a large amount of particulate organic matter available to be remineralized by pelagic consumers and bacterioplankton cloern 1982 newell 2004 kellogg et al 2014

oyster farming jiang et al 2012 2016 china is the biggest oyster culture country in the world however the effects of oyster farming on the phytoplankton community and water column biogeochemistry in coastal waters of china remains poorly understood xiangshan bay xsb is a long 60 km narrow 3 8 km eutrophic semi enclosed subtropical bay located at the northern east china sea with long water residence time 80 days for 90 water exchanges in the upper section ning and hu 2002 oyster farming in this bay has been expanded since the 1980s reflecting china s tremendously increased cultural scale shellfish production during 2005 2006 was estimated to be 45 000 t year 1 of which 93 was oyster produced either on ropes or in intertidal areas nobre et al 2010 the ninghai power plant npp located in the upper bay began to operate since december 17 2005 and produced a large amount of thermal discharge 82 5 m3 s 1 which caused a strong increase in the temperature of receiving waters adjacent to the npp including oyster farms ofs in the upper xsb this temperature increase stimulated phytoplankton growth and frequent bloom in the upper bay particularly in cold seasons jiang et al 2012 2019a 2019b in this context we hypothesize that oyster farming results in top down control of algal bloom under thermal stimulation and that the phytoplankton community structure is altered by size selective grazing and the bottom up effect to test our hypothesis ten cruises were conducted in the chinese pleated oyster crassostrea plicatula ofs and control areas cas adjacent to the npp in xsb during 2009 2015 we examined how oyster farming affects the phytoplankton community chlorophyll a chla abundance diversity dominant species and size structure and physicochemical variables temperature transparency suspended solids oxygen nutrients and organic carbon our objectives were 1 to quantify the removal of phytoplankton biomass by obas under thermal stimulation 2 to investigate the effects of oyster farming on the phytoplankton community structure and physicochemical variables and 3 to evaluate the mitigation potential of algal bloom and eutrophication by using oyster farming our study can help understand the effect of oyster farming on the coastal ecosystem and guide future policy formulating of mariculture and ecological restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1

species abundance was transformed by log x 1 and standardized before the estimation of bray curtis similarities between sample pairs a two way area and water layer analysis of similarity anosim was used to test phytoplankton community differences on different sampling dates spearman s rank correlation was used to determine the relationship between the decreased percentage of phytoplankton

regional differences between the new of and ca respectively table s1 the dsi concentration varied slightly between of and ca fig 2h and fig s1i toc was considerably lower in of than in ca in all cases fig 2i and fig s1j however after the removal of the old farm no significant regional difference was found for nutrients and toc table 1 shows that oyster farming reduced the concentration of din dip

fig 2 although no significant differences within the water layer were usually found table s1 3 2 phytoplankton abundance and chla the phytoplankton abundance fig 3a and fig s2a and chla concentration fig 4a and fig s3 were significantly p 0 05 lower in of than in ca during the oyster culture period tables s2 and s3 however no significant difference between of and ca was found after the removal of cultured rafts table 1 shows that oyster farming reduced the phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration by 46 3 and 18 4 on average respectively thermal discharge from the npp likely promoted phytoplankton growth and even bloom with chla 6 μg l on the surface in ca during winter of 2009 2010 and 2015 fig s3 however oyster farming effectively controlled winter algal bloom with 30 reduction in the phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration oyster farming profoundly influenced phytoplankton size structure that effectively reduced micro chla contribution by 34 8 but increased nano by 8 7 and pico chla contribution by 95 0 table 2 the water column micro and nano chla concentration was lower in of than in ca in all seasons but the pico chla concentration showed the opposite results fig 4 pico chla concentrations were higher in of 0 31 0 74 and 0 36 μg l than in ca 0 16 0 51 and 0 26 μg l in spring autumn and summer fig 4b and table s3 show that the pheo chla was significantly p 0 05 higher in of than in ca on average oyster farming increased the pheo chla by 71 1 table 2 suggesting a high grazing rate on phytoplankton 3 3 phytoplankton species diversity phytoplankton diversity indices s h and j on both the surface and bottom were considerably higher in of than in ca during the oyster culture period fig 3 and fig s2 s h and j varied significantly p 0 05 between of and ca in most cases table s2 table 1 shows that oyster farming increased s h and j by 26 3 38 3 and 28 8 on average respectively however after the removal of cultured rafts diversity indices did not significantly differ between of and ca table s2 3 4 dominant phytoplankton species dominant phytoplankton species included diatoms e g chaetoceros skeletonema thalassiosira and coscinodiscus dinoflagellates e g prorocentrum minimum scripposciella trochoidea and karlodinium veneficum cryptophytes teleaulax euglenophyte eutreptia lanowii and eutreptiella gymnastica cyanobacteria trichodesmium erythraeum and chlorophyte unidentified species with cell size of 5 μm the dominance of large celled e g coscinodiscus ditylum brightwelli and guinardia delicatula or chain formed e g chaetoceros and skeletonema diatoms was lower in of than in ca during the oyster culture period fig s4 micro and nano sized species e g p minimum and teleaulax also frequently showed lower dominance in of by contrast the dominance of small sized unidentified chlorophytes was higher in of than in ca however no discernible difference in the contribution of dominant species between of and ca was found after the removal of culture rafts figs s4e j these findings indicated selective grazing on phytoplankton species by the oysters 3 5 phytoplankton community composition the results of two way anosim showed a significant p 0 05 difference in the phytoplankton community composition between of and ca during the oyster culture period despite the water layer difference table 3 however no significant spatial difference in the phytoplankton community was found after the removal of culture rafts this finding indicated that oyster farming significantly influences phytoplankton composition 3 6 relationship between algal biomass deficit and environmental variables spearman s rank correlation showed that the decreased percentage of phytoplankton biomass was positively and significantly p 0 05 correlated with surrounding phytoplankton abundance and chla and were negatively correlated with transparency dip and dsi table 4 however there was no significant correlation between the reduction of algal biomass and environmental parameters except for dsi 4 discussion 4 1 top down control on algal bloom by oyster farming under thermal stimulation severe algal blooms with a surface chla concentration of 6 μg l in ca were found in the winter of 2009 2010 and 2015 fig s3 our simultaneous observations revealed that the temperature increase caused by thermal discharge from the npp promoted phytoplankton growth and even bloom in the upper xsb characterized by abundant nutrients and relatively high transparency and water column stability particularly in cold seasons jiang et al 2012 2019a 2019b similar result was observed in eutrophic daya bay northern south china sea because of thermal discharge from a nuclear power station yu et al 2007 additionally it seems that algal bloom seasonality has shifted forward from spring and early summer to winter since the power plant operation in 2006 jiang et al 2019a 2019b our previous studies demonstrated that phytoplankton abundance jiang et al 2019b and chla concentration jiang et al 2019a were significantly higher in upper than in middle and lower xsb in all seasons moreover thermal discharge accelerated the warming trend in xsb because of long water residence time jiang et al 2019a which significantly influence phytoplankton community composition e g increase in dominance of dinoflagellates under increasing eutrophication jiang et al 2019a 2019b these findings warrant consideration in mitigating algal bloom and eutrophication in xsb through oyster farming phytoplankton are the main food source for sustaining intensive cultivation of filter feeding bivalves cloern 1982 souchu et al 2001 trottet et al 2007 jacobs et al 2015 our study showed that the phytoplankton abundance fig 3a and fig s2a and chla concentration fig 4 and fig s3 were significantly p 0 05 lower in of than in ca during the oyster culture period table s2 however after the removal of culture rafts no significant differences in phytoplankton biomass between of and ca were found table 1 shows that the average deficits of phytoplankton abundance and chla concentration were 46 3 and 28 3 respectively this finding indicated strong filtration efficiency by obas in xsb similarly huang et al 2008 found that phytoplankton abundance chla and primary production increased significantly after the removal of culture racks in of in a eutrophic lagoon taiwan suggesting an effective top down control on algal biomass and production phytoplankton biomass chla or carbon depletion has been widely reported souchu et al 2001 wheat and ruesink 2013 zúñiga et al 2013 ray et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 including a noticeable reduction in phytoplankton biomass in entire systems of south san francisco cloern 1982 and tapong bays huang et al 2008 however algal biomass deficit is not universal la rosa et al 2002 trottet et al 2008 the algal biomass increase has been mainly attributed to the local phytoplankton composition dominance of small cells food source mainly heterotrophic plankton and low culture density trottet et al 2007 2008 higher deficits of phytoplankton abundance and chla in winter 30 than in warm seasons were observed table 1 table 4 shows that the reduction of chla was negatively correlated with temperature although algal abundance was not correlated with temperature this finding might be attributed to the reproductive and culture period of the oysters in xsb for example the clearance rate of another cultivated portuguese oyster crassostrea angulata in dapeng cove northern south china sea increased with increasing temperature until at 25 c and then declined outside of the reproductive period but decreased to the minimum during the reproductive period august yu et al 2017 gu and li 1998 found that spawning of c plicatula in xsb usually occurred monthly from may to october furthermore the cultivated oyster in xsb begins seeding in warm seasons and grows into adults in winter of the following year nobre et al 2010 adult oysters filter more algal biomass than juvenile oysters these studies indicate that the filtration rate of oyster might be suppressed in summer with temperatures close to 30 c in winter however the temperature increase caused by thermal discharge enhances oyster filtration rate resulting in a strong top down control on phytoplankton thus oyster farming effectively mitigates winter algal bloom under thermal stimulation in the upper xsb in addition to temperature depletion of phytoplankton biomass in of was positively and significantly p 0 05 correlated with surrounding phytoplankton abundance and chla but not with transparency suspended solids din and dip table 4 fournier et al 2012 found that the quantity and origin of carbon filtered by pearl oysters were highly related to the concentration and composition of plankton in ahe atoll lagoon french polynesia however in ría de vigo galicia the organic ingestion rate and absorption efficiency of mussels mytilus galloprovincialis were more strongly correlated with the plankton carbon contents than with particulate organic carbon and chla suggesting the importance of heterotrophic plankton as a food source zúñiga et al 2013 trottet et al 2007 also emphasized that heterotrophic plankton mostly naked ciliates and tintinnids could be an essential food source for cultured mussels in grande entrée lagoon we speculated that the top down control of phytoplankton biomass is highly dependent on culture density growth and cultivation period of oyster and on phytoplankton abundance and composition additional studies should investigate the role of heterotrophic microbial plankton during oyster farming 4 2 effects of oyster farming on the phytoplankton community composition our study found that oyster farming considerably reduced increased micro chla pico chla contribution by 34 8 95 0 on average table 2 fig 4 and table s3 show that micro chla pico chla contribution was significantly p 0 05 lower higher in of than in ca in all seasons except summer probably due to the lower filtration at high temperature as mentioned earlier gu and li 1998 yu et al 2017 however pheo chla was significantly p 0 05 higher in of than in ca fig 4b on average oyster farming increased pheo chla by 71 1 table 2 suggesting a high grazing pressure on phytoplankton these results indicated that obas tended to filter relatively large celled phytoplankton consistent with previous reports souchu et al 2001 la rosa et al 2002 trottet et al 2008 fournier et al 2012 froján et al 2014 jacobs et al 215 lu et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 a higher pico chla concentration in of than in ca was observed in all seasons except winter jiang et al 2016 also found higher picoeukaryote mostly prasinophyte abundance in of than that at a reference site in daya bay we speculated that oyster farming favored picophytoplankton under size selective filtration and a decrease in predators e g flagellates and ciliates grazed by the obas our previous study found that pico chla contribution increased significantly with increasing nutrient amounts from the lower to the upper xsb jiang et al 2019a this result is not consistent with the principle of phytoplankton cell size tradeoffs that small cells thrive in warm oligotrophic waters whereas large cells are dominant in eutrophic waters irwin et al 2006 we inferred that thermal discharge and oyster farming were partially responsible for the relatively high pico chla contribution in the upper bay apart from water column stability oyster farming exerts a top down control on size structure by consuming micro and nanophytoplankton but stimulating picophytoplankton growth which profoundly influences local pelagic food web and biogeochemical processes under trophic interaction legendre and rassoulzadegan 1996 dupuy et al 2000 lu et al 2015 size fractionated chla data in ca indicated that the sum of micro and nano fraction accounted for 85 in all seasons fig 4 thus our present phytoplankton abundance through microscope counting with the size limit at 5 μm represented the almost total algal biomass because of size selective filtration the dominance of large sized dominant phytoplankton species decreased particularly micro sized or chain formed diatoms and nano sized flagellates fig s4 additionally we found that many epiphytic epizoic diatom species e g diploneis gyrosigma and pleurosigma with low abundance were divorced from the rafts ropes and obas during the oyster culture period jiang et al 2012 which increased phytoplankton diversity consequently phytoplankton species diversity indices s h and j were significantly p 0 05 higher in of than in ca in most cases fig s2 and table s2 on average oyster farming increased s h and j by 26 3 38 3 and 28 8 respectively table 1 an anosim test showed a significant p 0 05 difference in the phytoplankton community composition between of and ca during the oyster culture period table 3 however after the removal of cultured rafts diversity indices and community composition of phytoplankton in of were consistent with those in ca these findings confirmed our hypothesis that oyster farming exhibits strong top down control on the phytoplankton community suspension feeding bivalves usually show selective filtration on phytoplankton not only based on size but also on cell properties and nutrition shumway et al 1985 loret et al 2000 ward and shumway 2004 our study demonstrated a frequent reduction of p minimum and teleaulax in of in addition to large celled diatoms fig s4 this finding is consistent with those of other studies on ostrea edulis shumway et al 1985 and mytilus edulis bougrier et al 1997 in the laboratory additionally loret et al 2000 indicated that nanoflagellates particularly cryptophytes were preferentially ingested by the pearl oyster pinctada margaritifera in the natural phytoplankton community in takapoto atoll lagoon based on the findings of optical microscopy and hplc pigment analysis we speculated that dominant micro sized diatoms and nanoflagellates particularly cryptophytes and dinoflagellates are potential nutrition sources of obas in xsb resulting in niche occupation by picoplankton fig 4 in this condition oyster farming significantly altered the phytoplankton community composition through grazing and trophic interaction similarly dupuy et al 2000 revealed that oyster grazing triggered dramatic changes in the protist community composition including the abundance and contribution of bacterioplankton 5 μm and 5 μm flagellates ciliates diatoms and dinoflagellates moreover they hypothesized that oysters may access the strong bacterioplanktonic production through hetero mixotrophic protists which would thus allow carbon transfer from the microbial loop to oysters by contrast trottet et al 2008 found no significant influence of mussel farming on the planktonic community because of the relatively low culture mussel production 4 3 effects of oyster farming on water quality cultivated bivalves exhibit a natural cleansing process and remove phytoplankton and other organic and inorganic particles from the water column dupuy et al 2000 trottet et al 2007 jacobs et al 2015 moreover oysters have a well developed ability to preferentially ingest various types of organic material and to reject other particles as pseudofaeces newell and jordan 1983 our study showed considerable depletion of suspended solids and toc by 12 2 and 18 4 respectively and increased transparency by 29 1 during oyster culture period table 1 although these parameters did not vary significantly between of and ca in all cases table s1 previous studies have also reported that suspended solids in of were retained by oysters potentially increasing light availability to the bottom and thereby providing enhanced growth and production of benthic microphytobenthos seagrasses and marcoalgae newell 2004 grizzle et al 2018 additionally do was consumed by the obas and organic degradation resulting in a slight depletion 2 1 of do table 1 consistent with early reports souchu et al 2001 bricker et al 2018 nizzoli et al 2005 demonstrated that the mussel m galloprovincialis rope community was an enormous sink for oxygen and particulate organic matter in sacca di goro lagoon using in situ incubation in addition to the top down control on phytoplankton suspension feeding bivalves also stimulate algal growth bottom up effect by excretion and regeneration of nutrients newell 2004 nizzoli et al 2005 kellogg et al 2014 froján et al 2014 our study found a slight depletion by 1 5 and 3 7 respectively of din and dip during the oyster culture period suggesting an absorption and utilization of nutrients bricker et al 2018 estimated that 1 31 and 2 68 of the total annual n input in long island sound could be removed by current and expanded oyster production respectively using system scale modeling these findings were not consistent with previous studies which reported that bivalve farming increased nutrient level souchu et al 2001 la rosa et al 2002 lu et al 2015 ray et al 2015 kellogg et al 2014 suggested that n removal by oysters varied by orders of magnitude among sites seasons and growing conditions in the eutrophic upper xsb food source phytoplankton and organic particles was abundant enough for filtering by oysters fig s3 shows high surrounding chla concentrations 2 μg l in all cases with the highest chla concentration 21 6 μg l on the surface in the winter of 2015 such abundant phytoplankton can consume a large amount of excreted and regenerated organic inorganic nutrients thereby accelerating phytoplankton production and turnover under oyster grazing fig 5 souchu et al 2001 nizzoli et al 2005 broekhoven et al 2014 and thermal addition jiang et al 2012 2019a 2019b through filtration some of the n and p that was originally incorporated in phytoplankton but was not digested by obas can transform into their organic composition and buried in the accumulating sediments including undigested remains mucus bound faces and pseudofeces fig 5 otherwise large numbers of epibiotic macroalgae on rafts and ropes assimilate partial n and p moreover turbidity reduction favored the growth of phytoplankton in the water column and microphytobenthos on the sediment thereby increasing absorption and utilization of nutrients consequently oyster farming removed some n and p and reduced nutrient level in the upper xsb organic particulate n and p however might increase due to oyster excretion and biodeposit resuspension fig 5 newell 2004 kellogg et al 2014 porter et al 2018 further studies are warranted on the response of organic particulate n and p associated with phytoplankton to oyster farming 5 conclusions this study confirms our hypothesis that oyster farming in the upper xsb significantly reduced phytoplankton biomass and exerted a strong top down control on winter algal bloom under thermal stimulation under size selective grazing and bottom up effect of obas oyster farming reduced microphytoplankton contribution but promoted picophytoplankton growth thereby sharply increasing picophytoplankton contribution such a shift in phytoplankton cell size may profoundly influence local food web dynamics and biogeochemical processes which warrants further study interestingly obas tended to filter dinoflagellates e g p minimum and cryptophytes teleaulax in addition to large celled diatoms suggesting that this selective filtration is based not only on size but also on cell properties or nutrition furthermore oyster farming significantly enhanced phytoplankton diversity we concluded that the phytoplankton community structure was largely shaped by oyster farming through both top down and bottom up controls oyster farming considerably reduced suspended solids and toc and increased transparency which might enhance primary production in the water column and on the sediment thereby reducing n and p levels overall oyster farming slightly reduced din and dip concentrations based on these findings we proposed oyster farming as a vital restoration

18759,heterogeneous photochemical reactions associated with natural iron hydr oxides and oxalic acid have attracted a great deal of scientific attention in the application of organic pollutants degradation however the reaction mechanism is still unclear due to the complicated iron cycles and reactive oxygen species ros generation in this study the in situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was implemented to investigate the adsorption process and photochemical behavior of oxalic acid on the surface of ferrihydrite a comprehensive reaction mechanism from the perspective of charge transfer process including homogeneous heterogeneous iron cycling and ros generation was illustrated in detail we found that oxalic acid was first adsorbed on the surface of ferrihydrite with a mononuclear bidentate binding geometry interestingly this mononuclear bidentate complex on the surface of ferrihydrite was stable under visible light irradiation subsequently the whole complex departed from ferrihydrite surface through non reduction dissolution with the form of fe c2o4 in the solution the fe c2o4 complexes would quickly convert to fe c2o4 2 complexes under visible light irradiation the electrons generated from the photolysis of fe c2o4 2 complex reacted with o2 to form o2 ooh meanwhile fe iii was reduced to fe ii finally the produced o2 ooh could react with fe ii through a one step way to generate oh which possessed higher oh formation efficiency than that through the two step way of h2o2 as the intermediates this study helps us with understanding of in situ photochemical reaction mechanism of ferrihydrite oxalic acid system and also provides guidance to effectively utilize widespread iron hydr oxides and organic acids in natural environment to develop engineered systems for water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxalic acid ferrihydrite in situ atr ftir fe iii ox complex reactive oxygen species 1 introduction oxalic acid oa or its ion form oxalate ox are generally ubiquitous in the natural environment with a concentration from 2 5 10 2 to 4 0 mm and usually coexist in water and soil system with iron hydr oxides domagal goldman and kubicki 2018 flynn and catalano 2017 gadol et al 2017 reichard et al 2007 ox could be adsorbed on the surface of iron hydr oxides to form fe iii ox complexes which exhibit strong ligand to metal charge ltmc absorption bands in the near uv and visible region lan et al 2008 2011 pang et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 photolysis of fe iii ox complexes could in situ generate fe ii and various reactive oxygen species ros like o2 oh et al which could initiate the oxidative degradation of organic contaminants therefore the study of the heterogeneous photochemical systems containing ox and natural iron hydr oxides such as hematite magnetite maghemite and goethite is significant and widely reported for sewage treatment gulshan et al 2010 huang et al 2017 kretschmer et al 2019 mazellier and sulzberger 2001 however most of them pay more attention on the containment degradation process seldom focus on the interaction between iron oxides and ox implicating a molecular level mechanism which is crucial for the generation of ros at present many researchers prefer to illustrate the reaction mechanisms combining with iron cycling lan et al 2010 mazellier and sulzberger 2001 some reports have shown that the contribution for the degradation of organic contaminants during photochemical reactions could be recognized according to the location and concentration of fe ii generation huang et al 2017 li et al 2007 mazellier and sulzberger 2001 for example huang et al 2017 reported that the direct in situ photochemical reduction of surface bound iron ox complexes should be nearly neglected under uv irradiation due to the relative low accumulation of surface bound fe ii and mazellier et al 2001 found that the kinetics of contaminant degradation was determined by the rate of fe ii formation in solution through the photochemical reductive dissolution of goethite however fe ii in solution or surface bound fe ii could be produced directly in the process of lmct but also could be released from the surface of iron hydr oxides to solution or re adsorbed to the surface of iron hydr oxides therefore combining with in situ investigation of the photochemical behaviors of ox in the iron hydr oxides oa system a more profound reaction mechanism could be illustrated in situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir can provide real time measurement of the vibration signals of the ions davantès et al 2016 elzinga and kretzschmar 2013 in previous studies in situ atr ftir spectroscopy has been used to clarify the co adsorption characteristics of heavy metal cations and oxyanions on ferrihydrite fh liu et al 2016 2018 mendive et al 2006 studied the adsorption and photoreaction of oxalic acid on the surface of anatase and rutile tio2 nanoparticles using in situ atr ftir enlightened by these studies we expect that in situ atr ftir spectroscopy could be carried out to illustrate the photochemical behavior of oa at the iron hydr oxides water interface in the photolytic process of fe iii ox complexes oh is an important product which decides on the degradation performance of organic pollutants degradation in iron hydr oxides ox photochemical systems thomas et al 2016 zuo and hoigne 1992 a large number of reports believe that the in situ generated fe ii and h2o2 composes fenton reaction to produce oh since h2o2 could be detected in iron hydr oxides ox photochemical systems balmer and sulzberger 1999 lan et al 2010 however another possible pathway of oh formation which should be mentioned is the photolysis of fe iii complexes in iron hydr oxide and ox photochemical system lan et al 2008 in addition it has been proved that fe ii could react with o2 to generate oh through a sequential molecular oxygen activation pathway ai et al 2013 mu et al 2017 hence an exact charge transfer way from fe iii ox complexes to generate oh in iron hydr oxide ox photochemical system is worth of investigating in detail fh is one typical iron hydroxide which often coexists with ox in rivers lakes and wetland environment bhandari et al 2010 however the study of fh is reported scarcely in the ox photochemical area herein we systematically investigated the photochemical behavior of ox in the presence of fh the main objectives of our work were to a in situ investigate the adsorption behavior of ox on the surface of fh to form fe iii ox complexes and the dissolution process of fe iii ox complexes on the surface of fh b study the photochemical decomposition of fe iii ox complexes both in solution and on the surface of fh c finally propose a comprehensive reaction mechanism from the perspective of charge transfer process including homogeneous heterogeneous iron cycling and ros generation our work may shed new light on illustrating the heterogeneous photochemical mechanisms in the photochemical in situ chemical oxidation systems containing ox and natural iron hydr oxides 2 experimental sections 2 1

times the final product was freeze dried under 40 c and pulverized to pass through a 100 mesh sieve the structural characteristics of obtained fh showed in fig s1 and table s1 2 3 experiments and analytical methods 2 3 1 in situ atr ftir in situ atr ftir spectra were collected with a ftir spectrophotometer bruker vertex 70 germany equipped with a multi bounce horizontal atr accessory and flow cell pike technologies usa a thin layer of immobilized fh particles 2 5 mg was deposited on the surface of the horizontal znse atr crystal by drying fh suspension the fh layer was allowed to

of fe3 1 ml of o phen 2 g l and 1 ml of a ch3coonh4 ch3cooh buffer solution ph 4 2 were added after 15 min of color development the absorbance of the samples at 510 nm was analyzed on a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan for the measurement of the concentration of total dissolved iron tfe the procedure was similar to the fe ii measurement except that 0 5 ml of a reducing agent 100 g l honh3cl was used instead of nh4f the concentration of sm2 was measured by hplc shimadzu lc 20at japan with a sb c18 reverse phase column the injection volume was 100 μl a mixture of 1 acetic

reactive oxygen species electron paramagnetic resonance epr was used to qualitatively analyze the formation of co2 oh and o2 epr signals of radicals trapped by dmpo 20 mm were recorded at 25 1 c on a jes fa 200 x band spectrometer jeol japan the settings for the epr spectrometer were as follows center field 3231 g sweep width 50 g microwave frequency 9 05 ghz modulation frequency 100 khz and power

investigate the influence of o2 h2o2 and fe ii to oh generation respectively chen et al 2017 hou et al 2017 xu et al 2016 the detailed free radical capture processes were similar to the photochemical experiments h2o2 determination was measured using a pod dpd method the details of analysis procedure of oh and h2o2 concentration were described according to the report of chen et al 2017 3 results and discussions 3 1 the interactions between oa and fh in dark 3 1 1 in situ atr ftir spectroscopy under flow conditions in dark in situ atr ftir spectra were used to identify the type of ox surface complex and its binding modes at the fh water interface fig 1 a and b showed time dependent evolution atr ftir spectra of adsorbed ox on the surface of fh the vibrational modes at 1707 cm 1 νs co 1679 cm 1 νa co 1620 cm 1 νa c o 1414 cm 1 νs c o ν c c combination mode 1302 cm 1 νs c o 1276 cm 1 νa c o were associated to adsorbed ox on the surface of fh in order to confirm the exact adsorption model density functional theory dft was applied to calculate the ftir modes of binding geometries process was showed in supporting information theoretically there are three types of possible inner spheres and an out sphere hydrogen bonded binding geometry of the adsorbed ox complexes at the fh water interface fig 1e h the three types of possible inner sphere binding geometries are mononuclear monodentate mm binuclear bidentate bb and mononuclear bidentate mb respectively kubicki et al 2017 reichard et al 2007 fig 1d and table s2 showed the analysis results of the slope standard deviation and r2 correlation of the in situ atr ftir experimental frequencies and dft calculated vibrational frequencies compared with mm and bb geometries the experimental frequency versus the calculated frequencies for mb geometry plot was associated with the lowest standard deviation 27 3 y intercept closest to zero 31 3 ideal value is zero and best r2 correlation 0 988 this analysis confirmed that the adsorbed ox likely adopted a mb binding configuration of inner sphere complex on the fh surface in addition dft calculations were associated with hydrogen bonded ox species on a fe o cluster table s3 and the study of bhandari et al 2010 supported that the modes at 1308 and 1610 cm 1 were assigned to hydrogen bonded ox interacting with the surface hydroxyl groups of fh meanwhile in situ atr ftir could also provide detailed information about the kinetics of both adsorption and desorption processes of ox on the surface of fh obviously the spectral intensity of all modes increased first but then decreased after 30 min fh presents positively charged surface at ph 7 9 fig s2 and ox is negatively charged at ph 1 5 hence ox could be adsorbed to fh through electrostatic attraction on the other hand the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of fh could become active sites for the subsequent adsorption of ox however both inner sphere and out sphere modes tended to decrease after 30 min which may be due to the desorption process of ox on fh or the dissolution process of fe iii ox complexes from the surface of fh fig 1b according to the intensity variations of the bands 1620 representing inner sphere complexes and 1679 cm 1 representing out sphere complexes fig 1c hydrogen bonded complexes were easier to be desorbed from the surface of fh than mb complexes 3 1 2 detachment behavior of adsorbed ox on fh surface in dark several batch experiments were carried out to investigate the possible way of the fe iii ox complexes fallen off fh from the perspective of concentration variation of ox and fe leaching in solution there is no doubt that hydrogen bonded complexes were desorbed from the surface of fh in the form of ox however for the inner sphere complexes fall off iron hydr oxides it is generally accepted that there are two possible ways which are non reduction dissolution or reduction dissolution respectively mazellier and sulzberger 2001 siffert and sulzberger 1991 fig 2 a shows the concentration of ox in the solution decreased first but then increased slightly after 15 min this phenomenon was in accordance with the results obtained by in situ atr ftir in addition fe leaching also could be observed in the absence of light fig 2b the leaching concentration of fe iii was up to 0 406 mm but only 0 025 mm for fe ii leaching implying non reduction dissolution was the dominant way for ox detaching from fh surface in other words fe iii ox complexes non reduction dissolution was the dominant way for the inner sphere complexes of ox detached from fh 3 2 the interactions between oa and fh under visible light irradiation 3 2 1 in situ atr ftir under nonflow conditions and visible light irradiation to investigate the surface photolytic reaction of ox on fh in situ atr ftir was carried out under visible light irradiation in order to avoid interference of fe iii ox complexes dissolution in situ atr ftir spectra were recorded under nonflow conditions experimental data shown in fig 3 was the time dependent ftir spectra associated with adsorbed ox on fh which were obtained after 1 mm of ox was added into the fh system and adsorption saturation was reached successive spectra showed no change after 60 min of visible light exposure the peak position and intensity fig 3a and b of all the modes which assigned to the adsorbed ox barely changed apart from the above experiments fh was exposed to a 1 mm of ox solution at ph 3 1 for 180 min to reach the system equilibration in dark and then the ox solution was replaced by water ph 3 1 this particular type of experiment fig 3c eliminated the possibility of ox re adsorption from solution so that the pure photolytic behavior of the ox could be better isolated for study interestingly both of peak position and intensity of all the modes in such condition barely changed the results obtained above implied that the photolytic reaction of fe iii ox complexes would not take place on the surface of fh this phenomenon could be explained by two reasons on the one hand fh is an insulator mineral kato et al 2010 though fh exhibited strong light absorption from uv to visible light region fig s3 which showed little photocatalytic activity to degrade ox on the other hand because the visible light absorbed by fh is invalid hence for the fh oa system the more light is absorbed by fh the less light could be utilized by fe iii ox xps pattern shows that the small amount of fe ii on the surface of fh after 80 min of visible light exposure appeared in the presence of ox fig 3d combined with the atr ftir results the fe ii on the surface of fh in fh oa photochemical system came from the re adsorbed fe ii in solution in previous reports distinguishing the contribution of homogeneous heterogeneous reaction on contaminants degradation in iron hydr oxides oa photochemical system depends on the location of fe ii huang et al 2017 li et al 2007 however our study implied that it was unreliable to estimate the photochemical reaction sites depending on the location of fe ii only combining with the in situ investigation of ox decomposition could illustrate the real photochemical reaction mechanism in iron hydr oxides ox systems 3 2 2 photochemical behavior of oa in the presence of fh batch experiments were carried out to further investigate the photochemical behavior of oa in the presence of fh and visible light fig 4 with only visible light negligible ox was decomposed fig 4a after introducing fh the concentration of ox decreased very fast and approximately 0 54 mm of ox was decomposed within 80 min meanwhile the leaching rate of fe was further increased under visible light irradiation the leaching concentration of both the fe iii and fe ii increased first but then decreased after 20 and 50 min fig 4c respectively the large amounts of fe ii production were due to the fast photolytic reactions of fe iii ox complexes during the photolytic reactions of fe iii ox complexes ox as the electrons donors was oxidized and fe iii as the electrons accepter were reduced to fe ii the presence of fe ii produced by the photolytic reaction can also further induce fe leaching which has been proved by the comparison experiments in ar conditions fig s4 in order to further illustrate the photolytic reaction in fh oa system the photolytic reaction of fe iii ox complexes both on the surface of fh and in solution were illustrated respectively firstly the materials and pure supernatant were separated and collected in fh oa system after 30 min in dark filtering system a photochemical experiment of the recovered fh with water ph 3 1 showed that the adsorbed ox inclined to dissolve into solution first with the form of fe iii ox complexes which was followed by photolytic reaction along with the decomposition of ox and the reduction of fe iii fig s5 at the meantime a photochemical experiment of supernatant filtering system was executed by direct exposure to visible light irradiation and a fh oa system with pre dissolution time of 30 min non filtering system and fe iii oa homogenous system composing by 0 2 mm fe no3 3 and 1 mm oa as the control experiments fig 4d f surprisingly the photolytic rate of ox in the filtering system was very fast which was 10 times larger than those of fe iii oa homogenous system though both of the two systems had the same initial amount of fe iii 0 2 mm about 0 9 mm of ox was broken down in the fh oa filtering system after 40 min however less than 0 4 mm of ox was decomposed in the fe iii oa homogenous system after 80 min in addition the ox decomposition in non filtering system was higher than fe iii oa homogenous system but still lower than that in filtering system which could be attributed to the factor that the presence of fh interfered visible light transmittance this result could further prove that the structure of fe iii ox complexes on the surface of fh were stable and could not be decomposed at the same time fe ii concentration in filtering system increased quickly and then had a tendency to increase slightly the concentration of fe iii changed in the opposite trend simultaneously indicating that ox decomposition reaction in fh oa filtering system was also attributed to the lmct process to sum up in situ atr ftir in the combination with batch experiments under visible irradiation revealed that inner sphere complex was desorbed from the fh surface first and then was decomposed in solution during visible light irradiation meanwhile the above results also manifested that the fe iii ox complexes in solution of fh oa system had impressive performance of photochemistry which depended on its form as a mb inner sphere complexes were formed on the surface of fh according to the in situ atr ftir and dft results the form fe iii ox complexes in the solution also should be investigated in detail 3 3 the form of fe iii ox complexes in solution of fh oa system it is generally believed that ox can form three kinds of complexes with fe iii i e fe c2o4 fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 in different quantum yields for fe ii form depending on the wavelength of light faust and zepp 1993 weller et al 2013 taking it at 436 nm as examples quantum yields for fe c2o4 fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 are 0 1 0 and 0 6 respectively faust and zepp 1993 considering the markedly different photochemical activity between fh oa and fe iii oa homogenous systems the form of fe iii ox complexes in the solution of fh oa system were discussed below surface enhanced raman scattering spectra sers was used to study the form of fe iii ox complexes in the solution of fh oa system fig 5 a the raman signals at 1465 1356 901 and 856 cm 1 in the sers pattern of pure ox were the characteristic bands corresponding to stretching vibrations of co double bonds deformation vibrations of o co stretching vibrations of c o and c c single bonds respectively table s4 in the sers patterns of the solution in fh oa and fe iii oa homogenous composing by 0 2 mm fe no3 3 and 1 mm oa systems the fe o and fe o fe bonds could be observed but located in different position implying the species of fe iii ox complexes were different between fh oa and fe iii oa homogenous systems in addition fe iii ox complex displayed strong vibrational modes at 1728 or 1740 cm 1 that were associated with the symmetric νs co stretching modes the vibrational mode appeared at 1474 cm 1 in the fh oa pattern was associated with the combination mode of νa co however in the sers pattern of the solution in fe iii oa homogenous the vibrational mode of νa co was divided into two peaks νa and νs stretches at 1508 and 1450 cm 1 respectively the split peak between the coo νa and νs stretch frequencies was caused by vibrational coupling effect due to a close distance between two carboxyl groups deacon and phillips 1980 nakamoto 1997 rich and maréchal 2008 it was implied that the distance between carboxyl groups of fe iii ox complexes in fh oa system should be closer than that in fe iii oa homogenous system hplc eis spectrometry was applied for the further qualitative analysis of the fe iii ox complex formed in the solution fig 5b f and fig s6 to our surprise the main form of fe iii ox complexes in the fh oa system were fe c2o4 fe c2o4 2 whether with or without visible light irradiation in the absence of fe c2o4 3 3 however all three kinds of fe iii ox complexes existed in the fe iii oa homogenous system both in the absence and presence of visible light irradiation among three types of fe iii ox complexes the concentration of fe c2o4 was very low since it was easily transformed to fe c2o4 2 k 3 31 106 m 1 and fe c2o4 3 3 k 2 75 104 m 1 step by step smith et al 1976 in the fh oa system ox was adsorbed on fh with a mb inner sphere binding geometry fig 1f therefore fe c2o4 should be the exact form of fe iii ox complexes after non reduction dissolution from the surface of fh then fe c2o4 quickly transformed to fe c2o4 2 as the normal tendency however since fh shows positively charged surface at ph 7 9 fig s2 and fe c2o4 2 is an anionic ion the formation of fe c2o4 3 3 from fe c2o4 2 could be inhibited due to electrostatic attraction hence fe c2o4 2 was the predominant species in the solution of fh oa system whereas in the fe iii oa homogenous system both fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 coexisted and the proportion of fe c2o4 3 3 was higher than 33 according to the result of speciation calculation by medusa software fig s7 the quantum yield of fe c2o4 3 3 is lower than that of fe c2o4 2 in the range of visible light region weller et al 2013 therefore the results of sers and hplc eis could well explain that the decomposition rate of ox in the fh oa system was faster than that in the fe iii oa homogenous system shown in fig 4 3 4 the charge transfer process in the photolysis of fe iii ox complexes in the fh oa system in order to qualitatively study the ros generation epr was implemented as shown in fig 6 a six line epr signal and a weak four line signal were detected under ar purged conditions which were assigned to dmpo co2 adduct αh 18 9 g αn 15 8 g and dmpo oh αn αh 14 8 g respectively wang et al 2014 obviously co2 was the product of the photolytic reaction of fe iii ox complexes and oh radicals were originated from the direct photolysis of hydroxylated fe iii complexes on the surface of fh fig 6a under air conditions strong oh fig 6b and o2 signals fig 6c a four line epr signal with an intensity ratio of nearly 1 1 1 1 were observed in epr patterns but no co2 signals were detected the epr results suggested that co2 oh and o2 were generated in the heterogeneous fh oa photochemical system and the yields of oh and o2 were closely related to the abundance of dissolved oxygen among the ros the concentration of oh is reflected by the photodegradation efficiency of organic pollutants in iron hydr oxides oa photochemical system in order to investigate the electron pass way from fe iii ox complexes to oh in air condition oh concentration was quantified under different conditions fig 6d fig s8 obviously the amount of generated oh increased with rising reaction time and oh concentration could reach up to 141 35 μm conversion rate was 14 77 per mm ox decomposition table s5 and fig 6e after 80 min however in the presence of bq o2 scavenger the oh generation deceased to 16 46 μm conversion rate was 1 72 per mm ox decomposition the results from control experiments revealed that only 5 42 μm of oh was from direct photolysis of hydroxylated fe iii complexes on the surface of fh hence oh production should be controlled by the generation of o2 to our surprise the presence of cat did not show any influence on oh generation 139 03 μm and 14 60 of conversion rate after 80 min though the amounts of ox decomposition were almost the same in addition h2o2 could not be detected during the whole photochemical process fig 6f implying that oh was not produced through the fenton reaction fe ii react with h2o2 however o phen could significantly inhibit the oh generation confirming that oh had strong dependence on fe ii hence oh should be produced by a one step way from o2 o2 oh in the fh oa photochemical system actually other iron hydr oxides oa photochemical systems have been reported that oh was mainly generated through a two step way in which h2o2 was the intermediate o2 h2o2 oh and quantified kribéche et al 2016 mazellier and sulzberger 2001 for example in the photochemical system of magnetite ox system ph 3 the highest h2o2 concentration was about 45 μm in the presence of 1 mm ox and uv irradiation huang et al 2017 meanwhile the production of h2o2 in maghemite ox uv system lan et al 2008 and hematite ox uv system kribéche et al 2016 were lower than 2 mg l 58 8 μm and 4 mg l 117 6 μm respectively in our study the oh concentration produced in the fh oa photochemical system was about 141 35 μm which was higher than the h2o2 concentration in the previous reports involving iron hydr oxides oa photochemical systems let alone the amount of oh lost in the reaction of fe ii and h2o2 on the basis of the analysis above we can draw the conclusion that the yield of oh through one step way was higher than that by a two step way from what has been discussed above under visible light irradiation the first step was the photolysis of fe iii oa complex in the fh oa photochemical system leading to the formation of co2 and then co2 can reduce o2 to o2 ooh the produced o2 ooh could react directly with fe ii or o2 ooh to generate oh 3 5 proposed reaction mechanisms involved in the fh oa system under visible light irradiation based on the above discussion a possible photochemical behavior of oa was proposed in the fh oa photochemical system scheme 1 oa could be adsorbed on the surface of fh by two ways 1 electrostatic force 2 the form of covalent bonds between the surface hydroxyl group on fh and oa a mb binding geometry inner sphere complex was formed at the fh water interface through the replacement of hydroxyl surface groups by ox borowski et al 2018 investigated the ir spectra of dissolved fe c2o4 in h2o and found that fe c2o4 had peaks at 1712 1691 1390 and 1250 cm 1 in ir spectra which was similar to the peaks of adsorbed oxalate mb on the surface of fh peaks at 1709 1679 1414 1276 cm 1 fig 1 in addition fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 structures are not possible on the surface of fh hence fe c2o4 would be the unique form for the mb inner sphere complexes detaching from fh surface into solution through non reduction dissolution then the fe c2o4 complexes quickly transferred to fe c2o4 2 complexes at a rate constant of k 3 31 106 m 1 smith et al 1976 the photolytic reaction of fe c2o4 2 complex was induced by visible light along with the decomposition of ox and the reduction of fe iii and both of fe ii and co2 were the primary photolyzed products in the fh oa system based on previous studies chen et al 2007 2008 ivan et al 2008 mangiante et al 2017 the photolytic reaction of fe iii ox complex may contain three steps within the ns time domain firstly one photoexcited oxalate ligand reduces fe iii and then the resulting oxalate radical anion c2o4 dissociates rapidly with the c c bond breaking finally co2 and co2 leave from the fe ii coordination sphere on the one hand a small part of fe ii in solution could be re adsorbed on the surface of fh and tended to form a surface bound fe iii ox fe ii bridging complex it could induce a spontaneous electron transfer between the outer fe ii and surface bound fe iii huang et al 2017 siffert and sulzberger 1991 as a result the accumulation of surface bound fe ii could occur on the surface of fh meanwhile the surface ox bridged outer fe iii could be released to the solution through the ox complexation dissolution owing to the high complexion ability between ox and fe iii on the other hand a larger number of fe ii was involved in the process of radical reaction which begun with the generation of co2 co2 was a strong reducing agent e0 1 8 v vs nhe perissinotti et al 2015 which could reduce fe iii to fe ii fig s9 however co2 tended to transfer one electron fast to o2 in the presence of dissolved oxygen rather than fe iii fig 6a b and fig s9 and the dissolved oxygen could be reduced to o2 and its conjugated acid ho2 the near diffusion controlled rate of co2 to o2 could reach up to 2 4 109 m 1 s 1 surdhar et al 1989 then the o2 ooh could through the one step way generate oh by reacting with fe ii or o2 ooh in fh oa photochemical system which has higher oh formation efficiency than that through the two step way with the intermediate of h2o2 with the generation of oh the sm2 could be degraded effectively in the system of fh oa under visible light irradiation fig s10 s11 4 conclusion in this study the photochemical behavior of ferrihydrite oxalate system was investigated in detail from the view of interfacial reaction and charge transfer process in situ atr ftir in combination with dft results implied ox was adsorbed on fh with both a mb inner sphere binding geometry and a hydrogen bonded out sphere binding geometry after that fe oxalate complex with mb inner sphere binding geometry was detached from fh to the liquid phase through the way of non reduction dissolution where it was mainly presented in the form of fe c2o4 2 under visible light irradiation and in the presence of dissolve oxygen high formation efficiency of oh was achieved by a one step way from the reaction between fe ii and o2 ooh which was generated by the photolysis of fe c2o4 2 and o2 our work has important implications for the understanding of the mechanisms in the photochemical oxidation

18759,heterogeneous photochemical reactions associated with natural iron hydr oxides and oxalic acid have attracted a great deal of scientific attention in the application of organic pollutants degradation however the reaction mechanism is still unclear due to the complicated iron cycles and reactive oxygen species ros generation in this study the in situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was implemented to investigate the adsorption process and photochemical behavior of oxalic acid on the surface of ferrihydrite a comprehensive reaction mechanism from the perspective of charge transfer process including homogeneous heterogeneous iron cycling and ros generation was illustrated in detail we found that oxalic acid was first adsorbed on the surface of ferrihydrite with a mononuclear bidentate binding geometry interestingly this mononuclear bidentate complex on the surface of ferrihydrite was stable under visible light irradiation subsequently the whole complex departed from ferrihydrite surface through non reduction dissolution with the form of fe c2o4 in the solution the fe c2o4 complexes would quickly convert to fe c2o4 2 complexes under visible light irradiation the electrons generated from the photolysis of fe c2o4 2 complex reacted with o2 to form o2 ooh meanwhile fe iii was reduced to fe ii finally the produced o2 ooh could react with fe ii through a one step way to generate oh which possessed higher oh formation efficiency than that through the two step way of h2o2 as the intermediates this study helps us with understanding of in situ photochemical reaction mechanism of ferrihydrite oxalic acid system and also provides guidance to effectively utilize widespread iron hydr oxides and organic acids in natural environment to develop engineered systems for water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxalic acid ferrihydrite in situ atr ftir fe iii ox complex reactive oxygen species 1 introduction oxalic acid oa or its ion form oxalate ox are generally ubiquitous in the natural environment with a concentration from 2 5 10 2 to 4 0 mm and usually coexist in water and soil system with iron hydr oxides domagal goldman and kubicki 2018 flynn and catalano 2017 gadol et al 2017 reichard et al 2007 ox could be adsorbed on the surface of iron hydr oxides to form fe iii ox complexes which exhibit strong ligand to metal charge ltmc absorption bands in the near uv and visible region lan et al 2008 2011 pang et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 photolysis of fe iii ox complexes could in situ generate fe ii and various reactive oxygen species ros like o2 oh et al which could initiate the oxidative degradation of organic contaminants therefore the study of the heterogeneous photochemical systems containing ox and natural iron hydr oxides such as hematite magnetite maghemite and goethite is significant and widely reported for sewage treatment gulshan et al 2010 huang et al 2017 kretschmer et al 2019 mazellier and sulzberger 2001 however most of them pay more attention on the containment degradation process seldom focus on the interaction between iron oxides and ox implicating a molecular level mechanism which is crucial for the generation of ros at present many researchers prefer to illustrate the reaction mechanisms combining with iron cycling lan et al 2010 mazellier and sulzberger 2001 some reports have shown that the contribution for the degradation of organic contaminants during photochemical reactions could be recognized according to the location and concentration of fe ii generation huang et al 2017 li et al 2007 mazellier and sulzberger 2001 for example huang et al 2017 reported that the direct in situ photochemical reduction of surface bound iron ox complexes should be nearly neglected under uv irradiation due to the relative low accumulation of surface bound fe ii and mazellier et al 2001 found that the kinetics of contaminant degradation was determined by the rate of fe ii formation in solution through the photochemical reductive dissolution of goethite however fe ii in solution or surface bound fe ii could be produced directly in the process of lmct but also could be released from the surface of iron hydr oxides to solution or re adsorbed to the surface of iron hydr oxides therefore combining with in situ investigation of the photochemical behaviors of ox in the iron hydr oxides oa system a more profound reaction mechanism could be illustrated in situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir can provide real time measurement of the vibration signals of the ions davantès et al 2016 elzinga and kretzschmar 2013 in previous studies in situ atr ftir spectroscopy has been used to clarify the co adsorption characteristics of heavy metal cations and oxyanions on ferrihydrite fh liu et al 2016 2018 mendive et al 2006 studied the adsorption and photoreaction of oxalic acid on the surface of anatase and rutile tio2 nanoparticles using in situ atr ftir enlightened by these studies we expect that in situ atr ftir spectroscopy could be carried out to illustrate the photochemical behavior of oa at the iron hydr oxides water interface in the photolytic process of fe iii ox complexes oh is an important product which decides on the degradation performance of organic pollutants degradation in iron hydr oxides ox photochemical systems thomas et al 2016 zuo and hoigne 1992 a large number of reports believe that the in situ generated fe ii and h2o2 composes fenton reaction to produce oh since h2o2 could be detected in iron hydr oxides ox photochemical systems balmer and sulzberger 1999 lan et al 2010 however another possible pathway of oh formation which should be mentioned is the photolysis of fe iii complexes in iron hydr oxide and ox photochemical system lan et al 2008 in addition it has been proved that fe ii could react with o2 to generate oh through a sequential molecular oxygen activation pathway ai et al 2013 mu et al 2017 hence an exact charge transfer way from fe iii ox complexes to generate oh in iron hydr oxide ox photochemical system is worth of investigating in detail fh is one typical iron hydroxide which often coexists with ox in rivers lakes and wetland environment bhandari et al 2010 however the study of fh is reported scarcely in the ox photochemical area herein we systematically investigated the photochemical behavior of ox in the presence of fh the main objectives of our work were to a in situ investigate the adsorption behavior of ox on the surface of fh to form fe iii ox complexes and the dissolution process of fe iii ox complexes on the surface of fh b study the photochemical decomposition of fe iii ox complexes both in solution and on the surface of fh c finally propose a comprehensive reaction mechanism from the perspective of charge transfer process including homogeneous heterogeneous iron cycling and ros generation our work may shed new light on illustrating the heterogeneous photochemical mechanisms in the photochemical in situ chemical oxidation systems containing ox and natural iron hydr oxides 2 experimental sections 2 1

monodentate mm binuclear bidentate bb and mononuclear bidentate mb respectively kubicki et al 2017 reichard et al 2007 fig 1d and table s2 showed the analysis results of the slope standard deviation and r2 correlation of the in situ atr ftir experimental frequencies and dft calculated vibrational frequencies compared with mm and bb geometries the experimental frequency versus the calculated frequencies for mb geometry plot was associated with the lowest standard deviation 27 3 y intercept closest to zero 31 3 ideal value is zero and best r2 correlation 0 988 this analysis confirmed that the adsorbed ox likely adopted a mb binding configuration of inner sphere complex on the fh surface in addition dft calculations were associated with hydrogen bonded ox species on a fe o cluster table s3 and the study of bhandari et al 2010 supported that the modes at 1308 and 1610 cm 1 were assigned to hydrogen bonded ox interacting with the surface hydroxyl groups of fh meanwhile in situ atr ftir could also provide detailed information about the kinetics of both adsorption and desorption processes of ox on the surface of fh obviously the spectral intensity of all modes increased first but then decreased after 30 min fh presents positively charged surface at ph 7 9 fig s2 and ox is negatively charged at ph 1 5 hence ox could be adsorbed to fh through electrostatic attraction on the other hand the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of fh could become active sites for the subsequent adsorption of ox however both inner sphere and out sphere modes tended to decrease after 30 min which may be due to the desorption process of ox on fh or the dissolution process of fe iii ox complexes from the surface of fh fig 1b according to the intensity variations of the bands 1620 representing inner sphere complexes and 1679 cm 1 representing out sphere complexes fig 1c hydrogen bonded complexes were easier to be desorbed from the surface of fh than mb complexes 3 1 2 detachment behavior of adsorbed ox on fh surface in dark several batch experiments were carried out to investigate the possible way of the fe iii ox complexes fallen off fh from the perspective of concentration variation of ox and fe leaching in solution there is no doubt that hydrogen bonded complexes were desorbed from the surface of fh in the form of ox however for the inner sphere complexes fall off iron hydr oxides it is generally accepted that there are two possible ways which are non reduction dissolution or reduction dissolution respectively mazellier and sulzberger 2001 siffert and sulzberger 1991 fig 2 a shows the concentration of ox in the solution decreased first but then increased slightly after 15 min this phenomenon was in accordance with the results obtained by in situ atr ftir in addition fe leaching also could be observed in the absence of light fig 2b the leaching concentration of fe iii was up to 0 406 mm but only 0 025 mm for fe ii leaching implying non reduction dissolution was the dominant way for ox detaching from fh surface in other words fe iii ox complexes non reduction dissolution was the dominant way for the inner sphere complexes of ox detached from fh 3 2 the interactions between oa and fh under visible light irradiation 3 2 1 in situ atr ftir under nonflow conditions and visible light irradiation to investigate the surface photolytic reaction of ox on fh in situ atr ftir was carried out under visible light irradiation in order to avoid interference of fe iii ox complexes dissolution in situ atr ftir spectra were recorded under nonflow conditions experimental data shown in fig 3 was the time dependent ftir spectra associated with adsorbed ox on fh which were obtained after 1 mm of ox was added into the fh system and adsorption saturation was reached successive spectra showed no change after 60 min of visible light exposure the peak position and intensity fig 3a and b of all the modes which assigned to the adsorbed ox barely changed apart from the above experiments fh was exposed to a 1 mm of ox solution at ph 3 1 for 180 min to reach the system equilibration in dark and then the ox solution was replaced by water ph 3 1 this particular type of experiment fig 3c eliminated the possibility of ox re adsorption from solution so that the pure photolytic behavior of the ox could be better isolated for study interestingly both of peak position and intensity of all the modes in such condition barely changed the results obtained above implied that the photolytic reaction of fe iii ox complexes would not take place on the surface of fh this phenomenon could be explained by two reasons on the one hand fh is an insulator mineral kato et al 2010 though fh exhibited strong light absorption from uv to visible light region fig s3 which showed little photocatalytic activity to degrade ox on the other hand because the visible light absorbed by fh is invalid hence for the fh oa system the more light is absorbed by fh the less light could be utilized by fe iii ox xps pattern shows that the small amount of fe ii on the surface of fh after 80 min of visible light exposure appeared in the presence of ox fig 3d combined with the atr ftir results the fe ii on the surface of fh in fh oa photochemical system came from the re adsorbed fe ii in solution in previous reports distinguishing the contribution of homogeneous heterogeneous reaction on contaminants degradation in iron hydr oxides oa photochemical system depends on the location of fe ii huang et al 2017 li et al 2007 however our study implied that it was unreliable to estimate the photochemical reaction sites depending on the location of fe ii only combining with the in situ investigation of ox decomposition could illustrate the real photochemical reaction mechanism in iron hydr oxides ox systems 3 2 2 photochemical behavior of oa in the presence of fh batch experiments were carried out to further investigate the photochemical behavior of oa in the presence of fh and visible light fig 4 with only visible light negligible ox was decomposed fig 4a after introducing fh the concentration of ox decreased very fast and approximately 0 54 mm of ox was decomposed within 80 min meanwhile the leaching rate of fe was further increased under visible light irradiation the leaching concentration of both the fe iii and fe ii increased first but then decreased after 20 and 50 min fig 4c respectively the large amounts of fe ii production were due to the fast photolytic reactions of fe iii ox complexes during the photolytic reactions of fe iii ox complexes ox as the electrons donors was oxidized and fe iii as the electrons accepter were reduced to fe ii the presence of fe ii produced by the photolytic reaction can also further induce fe leaching which has been proved by the comparison experiments in ar conditions fig s4 in order to further illustrate the photolytic reaction in fh oa system the photolytic reaction of fe iii ox complexes both on the surface of fh and in solution were illustrated respectively firstly the materials and pure supernatant were separated and collected in fh oa system after 30 min in dark filtering system a photochemical experiment of the recovered fh with water ph 3 1 showed that the adsorbed ox inclined to dissolve into solution first with the form of fe iii ox complexes which was followed by photolytic reaction along with the decomposition of ox and the reduction of fe iii fig s5 at the meantime a photochemical experiment of supernatant filtering system was executed by direct exposure to visible light irradiation and a fh oa system with pre dissolution time of 30 min non filtering system and fe iii oa homogenous system composing by 0 2 mm fe no3 3 and 1 mm oa as the control experiments fig 4d f surprisingly the photolytic rate of ox in the filtering system was very fast which was 10 times larger than those of fe iii oa homogenous system though both of the two systems had the same initial amount of fe iii 0 2 mm about 0 9 mm of ox was broken down in the fh oa filtering system after 40 min however less than 0 4 mm of ox was decomposed in the fe iii oa homogenous system after 80 min in addition the ox decomposition in non filtering system was higher than fe iii oa homogenous system but still lower than that in filtering system which could be attributed to the factor that the presence of fh interfered visible light transmittance this result could further prove that the structure of fe iii ox complexes on the surface of fh were stable and could not be decomposed at the same time fe ii concentration in filtering system increased quickly and then had a tendency to increase slightly the concentration of fe iii changed in the opposite trend simultaneously indicating that ox decomposition reaction in fh oa filtering system was also attributed to the lmct process to sum up in situ atr ftir in the combination with batch experiments under visible irradiation revealed that inner sphere complex was desorbed from the fh surface first and then was decomposed in solution during visible light irradiation meanwhile the above results also manifested that the fe iii ox complexes in solution of fh oa system had impressive performance of photochemistry which depended on its form as a mb inner sphere complexes were formed on the surface of fh according to the in situ atr ftir and dft results the form fe iii ox complexes in the solution also should be investigated in detail 3 3 the form of fe iii ox complexes in solution of fh oa system it is generally believed that ox can form three kinds of complexes with fe iii i e fe c2o4 fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 in different quantum yields for fe ii form depending on the wavelength of light faust and zepp 1993 weller et al 2013 taking it at 436 nm as examples quantum yields for fe c2o4 fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 are 0 1 0 and 0 6 respectively faust and zepp 1993 considering the markedly different photochemical activity between fh oa and fe iii oa homogenous systems the form of fe iii ox complexes in the solution of fh oa system were discussed below surface enhanced raman scattering spectra sers was used to study the form of fe iii ox complexes in the solution of fh oa system fig 5 a the raman signals at 1465 1356 901 and 856 cm 1 in the sers pattern of pure ox were the characteristic bands corresponding to stretching vibrations of co double bonds deformation vibrations of o co stretching vibrations of c o and c c single bonds respectively table s4 in the sers patterns of the solution in fh oa and fe iii oa homogenous composing by 0 2 mm fe no3 3 and 1 mm oa systems the fe o and fe o fe bonds could be observed but located in different position implying the species of fe iii ox complexes were different between fh oa and fe iii oa homogenous systems in addition fe iii ox complex displayed strong vibrational modes at 1728 or 1740 cm 1 that were associated with the symmetric νs co stretching modes the vibrational mode appeared at 1474 cm 1 in the fh oa pattern was associated with the combination mode of νa co however in the sers pattern of the solution in fe iii oa homogenous the vibrational mode of νa co was divided into two peaks νa and νs stretches at 1508 and 1450 cm 1 respectively the split peak between the coo νa and νs stretch frequencies was caused by vibrational coupling effect due to a close distance between two carboxyl groups deacon and phillips 1980 nakamoto 1997 rich and maréchal 2008 it was implied that the distance between carboxyl groups of fe iii ox complexes in fh oa system should be closer than that in fe iii oa homogenous system hplc eis spectrometry was applied for the further qualitative analysis of the fe iii ox complex formed in the solution fig 5b f and fig s6 to our surprise the main form of fe iii ox complexes in the fh oa system were fe c2o4 fe c2o4 2 whether with or without visible light irradiation in the absence of fe c2o4 3 3 however all three kinds of fe iii ox complexes existed in the fe iii oa homogenous system both in the absence and presence of visible light irradiation among three types of fe iii ox complexes the concentration of fe c2o4 was very low since it was easily transformed to fe c2o4 2 k 3 31 106 m 1 and fe c2o4 3 3 k 2 75 104 m 1 step by step smith et al 1976 in the fh oa system ox was adsorbed on fh with a mb inner sphere binding geometry fig 1f therefore fe c2o4 should be the exact form of fe iii ox complexes after non reduction dissolution from the surface of fh then fe c2o4 quickly transformed to fe c2o4 2 as the normal tendency however since fh shows positively charged surface at ph 7 9 fig s2 and fe c2o4 2 is an anionic ion the formation of fe c2o4 3 3 from fe c2o4 2 could be inhibited due to electrostatic attraction hence fe c2o4 2 was the predominant species in the solution of fh oa system whereas in the fe iii oa homogenous system both fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 coexisted and the proportion of fe c2o4 3 3 was higher than 33 according to the result of speciation calculation by medusa software fig s7 the quantum yield of fe c2o4 3 3 is lower than that of fe c2o4 2 in the range of visible light region weller et al 2013 therefore the results of sers and hplc eis could well explain that the decomposition rate of ox in the fh oa system was faster than that in the fe iii oa homogenous system shown in fig 4 3 4 the charge transfer process in the photolysis of fe iii ox complexes in the fh oa system in order to qualitatively study the ros generation epr was implemented as shown in fig 6 a six line epr signal and a weak four line signal were detected under ar purged conditions which were assigned to dmpo co2 adduct αh 18 9 g αn 15 8 g and dmpo oh αn αh 14 8 g respectively wang et al 2014 obviously co2 was the product of the photolytic reaction of fe iii ox complexes and oh radicals were originated from the direct photolysis of hydroxylated fe iii complexes on the surface of fh fig 6a under air conditions strong oh fig 6b and o2 signals fig 6c a four line epr signal with an intensity ratio of nearly 1 1 1 1 were observed in epr patterns but no co2 signals were detected the epr results suggested that co2 oh and o2 were generated in the heterogeneous fh oa photochemical system and the yields of oh and o2 were closely related to the abundance of dissolved oxygen among the ros the concentration of oh is reflected by the photodegradation efficiency of organic pollutants in iron hydr oxides oa photochemical system in order to investigate the electron pass way from fe iii ox complexes to oh in air condition oh concentration was quantified under different conditions fig 6d fig s8 obviously the amount of generated oh increased with rising reaction time and oh concentration could reach up to 141 35 μm conversion rate was 14 77 per mm ox decomposition table s5 and fig 6e after 80 min however in the presence of bq o2 scavenger the oh generation deceased to 16 46 μm conversion rate was 1 72 per mm ox decomposition the results from control experiments revealed that only 5 42 μm of oh was from direct photolysis of hydroxylated fe iii complexes on the surface of fh hence oh production should be controlled by the generation of o2 to our surprise the presence of cat did not show any influence on oh generation 139 03 μm and 14 60 of conversion rate after 80 min though the amounts of ox decomposition were almost the same in addition h2o2 could not be detected during the whole photochemical process fig 6f implying that oh was not produced through the fenton reaction fe ii react with h2o2 however o phen could significantly inhibit the oh generation confirming that oh had strong dependence on fe ii hence oh should be produced by a one step way from o2 o2 oh in the fh oa photochemical system actually other iron hydr oxides oa photochemical systems have been reported that oh was mainly generated through a two step way in which h2o2 was the intermediate o2 h2o2 oh and quantified kribéche et al 2016 mazellier and sulzberger 2001 for example in the photochemical system of magnetite ox system ph 3 the highest h2o2 concentration was about 45 μm in the presence of 1 mm ox and uv irradiation huang et al 2017 meanwhile the production of h2o2 in maghemite ox uv system lan et al 2008 and hematite ox uv system kribéche et al 2016 were lower than 2 mg l 58 8 μm and 4 mg l 117 6 μm respectively in our study the oh concentration produced in the fh oa photochemical system was about 141 35 μm which was higher than the h2o2 concentration in the previous reports involving iron hydr oxides oa photochemical systems let alone the amount of oh lost in the reaction of fe ii and h2o2 on the basis of the analysis above we can draw the conclusion that the yield of oh through one step way was higher than that by a two step way from what has been discussed above under visible light irradiation the first step was the photolysis of fe iii oa complex in the fh oa photochemical system leading to the formation of co2 and then co2 can reduce o2 to o2 ooh the produced o2 ooh could react directly with fe ii or o2 ooh to generate oh 3 5 proposed reaction mechanisms involved in the fh oa system under visible light irradiation based on the above discussion a possible photochemical behavior of oa was proposed in the fh oa photochemical system scheme 1 oa could be adsorbed on the surface of fh by two ways 1 electrostatic force 2 the form of covalent bonds between the surface hydroxyl group on fh and oa a mb binding geometry inner sphere complex was formed at the fh water interface through the replacement of hydroxyl surface groups by ox borowski et al 2018 investigated the ir spectra of dissolved fe c2o4 in h2o and found that fe c2o4 had peaks at 1712 1691 1390 and 1250 cm 1 in ir spectra which was similar to the peaks of adsorbed oxalate mb on the surface of fh peaks at 1709 1679 1414 1276 cm 1 fig 1 in addition fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 structures are not possible on the surface of fh hence fe c2o4 would be the unique form for the mb inner sphere complexes detaching from fh surface into solution through non reduction dissolution then the fe c2o4 complexes quickly transferred to fe c2o4 2 complexes at a rate constant of k 3 31 106 m 1 smith et al 1976 the photolytic reaction of fe c2o4 2 complex was induced by visible light along with the decomposition of ox and the reduction of fe iii and both of fe ii and co2 were the primary photolyzed products in the fh oa system based on previous studies chen et al 2007 2008 ivan et al 2008 mangiante et al 2017 the photolytic reaction of fe iii ox complex may contain three steps within the ns time domain firstly one photoexcited oxalate ligand reduces fe iii and then the resulting oxalate radical anion c2o4 dissociates rapidly with the c c bond breaking finally co2 and co2 leave from the fe ii coordination sphere on the one hand a small part of fe ii in solution could be re adsorbed on the surface of fh and tended to form a surface bound fe iii ox fe ii bridging complex it could induce a spontaneous electron transfer between the outer fe ii and surface bound fe iii huang et al 2017 siffert and sulzberger 1991 as a result the accumulation of surface bound fe ii could occur on the surface of fh meanwhile the surface ox bridged outer fe iii could be released to the solution through the ox complexation dissolution owing to the high complexion ability between ox and fe iii on the other hand a larger number of fe ii was involved in the process of radical reaction which begun with the generation of co2 co2 was a strong reducing agent e0 1 8 v vs nhe perissinotti et al 2015 which could reduce fe iii to fe ii fig s9 however co2 tended to transfer one electron fast to o2 in the presence of dissolved oxygen rather than fe iii fig 6a b and fig s9 and the dissolved oxygen could be reduced to o2 and its conjugated acid ho2 the near diffusion controlled rate of co2 to o2 could reach up to 2 4 109 m 1 s 1 surdhar et al 1989 then the o2 ooh could through the one step way generate oh by reacting with fe ii or o2 ooh in fh oa photochemical system which has higher oh formation efficiency than that through the two step way with the intermediate of h2o2 with the generation of oh the sm2 could be degraded effectively in the system of fh oa under visible light irradiation fig s10 s11 4 conclusion in this study the photochemical behavior of ferrihydrite oxalate system was investigated in detail from the view of interfacial reaction and charge transfer process in situ atr ftir in combination with dft results implied ox was adsorbed on fh with both a mb inner sphere binding geometry and a hydrogen bonded out sphere binding geometry after that fe oxalate complex with mb inner sphere binding geometry was detached from fh to the liquid phase through the way of non reduction dissolution where it was mainly presented in the form of fe c2o4 2 under visible light irradiation and in the presence of dissolve oxygen high formation efficiency of oh was achieved by a one step way from the reaction between fe ii and o2 ooh which was generated by the photolysis of fe c2o4 2 and o2 our work has important implications for the understanding of the mechanisms in the photochemical oxidation
